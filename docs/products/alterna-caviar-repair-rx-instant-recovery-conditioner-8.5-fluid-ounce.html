            <li>The conditioner smells really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to know who thought that bottle was a good idea</li>
            <li>My favorite part is how excellently it detangles my tangle-prone, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Tried this morning for the first time-WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s kind of pricey, it lasts for months.</li>

            <li>This is great and makes my hair very smooth and easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, I will continue to purchase and use this product, as it is great for restoring the health of your hair and worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>i love alterna.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this brand</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>expensive, but performs excellently and has a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li>love this conditioner, I abuse my hair</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>glad I stuck it out.</li>
            <li>overall very nice product !!!!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not some magic potion.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you my curls have never been the same since, in a good way!!</li>
            <li>I now have color treated hair, which I have never been able to have because it would ALWAYS break off.</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully my hair has been extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the shampoo too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Moroccan oil line, Okara, and It&#x27;s a 10- which have all kept my highlights from fading and minimize frizzing.</li>
            <li>Did not like the shampoo at all, but the conditioner was OK.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip or dilute color either, so anyone with color or chemically treated hair will love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and for anyone having problems with the packaging, make sure you \\&quot;twist\\</li>
            <li>At first i really loved it</li>
            <li>It rinsed out easily and the comb passed through my hair much more easily.</li>
            <li>It smells great and made my hair feel really soft and repaired.</li>
            <li>I got this to help smooth that out while my healthy hair is still growing.</li>
            <li>it is a very good conditioner for color hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt better after the first use!</li>
            <li>however, this conditioner which felt great initially, ended up drying out my hair over time.</li>
            <li>Loved what this conditioner did for my natural curls.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>Noticed a significant difference in hair....</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>NOT user friendly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair feels soft and LIGHT, which is not something you get with &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; conditioners.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works right away!  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to take the whole top off.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t purchase it again until they change the packaging because otherwise, I&#x27;m paying full price for 75% of the contents.  </li>
            <li>This item shipped quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it has in a long time: healthy, shiny, THICKER and full of body.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks using this and the overnight hair repair, her hair looks great again.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found for my thin tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>a positive note, once I get the actual product out of the bottle and onto my hair, it is effective at restoring moisture and softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was one of the ones I was given, and with such a small amount of product I was still able to saturate most of my ends and the result was amazing.</li>
            <li>This makes it smooth, silky soft and SO shiny!</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected for the high price.</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner once a week and my hair is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>After one use of this conditioner my hair is noticably soft, smooth and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>After the first usage I immediately saw a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>No weird residues</li>
            <li>This is actually a really nice feature because it lets you store the bottles upside down</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it and found that my hair felt much drier which contradicts its &amp;#34;Instant Recovery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It is concentrated which means you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>Really helps repair the damage and dryness on stripped hair.</li>
            <li>Great product used for over a year, I wash my blonde hair daily, swim in salt water pools all summer, live in dry desert heat, highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I am a blonde and have dry hair so a rich conditioner is important.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express enough how smooth and soft this leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the Repair RX Instant Recovery Conditioner (along with the shampoo) and it worked much better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>but still makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>With a different shampoo it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Actually repairs some damage and new hair is much healthier since I started using this.</li>
            <li>slightly turn the top and squeeze and it will come out the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: ordered this from a third party seller</li>
            <li>Using more than really necessary, I worked it through my tangled mess for 2-3 minutes and could immediately feel a difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really old to the point the smell changed.</li>
            <li>Not heavy feeling on hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my coarse,curly hair soft decreases the volume and holds the curls well.</li>
            <li>Leaves it shiny soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look healthier and feel soft.</li>
            <li>(so you can get as much of the product out as possible!)</li>
            <li>I went back to my Moisture Replenishing line and my hair bounced right back.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smooth, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to squeeze the conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, along with the shampoo, really helped my dry, frizzy hair get silky again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having to wear it in a ponytail, but since I washed it with this low PH shampoo and conditioner, it really helped it to bounce back.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Daughter who has long thick natural wavy Hair,Her Hair seems to get very dry and Frizzy under certain Weather Conditions and we were surprised just how after the first use her Hair looked so much Healthier</li>
            <li>Its the same price as most Alterna conditioners, so it was a no brainer to at least try!</li>
            <li>I used the Alterna Clinical Scalp Stimulator and Daily Densifying Foam then dried with a blow dryer and finished with the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I agree that the bottle is a little temperamental and you really have to give a squeeze to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that I&#x27;ve had a major change but just by what I have seen I assume there will be.</li>

            <li> Reading the other reviews, apparently I&#x27;m the only one with a problem with the bottle.  </li>
            <li> it may be twice the price as other brands, but you use half as much product.  </li>
            <li> hair is fine, blonde and dry which makes it difficult to comb out after I wash it unless I use this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried many expensive products from other stores, and none of them worked for me.  </li>
            <li> had previously used the Alterna Caviar Repair RX Micro-Bead Fill &amp; Fix Treatment Masque and it completely transformed my dry, brittle hair after one use.  </li>
            <li> But Not sure why the hype &amp; high price?  </li>
            <li> I have used the Alterna Caviar products for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But obviously I&#x27;m going to have to rotate it in w 18 other things..</li>
            <li> I have a tyroid problem so my hair is constantly dry.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry and out of shape.  </li>
            <li> dry, damaged hair people out there</li>
            <li> I color my hair, so it gets dry from time to time.  </li>
            <li> but I am starting to feel like it is making my hair a little spongy</li>
            <li> I have very dry &amp; damaged &amp; weak hair plus live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a criminal record ladies!</li>
            <li> i have a hard time finding products that revitalize my dry curls, so I went to sephora for samples of different conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> i think the key is you use very little.</li>
            <li> I hate to think this one is fake since I&#x27;ve always loved Alterna products especially the Caviar and Bamboo</li>
            <li> It does not give any volume, but also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> We have alot of Alterna Hair products and they never let us down.</li>
            <li> , it is down to about 5 now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;my hair down or make it oily.</li>
            <li> This Conditioner (and the matching shampoo) have never let me down.</li>
            <li> I tried 2-3 other conditioners with no improvement before ordering this Instant Repair (with 1 day shipping was still less expensive than I could get locally).</li>
            <li> and I had about 25% of the product go to waste because I couldn&#x27;t get it out.  </li>
            <li> It is SO difficult to squeeze the product out of the bottle, especially with wet hands!  </li>
            <li> I also found the bottle tough to use with wet hands in the shower despite it being upside</li>
            <li> I have been going through a hair crisis with excessive hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was fake because the packaging is different and the smell was off.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair and use this daily to control frizz and minimize styling damage.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair you know it&#x27;s really hard to make it look shiny.</li>
            <li> Rinse well but never leaves a greasy dull feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every time I condition because it is rather expensive but it seems to have a lingering effect on my hair even when I use other products.</li>
            <li> thing I can tell you that was a issue is the conditioner is very thick and hard to come out of bottle.</li>
            <li> I recommended this to a coworker after she had a really bad dye job that left her hair fried.  </li>
            <li> Tough to squeeze</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle is very thick and hard to squeeze, and the cap is weird</li>
            <li> Obviously not happy with either possibility....</li>
            <li> my crazy colored curly hair seems to be less frizzy since i started using alterna!!</li>
            <li> I called Alterna who said that they changed their packaging over a year or two ago soooo either this is fake or</li>
            <li> My only issue is the terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> The smell is faint but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looked fake!</li>
            <li> There are about 3-4 inches of my hair that are severely damaged from a bad, bad bleach job at horrible salon by an incompetent &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> BAD PACKAGING.  </li>
            <li> Too bad about the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because the cap is really annoying.</li>
            <li> but I really hate the bottle design.  </li>
            <li> I HATE this bottle!  </li>

            <li> Great conditioner for a great price.  Actually repairs some damage and new hair is much healthier since I started using this. It does not give any volume, but also doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  It does not require a lot of product either so although it&#x27;s kind of pricey, it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used! I have frizzy hair almost curly but not quite... I use this conditioner once a week and my hair is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Noticed a significant difference in hair....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughter who has long thick natural wavy Hair,Her Hair seems to get very dry and Frizzy under certain Weather Conditions and we were surprised just how after the first use her Hair looked so much Healthier no Frizz even the split ends were repaired.We have alot of Alterna Hair products and they never let us down.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have been going through a hair crisis with excessive hair loss and breakage. Recently started the Alterna Clinical line for thinning hair. The Daily Detoxifying Shampoo cleans well but leaves my damaged hair feeling like a matted wad of straw-impossible to comb without further breakage. I tried 2-3 other conditioners with no improvement before ordering this Instant Repair (with 1 day shipping was still less expensive than I could get locally). Tried this morning for the first time-WOW!!!! Using more than really necessary, I worked it through my tangled mess for 2-3 minutes and could immediately feel a difference. It rinsed out easily and the comb passed through my hair much more easily. I used the Alterna Clinical Scalp Stimulator and Daily Densifying Foam then dried with a blow dryer and finished with the hot air brush. My hair looks better than it has in a long time: healthy, shiny, THICKER and full of body. I am thrilled! Thank you! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product used for over a year, I wash my blonde hair daily, swim in salt water pools all summer, live in dry desert heat, highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> i love alterna. my crazy colored curly hair seems to be less frizzy since i started using alterna!! pricey but worth it!!! and it took me a bit to finally figure out but you don&#x27;t need to take the whole top off. slightly turn the top and squeeze and it will come out the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: ordered this from a third party seller and I thought it was fake because the packaging is different and the smell was off. I called Alterna who said that they changed their packaging over a year or two ago soooo either this is fake or it&#x27;s really old to the point the smell changed. Obviously not happy with either possibility....</li>
            <li> Loved what this conditioner did for my natural curls. Definitely a splurge item but it works</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome!  I agree that the bottle is a little temperamental and you really have to give a squeeze to get the product out.  But that doesn&#x27;t change my opinion of the product itself.  I am a blonde and have dry hair so a rich conditioner is important.  This is great and makes my hair very smooth and easy to comb through.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that I&#x27;ve had a major change but just by what I have seen I assume there will be.</li>
            <li> My hair felt better after the first use!</li>
            <li> This item shipped quickly and works well. It smells great and made my hair feel really soft and repaired. I am giving it 4 stars because the cap is really annoying. I wish they&#x27;d designed this bottle to be easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found for my thin tangly hair.</li>
            <li> Hi! Love this brand it is a very good conditioner for color hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the Alterna Caviar products for a long time.  I tried the Repair RX Instant Recovery Conditioner (along with the shampoo) and it worked much better than I had expected.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Great heavier conditioner by alterna. Love!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used! There are about 3-4 inches of my hair that are severely damaged from a bad, bad bleach job at horrible salon by an incompetent &amp;#34;stylist&amp;#34;. I got this to help smooth that out while my healthy hair is still growing. This makes it smooth, silky soft and SO shiny! My coworker said my hair looked so shiny it looked fake! If you have damaged hair you know it&#x27;s really hard to make it look shiny. I don&#x27;t use this every time I condition because it is rather expensive but it seems to have a lingering effect on my hair even when I use other products. I will definitely repurchase. My only issue is the terrible packaging. The plastic bottle is very thick and hard to squeeze, and the cap is weird and I actually broke it trying to figure out how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Alterna Moisture Replenishing line so thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see how it compared.  I didn&#x27;t like it and found that my hair felt much drier which contradicts its &amp;#34;Instant Recovery&amp;#34; name.  I went back to my Moisture Replenishing line and my hair bounced right back.</li>
            <li> expensive, but performs excellently and has a wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> it may be twice the price as other brands, but you use half as much product.  my hair has never been so silky!</li>
            <li> love this conditioner, I abuse my hair the only one I  have found that puts life back in your hair. Not heavy feeling on hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I can tell you that was a issue is the conditioner is very thick and hard to come out of bottle. So I just turned upside&lt;br /&gt;down problem solved. Worth the $</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this conditioner.  I was losing about 50 hairs every morning when I would comb out my hair after my shower, it is down to about 5 now.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I recommended this to a coworker after she had a really bad dye job that left her hair fried.  After a few weeks using this and the overnight hair repair, her hair looks great again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smooth, but it&#x27;s REALLY hard to squeeze the conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a tyroid problem so my hair is constantly dry. After one use of this conditioner my hair is noticably soft, smooth and healthier looking. It is worth every penny and I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry and out of shape.  It now is silky shiny and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;It took some time before I saw results(maybe 1/4 of the way through the bottle)  glad I stuck it out.</li>
            <li> At first i really loved it but I am starting to feel like it is making my hair a little spongy but I am still trying to figure out. overall very nice product !!!!! I would recomend it. i think the key is you use very little.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good but it&#x27;s not some magic potion. I thought it hydrated my curls a bit. But obviously I&#x27;m going to have to rotate it in w 18 other things.., it&#x27;s not at all de tangling either</li>
            <li> i have a hard time finding products that revitalize my dry curls, so I went to sephora for samples of different conditioning treatments. This was one of the ones I was given, and with such a small amount of product I was still able to saturate most of my ends and the result was amazing. I ended up purchasing this from Amazon since I found it cheaper than sephora. Let me tell you my curls have never been the same since, in a good way!! After the first usage I immediately saw a difference. I now have color treated hair, which I have never been able to have because it would ALWAYS break off. But since I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully my hair has been extremely healthy. this conditioner is literally like the holy grail of all conditioners. Also, I never write reviews but I had to rave for all of you dry, damaged hair people out there like I was, please give it a try!</li>
            <li> This conditioner, along with the shampoo, really helped my dry, frizzy hair get silky again. I&#x27;ve been having to wear it in a ponytail, but since I washed it with this low PH shampoo and conditioner, it really helped it to bounce back. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works good  But Not sure why the hype &amp; high price?  I have very dry &amp; damaged &amp; weak hair plus live in a dry climate.  Need something even heavier</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.The smell of it is absolutely wonderful.I use it as a weekly deep conditioner,because it is quite pricey.It makes my coarse,curly hair soft decreases the volume and holds the curls well.Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This Alterna Caviar Repair RX Conditioner is the best conditioner I have ever used (and I have tried many)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, blonde and dry which makes it difficult to comb out after I wash it unless I use this product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh&lt;br /&gt;my hair down or make it oily. The conditioner smells really good and I get compliments on the way my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;I like the shampoo as well! It is concentrated which means you don&#x27;t have to use much. I go through 2 conditioners for every shampoo. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how smooth and soft this leaves my hair. I literally almost got arrested by TSA when they tried to take it out of my bag. It&#x27;s worth a criminal record ladies! Honestly, my hair feels soft and LIGHT, which is not something you get with &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; conditioners. Its the same price as most Alterna conditioners, so it was a no brainer to at least try!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair and use this daily to control frizz and minimize styling damage. Rinse well but never leaves a greasy dull feeling on my hair. Leaves it shiny soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair very soft! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner a lot, and use the shampoo, too.  My hair is in chlorine 6 days a week, and I like the way this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great on over processed colored hair. Really helps repair the damage and dryness on stripped hair.</li>
            <li> I HATE this bottle!  BAD PACKAGING.  Tough to squeeze and then it ended up not working toward the end and I had about 25% of the product go to waste because I couldn&#x27;t get it out.  Needs to be in a regular tube.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again until they change the packaging because otherwise, I&#x27;m paying full price for 75% of the contents.  Regarding the product, it is great.  Great conditioner!  And I love the shampoo too.  Too bad about the bottle.  I&#x27;d like to know who thought that bottle was a good idea and I can&#x27;t believe they actually put that bottle into production.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner EVER.  It has totally changed my color, heat damaged hair!!!  I cannot say enough about this product EXCEPT I am so thankful that I found it!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate to think this one is fake since I&#x27;ve always loved Alterna products especially the Caviar and Bamboo line- however, this conditioner which felt great initially, ended up drying out my hair over time. I also found the bottle tough to use with wet hands in the shower despite it being upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Moroccan oil line, Okara, and It&#x27;s a 10- which have all kept my highlights from fading and minimize frizzing.</li>
            <li> Did not like the shampoo at all, but the conditioner was OK. Not as good as expected for the high price. With a different shampoo it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, so it gets dry from time to time.  This conditioner works right away!  It makes my hair look healthier and feel soft.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, apparently I&#x27;m the only one with a problem with the bottle.  It is SO difficult to squeeze the product out of the bottle, especially with wet hands!  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective bottle or what, but I really hate the bottle design.  NOT user friendly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, once I get the actual product out of the bottle and onto my hair, it is effective at restoring moisture and softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used the Alterna Caviar Repair RX Micro-Bead Fill &amp; Fix Treatment Masque and it completely transformed my dry, brittle hair after one use.  I had tried many expensive products from other stores, and none of them worked for me.  My hair still felt like straw until I tried this Alterna Caviar line.  I purchased this conditioner because I can&#x27;t afford to constantly buy the mask and thought this might be a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I will continue to purchase and use this product, as it is great for restoring the health of your hair and worth the cost.  The only con for me is the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff. I should put it on a repeat buy but where the savings?</li>
            <li> This Conditioner (and the matching shampoo) have never let me down. No weird residues but still makes my hair very soft. My favorite part is how excellently it detangles my tangle-prone, fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t strip or dilute color either, so anyone with color or chemically treated hair will love this. The smell is faint but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and for anyone having problems with the packaging, make sure you \\&quot;twist\\&quot; the top/cap into the \\&quot;unlocked\\&quot; position. This is actually a really nice feature because it lets you store the bottles upside down (so you can get as much of the product out as possible!) without it leaking from the rubber part.</li>
