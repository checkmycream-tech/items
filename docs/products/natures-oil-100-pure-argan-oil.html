            <li>Great for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>The price that I bought this was a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Great for skin aswell.</li>
            <li>chose this over others because it has a light smell ( perfect smell ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Through the years I&#x27;ve tried everything, and even coconut oil wasn&#x27;t as good as this argan.</li>
            <li>Will do some research and, if a good idea, get another bottle for the freezer.</li>
            <li>but for the most I wanted to address the price and size up front!</li>
            <li>i am so happy that it is now available on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Plus, coconut oil in my hair makes it kind of lifeless and oily.</li>
            <li>Cant just go by what the distributor says, right?!!!  </li>
            <li>I make my own shampoo with this by taking one part Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, one part argan oil, and one part water.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s a very light amber color.</li>
            <li>I received my product yesterday and I was impressed with the size of the bottle (especially for the price).  </li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients to make sure</li>
            <li>Love the oil</li>
            <li>But this was a considerably better value, so</li>

            <li>take much to make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Well worth the below market price</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t glide onand soak into to the skin as nicely as the last Argan oil I bought from another company.  </li>
            <li>this will be worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I tried a tiny sample and liked the way it made my skin feel very much.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the right product</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I love using this oil for several applications.</li>

            <li>as well as use it straight!</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my hair, I have very think curly hair</li>
            <li>and I have to see if this is the real deal...</li>
            <li>This will last me a LONG time. :)</li>
            <li>I would normally get 8-10oz for this price.</li>
            <li>This completely healed the dry skin patches on my face in 3 days just by lightly applying it after washing face before bed &amp; in the morning.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>This argan oil in my hair made it SO soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I can get this oil in reasonable quantities to use in my cosmetic business.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews and, hoping they were even half true, decided to order.</li>

            <li> I have heard that some Argan oil has a bad scent, but there was none of that with this brand.</li>
            <li> so the worst it would do is not work for frizz and shine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> of the brands that i have used this is my favourite.  i am so happy that it is now available on amazon.  the size bottle and the price for this product are spot on.</li>
            <li> Well worth the below market price</li>
            <li> I received my product yesterday and I was impressed with the size of the bottle (especially for the price).  I looked at the ingredients to make sure I ordered the right product and I did.  It smells different from the other argan products I have purchased and this is a plus.  I will try to remember to post about the actual progress- but for the most I wanted to address the price and size up front!</li>
            <li> Love the oil but it doesn&#x27;t glide onand soak into to the skin as nicely as the last Argan oil I bought from another company.  But this was a considerably better value, so I will probably reorder this one when the time comes.  It will be a while, though.  This will last me a LONG time. :)</li>
            <li> I had never heard of argan oil until I was at a health food store about six months ago.  I tried a tiny sample and liked the way it made my skin feel very much.  Later, I tried putting some into body lotion that I had purchased at Costco and I really like the way it makes my skin feel and look.  Now I will not be without it.  Oddly, I noticed on a bottle of dog shampoo that it contained argan oil and I tried putting a little on my Havanese&#x27;s coat which is a lot like a Swifter dusting thing and it really tamed the static electricity or whatever it is that causes her coat to attract dust like a magnet.  It is excellent and does not cause her hair to look oily at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves a grimey feeling on the skin</li>
            <li> Great oil will be buying again very soon.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about using this on my face. But as an alternative, I tried it exclusively for facial moisturizing in our arid climate in the foothills of the Rockies. It worked well for that. No problem. I am still trying to figure out how I will verify if it is organic or not. Cant just go by what the distributor says, right?!!!  I did after a couple of months go back to organic moisturizing creams. They seem to nourish the skin in so many ways.</li>
            <li> As recommended by others, I use two drops to wet hair.  My hair feels softer and it seems to help slow down hair loss.</li>
            <li> I recieved mine this morning 01/10/14. I placed my order on the 7th so that you know how long it takes for the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16 oz bottle is like 4Xs the 4 oz bottle with the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used oil a lot and I know which is best.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this over others because it has a light smell ( perfect smell ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions on how to use it and&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> wow. Read the reviews and, hoping they were even half true, decided to order. A few drops applied on an as-needed basis and this is the first year I can remember not having my winter-face so dry it hurts. Not greasy, at all! Through the years I&#x27;ve tried everything, and even coconut oil wasn&#x27;t as good as this argan. Plus, coconut oil in my hair makes it kind of lifeless and oily. This argan oil in my hair made it SO soft. It neither felt nor looked oily, but it did flatten, a bit. I almost never put oil in my hair though. Was just curious after one of the other reviewers mentioned using is as a hair treatment. This would probably be a godsend for people with dry hair as well as for those with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take much to make a HUGE difference. Only wish I&#x27;d found it sooner. Now wondering if I should keep it in the refrigerator for &amp;#34;preservation&amp;#34; since this bottle will last a very long time. Will do some research and, if a good idea, get another bottle for the freezer. HATE it when I run out of a must-have and find it&#x27;s no longer available...</li>
            <li> I love using this oil for several applications. I have heard that some Argan oil has a bad scent, but there was none of that with this brand.The price that I bought this was a great bargain. I hope that they still have the same price and quality product when I  have finished this bottle.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle last week and won&#x27;t know for a couple weeks if it works as well as the previous brand I used. I use it for my hair, I have very think curly hair and I have to see if this is the real deal... it doesn&#x27;t smell like or look like any other Argan oil I&#x27;ve used and MUCH cheaper than any other brand I used. I would normally get 8-10oz for this price. It smells like nothing and looks like ordinary oil. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything like this so the worst it would do is not work for frizz and shine. I do use a combination of oils in my hair and each has it purpose. Argan oil is great for stopping frizz and a long lasting shine. I will be documenting the results and updating my review soon. If this actually does what ( I ) want it to do.... this will be worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Good item, decent price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> great stuff!,  I used the heck out of it, and as You know its in everything now days, and expencive  I out it in myself,. as well as use it straight! love love love this</li>
            <li> Its a lot for the price kinda greasy so if you put it on hair watch the  amount. Great for skin aswell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it on my body and hair.  The price and quality is off the charts.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can get this oil in reasonable quantities to use in my cosmetic business.  Will be a repeat customer.  Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I make my own shampoo with this by taking one part Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, one part argan oil, and one part water.  Try it!  You will LOVE it.  Does NOT leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This completely healed the dry skin patches on my face in 3 days just by lightly applying it after washing face before bed &amp; in the morning. There is no scent at all &amp; it&#x27;s a very light amber color.</li>
