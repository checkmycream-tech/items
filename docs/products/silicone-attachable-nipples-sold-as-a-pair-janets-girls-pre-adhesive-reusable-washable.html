            <li>fit great!!!</li>
            <li>Hugh but the adhesive is really good and the good materal.</li>
            <li>They stay on fairly well</li>
            <li>Good for occasion use but not to keep in place.</li>
            <li>Okay so the quality is great</li>
            <li>These are HUGE!  </li>
            <li>Wish the adheasive was better</li>
            <li>The nipple, not the areola, is almost 3/4&amp;#34; across and it sticks up more than 1/2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Fun, flirty, especially a great fun laugh</li>
            <li>Well ladies when everyone else says they are huge...</li>
            <li>but these are huge.  </li>
            <li>but huge.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the erect nipples to be so huge.</li>
            <li>very nice little addition to any outfit to draw attention to your chest under almost any style top or blouse</li>
            <li>Large nipples love them</li>
            <li>Wow there realy nice nipples</li>
            <li>and I imagine if the sticky stuff wears out it would be pretty easy to refresh.</li>
            <li>Excellent shape but the polyurethane &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; begins to come loose after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;. . .</li>
            <li>oh well, still LOTS of fun.</li>
            <li>they were so much fun.</li>
            <li>They are so much fun.</li>
            <li>Center of nipple is good and firm but was hoping outer edges would have been softer and more flexable because they show through some of the tops that are worn.</li>
            <li>Great feel but very delicate....</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really stick that well.  </li>
            <li>Very teasing effect.</li>
            <li>ordered size XL, very unnatural</li>
            <li>I received my nipples fast.</li>
            <li>after a month, &amp;#34;the tip&amp;#34; broke off from the base...literally...and i was &amp;#34;so gentle with it&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>The outer edge will stick out and very unnaturally looking.  </li>
            <li>A realistic feel and</li>
            <li>It is a good idea, but poorly designed.  </li>
            <li>and these are really hugh like similar to skull candies</li>
            <li>However does not look like a natural color for a nipple.</li>
            <li>The large size looked flat and the XL size had the look I wanted, but</li>
            <li>Now I am reasonable enough to say that I have big breasts and the nipples to go with them...</li>

            <li> Well ladies when everyone else says they are huge... they weren&#x27;t kidding.  Now I am reasonable enough to say that I have big breasts and the nipples to go with them... but these are huge.  FUN!!!!! but huge.  It was a way for my nips to be even for once.  Fun, flirty, especially a great fun laugh</li>
            <li> Center of nipple is good and firm but was hoping outer edges would have been softer and more flexable because they show through some of the tops that are worn.</li>

            <li> Product isn&#x27;t bad, just way to big! I wasn&#x27;t expecting the erect nipples to be so huge. I did order a XL, they look good, but I need something 1/2 to maybe 2/3 the size. If you have huge breasts, this might be great for you! Very teasing effect. Nice material, and the seller was great with everything.

            <li> Large nipples love them</li>
            <li> ordered size XL, very unnatural</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with nipples.  The size was perfect.</li>
            <li> These are HUGE!  The nipple, not the areola, is almost 3/4&amp;#34; across and it sticks up more than 1/2&amp;#34;.  The large size looked flat and the XL size had the look I wanted, but oh my.  These will show through anything other than a heavy winter coat.  As a sissy I relish the attention and there is no hiding these.</li>
            <li> Great Idems!!! fit great!!!</li>
            <li> Okay so the quality is great the color is a little off and these are really hugh like similar to skull candies ear bud numbs but a little bigger. Hugh but the adhesive is really good and the good materal. However does not look like a natural color for a nipple.</li>
            <li> Wow there realy nice nipples i like them.I bought the XL size..Thank you !!</li>
            <li> I received my nipples fast. I tried them out. I didn&#x27;t want to take them off they were so much fun. I wish I could just were them all the time. They are so much fun. They stay on fairly well and I imagine if the sticky stuff wears out it would be pretty easy to refresh. They are a pinkish color I wish I had a slightly darker color but I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> very nice little addition to any outfit to draw attention to your chest under almost any style top or blouse</li>
            <li> Great feel but very delicate....after a month, &amp;#34;the tip&amp;#34; broke off from the base...literally...and i was &amp;#34;so gentle with it&amp;#34;....useless now...!!!</li>

            <li> It is totally not worth the money.  It is a good idea, but poorly designed.  The adhesive base is flat and does not conform to breast.  The outer edge will stick out and very unnaturally looking.  I may as well just use duct tape and cotton ball......LOL</li>
            <li> Excellent shape but the polyurethane &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; begins to come loose after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;. . . Good for occasion use but not to keep in place.</li>
