            <li>I love the variety of blush shades.  </li>
            <li>I swatched them, it felt like I was touching silk.</li>
            <li>They were okay...</li>
            <li>I love these blushes.</li>
            <li>They colors are a great variety of depths and tones that will truly compliment anyone and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like it!  :)</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m 100% sure.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just glad I got 3 of them.  </li>
            <li>I love these blushes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as elegant as I imagined.  </li>
            <li>The colors are more orange than I could see.  </li>
            <li>i love makeup</li>
            <li>and i clearly love it</li>
            <li>The colors are better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>I like my new blushes color, specially for me that I&#x27;m going to travel, love the colors and for my skin color they are perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap quality and very strong...</li>
            <li>They are pretty good.</li>
            <li>These have a lot of natural colors that look great.</li>
            <li>The colors are very beautiful, but my stuff was broken,, all colors are excellent,, thanks,, but I need replace my blush set...</li>
            <li>Wearing today for a trial run and so far happy with product - blended easily</li>
            <li>I was excited to get so many colors of blush, but they look nothing like the pictures shown.</li>
            <li>for anything though it works wonders and the palettes are easy to store.</li>
            <li>Seems to me it would break easily if dropped</li>
            <li>the variety of colors are awesome from light blush peach color Barbie pink</li>
            <li>Variety is awesome; there&#x27;s dark bronzers, light mocha shades, some with shimmer and without.</li>
            <li>and it is fine...</li>
            <li>but I would never order them because most of the colors are way to bold.</li>
            <li>they fit all skin tones.</li>
            <li>the blushes have kind of a creamy/powder consistency which I don&#x27;t really like I just wanted a powder blush.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors come out darker  even though they look light beware before when applying them</li>
            <li>But in itty bitty tiny squares lol</li>
            <li>Smooth application and wears all day.</li>
            <li>Use a light hand when applying.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews before I received mine and everyone talked about how great the color payoff is and that they can be used on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Just received and this is really quite nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would probably recommend it based on the cheap price.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smooth in with my akin</li>
            <li>and it applies evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and it looks good so far.  </li>
            <li>This would be perfect for darker skin tones but im as pale as they come.</li>
            <li>Very nice, pigment is solid,</li>
            <li>They are very pretty colors and the quality is alright till he gets better, this is a good choice for someone who is just starting out.</li>
            <li>There are things that I don&#x27;t like, but overall its a great product worthy of your money</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I originally bought them for my niece to experiment with.  </li>
            <li>I have light to medium skintone with yellow undertone and these all look good.</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The actual product is actually pretty great, they have good pigmentation, nice colors, and a reasonable amount of product, the reason that I am only giving it 3 stars</li>
            <li>these are professional size...just love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering buying a backup because I love it so much and for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was cool.</li>
            <li>Both of those statements are true.</li>
            <li>I do makeup as a career, and I&#x27;m constantly looking for good quality products.</li>
            <li>The pigment is outstanding and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the color that&#x27;s in the pallet.</li>
            <li>So true to color.  </li>
            <li>Loved it, the only problem was one of the blushes broke during shipment</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how large they were, so I got good value for my money.  </li>
            <li>there are many hard to find colors and at a great price</li>
            <li>Deliver was quick and nothing was damaged.  </li>
            <li>Seems to wear out quick</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful but they are very dark.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors</li>
            <li>just cause the product may look a bit sketchy not sure if it&#x27;s good for skin. :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are looking for a blush palette!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a women of color and are looking for the perfect peach and pink blush colors you cannot go wrong with these 12 beautiful colors.  </li>
            <li>they are really pigmented however the pallets that i got look every cheap not like the picture</li>
            <li>i havent tried all the colors but the few i have look great on me.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and I use the light Beige to contour the colors are a bit creamy which I think helps them stay</li>
            <li>purchasing, i would have liked to know that the palette is split in to 2 smaller palettes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this palette set is DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
            <li>COLORS ARE NICE BUT TOO CLOSE TO BEING THE SAME COLOR.</li>
            <li>Some if tue colors a shimmery which i font tend to use but even if inly 4 of the colors work..its worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s simple and nice.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>the colors are super pretty.</li>
            <li>No matter how you apply them I cant seem to get it right.</li>
            <li>The color selection is great for every single type of skin color and occasion, especially for stage makeup which is why I originally purchased this palette.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast. ....</li>
            <li>Was kind of skeptical of how good it would be based on the price</li>
            <li>easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I never tought to find such a great quality for such lower price.</li>
            <li>Super WOW !!!  </li>
            <li>within the first week.</li>
            <li>When I received the package and opened it, the blushes were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, on top of that</li>
            <li>This product has a pretty blush color and it last on the face most of the day.</li>
            <li>When I first looked at the product online, it seemed like it was one set .</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and buttery!</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset about this product.</li>
            <li>I wish there would have been more pinks and red in here</li>
            <li>and I really like it !</li>
            <li>I like this product the color are pretty</li>
            <li>Outside of that I LOVE the color&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Which are pretty colors</li>
            <li>Colors r pretty,, some r shimmery and some r in Matt form</li>
            <li>I should have know that something so cheap would look like something you give to a 3 year old to play with.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I got this earlier than expected the colors are amazing too!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and ver pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors usually last the whole day, even with a light brushing.  </li>
            <li>they came fast.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and all pieces intact</li>
            <li>Very pigmented -</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need to apply much product to brush.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need a lot to make your cheeks pop.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they came really fast  </li>
            <li>I did not like the colors too much.</li>
            <li>They go with every skin type and are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>it headed straight to the garbage</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>of the blush had spilled out of the container, I really like the color.</li>
            <li>: these are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but still VERY useable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying them out</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really played around with them.</li>
            <li>All the colors of the pallet works really well with my skintone.</li>
            <li>The colors and texture look great except they were mostly broken...</li>
            <li>The items were very well packaged therefore, I do NOT think the seller caused the issue I believe it was from being tossed around at the post office.  </li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and stay on all day.</li>
            <li>i havent gotten a chance to play with them but by running my fingers thru some colors they seem very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and they came in VERY FAST!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is two different treys which I liked, but I gave it only four stars because that&#x27;s not how it looked</li>
            <li>There are many different colors for different skin tones which is really helpful.</li>
            <li>Pretty natural colors ....</li>
            <li>Love these blushes they just give you suttle amount of color has a slight smell but</li>
            <li>I love that the palettes came with a tiny mirror that allowed you to look at your cheeks and only your cheeks.</li>
            <li>Used only a few colors, but good to have around.</li>
            <li>The set includes matte and luminous colors and the pots are a decent size.</li>
            <li>Got it the other pretty good especially for the price a little smaller then displayed but I&#x27;m satisfied for now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented color.</li>
            <li>but wow!!</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t mean it is amazing</li>
            <li>The palettes are small and compact smaller than the anastasia contour kit which makes them great for travel especially because you&#x27;ll have options.</li>
            <li>the colors are very neutral, looks like bare skin!</li>
            <li>powder silky very soft</li>
            <li>I just received this product and I must say I was very surprised about the size</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>They came in such pretty packaging and didn&#x27;t come in broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first of all when i open my package the 1st of blush was crack ...</li>
            <li>I like the idea that you can use one color as a contour and the other as a blush and it has many different shades for all skintones.</li>
            <li>while it isn&#x27;t a big deal, it bothered me that in the photo they were trying to make it look like it was one large palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually like the dual packaging - rather than one large one.  </li>
            <li>I switched all of the blushes and was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>When I received this package in the mail on se was completely destroyed.  </li>
            <li>They apply really well and last all day.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY surprised at these blushes.  </li>
            <li>Every bit as pigmented as my professional grade product and generous in size and color options.  </li>
            <li>they kinda have like a creamy soft powderish feel.</li>
            <li>please do not waste you money on this blush set</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good not best</li>
            <li>Easy to use little fall out can be used for contour!</li>
            <li>They may make young women glow but an older person simply amplifies the wrinkles</li>
            <li>I admit I was silly for ordering so many colors in the first place</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to any mua or any one building their kit or even for personal use.</li>
            <li>blush does not go on very choppy, but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be.</li>
            <li>: I imagine if you have sensitive skin you may want to be careful again with how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6th: some are shimmery/glittery.</li>
            <li>I actually select my blush shade based on my mood and there is so much to choose from - two cases provide double the pleasure!</li>
            <li>all are very pigmented and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I apparently have an allergic reaction to the blush.</li>
            <li>I use one palet more then the other but out of all the other more expensive blushes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too small to even be considered a full on eyeshadow brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually know how well the products work because I will be sending them back for new ones.</li>
            <li>Too dark  for very fsir skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to open and see two pallets instead of one long one as picture.</li>

            <li> I really really love this set.</li>

            <li> Love it ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with it being two pieces</li>

            <li> I love the variety of blush shades.  </li>
            <li> I swatched them, it felt like I was touching silk.</li>
            <li> They were okay...</li>
            <li> I love these blushes.</li>
            <li> They colors are a great variety of depths and tones that will truly compliment anyone and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it!  :)</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m 100% sure.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just glad I got 3 of them.  </li>
            <li> I love these blushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as elegant as I imagined.  </li>
            <li> The colors are more orange than I could see.  </li>
            <li> i love makeup</li>
            <li> and i clearly love it</li>
            <li> The colors are better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I like my new blushes color, specially for me that I&#x27;m going to travel, love the colors and for my skin color they are perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap quality and very strong...</li>
            <li> They are pretty good.</li>
            <li> These have a lot of natural colors that look great.</li>
            <li> The colors are very beautiful, but my stuff was broken,, all colors are excellent,, thanks,, but I need replace my blush set...</li>
            <li> Wearing today for a trial run and so far happy with product - blended easily</li>
            <li> I was excited to get so many colors of blush, but they look nothing like the pictures shown.</li>
            <li> for anything though it works wonders and the palettes are easy to store.</li>
            <li> Seems to me it would break easily if dropped</li>
            <li> the variety of colors are awesome from light blush peach color Barbie pink</li>
            <li> Variety is awesome; there&#x27;s dark bronzers, light mocha shades, some with shimmer and without.</li>
            <li> and it is fine...</li>
            <li> but I would never order them because most of the colors are way to bold.</li>
            <li> they fit all skin tones.</li>
            <li> the blushes have kind of a creamy/powder consistency which I don&#x27;t really like I just wanted a powder blush.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors come out darker  even though they look light beware before when applying them</li>
            <li> But in itty bitty tiny squares lol</li>
            <li> Smooth application and wears all day.</li>
            <li> Use a light hand when applying.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before I received mine and everyone talked about how great the color payoff is and that they can be used on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just received and this is really quite nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would probably recommend it based on the cheap price.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smooth in with my akin</li>
            <li> and it applies evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and it looks good so far.  </li>
            <li> This would be perfect for darker skin tones but im as pale as they come.</li>
            <li> Very nice, pigment is solid,</li>
            <li> They are very pretty colors and the quality is alright till he gets better, this is a good choice for someone who is just starting out.</li>
            <li> There are things that I don&#x27;t like, but overall its a great product worthy of your money</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I originally bought them for my niece to experiment with.  </li>
            <li> I have light to medium skintone with yellow undertone and these all look good.</li>
            <li> The colors are super pigmented and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The actual product is actually pretty great, they have good pigmentation, nice colors, and a reasonable amount of product, the reason that I am only giving it 3 stars</li>
            <li> these are professional size...just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying a backup because I love it so much and for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was cool.</li>
            <li> Both of those statements are true.</li>
            <li> I do makeup as a career, and I&#x27;m constantly looking for good quality products.</li>
            <li> The pigment is outstanding and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the color that&#x27;s in the pallet.</li>
            <li> So true to color.  </li>
            <li> Loved it, the only problem was one of the blushes broke during shipment</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how large they were, so I got good value for my money.  </li>
            <li> there are many hard to find colors and at a great price</li>
            <li> Deliver was quick and nothing was damaged.  </li>
            <li> Seems to wear out quick</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful but they are very dark.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors</li>
            <li> just cause the product may look a bit sketchy not sure if it&#x27;s good for skin. :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are looking for a blush palette!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a women of color and are looking for the perfect peach and pink blush colors you cannot go wrong with these 12 beautiful colors.  </li>
            <li> they are really pigmented however the pallets that i got look every cheap not like the picture</li>
            <li> i havent tried all the colors but the few i have look great on me.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and I use the light Beige to contour the colors are a bit creamy which I think helps them stay</li>
            <li> purchasing, i would have liked to know that the palette is split in to 2 smaller palettes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this palette set is DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
            <li> COLORS ARE NICE BUT TOO CLOSE TO BEING THE SAME COLOR.</li>
            <li> Some if tue colors a shimmery which i font tend to use but even if inly 4 of the colors work..its worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s simple and nice.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> the colors are super pretty.</li>
            <li> No matter how you apply them I cant seem to get it right.</li>
            <li> The color selection is great for every single type of skin color and occasion, especially for stage makeup which is why I originally purchased this palette.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast. ....</li>
            <li> Was kind of skeptical of how good it would be based on the price</li>
            <li> easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I never tought to find such a great quality for such lower price.</li>
            <li> Super WOW !!!  </li>
            <li> within the first week.</li>
            <li> When I received the package and opened it, the blushes were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, on top of that</li>
            <li> This product has a pretty blush color and it last on the face most of the day.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at the product online, it seemed like it was one set .</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and buttery!</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset about this product.</li>
            <li> I wish there would have been more pinks and red in here</li>
            <li> and I really like it !</li>
            <li> I like this product the color are pretty</li>
            <li> Outside of that I LOVE the color&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Which are pretty colors</li>
            <li> Colors r pretty,, some r shimmery and some r in Matt form</li>
            <li> I should have know that something so cheap would look like something you give to a 3 year old to play with.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I got this earlier than expected the colors are amazing too!</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and ver pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors usually last the whole day, even with a light brushing.  </li>
            <li> they came fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and all pieces intact</li>
            <li> Very pigmented -</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need to apply much product to brush.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need a lot to make your cheeks pop.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> they came really fast  </li>
            <li> I did not like the colors too much.</li>
            <li> They go with every skin type and are very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> it headed straight to the garbage</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> of the blush had spilled out of the container, I really like the color.</li>
            <li> : these are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still VERY useable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying them out</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really played around with them.</li>
            <li> All the colors of the pallet works really well with my skintone.</li>
            <li> The colors and texture look great except they were mostly broken...</li>
            <li> The items were very well packaged therefore, I do NOT think the seller caused the issue I believe it was from being tossed around at the post office.  </li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and stay on all day.</li>
            <li> i havent gotten a chance to play with them but by running my fingers thru some colors they seem very pigmented.</li>
            <li> and they came in VERY FAST!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is two different treys which I liked, but I gave it only four stars because that&#x27;s not how it looked</li>
            <li> There are many different colors for different skin tones which is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural colors ....</li>
            <li> Love these blushes they just give you suttle amount of color has a slight smell but</li>
            <li> I love that the palettes came with a tiny mirror that allowed you to look at your cheeks and only your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Used only a few colors, but good to have around.</li>
            <li> The set includes matte and luminous colors and the pots are a decent size.</li>
            <li> Got it the other pretty good especially for the price a little smaller then displayed but I&#x27;m satisfied for now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented color.</li>
            <li> but wow!!</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it is amazing</li>
            <li> The palettes are small and compact smaller than the anastasia contour kit which makes them great for travel especially because you&#x27;ll have options.</li>
            <li> the colors are very neutral, looks like bare skin!</li>
            <li> powder silky very soft</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I must say I was very surprised about the size</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> They came in such pretty packaging and didn&#x27;t come in broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first of all when i open my package the 1st of blush was crack ...</li>
            <li> I like the idea that you can use one color as a contour and the other as a blush and it has many different shades for all skintones.</li>
            <li> while it isn&#x27;t a big deal, it bothered me that in the photo they were trying to make it look like it was one large palette.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually like the dual packaging - rather than one large one.  </li>
            <li> I switched all of the blushes and was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> When I received this package in the mail on se was completely destroyed.  </li>
            <li> They apply really well and last all day.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY surprised at these blushes.  </li>
            <li> Every bit as pigmented as my professional grade product and generous in size and color options.  </li>
            <li> they kinda have like a creamy soft powderish feel.</li>
            <li> please do not waste you money on this blush set</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good not best</li>
            <li> Easy to use little fall out can be used for contour!</li>
            <li> They may make young women glow but an older person simply amplifies the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I admit I was silly for ordering so many colors in the first place</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to any mua or any one building their kit or even for personal use.</li>
            <li> blush does not go on very choppy, but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be.</li>
            <li> : I imagine if you have sensitive skin you may want to be careful again with how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6th: some are shimmery/glittery.</li>
            <li> I actually select my blush shade based on my mood and there is so much to choose from - two cases provide double the pleasure!</li>
            <li> all are very pigmented and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I apparently have an allergic reaction to the blush.</li>
            <li> I use one palet more then the other but out of all the other more expensive blushes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small to even be considered a full on eyeshadow brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually know how well the products work because I will be sending them back for new ones.</li>
            <li> Too dark  for very fsir skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to open and see two pallets instead of one long one as picture.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too small maybe the size of an eye shadow brush which doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> So it is lasting me a long time because I dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> they last very long</li>
            <li> but in different other colors</li>
            <li> Comes in two separate pieces and all colors are similar to each other.</li>
            <li> The compacts are poor quality and will need to be handled very gently.</li>
            <li> not one single palette.</li>
            <li> was so mad, because i was so excited to start using the blushes!</li>
            <li> I received this  product  in less than a week of ordering it, however, one of the blush kits was totally messed</li>
            <li> And they are so pigmented that you only have to dab your brush a little to get a lot of product.</li>
            <li> The powder is cheap and dirty looking on my face.</li>
            <li> both are small enough to fit in a purse, and contain a small thin mirror for touch</li>
            <li> There is not much I can say.</li>
            <li> They may look similar but while dressing up they mean different shades..</li>
            <li> but no other complaint..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i use these for eyeshadows and blushes, i like the colors and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> it even came 2 days before i expected!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll work with the other two blushes.</li>
            <li> Gave my mother the other palette.</li>
            <li> one set comes in matte colors and the other in shimmer</li>
            <li> and you have to be very very careful with them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> For the price you really cant go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I just received this the other day!</li>
            <li> It also has a slight smell (not stinky smell....</li>
            <li> Im black and brown shin.</li>
            <li> but I could care less.  </li>
            <li> One of the containers was broken (major crack in the lid)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> There was a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> : they are a little powdery if you are a darker skin tone (Kelly Rowland)</li>
            <li> Not a huge issue for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2.the mirrors are in a ridiculous and not very efficient place</li>
            <li> Not sure I would tell a friend</li>
            <li> So I justed wasted my money on this produce!</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.the brushes are way too small to be useful&lt;</li>
            <li> if you drop them, then tough luck washing your clothes ( if they get on your clothes) and all of the little pallets break.</li>
            <li> kinda hard to describe).  </li>
            <li> With each palette there was a brush and quite frankly, the brush sucks.</li>
            <li> Not happy, not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to heck to see they did not look like the picture above.</li>
            <li> When I received the package the  blush sets were broken, Not able to use this produce!</li>
            <li> they are shark and hard!</li>
            <li> Tired of all the metallic products.</li>
            <li> Ordered them and one color was broken.</li>
            <li> Once I received the package one set was broken</li>
            <li> Two of the blushes were busted (ironically, neither of them were in the broken</li>
            <li> Which explains why one of them had broken, and blush powder had spilled over all of the containers.</li>
            <li> And the brushes were really poor quality!</li>
            <li> needless to say, i was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible quality would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really expensive, but it works just as well as a expensive item.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the colors are super pretty. they came fast. the only reasons i put a 3 star was because when they arrives, one color was cracked. and you have to be very very careful with them. if you drop them, then tough luck washing your clothes ( if they get on your clothes) and all of the little pallets break. And the brushes were really poor quality! they are shark and hard! they poke your face and don&#x27;t rub any of the blush on your face.</li>
            <li> Very nice, pigment is solid, great application, variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Nice colorw, it would have been better iif there was a cover to protect the blushers.  Blends nicely, but won&#x27;t travel well. There is nothing to prtect the blushers ftom breaking.</li>
            <li> Great colors, love it!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Nice colors.. They may look similar but while dressing up they mean different shades.. Smooth and spreads nicely on face with the brush included. Stays on for a while. Arrived fast and all pieces intact</li>
            <li> before you even try out the product, toss the brush. it&#x27;s too small to even be considered a full on eyeshadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;however, the selection of colors is pretty great. they fit all skin tones. some are shimmery, some are satin, some are matte, and there&#x27;s a couple with glitter flecks. all are very pigmented and last a long time. impressive options.&lt;br /&gt;the blush does not go on very choppy, but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be. a bit of blending is necessary, but not enough to be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;before purchasing, i would have liked to know that the palette is split in to 2 smaller palettes. while it isn&#x27;t a big deal, it bothered me that in the photo they were trying to make it look like it was one large palette.&lt;br /&gt;this palette set is DEFINITELY worth the price. both are small enough to fit in a purse, and contain a small thin mirror for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;upon arrival, the package was not damaged in any way. it even came 2 days before i expected! needless to say, i was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall ratings:&lt;br /&gt;application - 6.5/10&lt;br /&gt;color choices - 8/10&lt;br /&gt;lasting ability - 7/10&lt;br /&gt;price - 1,000,000/10&lt;br /&gt;shipping - 10/10&lt;br /&gt;recommend? heck yes.</li>
            <li> One set came broke..but no other complaint..they last very long</li>
            <li> it deserve fice stars</li>
            <li> Ordered these for travel so didn&#x27;t have to pack a bunch of different blushes in separate packages. The compacts are poor quality and will need to be handled very gently. The blushes are absolutely gorgeous though. Wearing today for a trial run and so far happy with product - blended easily and it looks good so far.  Very pigmented - didn&#x27;t need to apply much product to brush. Nice selection of shimmers and mattes in mostly neutral colors. I have light to medium skintone with yellow undertone and these all look good. Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The display of blushes isn&#x27;t like the one shown in the picture! The colors are way bolder than e ones shown, but they are still pretty good quality! I honeslty just have one colour left!</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and you don&#x27;t need a lot to make your cheeks pop.  I apparently have an allergic reaction to the blush. It also has a slight smell (not stinky smell....kinda hard to describe).  It&#x27;s up to the buyer&#x27;s liking though.</li>
            <li> Not happy, not satisfied. Not sure I would tell a friend the picture looks me appealing. Wasn&#x27;t it supposed pto come with a case?</li>
            <li> All of my purchase  was in good condition  Thanks</li>
            <li> I really really love this set. It has a variety of contrasting colors that you can mix and match for the perfect color you desire.</li>
            <li> Love these blushes they just give you suttle amount of color has a slight smell but it doesn&#x27;t stink  they came really fast  I can&#x27;t say enough about  have a review on my YouTube channel  inuyashasbabe120  so check it out</li>
            <li> I did not like the colors too much. They look slightly different than in the photo.</li>
            <li> Tired of all the metallic products. They may make young women glow but an older person simply amplifies the wrinkles</li>
            <li> i liked it . Nice shades and easy to wear. Non sticky. That is why i gave it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> No matter what skin tone you have, you will find the perfect shade of blush in this blush  set. I promise you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> Make up (Blush) for my daughter for Christmas.  She was happy so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE This product!</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast. ....within the first week. Very pretty colors. Love it!</li>
            <li> Was kind of skeptical of how good it would be based on the price but wow!! I was so amazed by  all the different shades that come with it and how well they last. Variety is awesome; there&#x27;s dark bronzers, light mocha shades, some with shimmer and without. Would highly recommend this to any mua or any one building their kit or even for personal use.</li>
            <li> When I received the package and opened it, the blushes were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, on top of that the blushes have kind of a creamy/powder consistency which I don&#x27;t really like I just wanted a powder blush. The brushes are too small maybe the size of an eye shadow brush which doesn&#x27;t really bother me I wasn&#x27;t going to use them anyway but you&#x27;re probably better off applying it with your fingers. I think the pictures are a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> Got it the other pretty good especially for the price a little smaller then displayed but I&#x27;m satisfied for now</li>
            <li> Very high quality and ver pigmented. Once I&#x27;m  finished i will re order.</li>
            <li> This product has a pretty blush color and it last on the face most of the day. I like the colors because you can wear one or blend all the colors. I would recommend this product to anyone with an olive complexion.</li>
            <li> The blush is excellent for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Love it ... It came with 2 pallets you just have to purchase your own blush brush ... But great</li>
            <li> When I first looked at the product online, it seemed like it was one set . When I received the product in the mail it was two. I&#x27;m ok with it being two pieces but I would have preferred if it was one. With each palette there was a brush and quite frankly, the brush sucks. The bristles are synthetic and do not bend and the brush isn&#x27;t big enough to correctly apply blush. I switched all of the blushes and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The colors are super pigmented and went on smoothly. They were a tad but ashy alone, but with foundation they were much better. I love that the palettes came with a tiny mirror that allowed you to look at your cheeks and only your cheeks. The color selection is great for every single type of skin color and occasion, especially for stage makeup which is why I originally purchased this palette. There are things that I don&#x27;t like, but overall its a great product worthy of your money</li>
            <li> I like my new blushes color, specially for me that I&#x27;m going to travel, love the colors and for my skin color they are perfect</li>
            <li> Some of the colors come out darker  even though they look light beware before when applying them</li>
            <li> Really great blush for the price.</li>
            <li> When I received the package the  blush sets were broken, Not able to use this produce! So I justed wasted my money on this produce!</li>
            <li> These blushes are amazing!! Very pigmented and buttery! The palettes are small and compact smaller than the anastasia contour kit which makes them great for travel especially because you&#x27;ll have options. They are like twice the size of a blush compact and yet you get 6 shades per palette and they are a great size. A little goes a very long way! Once again this is a great deal and the product is great all around, good size great pigmentation and even better price! Who cares if it&#x27;s not Mac, or tarte, or whatever it&#x27;s better! I&#x27;m considering buying a backup because I love it so much and for the price it&#x27;s totally non-negotiable. Xoxo</li>
            <li> Love the product and all the blush shade. Lose the brushes, and use your own.</li>
            <li> I love the color choices.  They go with every skin type and are very pigmented.  A little goes a long way.  The brush that came with it headed straight to the garbage can because there is nothing on earth you can use that for.  No big deal.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> When I received this package in the mail on se was completely destroyed.  The blush was coming out of the container and in the inside all the colors were mixed up.  I had to throw that set away!</li>
            <li> a gift its wonderful.</li>
            <li> COLORS ARE NICE BUT TOO CLOSE TO BEING THE SAME COLOR.</li>
            <li> I just received this the other day! Shipping was a lot faster than I expected, great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, and so many colors to choose from. If you don&#x27;t know what type of blush work on your skin tones. Then this is the set you want to get.</li>
            <li> I love this the colors blend beautifully</li>
            <li> I received this  product  in less than a week of ordering it, however, one of the blush kits was totally messed up.&lt;br /&gt;All of the blush had spilled out of the container, I really like the color. I guess I&#x27;ll work with the other two blushes.</li>
            <li> I totally love my blush  the variety of colors are awesome from light blush peach color Barbie pink I lub it :)</li>
            <li> As anyone who has used makeup well or has been taught anything in the application of blush and bronzer its about how you use something. THATS FIRST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd: these are very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd: they are a little powdery if you are a darker skin tone (Kelly Rowland) but still VERY useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th: great payoff, as in when you put your brush into the color. you only need to once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5th: I imagine if you have sensitive skin you may want to be careful again with how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6th: some are shimmery/glittery. some are matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7th and Final: these would also be great as eye shadows. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping was cool. they come in 2. not one single palette. but its good because it seperates shimmer/matte</li>
            <li> So happy with the quality of my purchase.  Very happy with this vendor</li>
            <li> What I received was not 12 different colors instead I received doubles of 6 colors. Terrible quality would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> they are really pigmented however the pallets that i got look every cheap not like the picture i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed. I received the blushes smashed. There was a mess everywhere. I was really looking forward to trying them out but they were too smashed to use.</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset about this product. Although it arrived somewhat like it&#x27;s supposed to.I was shocked to heck to see they did not look like the picture above. And to top it all of OMG,  they were almost the same...EXACT COLORS! But in itty bitty tiny squares lol</li>
            <li> The colors are darker than I thought they would be, but I like them anyway.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup and this is nice when I do.  I wish there would have been more pinks and red in here but I can still use them.</li>
            <li> Im black and brown shin. these colors show up so well on my face. i havent tried all the colors but the few i have look great on me.</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented blends well removed easily great colors for light to deeper complexions. Easy to use little fall out can be used for contour!</li>
            <li> These are very nice and true to quality and color. I was surprised to open and see two pallets instead of one long one as picture. But a bonus for that is its easier for travel! They&#x27;re some very nice colors on this set. Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I love this set of blushes. It looks like it is one palette of 12 but it is actually 2 palettes of 6. They apply really well and last all day. There are many different colors for different skin tones which is really helpful. I highly recommend purchasing this product if you are looking for a blush palette!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered them and one color was broken. They sent me another one which was awesome! Gave my mother the other palette. This works okay, it&#x27;s good not best but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it again just cause the product may look a bit sketchy not sure if it&#x27;s good for skin. :)</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors and looks very nice after applied</li>
            <li> Good for an olive type compexion. Too dark  for very fsir skin. Gave them to someone withthat</li>
            <li> I got different product</li>
            <li> There is not much I can say. I haven&#x27;t really played around with them. But when I did sorta play with them. They are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I really like it ! The colors are very pigmented and I use the light Beige to contour the colors are a bit creamy which I think helps them stay</li>
            <li> very pigmented and i use it almost everyday since i got it. i would recommend this to any girs who loves blush.</li>
            <li> All the colors of the pallet works really well with my skintone. it wasn&#x27;t really expensive, but it works just as well as a expensive item.</li>
            <li> A lot of different colors and they&#x27;re really good</li>
            <li> Love love love. Once I received the package one set was broken but they company did deliver another set. Love the service. Love the colors and the pigment. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I like this product the color are pretty the only downside some of the blush broke in delivery. But I like it the colors are nice and look good on me</li>
            <li> this did not look like the picture. I admit I was silly for ordering so many colors in the first place but the containers only have 4 colors and the container is bigger than my palm...</li>
            <li> Quality set with every color you can imagine. Great for testing and finding your right shade</li>
            <li> Used only a few colors, but good to have around.</li>
            <li> I will like to stat longer in my face, colors are asewome</li>
            <li> For the price you really cant go wrong.  Some if tue colors a shimmery which i font tend to use but even if inly 4 of the colors work..its worth it. I use it all the time for photo shoots. And the colors lasts and loks great.</li>
            <li> Love, love and love these colors. Smooth application and wears all day.</li>
            <li> really good  product especially for the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors in this pallet they work with any look that your trying to accomplish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, very please!</li>
            <li> This is some very very good eye shadow and i just love them and it smells so so good and i love the colors as well so i will deffently purchase more of these but in different other colors but i really do love this product thank you</li>
            <li> I love the variety of blush shades.  I actually select my blush shade based on my mood and there is so much to choose from - two cases provide double the pleasure! I was actually surprised at how large they were, so I got good value for my money.  The colors usually last the whole day, even with a light brushing.  I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great price, and great colors. We used f the Blush set for a stage production. It contains every color we need</li>
            <li> i use these for eyeshadows and blushes, i like the colors and a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> His makeup, I picked this out for him so he can have his own, he needs a lot of practice putting on makeup, Me an my girlfriends are coaching him and he&#x27;s getting better by the day. They are very pretty colors and the quality is alright till he gets better, this is a good choice for someone who is just starting out.</li>
            <li> The colors looks great but not on the face</li>
            <li> I love these blushes! They&#x27;re not only affordable but they&#x27;re also so pigmented. They came in such pretty packaging and didn&#x27;t come in broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I swatched them, it felt like I was touching silk. They are incredible! I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing! And they are so pigmented that you only have to dab your brush a little to get a lot of product. So it is lasting me a long time because I dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented color. Use a light hand when applying.</li>
            <li> They were okay...kinda makes me break out&lt;br /&gt;Cute colors though.&lt;br /&gt;also i don&#x27;t use the brush because they were flimsy.</li>
            <li> I love these blushes. I read several reviews before I received mine and everyone talked about how great the color payoff is and that they can be used on any skin tone. Both of those statements are true. They colors are a great variety of depths and tones that will truly compliment anyone and they are very pigmented. They did not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife. She just loved it.</li>
            <li> I do makeup as a career, and I&#x27;m constantly looking for good quality products. I came across this blush set and I love it! The pigment is outstanding and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the color that&#x27;s in the pallet.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, the colors do run out fast id you use them for theater or film makeup. for anything though it works wonders and the palettes are easy to store.</li>
            <li> it was just what I was looking for in blush  it had different shades for different make up I love it</li>
            <li> I advise every woman to buy this. it&#x27;s simple and nice. easy to apply and looks natural. I love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural colors .... powder silky very soft</li>
            <li> Just received and this is really quite nice.  I actually like the dual packaging - rather than one large one.  The colors are very different and I find myself experimenting!  This is a very nice product for the value and I would definitely re-order.  Deliver was quick and nothing was damaged.  I like it!  :)</li>
            <li> It was good for the price. It applies very nicely. It is two different treys which I liked, but I gave it only four stars because that&#x27;s not how it looked I. The picture.</li>
            <li> The actual product is actually pretty great, they have good pigmentation, nice colors, and a reasonable amount of product, the reason that I am only giving it 3 stars is because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.the brushes are way too small to be useful&lt;br /&gt;2.the mirrors are in a ridiculous and not very efficient place&lt;br /&gt;3. One of the containers was broken (major crack in the lid)&lt;br /&gt;4. Two of the blushes were busted (ironically, neither of them were in the broken container)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would probably recommend it based on the cheap price. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it is amazing</li>
            <li> Love all the colors!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap quality and very strong...it doesn&#x27;t smooth in with my akin</li>
            <li> I got this earlier than expected the colors are amazing too! Also, Great price!</li>
            <li> The colors and texture look great except they were mostly broken...although they return my money I wished they could of replace it with the warranties that this time they would be impeccable but I didn&#x27;t want to risk it..I do use like 4 that got saved. If they would bubble wrap twice I bet they make it intact.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this item was two sets of blushes, I loved the fact that it can work with any skin tone. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure but now I&#x27;m 100% sure.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package one of the containers of blush was busted into pieces. The items were very well packaged therefore, I do NOT think the seller caused the issue I believe it was from being tossed around at the post office.  I only hope if you order it that your post office does not toss it around.  I did not return this item because it was only one container of blush that was busted up and I cleaned it up and salvaged what I could of that color and it is fine...Not a huge issue for me.  Outside of that I LOVE the color&#x27;s and it applies evenly and smoothly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great blush to match any skin color.  It&#x27;s a good price and of great quality.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I must say I was very surprised about the size, it&#x27;s bigger than a quarter and bigger than a dollar coin.  The colors are absolutely wonderful and will complement any skin tone from fair to chocolate.  If you&#x27;re a women of color and are looking for the perfect peach and pink blush colors you cannot go wrong with these 12 beautiful colors.  For the summer you will have wonderful glow that is just right even for the winter.  So that&#x27;s another great deal that I was not expecting, I&#x27;m just glad I got 3 of them.  Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. these are professional size...just love it!</li>
            <li> These have a lot of natural colors that look great.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love these blushes. They are very pigmented and stay on all day. The set includes matte and luminous colors and the pots are a decent size. The value you get for the money is just amazing. I never tought to find such a great quality for such lower price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush set and recieved the 48 count eye shadow instead. Which are pretty colors but I would never order them because most of the colors are way to bold. Anyone else recieve something instead of this blush set?</li>
            <li> I was REALLY surprised at these blushes.  I originally bought them for my niece to experiment with.  For the price I assumed they would be sheer like tween budget makeup.  I could not believe hoe good they were.  Every bit as pigmented as my professional grade product and generous in size and color options.  I kept both for myself.</li>
            <li> In this case you get what you pay for. This is cheep kind of a ashy look not the best finish but it&#x27;s a good product for what it cost. Comes in two separate pieces and all colors are similar to each other. Because this is low pigment it doesn&#x27;t give you a ton of color but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> love it! one set comes in matte colors and the other in shimmer i boguht this to add to my MUA kit i havent gotten a chance to play with them but by running my fingers thru some colors they seem very pigmented. they kinda have like a creamy soft powderish feel. i love it and they came in VERY FAST!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE. :)&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Not as elegant as I imagined.  The colors are more orange than I could see.  The powder is cheap and dirty looking on my face.</li>
            <li> Colors r pretty,, some r shimmery and some r in Matt form.. They r just perfect for me,, I m very fair so all the colors look good on my cheeks ,, good quality and pretty colors :)</li>
            <li> The colors are very beautiful, but my stuff was broken,, all colors are excellent,, thanks,, but I need replace my blush set...</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful but they are very dark. No matter how you apply them I cant seem to get it right. This would be perfect for darker skin tones but im as pale as they come.</li>
            <li> For the price the product is good!  Seems to wear out quick, i guess i anticipated more for the buck!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  So true to color.  Throw the brushes out, they&#x27;re junk.  The price is unreal&lt;br /&gt;Cheap containers but I could care less.  I don&#x27;t care because I don&#x27;t travel with my make-up.  Seems to me it would break easily if dropped but I&#x27;ve no proof of that (thank God)</li>
            <li> Love love love these colors!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get so many colors of blush, but they look nothing like the pictures shown. I should have know that something so cheap would look like something you give to a 3 year old to play with. When I received the items they were practically falling out of the package. Which explains why one of them had broken, and blush powder had spilled over all of the containers. I don&#x27;t actually know how well the products work because I will be sending them back for new ones.</li>
            <li> i love makeup and i clearly love it</li>
            <li> Loved it, the only problem was one of the blushes broke during shipment</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what i wanted. Very happy with purchase and product</li>
            <li> This is a realy good buy for its price! I use one palet more then the other but out of all the other more expensive blushes I have I use this more!</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors and it compliments my beautiful brown skin tone!!!</li>
            <li> the colors are very neutral, looks like bare skin! I really like it!</li>
            <li> Super WOW !!!  Just awesome Colours ... Just Love all the Colours !!!</li>
            <li> first of all when i open my package the 1st of blush was crack ...i had about 3 pans that was all crumble into powder...I did not like the application of the product on me...the powder was to ashy on my skin....please do not waste you money on this blush set</li>
            <li> The colors are better than I thought they would be. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the idea that you can use one color as a contour and the other as a blush and it has many different shades for all skintones.</li>
            <li> there are many hard to find colors and at a great price</li>
            <li> very nice, great colors</li>
            <li> Luv Luv!! The the colors...</li>
            <li> Still doing its job, would buy again.</li>
            <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
            <li> I ordered these blushes and what came in the mail were three metallic eye shadow palettes? was so mad, because i was so excited to start using the blushes!</li>
