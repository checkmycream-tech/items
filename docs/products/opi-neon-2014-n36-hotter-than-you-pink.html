            <li>My new favorite polish!!</li>
            <li>The best pink polish ever.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best pink I&#x27;ve seen all summer!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is the perfect pink color!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try it because I hear such great things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if you went over it with a light coat of remover and just thinned it out.  </li>
            <li>This a wonderful everyday day color.</li>
            <li>This color is a nice, bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink, almost neon.</li>
            <li>Nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>is now my new favorite color!</li>
            <li>does dry a bit matte, but one good coat of top coat made my nails look</li>
            <li>I was excited about this color</li>
            <li>Fun color!</li>
            <li>Would recommend 2 coats for the full effect.</li>
            <li>Great summer pink color!</li>
            <li>Great, fun pink.</li>
            <li>Not exactly Neon summer color, but us still beautiful and a great summer color which can also be used year round.</li>
            <li>Hot Pink, how can that be anything but great?</li>
            <li>I rarely purchase nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun summer color.</li>
            <li>Nice polish but does normative gel with same name.</li>
            <li>So I like it, but I&#x27;m not crazy about OPI.</li>
            <li>When I went to use it for the first time, it was very clumpy and I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Good formula as with all OPI polishes, but this color is just neon enough to be different without looking cheap.</li>
            <li>I have other OPI bright pinks that are much brighter.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay color&lt;br /&gt;Got 4 bottles and 3 are Same  as picture.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the OPI Nail polish.</li>
            <li>Received many compliments on this color, especially on a pedicure in the summer</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but if you want neon you will be disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I saw the same polish and it looked and smelled a lot better than the one I ordered.  </li>
            <li>so its really pretty for summer when you have a tan.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 colors of this OPI polish and they are both clumpy and appear to be old!!!!  </li>
            <li>but when I used it wasn&#x27;t as bright and kinda dull.</li>
            <li>much better!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>who knows the real color?&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really ends up taking away from the vibrant-ness that the color was in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love OPI polishes,  I wanted a Neon Pink polish for my toes</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was as discribled</li>
            <li>Fast service...</li>
            <li>Love the color and it has just the right amount of iridescence to give it a little glamor.  </li>
            <li>High end brand of polish.</li>
            <li>I liked the color but when it dries it&#x27;s a dull finish not shiny.  </li>
            <li>Hot pink and fun.</li>
            <li>Got my nail color in a few days :)</li>
            <li>The white polish went on really smooth but dried super fast that it caused streaks.</li>
            <li>This polish is pretty BUT not as HOT pink as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had to put a top coat on for it to be shiny pink, I really like this pink color though.</li>
            <li>I finally ordered it through Amazon, for cheaper than the average OPI nail polish and with free shipping!</li>
            <li>Love the little shimmers of purple in this polish!!</li>
            <li>The nail polish seemed old.  </li>
            <li>It took 3 coats on natural nails and 2 coats on acrylic nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty hot pink sheer color.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink iridescent but dries matte.</li>
            <li>but it dries super dull and matt, not shiny</li>

            <li> Pretty pink iridescent but dries matte.</li>
            <li> but it dries super dull and matt, not shiny</li>
            <li> Long lasting!!!</li>
            <li> I expect this to at least last a whole week.</li>
            <li> : I recently painted it on my fingernails due recently.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.but when I put a top coat on it</li>
            <li> The color looked different than what I had seen in other pictures online.  </li>
            <li> Its not a creamy or flat color which I typically go for.</li>
            <li> bottle of this is a brighter neon looking pink</li>
            <li> On with Hotter Than You Pink.</li>
            <li> so I put three coats of pink on.</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t it&#x27;s still a bubble gum  pink</li>
            <li> I literally spent weeks looking for it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Also, color is not very shiny after it dries.</li>
            <li> The bottle was also uneven and would not stay on a flat surface without wobbling over.  </li>
            <li> Did not smell like other OPI polishes I have.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big negative.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m skeptical if this is the real deal</li>
            <li> very dull I am very surprise how dull the color is.  </li>
            <li> The white base also absorbed some of the pigment</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very dull after only three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not like this polish at all, very thin polish and a flat dull color when applied</li>
            <li> when you put it on it seems dull.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a big deal since I used it as a base coat, but after applying the pink polish you could see through it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a negative product review on Amazon before -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen an OPI dry with such a terrible finish</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in OPI</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> Love the color and it has just the right amount of iridescence to give it a little glamor.  Great color for the summertime!

You can see how bright the color is in the sunlight from my newest photos.</li>
            <li> Not the color I thought it was. Haven&#x27;t even used it.</li>
            <li> My favorite color by OPI</li>

            <li> Loved this nail polish!  Thanks!  Awesome color!!</li>
            <li> Three plus coats provides great spring and summer color.</li>
            <li> This color is a nice, bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink, almost neon. It&#x27;s a bit  iridescent too, and looks awesome! It took 3 coats on natural nails and 2 coats on acrylic nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on this color. It looks best with tanned skin. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it chipping either.&lt;br /&gt;It does dry a bit matte, but one good coat of top coat made my nails look gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;This is now my new favorite color!</li>
            <li> Love the color, perfect for summer</li>
            <li> Was not even close to being &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;. Had to apply 4 coats to look halfway good. Very disappointed in OPI</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay color&lt;br /&gt;Got 4 bottles and 3 are Same  as picture.&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle of this is a brighter neon looking pink and I like it much better!&lt;br /&gt;But who knows the real color?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; YOU DRIVE ME COCONUTS&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; IS NOT SAME AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR! So much so that I had to own it! I rarely purchase nail polish. It&#x27;s a fun summer color.</li>
            <li> OPI is the only polish I use and buy. I was excited about this color but when I used it wasn&#x27;t as bright and kinda dull. I have other OPI bright pinks that are much brighter.</li>
            <li> I liked the color but when it dries it&#x27;s a dull finish not shiny.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.but when I put a top coat on it was shinny so I made it work</li>
            <li> Love, love this color! Couldn&#x27;t find it locally! Yay, for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Nice polish but does normative gel with same name. See review I wroteforthat.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the OPI Nail polish. I thought I&#x27;d try it because I hear such great things about it. I didn&#x27;t like that when you put it on it seems dull. It&#x27;s not shiny. I had to put a top coat on for it to be shiny pink, I really like this pink color though. And also after two to three days the nail polish starts to peel off in big chunks. That&#x27;s a big negative. I expect this to at least last a whole week. So every three to fours days I&#x27;ll put one layer of a top coat on to revive the color and so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t start peeling off. So I like it, but I&#x27;m not crazy about OPI.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great summer pink color!</li>
            <li> This color is awesome!</li>
            <li> I do not like this nail polish. I love the color but it dries super dull and matt, not shiny and it really ends up taking away from the vibrant-ness that the color was in the bottle. I&#x27;ve never seen an OPI dry with such a terrible finish so I&#x27;m skeptical if this is the real deal or if it was tampered with by the seller. Buyer beware, I would not buy this nail polish if I were you</li>
            <li> Hot Pink, how can that be anything but great?</li>
            <li> I love OPI polishes,  I wanted a Neon Pink polish for my toes so I bought Put a Coat On with Hotter Than You Pink. The white polish went on really smooth but dried super fast that it caused streaks. I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a big deal since I used it as a base coat, but after applying the pink polish you could see through it. The white base also absorbed some of the pigment so I put three coats of pink on. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t mastered the art of neon nails but I still love the product!</li>
            <li> Great, fun pink. Love this color. Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> great color, great polish. Fast shipping was as discribled</li>
            <li> Received many compliments on this color, especially on a pedicure in the summer</li>
            <li> great color and great polish</li>
            <li> Love the color. Not exactly Neon summer color, but us still beautiful and a great summer color which can also be used year round.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT neon.  Pretty color, but if you want neon you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem, after three days it starts fading away.  Bizarre!  Never had that problem with nail polish before except for the OPI Neon Juice Bar Hopping.  (It&#x27;s not neon either.)  It&#x27;s as if you went over it with a light coat of remover and just thinned it out.  And it&#x27;s very dull after only three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this polish when I got a pedicure.  I cannot afford to get a pedicure every three days, so I will not be using this polish again.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink iridescent but dries matte.</li>
            <li> Great summer color.  High end brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  I&#x27;ve never written a negative product review on Amazon before - I purchased 2 colors of this OPI polish and they are both clumpy and appear to be old!!!!  Would never purchase again!!! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This polish is pretty BUT not as HOT pink as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Get so many compliments! Long lasting!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT summertime color, arrived quickly, packaged very well!!!! BIG HIT with ladies at the nail salon!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> The purple shimmer is amazing! This is the best pink I&#x27;ve seen all summer!!</li>
            <li> Perfect summer color or when you want a fun color</li>
            <li> Love the little shimmers of purple in this polish!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Received in perfect condition. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the color! Nice and vibrant. Would recommend 2 coats for the full effect.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. lovely colour!!</li>
            <li> Omg! Barbie watch out! This color has an irredescent shine which makes it greater. Have to buy more than 1 bottle. This a wonderful everyday day color.</li>
            <li> so happy I found this it was a great deal</li>
            <li> The polish had a very strong smell of paint.  Did not smell like other OPI polishes I have.  The color looked different than what I had seen in other pictures online.  When I went to Ulta I saw the same polish and it looked and smelled a lot better than the one I ordered.  The bottle was also uneven and would not stay on a flat surface without wobbling over.  Very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> Fast service...awesome product...thank you!</li>
            <li> Love color. Love product.the color is perfect for summer time. I find this brand lasts longer than others. Go, get your nails done.</li>
            <li> The color was not as &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; as I thought it would be. Nice color though!</li>
            <li> The best pink polish ever. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic,lasting, sexy color. I have made it my signature color. Looks great with a tan. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!!</li>
            <li> you would think Opi would have great neon color but they don&#x27;t it&#x27;s still a bubble gum  pink</li>
            <li> I tried this color at the nail salon and LOVED it! Its not a creamy or flat color which I typically go for. It actually has a pearly, sheen to it.. so its really pretty for summer when you have a tan. I literally spent weeks looking for it in the stores. I could not find it to buy anywhere! I finally ordered it through Amazon, for cheaper than the average OPI nail polish and with free shipping! Got my nail color in a few days :) Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Great neon color without being too bright!!</li>
            <li> Pretty hot pink sheer color. With several coats, no longer sheer. I got a pedicure with this color in a salon and loved the color, so I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> very dull I am very surprise how dull the color is.  you have to put on practically 3 coats to get a deeper color.</li>
            <li> Great color for summer!!</li>
            <li> Did not like this polish at all, very thin polish and a flat dull color when applied</li>
            <li> My new favorite polish!!</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and is the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fun color! Good formula as with all OPI polishes, but this color is just neon enough to be different without looking cheap.</li>
            <li> My wife says the color looks different online and when she got it, it looked different.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is the perfect pink color!</li>
            <li> Starts chipping off by the next day. Also, color is not very shiny after it dries.</li>
            <li> Nice not as bright as I would have liked but a great polish</li>
