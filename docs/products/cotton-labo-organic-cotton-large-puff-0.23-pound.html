            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for cotton suitable for vaping just buy the stuff already!</li>
            <li>but i love it!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s excellent for rewicking my Lemo and I won&#x27;t bother using anything else.  </li>
            <li>great cotton, fantastic price.</li>
            <li>100% amazing product for wicking rebuild-able atomizers.</li>
            <li>nicely aligned fibers.  </li>
            <li>Got this to try in place of Koh Gen Do which I also own.</li>
            <li>the flavor is so good and its better than cotton balls no need boiling it because its organic...</li>
            <li>I own a vape shop, and this is what I give customers to wick their rebuildables.</li>
            <li>the absolute best cotton for rda&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I make most coils on a 2.5mm mandrel and the thickness of these pads is pretty much perfect once the paper layers are stripped away.</li>
            <li>These are great and most importantly organic and non gmo.</li>
            <li>Great product fantastic price, shipped as stated  overall excellent deal.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have any taste!</li>
            <li>Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it for my RDAs/RTAs.</li>
            <li>Lasts me about a year, I use this for vaping and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will be a return customer :)</li>
            <li>Certainly better than any American/European cotton.</li>
            <li>To get the thickness of a KGD you would have to stack 3 or 4 of these pads, and then you&#x27;d have all those papery layers that make up the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>its way better than cotton in use this on my rebuildable atomizer...</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>The taste is nice and clean also.</li>
            <li>I love puff cotton and this was a pretty good price for it</li>
            <li>Good and fast delivery :-)</li>
            <li>Has its own distinct flavor, until it cures in your juice for a while, but most all wicking material does.</li>
            <li>but hey..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bag it comes in, resealable with a good lock to the seal, much like a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly - 14 days from order date to delivery.</li>
            <li>You will not believe the difference in the way your juice tastes, not to mention how easily it pulls through your coils.</li>
            <li>Major win all around.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Great deal on japanese organic cotton, quality item.</li>
            <li>using for wick in my RTA, works great and this is probably enough for the rest of the decade</li>
            <li>SUPER easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The original review is below for reference.  </li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>Clean taste and holds lots of joose.</li>
            <li>Burns my eliquid clean and without any taste</li>
            <li>The good news is, at $5.99 which included shipping, it&#x27;s no big loss.</li>
            <li>The quality is not bad, I would buy it again for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for cleanup: It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>.. wicks better than the bleached cotton and has a nice flavor when it starts to get dry,  </li>
            <li>It separates nice and evenly and wicks pretty decent, depending on your build.</li>
            <li>The price on the large size cotton is fantastic.</li>
            <li>the only thing is the shipping but its worth the wait coming from japan knowing that its really the good stuff...</li>
            <li>You found the right item, buy it.</li>
            <li>Very large quantity of organic cotton puffs.</li>
            <li>You could peel away the top and bottom layers and just stack the extremely thin centers, but it would take even more pads and be even more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>There is a good chance I will be passing this bag down to my children to re-wick their coils.</li>
            <li>this cotton pad are super soft!!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to provide first class wicking material for vaping.</li>
            <li>Plus this 120 pack is pretty much a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and decently packaged.</li>
            <li>That way, I utilize more of the product on one side, sometimes resulting in only having to cut one piece for two coils.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried Koh Gen Do, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s practically the same.</li>
            <li>So these thinner pads actually work out to be more convenient.   </li>
            <li>That guy has always tried to smell my bra with labo cotton in it ever since and now i am married to him.</li>
            <li>great for e-cig wicks, definitely tasted organic, ordinary cheap cotton balls will taste chemical</li>
            <li>For the price, a great quantity of quality stuff that will likely last you half a year or more.</li>
            <li>Easy to separate in the middle, and</li>
            <li>And this should last a good long while without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>No taste whatsoever and the convenience of the  precut squares makes rebuilding that much easier.</li>
            <li>well and doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to every girl!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It seems to wick very well, doesn&#x27;t contribute any off tastes that I can tell.</li>
            <li>I switched my rating to 5 stars as I actually really like these pads for wicking.</li>
            <li>Did I mention the product came in really fast. .</li>
            <li>That I feel, is an effective way to save a lot of product from going to waste.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well and for the price, I have a supply that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>no nasty burn taste or odd taste. .</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too, like two weeks early fast.</li>
            <li>for (mainly) vaping:</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend    </li>
            <li>It is clean, exactly the quality you could expect from a name brand such as Koga, and the pads are actually larger and a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>I prefer vaping on fresh cotton and change my wicks on my RDAs twice a day, once with standard cotton balls.</li>
            <li>Used as wick for my Magma and love it, will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Like when trying new flavors with a dripper, I replace the wick for each new flavor without thinking twice.</li>
            <li>Throw them in a small zip lock and toss them in with your build supplies to make rewicking fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Nearly indistinguishable from Koh Gen Do!</li>
            <li>It can divided into 5 pieces that is REALLY surprised me!</li>
            <li>The most common way to use this is to separate each pad into 2 pieces, which doubles your value.</li>
            <li>This is much larger than M, it works much better if you design with complex cotton builds and Thier Fast shipping makes it even Better!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and arrived sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li>Very absorbant, and resists dry hits.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a winner, and using it these past weeks (since I posted my original review)</li>
            <li>Secondly they are soft enough to use for makeup removal/toning on my ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I really like is I don&#x27;t mind &#x27;going through&#x27; this stuff as needed</li>

            <li> Used as wick for my Magma and love it, will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Like when trying new flavors with a dripper, I replace the wick for each new flavor without thinking twice.</li>
            <li> Throw them in a small zip lock and toss them in with your build supplies to make rewicking fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Nearly indistinguishable from Koh Gen Do!</li>
            <li> It can divided into 5 pieces that is REALLY surprised me!</li>
            <li> The most common way to use this is to separate each pad into 2 pieces, which doubles your value.</li>
            <li> This is much larger than M, it works much better if you design with complex cotton builds and Thier Fast shipping makes it even Better!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and arrived sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> Very absorbant, and resists dry hits.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a winner, and using it these past weeks (since I posted my original review)</li>
            <li> Secondly they are soft enough to use for makeup removal/toning on my ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I really like is I don&#x27;t mind &#x27;going through&#x27; this stuff as needed</li>
            <li> This package of cotton will be a life time supply of wicks for most vapers, seeing as how you will split the pad down the middle first before cutting it into strips for wicks.</li>
            <li> (Some people actually discard those as they don&#x27;t wick like the center.)</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t run out of my other Japanese cotton, I&#x27;d be returning this...</li>
            <li> All you Vapors out there that are tired of paying too much for Japanese cotton?</li>
            <li> I realistically expect this package to last me very close to a year, and that&#x27;s with changing wicks at least weekly if not more, in all three of the RDAs I&#x27;m currently using.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup pretty well according to my girlfriend and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any dust.</li>
            <li> I usually peel off a few layers of it and set them aside from each new piece I use, building layer upon layer until I have enough to work with.</li>
            <li> Saw comparisons on reddit and elsewhere that it was the same thing, just a little thinner.</li>
            <li> Only downside it does take a few weeks to get delivered</li>
            <li> other cotton companies should take notice..</li>
            <li> what so ever other</li>
            <li> Not nearly as convenient as one, thick, fluffy pad like the KGD.  </li>
            <li> When threading, it does shed a little dust, but just blow it off your atty and you&#x27;re in business.</li>
            <li> With KGD it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> Very thick pads.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> (And even if you want these for what they are made for - cosmetic pads -  they still seem thin to me.)  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It works wonderfully as wicking for my RDA.</li>
            <li> No chemical taste whatsoever. No longer need to boil cotton. These are a dream for vapers.</li>
            <li> Switched from organic cotton balls from the local drug store to these.  I won&#x27;t be going back! If you&#x27;re looking for cotton suitable for vaping just buy the stuff already! No taste whatsoever and the convenience of the  precut squares makes rebuilding that much easier. I cut about 8 strips from each square. Throw them in a small zip lock and toss them in with your build supplies to make rewicking fast and easy. I do tend to go through this cotton faster than the standard balls. I prefer vaping on fresh cotton and change my wicks on my RDAs twice a day, once with standard cotton balls. Definitely recommend these to every vaper I know.</li>
            <li> This cotton is great for dripping. It separates nice and evenly and wicks pretty decent, depending on your build. The taste is nice and clean also.</li>
            <li> great cotton, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Great cotton at a great price. Love this stuff. Wicks well and doesn&#x27;t really have a flavor. And this should last a good long while without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product, for a great price. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Bought this organic cotton for wicking material for my vape gear. It works amazingly well and for the price, I have a supply that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I like it better than kami.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff. I love it for my RDAs/RTAs. SUPER easy to work with. Now if only I could keep the wife from using it for makeup.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to provide first class wicking material for vaping. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> 2nd bag I&#x27;ve ordered now. Lasts me about a year, I use this for vaping and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived very quickly - 14 days from order date to delivery. I will be a return customer :)</li>
            <li> Good quality. Just what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for E-cigs. Very absorbant, and resists dry hits.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for Ecig rda mods.</li>
            <li> The bag I received is torn open across the bottom.. If I hadn&#x27;t run out of my other Japanese cotton, I&#x27;d be returning this...</li>
            <li> Excellent wicking material</li>
            <li> Good and fast delivery :-)</li>
            <li> The best wicking material I have come across. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> 100% amazing product for wicking rebuild-able atomizers. Plus this 120 pack is pretty much a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li> Work great for vaping wicks.  Easy to separate in the middle, and nicely aligned fibers.  Nearly indistinguishable from Koh Gen Do!</li>
            <li> Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this cotton pad are super soft!!!  I can&#x27;t use toner as a facial mask without this product! It can divided into 5 pieces that is REALLY surprised me! Highly recommended to every girl!</li>
            <li> Unreal for RDA&#x27;s and you get a ton for the price definitely gonna buy again if I ever run out of cotton.</li>
            <li> Only cotton me and my boyfriend sill use for dripping!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Vapes awesome! If you are looking for some cotton for your RBA/RDA atomizer, then this is the stuff. Shipping was fast too, like two weeks early fast.</li>
            <li> What a difference. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome great flavor and vapor</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very large quantity of organic cotton puffs. Came quickly and decently packaged. The quality is not bad, I would buy it again for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for cleanup: It&#x27;s not bad. It removes makeup pretty well according to my girlfriend and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any dust. Very thick pads.&lt;br /&gt;Used for (mainly) vaping: Always cut it WITH the grain. That is, vertically, along the longest side. It seems to wick very well, doesn&#x27;t contribute any off tastes that I can tell. When threading, it does shed a little dust, but just blow it off your atty and you&#x27;re in business. For the price, a great quantity of quality stuff that will likely last you half a year or more. I usually peel off a few layers of it and set them aside from each new piece I use, building layer upon layer until I have enough to work with. That I feel, is an effective way to save a lot of product from going to waste. Also I like pulling it through until I have enough on my ends without having to cut one end off. That way, I utilize more of the product on one side, sometimes resulting in only having to cut one piece for two coils. I do wish they were a bit smaller in length so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to do that, but hey..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bag it comes in, resealable with a good lock to the seal, much like a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> The price on the large size cotton is fantastic.These are great and most importantly organic and non gmo.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, best wicking material I&#x27;ve come across for vaping. Haven&#x27;t tried Koh Gen Do, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s practically the same. Certainly better than any American/European cotton.</li>
            <li> Great deal on japanese organic cotton, quality item.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I switched my rating to 5 stars as I actually really like these pads for wicking. I make most coils on a 2.5mm mandrel and the thickness of these pads is pretty much perfect once the paper layers are stripped away. With KGD it&#x27;s so thick it always has to be thinned. So these thinner pads actually work out to be more convenient.   The other thing I really like is I don&#x27;t mind &#x27;going through&#x27; this stuff as needed, b/c it&#x27;s so inexpensive. Like when trying new flavors with a dripper, I replace the wick for each new flavor without thinking twice. And it wicks every bit as good as KGD. So for me it&#x27;s a winner, and using it these past weeks (since I posted my original review) changed my mind from caring that it&#x27;s a thinner pad than KGD, to preferring it *becasue* it&#x27;s thinner. The original review is below for reference.  **** Original Review ****  Got this to try in place of Koh Gen Do which I also own. Saw comparisons on reddit and elsewhere that it was the same thing, just a little thinner. It is way, WAY thinner, and therefore not comparable imo. To get the thickness of a KGD you would have to stack 3 or 4 of these pads, and then you&#x27;d have all those papery layers that make up the top and bottom. (Some people actually discard those as they don&#x27;t wick like the center.) You could peel away the top and bottom layers and just stack the extremely thin centers, but it would take even more pads and be even more of a hassle. Not nearly as convenient as one, thick, fluffy pad like the KGD.  Yes, the pads came from Japan (to me in the USA) and might have been somewhat compressed en route, but that KGD pad in the picture came to me from China... so, what can I say?  Imo KGD is way overpriced, so an alternative is needed. I just don&#x27;t think this is it. Will keep on hand for emergencies, but will continue looking. (And even if you want these for what they are made for - cosmetic pads -  they still seem thin to me.)  The good news is, at $5.99 which included shipping, it&#x27;s no big loss.</li>
            <li> its way better than cotton in use this on my rebuildable atomizer... the flavor is so good and its better than cotton balls no need boiling it because its organic... the only thing is the shipping but its worth the wait coming from japan knowing that its really the good stuff... overall i would recomend this if your into vaping...</li>
            <li> Great product, will recomend to friends. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product fantastic price, shipped as stated  overall excellent deal.</li>
            <li> Great price for an alternative to Koh Gen Doh at comparable quality. Used as wick for my Magma and love it, will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great for wicking your RBA.  You found the right item, buy it.</li>
            <li> All you Vapors out there that are tired of paying too much for Japanese cotton? Then buy this!!!  Just as good as KGD and I prefer over cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Vaping!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tugboat V2, Roughneck, Plumeveil V2, Cartel Cascada, Mutation X2, Doge V2, Atlantis, Kanger Sub ohm mini.</li>
            <li> its cotton pads. nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> Best cotton ever for mods.</li>
            <li> I own a vape shop, and this is what I give customers to wick their rebuildables. Works fantastically with no &amp;#34;new cotton&amp;#34; taste. Will continue to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..potato</li>
            <li> Best for vaping!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in My RDA for vaping and I have been very happy with how well it has worked.</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s great.  Clean taste and holds lots of joose.</li>
            <li> One of the easiest to work with of all cotton wicking material. Has its own distinct flavor, until it cures in your juice for a while, but most all wicking material does. If it&#x27;s cotton and it has no cotton flavor it probably has been bleached and you should stay away from it. A package of this stuff will last a chain vaper forever! The most common way to use this is to separate each pad into 2 pieces, which doubles your value. Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find koh gen doh. Have tried koh gen doh since and it is the same.</li>
            <li> Kick but Cotton for vaping</li>
            <li> using for wick in my RTA, works great and this is probably enough for the rest of the decade</li>
            <li> I use this cotton for wicking in my vaporizers. It is clean, exactly the quality you could expect from a name brand such as Koga, and the pads are actually larger and a bit thicker. I realistically expect this package to last me very close to a year, and that&#x27;s with changing wicks at least weekly if not more, in all three of the RDAs I&#x27;m currently using. For the price, it is simply no contest.</li>
            <li> the absolute best cotton for rda&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product is awesome wicking material for vaping! You will not believe the difference in the way your juice tastes, not to mention how easily it pulls through your coils. This package of cotton will be a life time supply of wicks for most vapers, seeing as how you will split the pad down the middle first before cutting it into strips for wicks. Throw out your cotton balls and buy this stuff..... you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used for vaping and it has no taste and is good quality</li>
            <li> This cotton is the best item ever. Sometimes I stuff these cotton into my bra when I want to impress guys. It works so well. They say I smell so organic and it turns them on. So get this cotton if you want to impress some guys who appreciate the smell of organic cotton. That guy has always tried to smell my bra with labo cotton in it ever since and now i am married to him. Now I want to file a divore with him because I ran out of money to buy the Labo cotton and now he doesnt want to be with me anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best cotton for making you Ecig wicks.</li>
            <li> great for e-cig wicks, definitely tasted organic, ordinary cheap cotton balls will taste chemical</li>
            <li> Perfection...other cotton companies should take notice..</li>
            <li> This is much larger than M, it works much better if you design with complex cotton builds and Thier Fast shipping makes it even Better!!&lt;br /&gt;Always got mine in about 5-7 days after purchase that included the weekend, I have bought again and will continue too, You&#x27;ll be Happy!!</li>
            <li> Great quality smooth and great to work with!</li>
            <li> I love puff cotton and this was a pretty good price for it</li>
            <li> Life time supply of vape cotton.  You can share some with the wife, though not for vaping.</li>
            <li> Great product. . Great for vaping in your rda.. wicks better than the bleached cotton and has a nice flavor when it starts to get dry,  no nasty burn taste or odd taste. . Highly recommend    Did I mention the product came in really fast. .</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s organic cotton and it&#x27;s awesome! Looks and feels the exact same as the waaaay more expensive waste of money stuff! Burns my eliquid clean and without any taste what so ever other then the flavor of the liquid! Very happy with this brand! And it&#x27;s enough to last a solid year even rebuilding coils once a day!</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me? This is the same price I have seen on e-cig shops for like 10 pads. There is a good chance I will be passing this bag down to my children to re-wick their coils.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and arrived sooner than I thought. Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Great for rda! Only downside it does take a few weeks to get delivered but i love it! Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> This cotton is the BEST wicking material. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have any taste! Vape on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chick so this serves a dual purpose for me.  First, it&#x27;s excellent for rewicking my Lemo and I won&#x27;t bother using anything else.  Secondly they are soft enough to use for makeup removal/toning on my ridiculously sensitive skin.  Major win all around.</li>
