            <li>Very happy to be saving money and will replace my brush head more often because of it.  </li>

            <li>The packaging was good.  </li>

            <li>Fit perfect.</li>
            <li>but again it is not as good as others I have purchased</li>

            <li>I was delighted thinking that Im saving $$$$.</li>
            <li>This was a really good buy.</li>
            <li>The quality is not as good as Clairisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>I would defenetly recommend this product, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly</li>
            <li>I bought these from Paz Generics, having had good luck with nonbrand clarasonic brushes before.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads are a good alternative for the price.</li>
            <li>These work just as good as clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>For the price these work just as good as the clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly, and work just like the OEMs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Good Quality..</li>
            <li>Good Price</li>
            <li>These were really good for my skin when I used it with organic exfoliating creams</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than the original ones by Clarisonic, yet they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly, and are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>great price which means you can change them out more often .</li>
            <li>Very pleased with these.  </li>
            <li>The price was great better than one brush for 25.00.</li>
            <li>Love the Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>If you want the best performance, spend the money for the original replacements, even though they cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly and has smoothed out my skin n texture very well!</li>
            <li>I had no problem with them fitting onto my Clarisonic brush!</li>
            <li>Great brushes, fits easily on my Mia 2.  </li>
            <li>Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li>just fine and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Considering these are a fraction of the price of Clarisonic manufactured brushes, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia 2 great and seem to work as effectively as the Clarisonic brushes I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Just kind of always ticked me off, to be honest.  </li>
            <li>okay but not as good as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>She took them out of the packaging and wrapped them nicely.</li>
            <li>nice to did item that fits my Clarisonic but</li>
            <li>but honestly I would buy again for the price.</li>
            <li>It was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>These are good quality, I like them and rate them as good or better than the original.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and a great price.</li>
            <li>Have experienced the wonderful joy of adult acne but also want anti aging protection from my products so I am not dried out and scaly!  </li>
            <li>The brush heads fit my Mia-2 cleaner perfectly and were much more economical than ordering replacement heads from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li>This product works great, fits right into clarisonic with no problem.</li>
            <li>almost as good as original clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the name brand, but work just as well and fit my Mia 2 perfectly!</li>
            <li>the first set was great and worked just like my clarisonic brushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought a twin pack and they are as good or better than the original brush head on my Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li>can tell its made at a very cheap place.</li>
            <li>Amazon reimbursed with good customer service quickly and into the trash</li>
            <li>For a generic replacement, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly on my clarisonic and truly do last 3 months.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fits my clarisonic :)</li>
            <li>The replacement heads makes the product more valuable.</li>
            <li>, really glad I gave them a try, I will be saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li>i love the quality and the price.</li>
            <li>These brushes can cost me more with the oem.</li>
            <li>Glad that I found these.  </li>
            <li>Much better price and work just as well as the named product one for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>what more can i ask?</li>
            <li>Clairsonic brushes are too expensive and Im glad there is a perfect match at a great price!!  </li>
            <li>Was so glad to save a ton.</li>
            <li>They vibrate and spin, most of the time but not all of the time.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing and better than paying more per brush</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit easily or nicely on my Mia 2.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad to have discovered these brush-heads.  </li>
            <li>Okay, but prefer the &#x27;brand name.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I prefer the acne brushes better.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad I found these because it means I don&#x27;t have to go</li>
            <li>These are my favorite</li>
            <li>I used them for about three months and my pores are looking more and more clogged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly glad I found an alternative to their pricey brush heads.</li>
            <li>Mine fits ok, but it doesn&#x27;t vibrate with the device.</li>
            <li>Probably a defect since others were doing ok on theirs?</li>
            <li>These brushes state that they will fit ANY device!</li>
            <li>love these...</li>
            <li>Why pay more for a brush with plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>but if you use the sonicare for a shorter period of time it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered them before and they seemed to have been better quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly on my Clarisonic Pro, and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these generic ones from the $25 heads.  </li>
            <li>Soft, perfect fit - can&#x27;t even tell the difference :)</li>
            <li>These were a way better deal than getting the replacements from Sephora or Ulta or even a Groupon deal.</li>
            <li>not compatible with the mia, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate appropriately.</li>
            <li>Glad to find this product</li>
            <li>The fit isn&#x27;t completely perfect, causing some extra noise when using the device, but the bristle rotation is just as good as the original brand-name heads.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve paid a good price for the original machine, why cheap out now?  </li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my clarisonic classic, but better than the original.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t find anything wrong with these brushes at all - they work great and feel wonderful to my skin.</li>
            <li>Save your time and skin-buy the original one!</li>
            <li>Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly in the machine.  </li>
            <li>The difference is these provide a bit more friction for a more noticeable clean feeling, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re perfect for the price, and gave me a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Very cool deal.</li>
            <li>I bought these despite some people saying they produced more noise or didn&#x27;t fit the cover.</li>
            <li>These really aren&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>I got the new brushes and they are amazing!  </li>
            <li>Better than the Original...</li>
            <li>Great product and price even better because its generic and you won&#x27;t even know</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these if you are looking for a good set of brush heads that are going to do the job just as well as the branded ones.</li>
            <li>These brushes cost far less than the name brand ones and fit my MIA perfectly and work great.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price I will buy again these work fine will use and buy more.</li>
            <li>Second, they fit right on perfectly!</li>
            <li>The heads are fine, except they start growing mold.</li>
            <li>gentle and really helps my skin stay beautiful</li>
            <li>These work just fine.</li>
            <li>but when you attach (they attach fine) and turn on, the heads don&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it does lock on and work fine, but once in a while</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>These work just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but you get what you pay for vs. the Clairsonic name brand.  </li>
            <li>and it worked fine).</li>
            <li>But still works fine.</li>
            <li>can attest that they look exactly the same and fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly...</li>
            <li>mine fit fine.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin like mine, it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Although these brush heads fit, once attached to the Clarisonic, it did not rotate.</li>
            <li>trash... didn&#x27;t fit the Clarisonic ARIA... and flimsy brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase these again, and even though the heads snap into place, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; fit, and I can use the unit.  </li>
            <li>Product fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li>Thank you making such a great product.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to fit.</li>
            <li>I got this generic brush heads from Sylvia&#x27;s Treasure and this brush heads are great quality.  </li>
            <li>They physically fit - although not as well as the brand name ones - but they vibrate the way the brand ones do - so using them was just like using a brush.  </li>
            <li>Such a great value over buying the brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li>All you hear is the buzzing sound from the Clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you have a Clarsonic Mia and think this is a cheap way to replace the heads think again.  </li>
            <li>agree with most users that the price difference was worth the try, but it&#x27;s going to take forever for the blemishes of this trial and error to disappear.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the fit for my Mia.</li>
            <li>these brushes will fit on the clarisonic mia 2.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic option for my mia ultrasonic cleanser.</li>
            <li>They fit my &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; clarisonic pro like a charm</li>
            <li>So I went cheap and got these instead of the replacements made by the manufacturer of the brush.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are fantastic, and a lot cheaper than the name brand.</li>
            <li>The Mia 2 works great now, with the generic head attached</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my skin, and don&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>There is a reason these are so cheap...</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and amazing price.</li>
            <li>It makes it much more economical way to change brushes every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>GREAT price point compared to the actual Clarisonic replacement heads</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes work great and terrific price.</li>
            <li>and you can tell they are cheaply made</li>
            <li>however, even though they fit, snapped in they way</li>
            <li>They look and fit just like the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li>Working great - this is my second order.</li>
            <li>I have had great luck with almost all purchases that I have made of generic items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>doesn &#x27;t fit the device</li>
            <li>No wonder why they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>But it is a good daily washer, better than just a washcloth.</li>
            <li>just as good as the big names just better priced</li>
            <li>I will be back for more of those! !</li>
            <li>The real ones are the way to go!!!</li>
            <li>These fit my original Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>One review had some silliness about the head not rotating smoothly like the original.  </li>
            <li>I put the on my Mia, and they didn&#x27;t quite feel like a good fit; when I turned it on, the brush barely vibrated.  </li>
            <li>This brush leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean without drying me out!</li>
            <li>The brushes are not equivalent to the original parts.</li>
            <li>I chose this as a lower cost alternative to the original heads.</li>
            <li>(math is fun!).</li>
            <li>These brushes are made of a harsher plastic, and not at all competible to the original Clerasonic once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They came in an original Clarisonic box with the protectors so I feel like I could give them as a gift.  </li>
            <li>then I put the original head on &amp; immediately felt a difference.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell the difference between these and the original ones.  </li>
            <li>, I have owned the original brushes also</li>
            <li>Buy the certified original.</li>
            <li>It works just like the original but way</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these for cheaper than the replacements at Macy&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>The brush head doesn&#x27;t seem as soft, but I prefer it because it exfoliates better!</li>
            <li>The price is right for a try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get what you pay for, this is a true statement is true for this item.</li>
            <li>Good quality for generic product.</li>
            <li>which is what my skin likes as it truly feels as if there is true exfoliation occuring.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement brush head for your Clairsonic device and don&#x27;t want to pay the full price for it, give these brushes a try.</li>
            <li>For that purpose they are a good substitute for your next replacement.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the mailene generic brush heads</li>
            <li>They are too soft to be effective</li>
            <li>First, they were packaged fine - NO problems.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It seemed as though every time I brushed the bristles against my palm, more and more fell off.</li>
            <li>Items came as described and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>I love them and I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li>However, they fit, they do the job and they are so much cheaper!  </li>
            <li>I have the very first Clarisonic model ever made, like 7 years ago (before the Mia).  </li>
            <li>Ever used the deep pore version from clarsonic so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but so far I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>They are not as good, not by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>These brush are very soft and fit my Clairsonic perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I could probably get them to fit as snugly as the real deal</li>
            <li>And I really don&#x27;t want to compromise my Mia experience with some rattle -y sound.</li>
            <li>Fit the Clarisonic, but very noisy compared to the brand name heads.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find something that would replace the regular Clarisonic heads as I always felt Clarisonic was ripping us off.  </li>
            <li>As a result I would use the brush twice in one sitting just to get that freshly scrubbed feeling</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with them fitting</li>
            <li>/&gt;So economical and affordable, compared to the name brand.  </li>
            <li>She experienced the same thing as far as it not vibrating after fumbling with getting it attached.</li>
            <li>I read the negative reviews before purchasing and figured for the price, I couldn&#x27;t lose much if they weren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li>Sure, technically they FIT on my Mia, but the brush head doesn&#x27;t vibrate at all.</li>
            <li>They cost per value is completely worth it here.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>these brush heads were not as soft or durable as the authentic clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really, really thrilled to report that I didn&#x27;t experience any of those issues when I used them to wash my face last night!</li>
            <li>They last longer and clean better</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t seem much like the original clarisonic ones.</li>
            <li>My two went right in the trash...</li>
            <li>returned right away.  </li>
            <li>right &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use these for a bit since I paid for them, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>love new brushes, and this makes it much cheaper, with no change in quality.</li>
            <li>Amazon did a quick refund and I&#x27;m satisfied with that but will probably stick with the Clarisonic site for future replacements.</li>
            <li>I use a Clarisonic Mia 2 and these brush heads are generally compatible (I&#x27;ve had an incident where one brush head had to be adjusted because it didn&#x27;t seem to be fitting</li>
            <li>these work perfectly, do the exact same job, and cost half the price.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think its a deal, because you will waste your money on this one then buy the original !!!</li>
            <li>I originally used the brush for normal skin.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my clarisonic, a very reasonable priced replacement.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall out, and it connected to my Clairisonic Mia2 just fine.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between this generic and the original clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have the clarisonic Mia and it fits fine, but in terms of the functionality, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s giving me a thorough cleanse because of the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>And the brushes felt fine as far as texture.</li>
            <li>When I found these, they certainly looked like they were worth a shot,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it until my brush started smelling funny.</li>
            <li>Comparable to the real thing!</li>
            <li>When I say the experience is off, the actual noise itself sounds like it does when the heads aren&#x27;t appropriately attached, and I know that&#x27;s the case because of the gap between the heads and the unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but they definitely don&#x27;t work like they should.</li>
            <li>I received a Clarisonic Mia 2 as a birthday present from my mom about a year ago, and as much as I loved it, I stopped using it a few months ago when I couldn&#x27;t afford more replacement heads.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to the authentic brush, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks exactly like the Clarsonic heads</li>
            <li>SO much better than paying $40 for the same brush at ulta.</li>
            <li>They looked the part and fit on the head, but the bristles were too soft, not what I would expect for something that claims to be &amp;#34;deep pore cleansing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just replaced my old brush and this fit my Mio 2</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I was hoping these heads would do more of a scrubbing than the regular heads that came with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Just like my Clarisonic but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize they were not the real ones!</li>
            <li>brussels fell off during first use.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this item at first, since it was not Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but these are wonderful!!</li>
            <li>This is the EXACT replica of the real deal!</li>
            <li>Exactly like the originals</li>
            <li>I have had problem skin for most of my life and the Clarisonic Mia and these deep pore cleansing brushes have solved the problem.</li>
            <li>So glad I found the generic ones.</li>
            <li>There were some comments they did not fit good but</li>
            <li>I feel like I got the same quality of clean from these brush heads as I did with the original Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>If I loosely set the brush head on the handle, it works fine; but as soon as I try to secure the brush head onto the Mia2, it stops rotating/</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s why you invested so much money in it to begin with, right?.</li>
            <li>part on a $150 name brand item?&amp;#34; Buyers beware as these are garbage and don&#x27;t work anywhere near as the original name brand pieces.</li>
            <li>For a generic set these really do what they are supposed to and although the brush heads are a little rougher than the original, they work great</li>
            <li>Fit my Clairsonic and much cheaper than re-ordering directly from the Clairsonic company.</li>
            <li>broke to keep my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li>the brand name brushes was that the plastic cap on these wasn&#x27;t as good as the official ones, which made replacing the brush a bit more difficult.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s extremely soft more like the sensitive head.</li>
            <li>Fit but did not work anything like they should barely moved!</li>
            <li>I have taken it off several times but it just doesn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Pretty much you get what you pay for you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>Not sure why others have, but for me it&#x27;s all good and will be what I use for replacements going forward.</li>
            <li>One &#x27;head&#x27; fit perfectly, the other was very hard to put on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They look just like the original ones, and snapped right on, but when turned on they just made noise and the brush wouldn&#x27;t move back and forth.</li>
            <li>The normal brush was better than this generic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;d switched between the brand-name acne and pore heads and preferred the acne model, I actually like these a lot more than I liked either of those models (still have to try their acne head, I initially avoided it because of a greater number of negative reviews in regards to the fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is evident that they&#x27;re not of the same quality as genuine Clarisonic brush heads--</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more hygienic since it&#x27;s not a big deal to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Other than these, I&#x27;ve only used the original sensitive brush head that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2 but to me, these are just as good.</li>
            <li>I compared these to the original that came with my product and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The generic replacements vibrate just fine</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia2 fine but the material is flimsy and too soft, would be fine for those with delicate skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li>The time from order to delivery was reasonable according to shipping chosen.  </li>
            <li>thanks guys.</li>
            <li>Wound up going to Sephora and buying the real Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than the clarsonic brand</li>
            <li>They feel like they&#x27;re securely fit, but they will stop movement shortly after turning it on.  </li>
            <li>considering how much they cost at Ulta for the name brand</li>
            <li>The price and quality of these are better than i expected - i had zero issues as some others have mention (i have the Mia2).</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t fit properly resulting in the brushes not rotating the way they where design</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an item that is just like the clairsonic.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the real deal</li>
            <li>I really advise you NOT to order and suck it up and order the Clarsonic heads.  </li>
            <li>only reason I can&#x27;t give this cheaper replacement 5/5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t perfectly fit my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem much softer and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues with fit or function; however after 2 months of use, my skin just isn&#x27;t responding the same as it has every since I began using my Clarisonic Pro and the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>and they do not move like the real brushes either.  </li>
            <li>I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal.</li>
            <li>and they are just like the real ones.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>No comparison to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I am coughing up the $ for the real thing.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>They still don&#x27;t really exfoliate, which I guess is not their purpose.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to smell &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; much faster than the name brand.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as the real ones</li>
            <li>They went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal.</li>
            <li>Buy the real ones, you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li>it really isn&#x27;t compatible.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this over the original as much cheaper and same performance</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original.</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone who has a clarisonic brush and who wears makeup to remove your makeup prior to using these brushes (or the original ones for that matter).</li>
            <li>After seeing this and verifying it by re-installing the original head I immediately boxed these back up and contacted Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better than not using a Clarisonic at all, but it&#x27;s really not using the brush to its full potential.</li>
            <li>they should, when I turned it on, they didn&#x27;t actually vibrate the way the original did.  </li>
            <li>I cannot compare this item to the OEM Clarisonic Deep Pore heads, but I do like these better than the OEM Normal and Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compatible in the sense that it fits onto the handle, but unless you operate the same as the original</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t have been ableto continue use of this pretty much life-changing device without these generic heads, and would have likely continued getting them even if they didn&#x27;t work quite as well (as long as they lasted just long enough to not be more expensive in the long-run), so I&#x27;m very happy to see that they really do just as good of a job!</li>
            <li>Bristles are limp compared to the original Clarisonic heads&#x27; and don&#x27;t clean the skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Upon first use I did notice a quiet but different buzzing sound that was mentioned by another reviewer, but I haven&#x27;t heard it again since that first use.  </li>
            <li>These heads work really well, though I agree that the bristles are slightly softer than the Clarisonic brand, so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I switched from sensitive skin brushes to these when they first came out.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t love them simply because they are a little stiffer than the original.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>They work as well as the Clarisonic ones I have previously purchased that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so clearly inferior that I am now ordering the real thing - save money and order the real ones.</li>
            <li>These may have slightly more stiff bristles than the brand name, but I just run them under hot water for a second and they soften right up.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the ones directly from Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li>Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product to use with my Clarsonic Mia which would save me from having to spend $25 per replacement</li>
            <li>why are those brushes so danged high???</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>and I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t quite Clairsonic quality and need to be replaced a little more often, but for the price I still come out ahead.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get Clarisonic</li>
            <li>They still work, just a little more abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li>I find the actual banner brand heads to be ridiculously overpriced so this product was great for me.</li>
            <li>Really cannot beat the price of these generics and so far, I have not seen any irritation or increase in blemishes as a result of switching over.</li>
            <li>They clear your face very well.</li>
            <li>A great replacement for the expensive brand name.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly the same, but obviously are not engineered the same since they fit is not as exact.</li>
            <li>no, I don&#x27;t mean the kind of jammin&#x27;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my machine as well as other brushes I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews that said they didn&#x27;t fit or vibrate, but I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>I had a new band name on in the box that I used to compare it to</li>
            <li>It vibrates out of place and taking it off almost damaged my new device.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not picky and can live with that, these are your ticket.</li>
            <li>The looked like new Clairsonic brushes.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my face feels very tender and my problem areas are bright red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit but not the same as the actual brand-name version.  </li>
            <li>The only difference is that the heads do not fit 100% the way they should do they kind of jiggle a bit.</li>
            <li>, it had to be snapped down, now it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a sceptic when it comes to generic replacements because so many of them don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the name brand brushes, even in my very old Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Cause the brush to rattle and make a very loud noise.  </li>
            <li>The fit is not right for a Clarisonic in the 1st place .</li>
            <li>Brushed work very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that two months later, I&#x27;m definitely going to get at least another two weeks out of this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about saving $, but only if the product delivers the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li>These work well as far as I can tell!</li>
            <li>These work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>This brush is a little stiffer, a little more course than the original Clarisonic brand pore brush.  </li>
            <li>I think the bristles on the head feel exactly the same as on the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li>it fits and works fine on my clarsonic and cost a lot less then</li>
            <li>First one broke after only a month.</li>
            <li>While they do fit the clarisonic brush, I&#x27;d guess roughly 40% of the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration is lost, essentially making the entire device 40% less effective.</li>
            <li>brush fits fine on my Mia2, but I think it fits too tightly, or</li>
            <li>The bristles on these are definitely not as stiff as the name brand.  </li>
            <li>They fit the Mia and do the job, I want them a little gentler though</li>
            <li>It works and feels just like the original brush head at half the price.</li>
            <li>SUPER ROUGH ON MY SKIN!</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t as clear as with the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used for several years.</li>
            <li>so far the density of the bristles on this type is my fav.</li>
            <li>The second set- not so much.  </li>
            <li>They cost 1/4 of the cost and are nearly indistinguishable from the name brand.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I do not have terribly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However just received the real clarisonic deep pore brushes and they are NOTHING alike.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are to soft.</li>
            <li>Wow -</li>
            <li>so I asked my Wife to give it a try as far as removing and re-installing the head.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem rougher but they don&#x27;t vibrate the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is a problem since the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; part is what does most of the work to vibrate the gunk out of pores (at least, according to my esthetician).</li>
            <li>Even if they don&#x27;t last as long they are still cheaper in the long run even if replaced more often.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your time.</li>
            <li>This was easily fixed by just holding onto a official clarisonic brush cap and using that one instead.</li>
            <li>I no longer purchase the real ones and go with generic ones.</li>
            <li>It also has makes loud noise when the machine is on</li>
            <li>Wobble and make a loud noise when attached and running.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used and adored for several years.  </li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it is not making a complete connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They do the job but don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel different and for whatever reason make the buzz of the clarisonic much louder.</li>
            <li>The only difference that I can tell is that the bristles are more firm.</li>
            <li>I replaced them with other that I bought locally and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>After attaching the head I turn the unit on and noticed the center wasn&#x27;t moving and the unit was making a very strange vibrating sound compared to the normal brush.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, as replacements are not cheap.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t seem to fit on my Mia 2, so I removed carefully the inside of the generic deep pore cleansing head, and then removed the inside of the normal inside head of the one that came with the Mia 2.  </li>
            <li>They are a little stiff at first but get better so far I would buy again.</li>
            <li>They do not vibrate the same on your face (which must mean that they don&#x27;t fit properly on the brush), and they are super scratchy.</li>
            <li>I got the deep pore cleansing instead of the normal or sensitive skin models.</li>
            <li>These arrived and appeared to be of decent quality until I actually inspected them up close.</li>
            <li>the first time i used it a few bristles came out, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the real clarisonic heads work</li>
            <li>I would compare these deep pore bristles to the name brand normal brush head bristles.  </li>
            <li>The mia doesn&#x27;t run the same as normal with these brushes attached.  </li>
            <li>It is true that they do not fit with the plastic covers -</li>
            <li>these brush heads are a little more rough.</li>
            <li>I remember a while back one of the brush heads broke and without any questions, they sent me new ones.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to the real Clarisonic brush heads in the future.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what one of the 1-star reviewers was talking about - I have had the original Clarisonic brush heads and the bristles don&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li>It is easily half as less as much as the original Clairisonic brand head regardless of the setting.</li>
            <li>These fit a clarisonic Mia, and are less expensive, but the quality is eh, ok...</li>
            <li>Clearly, these are generic brush heads.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t feel remotely close to cleaning my face as the real brushes do.</li>
            <li>I tried three of them so far, with the same results.</li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks; I&#x27;ll be sticking to Clarisonic brand accessories for my Pro moving forward...</li>
            <li>2nd is the bristles on the head, they are so soft, never could they exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Although these are aupposed to be deep cleaning they are softer than the sensitive skin ones.</li>
            <li>I finally got it to line up after having the align the notches on the center portion first, then it allowed me to twist the head into place.</li>
            <li>Purchased these to replace my brush heads on my Clarisonic - not sure why anyone would pay full price for the brand name.  </li>
            <li>Works like the expensive kind</li>
            <li>They are a little more stiff than the originals, but then you won&#x27;t order these if you have sensitive skin anyway.</li>
            <li>, although these may sound a little funny in your device, they work just as well and last just about as long, meaning there&#x27;s not much reason to not give them a try!</li>
            <li>But when you put one of them in, you&#x27;ll notice that the fit is sloppy, and the bristles aren&#x27;t as high quality.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like these due to the value, but find them to be too abrasive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it was just a bit to much using it everyday.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the official replacement heads are a little two pricey for me, but I was willing to try these.</li>
            <li>They are clearly not made as well and the bristles aren&#x27;t as soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the deep pore cleansing brush heads and recently thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying the generic kind.</li>
            <li>i.e. wonky fit and loose brush fibers.  </li>
            <li>I actually needed something a little stiffer than these replacement heads, but they were so much cheaper</li>
            <li>I SO BADLY wanted these to be as good the Clarisonic brand...</li>

            <li> Very happy to be saving money and will replace my brush head more often because of it.  </li>
            <li> Great savings for what I consider to be just as good as the Clarisonic brand.  </li>

            <li> The packaging was good.  </li>

            <li> Fit perfect.</li>
            <li> but again it is not as good as others I have purchased</li>

            <li> I was delighted thinking that Im saving $$$$.</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy.</li>
            <li> The quality is not as good as Clairisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> I would defenetly recommend this product, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought these from Paz Generics, having had good luck with nonbrand clarasonic brushes before.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are a good alternative for the price.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> For the price these work just as good as the clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly, and work just like the OEMs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Good Quality..</li>
            <li> Good Price</li>
            <li> These were really good for my skin when I used it with organic exfoliating creams</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the original ones by Clarisonic, yet they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, and are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> great price which means you can change them out more often .</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these.  </li>
            <li> The price was great better than one brush for 25.00.</li>
            <li> Love the Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> If you want the best performance, spend the money for the original replacements, even though they cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly and has smoothed out my skin n texture very well!</li>
            <li> I had no problem with them fitting onto my Clarisonic brush!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fits easily on my Mia 2.  </li>
            <li> Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> just fine and feels great.  </li>
            <li> Considering these are a fraction of the price of Clarisonic manufactured brushes, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> They fit my Mia 2 great and seem to work as effectively as the Clarisonic brushes I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Just kind of always ticked me off, to be honest.  </li>
            <li> okay but not as good as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> She took them out of the packaging and wrapped them nicely.</li>
            <li> nice to did item that fits my Clarisonic but</li>
            <li> but honestly I would buy again for the price.</li>
            <li> It was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> These are good quality, I like them and rate them as good or better than the original.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a great price.</li>
            <li> Have experienced the wonderful joy of adult acne but also want anti aging protection from my products so I am not dried out and scaly!  </li>
            <li> The brush heads fit my Mia-2 cleaner perfectly and were much more economical than ordering replacement heads from the Clarisonic site.  </li>
            <li> This product works great, fits right into clarisonic with no problem.</li>
            <li> almost as good as original clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the name brand, but work just as well and fit my Mia 2 perfectly!</li>
            <li> the first set was great and worked just like my clarisonic brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought a twin pack and they are as good or better than the original brush head on my Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> can tell its made at a very cheap place.</li>
            <li> Amazon reimbursed with good customer service quickly and into the trash</li>
            <li> For a generic replacement, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly on my clarisonic and truly do last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fits my clarisonic :)</li>
            <li> The replacement heads makes the product more valuable.</li>
            <li> , really glad I gave them a try, I will be saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> i love the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes can cost me more with the oem.</li>
            <li> Glad that I found these.  </li>
            <li> Much better price and work just as well as the named product one for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> what more can i ask?</li>
            <li> Clairsonic brushes are too expensive and Im glad there is a perfect match at a great price!!  </li>
            <li> Was so glad to save a ton.</li>
            <li> They vibrate and spin, most of the time but not all of the time.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing and better than paying more per brush</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit easily or nicely on my Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to have discovered these brush-heads.  </li>
            <li> Okay, but prefer the &#x27;brand name.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I prefer the acne brushes better.  </li>
            <li> I am really glad I found these because it means I don&#x27;t have to go</li>
            <li> These are my favorite</li>
            <li> I used them for about three months and my pores are looking more and more clogged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly glad I found an alternative to their pricey brush heads.</li>
            <li> Mine fits ok, but it doesn&#x27;t vibrate with the device.</li>
            <li> Probably a defect since others were doing ok on theirs?</li>
            <li> These brushes state that they will fit ANY device!</li>
            <li> love these...</li>
            <li> Why pay more for a brush with plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> but if you use the sonicare for a shorter period of time it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them before and they seemed to have been better quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Clarisonic Pro, and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these generic ones from the $25 heads.  </li>
            <li> Soft, perfect fit - can&#x27;t even tell the difference :)</li>
            <li> These were a way better deal than getting the replacements from Sephora or Ulta or even a Groupon deal.</li>
            <li> not compatible with the mia, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate appropriately.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product</li>
            <li> The fit isn&#x27;t completely perfect, causing some extra noise when using the device, but the bristle rotation is just as good as the original brand-name heads.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve paid a good price for the original machine, why cheap out now?  </li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my clarisonic classic, but better than the original.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t find anything wrong with these brushes at all - they work great and feel wonderful to my skin.</li>
            <li> Save your time and skin-buy the original one!</li>
            <li> Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly in the machine.  </li>
            <li> The difference is these provide a bit more friction for a more noticeable clean feeling, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re perfect for the price, and gave me a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Very cool deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these despite some people saying they produced more noise or didn&#x27;t fit the cover.</li>
            <li> These really aren&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> I got the new brushes and they are amazing!  </li>
            <li> Better than the Original...</li>
            <li> Great product and price even better because its generic and you won&#x27;t even know</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these if you are looking for a good set of brush heads that are going to do the job just as well as the branded ones.</li>
            <li> These brushes cost far less than the name brand ones and fit my MIA perfectly and work great.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price I will buy again these work fine will use and buy more.</li>
            <li> Second, they fit right on perfectly!</li>
            <li> The heads are fine, except they start growing mold.</li>
            <li> gentle and really helps my skin stay beautiful</li>
            <li> These work just fine.</li>
            <li> but when you attach (they attach fine) and turn on, the heads don&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does lock on and work fine, but once in a while</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> These work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but you get what you pay for vs. the Clairsonic name brand.  </li>
            <li> and it worked fine).</li>
            <li> But still works fine.</li>
            <li> can attest that they look exactly the same and fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly...</li>
            <li> mine fit fine.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin like mine, it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Although these brush heads fit, once attached to the Clarisonic, it did not rotate.</li>
            <li> trash... didn&#x27;t fit the Clarisonic ARIA... and flimsy brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase these again, and even though the heads snap into place, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; fit, and I can use the unit.  </li>
            <li> Product fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li> Thank you making such a great product.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to fit.</li>
            <li> I got this generic brush heads from Sylvia&#x27;s Treasure and this brush heads are great quality.  </li>
            <li> They physically fit - although not as well as the brand name ones - but they vibrate the way the brand ones do - so using them was just like using a brush.  </li>
            <li> Such a great value over buying the brand name brush heads.</li>
            <li> All you hear is the buzzing sound from the Clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you have a Clarsonic Mia and think this is a cheap way to replace the heads think again.  </li>
            <li> agree with most users that the price difference was worth the try, but it&#x27;s going to take forever for the blemishes of this trial and error to disappear.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the fit for my Mia.</li>
            <li> these brushes will fit on the clarisonic mia 2.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic option for my mia ultrasonic cleanser.</li>
            <li> They fit my &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; clarisonic pro like a charm</li>
            <li> So I went cheap and got these instead of the replacements made by the manufacturer of the brush.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are fantastic, and a lot cheaper than the name brand.</li>
            <li> The Mia 2 works great now, with the generic head attached</li>
            <li> They are gentle on my skin, and don&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> There is a reason these are so cheap...</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and amazing price.</li>
            <li> It makes it much more economical way to change brushes every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> GREAT price point compared to the actual Clarisonic replacement heads</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes work great and terrific price.</li>
            <li> and you can tell they are cheaply made</li>
            <li> however, even though they fit, snapped in they way</li>
            <li> They look and fit just like the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> Working great - this is my second order.</li>
            <li> I have had great luck with almost all purchases that I have made of generic items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> doesn &#x27;t fit the device</li>
            <li> No wonder why they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> But it is a good daily washer, better than just a washcloth.</li>
            <li> just as good as the big names just better priced</li>
            <li> I will be back for more of those! !</li>
            <li> The real ones are the way to go!!!</li>
            <li> These fit my original Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> One review had some silliness about the head not rotating smoothly like the original.  </li>
            <li> I put the on my Mia, and they didn&#x27;t quite feel like a good fit; when I turned it on, the brush barely vibrated.  </li>
            <li> This brush leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean without drying me out!</li>
            <li> The brushes are not equivalent to the original parts.</li>
            <li> I chose this as a lower cost alternative to the original heads.</li>
            <li> (math is fun!).</li>
            <li> These brushes are made of a harsher plastic, and not at all competible to the original Clerasonic once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They came in an original Clarisonic box with the protectors so I feel like I could give them as a gift.  </li>
            <li> then I put the original head on &amp; immediately felt a difference.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell the difference between these and the original ones.  </li>
            <li> , I have owned the original brushes also</li>
            <li> Buy the certified original.</li>
            <li> It works just like the original but way</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these for cheaper than the replacements at Macy&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> The brush head doesn&#x27;t seem as soft, but I prefer it because it exfoliates better!</li>
            <li> The price is right for a try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get what you pay for, this is a true statement is true for this item.</li>
            <li> Good quality for generic product.</li>
            <li> which is what my skin likes as it truly feels as if there is true exfoliation occuring.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement brush head for your Clairsonic device and don&#x27;t want to pay the full price for it, give these brushes a try.</li>
            <li> For that purpose they are a good substitute for your next replacement.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the mailene generic brush heads</li>
            <li> They are too soft to be effective</li>
            <li> First, they were packaged fine - NO problems.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> It seemed as though every time I brushed the bristles against my palm, more and more fell off.</li>
            <li> Items came as described and shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> I love them and I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> However, they fit, they do the job and they are so much cheaper!  </li>
            <li> I have the very first Clarisonic model ever made, like 7 years ago (before the Mia).  </li>
            <li> Ever used the deep pore version from clarsonic so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but so far I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> They are not as good, not by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> These brush are very soft and fit my Clairsonic perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I could probably get them to fit as snugly as the real deal</li>
            <li> And I really don&#x27;t want to compromise my Mia experience with some rattle -y sound.</li>
            <li> Fit the Clarisonic, but very noisy compared to the brand name heads.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find something that would replace the regular Clarisonic heads as I always felt Clarisonic was ripping us off.  </li>
            <li> As a result I would use the brush twice in one sitting just to get that freshly scrubbed feeling</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with them fitting</li>
            <li> /&gt;So economical and affordable, compared to the name brand.  </li>
            <li> She experienced the same thing as far as it not vibrating after fumbling with getting it attached.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews before purchasing and figured for the price, I couldn&#x27;t lose much if they weren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li> Sure, technically they FIT on my Mia, but the brush head doesn&#x27;t vibrate at all.</li>
            <li> They cost per value is completely worth it here.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> these brush heads were not as soft or durable as the authentic clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really, really thrilled to report that I didn&#x27;t experience any of those issues when I used them to wash my face last night!</li>
            <li> They last longer and clean better</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem much like the original clarisonic ones.</li>
            <li> My two went right in the trash...</li>
            <li> returned right away.  </li>
            <li> right &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use these for a bit since I paid for them, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> love new brushes, and this makes it much cheaper, with no change in quality.</li>
            <li> Amazon did a quick refund and I&#x27;m satisfied with that but will probably stick with the Clarisonic site for future replacements.</li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic Mia 2 and these brush heads are generally compatible (I&#x27;ve had an incident where one brush head had to be adjusted because it didn&#x27;t seem to be fitting</li>
            <li> these work perfectly, do the exact same job, and cost half the price.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think its a deal, because you will waste your money on this one then buy the original !!!</li>
            <li> I originally used the brush for normal skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my clarisonic, a very reasonable priced replacement.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall out, and it connected to my Clairisonic Mia2 just fine.</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference between this generic and the original clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have the clarisonic Mia and it fits fine, but in terms of the functionality, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s giving me a thorough cleanse because of the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> And the brushes felt fine as far as texture.</li>
            <li> When I found these, they certainly looked like they were worth a shot,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it until my brush started smelling funny.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the real thing!</li>
            <li> When I say the experience is off, the actual noise itself sounds like it does when the heads aren&#x27;t appropriately attached, and I know that&#x27;s the case because of the gap between the heads and the unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but they definitely don&#x27;t work like they should.</li>
            <li> I received a Clarisonic Mia 2 as a birthday present from my mom about a year ago, and as much as I loved it, I stopped using it a few months ago when I couldn&#x27;t afford more replacement heads.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the authentic brush, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks exactly like the Clarsonic heads</li>
            <li> SO much better than paying $40 for the same brush at ulta.</li>
            <li> They looked the part and fit on the head, but the bristles were too soft, not what I would expect for something that claims to be &amp;#34;deep pore cleansing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my old brush and this fit my Mio 2</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these heads would do more of a scrubbing than the regular heads that came with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Just like my Clarisonic but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize they were not the real ones!</li>
            <li> brussels fell off during first use.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this item at first, since it was not Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but these are wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This is the EXACT replica of the real deal!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the originals</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for most of my life and the Clarisonic Mia and these deep pore cleansing brushes have solved the problem.</li>
            <li> So glad I found the generic ones.</li>
            <li> There were some comments they did not fit good but</li>
            <li> I feel like I got the same quality of clean from these brush heads as I did with the original Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> If I loosely set the brush head on the handle, it works fine; but as soon as I try to secure the brush head onto the Mia2, it stops rotating/</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s why you invested so much money in it to begin with, right?.</li>
            <li> part on a $150 name brand item?&amp;#34; Buyers beware as these are garbage and don&#x27;t work anywhere near as the original name brand pieces.</li>
            <li> For a generic set these really do what they are supposed to and although the brush heads are a little rougher than the original, they work great</li>
            <li> Fit my Clairsonic and much cheaper than re-ordering directly from the Clairsonic company.</li>
            <li> broke to keep my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> the brand name brushes was that the plastic cap on these wasn&#x27;t as good as the official ones, which made replacing the brush a bit more difficult.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely soft more like the sensitive head.</li>
            <li> Fit but did not work anything like they should barely moved!</li>
            <li> I have taken it off several times but it just doesn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews</li>
            <li> Pretty much you get what you pay for you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> Not sure why others have, but for me it&#x27;s all good and will be what I use for replacements going forward.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;head&#x27; fit perfectly, the other was very hard to put on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They look just like the original ones, and snapped right on, but when turned on they just made noise and the brush wouldn&#x27;t move back and forth.</li>
            <li> The normal brush was better than this generic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;d switched between the brand-name acne and pore heads and preferred the acne model, I actually like these a lot more than I liked either of those models (still have to try their acne head, I initially avoided it because of a greater number of negative reviews in regards to the fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is evident that they&#x27;re not of the same quality as genuine Clarisonic brush heads--</li>
            <li> I feel a lot more hygienic since it&#x27;s not a big deal to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Other than these, I&#x27;ve only used the original sensitive brush head that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2 but to me, these are just as good.</li>
            <li> I compared these to the original that came with my product and they are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The generic replacements vibrate just fine</li>
            <li> They fit my Mia2 fine but the material is flimsy and too soft, would be fine for those with delicate skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> The time from order to delivery was reasonable according to shipping chosen.  </li>
            <li> thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Wound up going to Sephora and buying the real Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the clarsonic brand</li>
            <li> They feel like they&#x27;re securely fit, but they will stop movement shortly after turning it on.  </li>
            <li> considering how much they cost at Ulta for the name brand</li>
            <li> The price and quality of these are better than i expected - i had zero issues as some others have mention (i have the Mia2).</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t fit properly resulting in the brushes not rotating the way they where design</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an item that is just like the clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the real deal</li>
            <li> I really advise you NOT to order and suck it up and order the Clarsonic heads.  </li>
            <li> only reason I can&#x27;t give this cheaper replacement 5/5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t perfectly fit my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem much softer and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with fit or function; however after 2 months of use, my skin just isn&#x27;t responding the same as it has every since I began using my Clarisonic Pro and the name brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> and they do not move like the real brushes either.  </li>
            <li> I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal.</li>
            <li> and they are just like the real ones.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> No comparison to the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> I am coughing up the $ for the real thing.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> They still don&#x27;t really exfoliate, which I guess is not their purpose.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to smell &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; much faster than the name brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the real ones</li>
            <li> They went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal.</li>
            <li> Buy the real ones, you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> it really isn&#x27;t compatible.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this over the original as much cheaper and same performance</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone who has a clarisonic brush and who wears makeup to remove your makeup prior to using these brushes (or the original ones for that matter).</li>
            <li> After seeing this and verifying it by re-installing the original head I immediately boxed these back up and contacted Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better than not using a Clarisonic at all, but it&#x27;s really not using the brush to its full potential.</li>
            <li> they should, when I turned it on, they didn&#x27;t actually vibrate the way the original did.  </li>
            <li> I cannot compare this item to the OEM Clarisonic Deep Pore heads, but I do like these better than the OEM Normal and Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compatible in the sense that it fits onto the handle, but unless you operate the same as the original</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t have been ableto continue use of this pretty much life-changing device without these generic heads, and would have likely continued getting them even if they didn&#x27;t work quite as well (as long as they lasted just long enough to not be more expensive in the long-run), so I&#x27;m very happy to see that they really do just as good of a job!</li>
            <li> Bristles are limp compared to the original Clarisonic heads&#x27; and don&#x27;t clean the skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Upon first use I did notice a quiet but different buzzing sound that was mentioned by another reviewer, but I haven&#x27;t heard it again since that first use.  </li>
            <li> These heads work really well, though I agree that the bristles are slightly softer than the Clarisonic brand, so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> I switched from sensitive skin brushes to these when they first came out.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t love them simply because they are a little stiffer than the original.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> They work as well as the Clarisonic ones I have previously purchased that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so clearly inferior that I am now ordering the real thing - save money and order the real ones.</li>
            <li> These may have slightly more stiff bristles than the brand name, but I just run them under hot water for a second and they soften right up.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the ones directly from Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li> Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product to use with my Clarsonic Mia which would save me from having to spend $25 per replacement</li>
            <li> why are those brushes so danged high???</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> and I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite Clairsonic quality and need to be replaced a little more often, but for the price I still come out ahead.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and get Clarisonic</li>
            <li> They still work, just a little more abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li> I find the actual banner brand heads to be ridiculously overpriced so this product was great for me.</li>
            <li> Really cannot beat the price of these generics and so far, I have not seen any irritation or increase in blemishes as a result of switching over.</li>
            <li> They clear your face very well.</li>
            <li> A great replacement for the expensive brand name.  </li>
            <li> They look exactly the same, but obviously are not engineered the same since they fit is not as exact.</li>
            <li> no, I don&#x27;t mean the kind of jammin&#x27;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my machine as well as other brushes I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said they didn&#x27;t fit or vibrate, but I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> I had a new band name on in the box that I used to compare it to</li>
            <li> It vibrates out of place and taking it off almost damaged my new device.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not picky and can live with that, these are your ticket.</li>
            <li> The looked like new Clairsonic brushes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face feels very tender and my problem areas are bright red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit but not the same as the actual brand-name version.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is that the heads do not fit 100% the way they should do they kind of jiggle a bit.</li>
            <li> , it had to be snapped down, now it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a sceptic when it comes to generic replacements because so many of them don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the name brand brushes, even in my very old Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Cause the brush to rattle and make a very loud noise.  </li>
            <li> The fit is not right for a Clarisonic in the 1st place .</li>
            <li> Brushed work very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that two months later, I&#x27;m definitely going to get at least another two weeks out of this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about saving $, but only if the product delivers the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> These work well as far as I can tell!</li>
            <li> These work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> This brush is a little stiffer, a little more course than the original Clarisonic brand pore brush.  </li>
            <li> I think the bristles on the head feel exactly the same as on the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> it fits and works fine on my clarsonic and cost a lot less then</li>
            <li> First one broke after only a month.</li>
            <li> While they do fit the clarisonic brush, I&#x27;d guess roughly 40% of the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration is lost, essentially making the entire device 40% less effective.</li>
            <li> brush fits fine on my Mia2, but I think it fits too tightly, or</li>
            <li> The bristles on these are definitely not as stiff as the name brand.  </li>
            <li> They fit the Mia and do the job, I want them a little gentler though</li>
            <li> It works and feels just like the original brush head at half the price.</li>
            <li> SUPER ROUGH ON MY SKIN!</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t as clear as with the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used for several years.</li>
            <li> so far the density of the bristles on this type is my fav.</li>
            <li> The second set- not so much.  </li>
            <li> They cost 1/4 of the cost and are nearly indistinguishable from the name brand.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I do not have terribly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However just received the real clarisonic deep pore brushes and they are NOTHING alike.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are to soft.</li>
            <li> Wow -</li>
            <li> so I asked my Wife to give it a try as far as removing and re-installing the head.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem rougher but they don&#x27;t vibrate the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is a problem since the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; part is what does most of the work to vibrate the gunk out of pores (at least, according to my esthetician).</li>
            <li> Even if they don&#x27;t last as long they are still cheaper in the long run even if replaced more often.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your time.</li>
            <li> This was easily fixed by just holding onto a official clarisonic brush cap and using that one instead.</li>
            <li> I no longer purchase the real ones and go with generic ones.</li>
            <li> It also has makes loud noise when the machine is on</li>
            <li> Wobble and make a loud noise when attached and running.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used and adored for several years.  </li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like it is not making a complete connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They do the job but don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel different and for whatever reason make the buzz of the clarisonic much louder.</li>
            <li> The only difference that I can tell is that the bristles are more firm.</li>
            <li> I replaced them with other that I bought locally and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> After attaching the head I turn the unit on and noticed the center wasn&#x27;t moving and the unit was making a very strange vibrating sound compared to the normal brush.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, as replacements are not cheap.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to fit on my Mia 2, so I removed carefully the inside of the generic deep pore cleansing head, and then removed the inside of the normal inside head of the one that came with the Mia 2.  </li>
            <li> They are a little stiff at first but get better so far I would buy again.</li>
            <li> They do not vibrate the same on your face (which must mean that they don&#x27;t fit properly on the brush), and they are super scratchy.</li>
            <li> I got the deep pore cleansing instead of the normal or sensitive skin models.</li>
            <li> These arrived and appeared to be of decent quality until I actually inspected them up close.</li>
            <li> the first time i used it a few bristles came out, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the real clarisonic heads work</li>
            <li> I would compare these deep pore bristles to the name brand normal brush head bristles.  </li>
            <li> The mia doesn&#x27;t run the same as normal with these brushes attached.  </li>
            <li> It is true that they do not fit with the plastic covers -</li>
            <li> these brush heads are a little more rough.</li>
            <li> I remember a while back one of the brush heads broke and without any questions, they sent me new ones.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to the real Clarisonic brush heads in the future.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what one of the 1-star reviewers was talking about - I have had the original Clarisonic brush heads and the bristles don&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li> It is easily half as less as much as the original Clairisonic brand head regardless of the setting.</li>
            <li> These fit a clarisonic Mia, and are less expensive, but the quality is eh, ok...</li>
            <li> Clearly, these are generic brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t feel remotely close to cleaning my face as the real brushes do.</li>
            <li> I tried three of them so far, with the same results.</li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks; I&#x27;ll be sticking to Clarisonic brand accessories for my Pro moving forward...</li>
            <li> 2nd is the bristles on the head, they are so soft, never could they exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Although these are aupposed to be deep cleaning they are softer than the sensitive skin ones.</li>
            <li> I finally got it to line up after having the align the notches on the center portion first, then it allowed me to twist the head into place.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to replace my brush heads on my Clarisonic - not sure why anyone would pay full price for the brand name.  </li>
            <li> Works like the expensive kind</li>
            <li> They are a little more stiff than the originals, but then you won&#x27;t order these if you have sensitive skin anyway.</li>
            <li> , although these may sound a little funny in your device, they work just as well and last just about as long, meaning there&#x27;s not much reason to not give them a try!</li>
            <li> But when you put one of them in, you&#x27;ll notice that the fit is sloppy, and the bristles aren&#x27;t as high quality.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like these due to the value, but find them to be too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it was just a bit to much using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the official replacement heads are a little two pricey for me, but I was willing to try these.</li>
            <li> They are clearly not made as well and the bristles aren&#x27;t as soft.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the deep pore cleansing brush heads and recently thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying the generic kind.</li>
            <li> i.e. wonky fit and loose brush fibers.  </li>
            <li> I actually needed something a little stiffer than these replacement heads, but they were so much cheaper</li>
            <li> I SO BADLY wanted these to be as good the Clarisonic brand...</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft, original bristles were had a thick heavy texture to it</li>
            <li> do not have a delicate or sensitive skin normally, but this brush scraped my skin and left it red and rug burned in apparance.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that they are slightly more rough than the real ones, but not enough to where they are bad.</li>
            <li> They were cheap enough that I went out on a limb and tried them, but after using them for weeks, I&#x27;m going back to the expensive manufacturer brush.</li>
            <li> At any rate I put one on in 2 seconds flat and they do do not make anymore noise than the originals.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of adjusting to get in and out but for the price I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I got a little nervous seeing all of the negative reviews for these things - that they don&#x27;t fit, that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; -</li>
            <li> I received the black replacement brush heads for Sensitive Skin....</li>
            <li> The only way the heads move is if it is loosely attached to the Mia</li>
            <li> It was a little soft for me</li>
            <li> I also liked that the price was a lot lower than the brand name heads, but they shed really bad.</li>
            <li> Powerless, ineffective and cheap.</li>
            <li> fibers feel too plastic not soft</li>
            <li> What I have found is that the heads do not fit completely intact into the unit...</li>
            <li> After a short amount of use, the center bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> These really did seem to cleanse just as well, but considering the brand-name heads are $20 each and last 3 months, for this to be an actual deal I knew I needed to get at least a month and a half out of them</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using 1 time every other day, until your skin get&#x27;s used to it.  </li>
            <li> I am using all of the same products with the only change being these generic brush heads and my skin has reverted back to consistent painful cystic acne breakouts with an influx of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money, they do not fit properly on the Clarisonic Mia 2.  </li>
            <li> But for me, that doesn&#x27;t mean bad or good, just different.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to discern any difference in this brush and the more expensive ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a alarming amount of loose bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li> just because the originals can be difficult to replace due to relatively high cost and frequent replacement.  </li>
            <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit onto the brushes unless they&#x27;re attached to the device, so half of the bristles were crushed under the caps, making weird indentations from where it wasn&#x27;t poking out of the holes.</li>
            <li> Since these are stiffer, they may last a little longer than the recommended 3-month change.</li>
            <li> They look a little different on the bottom but there is nothing I can see that would lead to it not functioning.</li>
            <li> The fit is a little weird too.</li>
            <li> It did not fit properly and returned them.</li>
            <li> I grew further anxious and annoyed when I first tried to put the head on my Clarisonic</li>
            <li> The center part of the brush does not spin like it should.</li>
            <li> I felt like a few of the bristles were coming out, but not enough to make you question buying it.  </li>
            <li> This generic brush head does not fit my Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Thru it away &amp; spent the money for a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I decided I would write a review either way so that other shoppers could make an informed decision as well.  </li>
            <li> would not recommend this to other buyers</li>
            <li> If you are an extremely picky person then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I pushed down on the center part and it seemed to start to vibrate.</li>
            <li> Once gain pressing down on the center got it to vibrate.</li>
            <li> Very rough on skin compaired to name brand.</li>
            <li> Within one use, the formerly crushed bristles straightened themselves out (albeit slightly frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , these feel a little rough on the skin</li>
            <li> A little bit rough</li>
            <li> I was hoping to save a buck, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> They are TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> They are TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel different but the worst part is that they don&#x27;t fit into the handle properly</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic but hate to buy the replacment heads.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are Horrible Horrible brushes  not even close to real Clarisonic brush heads,They do not vibrate the same on your face which means that they don&#x27;t fit properly on the machine , and they are super scratchy.</li>
            <li> I found that if I pushed down on the brush head it would start vibrating.</li>
            <li> As other reviews state it does not fit correctly.  </li>
            <li> but this was super rough, pulled on my face and was a little painful.</li>
            <li> They are SO rough that it feels like it&#x27;s rubbing your skin raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest just forking over the cash, or trying to find a gift voucher/Sephora discount so you can get a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> I do think they&#x27;re slightly rougher than the Clarisonic ones, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> In fact, the brush feels slightly softer than the Clarisonic version.</li>
            <li> packaging was a bit of a mess, I&#x27;ll admit.</li>
            <li> It seems to rattle and not be tight.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is a little tricky to get on, but once on it performs well.</li>
            <li> The packaging is two little boxes, the bristles were not smashed.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was surprised because they are SO much less expensive than the Clarisonic brushes, and they work.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the Clarisonic brand, but they don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> These work just like the name brand ones, but are far less expensive.</li>
            <li> The head didn&#x27;t fit completely tightly to the base</li>
            <li> Had little trouble at 1st</li>
            <li> They are a little difficult to get completely locked in</li>
            <li> I decided to try these out to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe they would soften up after a few uses but they haven‚Äôt.</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor fit and poorly made....</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Made me break out too harsh for my face maybe for washing dishes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> but alas I am going back to Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> These do not fit a clarisonic 2</li>
            <li> I feel as though the surface of my skin is cleaner and the dead skin is scrubbed away thoroughly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was concerned when people said that the stronger brush was harsh on the face and caused acne.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble attaching these heads to my brush.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my Wife while looking to save a few bucks over the Name Brand pieces.</li>
            <li> This item does not fit the Mia.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> But then it stops after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i had a terrible experience and needed to replace them much sooner than the real deal ones.</li>
            <li> After she told me I was pretty shocked.</li>
            <li> there is a small gap, unlike with Clarisonic heads.  </li>
            <li> Just like the name brand, if not better.  </li>
            <li> Brush head did not easily fit in place and broke when forced in.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I just ordered a name brand brush because I&#x27;m not satisfied with these.</li>
            <li> They are very harsh on the skin - not like the Clarisonic ones - which I have never had a problem with.  </li>
            <li> I have a claresonic and it constantly sticks/or the head gets stuck, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned the hard way</li>
            <li> They are also hard to screw into place.</li>
            <li> At least the two I purchased did, and still do.</li>
            <li> I have not had one moment of difficulty or negative experience with them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews foul you.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads every 3-4 months with a $25 head would mean paying an additional $100 per year on a product that I paid over $200 for.  </li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for buying SIX of these generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, thinking I&#x27;d save some money.</li>
            <li> No more flare ups every month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that everyone who thinks the Clarisonic is not worth the money is just using these lame brush heads...</li>
            <li> The bristles also seemed quite a bit softer, which I assumed would seriously hinder quality of cleansing and longevity.</li>
            <li> These are much less expensive than the Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> and this one was just a little rougher but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> not good quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Nothing has gone wrong with the product as of late.</li>
            <li> Purchased these replacement brush heads considering the dramatic price difference from the Clarisonic brand as well as the reviews that have been posted.</li>
            <li> Is a fake.</li>
            <li> They appear to click in to place, but are unable to engage the vibration mechanism.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutly no difference between those and the expensive clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s just random whether you&#x27;ll get brushes that work.</li>
            <li> They are just like the expensive ones for the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> it gets stuck and doesn&#x27;t move or it&#x27;s difficult to twist</li>
            <li> and they were too expensive to be mediocre.</li>
            <li> The others were just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> never again with these fake stuff</li>
            <li> but they are just way to expensive to keep up with.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t as expensive as the name brand</li>
            <li> the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Awful did not fit the headset</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I threw out the packaging and am unable to return them! :(</li>
            <li> I am giving this product one star because it is not what I ordered, not because it is bad quality.  </li>
            <li> I too purchased these brush heads because of the price hoping they wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as some reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> Do not buy :(</li>
            <li> If you are a clarisonic brush owner, try these brushes; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Worthless, I should have returned.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> I hated purchasing the replacement brushes because they just did not seem as if they were doing the job of exfoliating</li>
            <li> hated it....</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews on Amazon and have to say I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Nasty!!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used for several years. I decided to try these out to save a few bucks. They feel as though they are scratching my face. I thought maybe they would soften up after a few uses but they haven‚Äôt. I will be going back to the real Clarisonic brush heads in the future.</li>
            <li> For a generic replacement, I was very impressed. Will be ordering again when needed.</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor fit and poorly made....Amazon reimbursed with good customer service quickly and into the trash they go.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like these due to the value, but find them to be too abrasive. I may try a different type but will not repurchase the deep pore brushes.</li>
            <li> Is a fake. It were used.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly on my clarisonic and truly do last 3 months. You can&#x27;t beat the price or quality of product! I have really deep pores on my nose and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> These generic replacement brush heads do not properly lock into the head of the Clearsonic device.  They appear to click in to place, but are unable to engage the vibration mechanism.  It is a waste of money to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Brushed work very well!</li>
            <li> Although these brush heads fit, once attached to the Clarisonic, it did not rotate. Do not buy :(</li>
            <li> The packaging was good.  The time from order to delivery was reasonable according to shipping chosen.  This product works well with my Clarisonic.  I believe for the price it is a comparable  product.</li>
            <li> The heads are fine, except they start growing mold. I didn&#x27;t realize it until my brush started smelling funny. I looked in between the bristles and there was mildew. Nasty!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the performance.  The brush head is a little tricky to get on, but once on it performs well.</li>
            <li> what a great buy.. thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Very rough on skin compaired to name brand.</li>
            <li> Really deep cleans.  I would recommend only using 1 time every other day, until your skin get&#x27;s used to it.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it was just a bit to much using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the real thing!</li>
            <li> Better than the Original... Very cool deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this generic item and guess what it works just like the original&lt;br /&gt;very gentle and really helps my skin stay beautiful I recommend this over the original as much cheaper and same performance</li>
            <li> I have a Mia 2 and I just got the two brushes in the mail. First, they were packaged fine - NO problems. Second, they fit right on perfectly! I have to admit I was surprised because they are SO much less expensive than the Clarisonic brushes, and they work. I did turn it on and try it to make sure there were no &amp;#34;extra noises, etc&amp;#34; as some others mentioned but it&#x27;s perfect. NO complaints here.</li>
            <li> It goes onto the handle, but doesn&#x27;t vibrate. Wound up going to Sephora and buying the real Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these are definitely not as stiff as the name brand.  However, they fit, they do the job and they are so much cheaper!  I would compare these deep pore bristles to the name brand normal brush head bristles.  I gave them 4 stars because I did anticipate them being a bit stiffer, but I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Worthless, I should have returned.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work !</li>
            <li> Just like Clarisonic...for a fraction of the cost. Love it.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, and are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the clarsonic brand , these feel a little rough on the skin but they work well.</li>
            <li> Made me break out too harsh for my face maybe for washing dishes lol fibers feel too plastic not soft</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, just take extra care of your clinque brushes. Then you will not have to return these.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the Clarisonic brand, but they don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Fits my clarisonic :)</li>
            <li> Totally crappy! Stick with Clairsonic brand!</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a great deal.  They aren&#x27;t quite Clairsonic quality and need to be replaced a little more often, but for the price I still come out ahead.</li>
            <li> These generic brush heads don&#x27;t move the way the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; brush heads do, in my opinion. They were cheap enough that I went out on a limb and tried them, but after using them for weeks, I&#x27;m going back to the expensive manufacturer brush. If you have oily skin like mine, it makes a huge difference. These might be acceptable to you if you don&#x27;t need actual deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> trash... didn&#x27;t fit the Clarisonic ARIA... and flimsy brush heads.  My two went right in the trash...Live and learn</li>
            <li> The replacement heads makes the product more valuable.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not equivalent to the original parts. They are loud and do not oscillate well when put under minimal pressure again the skin.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find something that would replace the regular Clarisonic heads as I always felt Clarisonic was ripping us off.  Replacing the heads every 3-4 months with a $25 head would mean paying an additional $100 per year on a product that I paid over $200 for.  Just kind of always ticked me off, to be honest.  So i found these, read the reviews, and purchased the heads.  I have the very first Clarisonic model ever made, like 7 years ago (before the Mia).  What I have found is that the heads do not fit completely intact into the unit...there is a small gap, unlike with Clarisonic heads.  Can I use it?  Yes?  Do I use it?  Yes.  However, I have found that the experience is off, though the heads do vibrate, so I know I&#x27;m getting a deep, sonic, cleanse.  When I say the experience is off, the actual noise itself sounds like it does when the heads aren&#x27;t appropriately attached, and I know that&#x27;s the case because of the gap between the heads and the unit.  The bristles don&#x27;t feel the same, either.  But for me, that doesn&#x27;t mean bad or good, just different.  I will purchase these again, and even though the heads snap into place, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; fit, and I can use the unit.  But it&#x27;s a different experience.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these brush heads but I don&#x27;t think I will. They fit my Mia2 fine but the material is flimsy and too soft, would be fine for those with delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic but hate to buy the replacment heads.  This product works great, fits right into clarisonic with no problem.</li>
            <li> I like these, I don&#x27;t love them simply because they are a little stiffer than the original.  I had a new band name on in the box that I used to compare it to and this one was just a little rougher but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> okay but not as good as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I think these work just as well as the brand name, really glad I gave them a try, I will be saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> excellent product. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought these for my clarisonic mia.  They fit but not the same as the actual brand-name version.  The mia doesn&#x27;t run the same as normal with these brushes attached.  They look exactly the same, but obviously are not engineered the same since they fit is not as exact.</li>
            <li> Fits Clairsonic perfectly.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it met and exceeded expectation. Product fit my clarisonic the price is  great and arrived on time. Will order again and refer.</li>
            <li> It might be generic but it does the job without paying the big price. Thank you making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I would have given this no stars if I could. It did not fit properly and returned them.</li>
            <li> These do not properly lock into the head of the device.  They feel like they&#x27;re securely fit, but they will stop movement shortly after turning it on.  It vibrates out of place and taking it off almost damaged my new device.</li>
            <li> I edited the review because I hadn&#x27;t put the head on the Mia correctly, it had to be snapped down, now it works fine.  Great value for the money considering how much they cost at Ulta for the name brand</li>
            <li> I received the black replacement brush heads for Sensitive Skin.... But I ordered the blue replacement brush heads for Deep Pore Cleansing.  I am giving this product one star because it is not what I ordered, not because it is bad quality.  I cannot attest for the quality of the product, as I have not used it.  How can I get the correct item and have this issue resolved??</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are every bit as good as the Clarosonic brand.  I can tell no difference. Very happy to be saving money and will replace my brush head more often because of it.  Thank you, PAZ for making them!</li>
            <li> The price and quality of these are better than i expected - i had zero issues as some others have mention (i have the Mia2).</li>
            <li> It fits but you will have to force it in.  It will stop running for every 2-10 seconds. The brush is very coarse. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but they definitely don&#x27;t work like they should. While they do fit the clarisonic brush, I&#x27;d guess roughly 40% of the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration is lost, essentially making the entire device 40% less effective. I was hoping to save a buck, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I chose this as a lower cost alternative to the original heads. The heads don&#x27;t fit properly resulting in the brushes not rotating the way they where design</li>
            <li> When I used this item it felt like the brush was not doing anything. I had to go over my face with a wash cloth after. The normal brush was better than this generic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, this is a true statement is true for this item. ($14.99) for twin pack.</li>
            <li> great price which means you can change them out more often .</li>
            <li> Fit perfect. Had little trouble at 1st but they work and are alittle softer then the actual brand name. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> i love the quality and the price. so far the density of the bristles on this type is my fav.</li>
            <li> I also liked that the price was a lot lower than the brand name heads, but they shed really bad. At least the two I purchased did, and still do. The fit is a little weird too. I don&#x27;t plan to buy these again.</li>
            <li> These feel nothing like the Clarisonic Brand. But they will scrub the ever-loving-life out of your face.</li>
            <li> I received a Clarisonic Mia 2 as a birthday present from my mom about a year ago, and as much as I loved it, I stopped using it a few months ago when I couldn&#x27;t afford more replacement heads. When I found these, they certainly looked like they were worth a shot, probably my only hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was a bit of a mess, I&#x27;ll admit. The caps don&#x27;t fit onto the brushes unless they&#x27;re attached to the device, so half of the bristles were crushed under the caps, making weird indentations from where it wasn&#x27;t poking out of the holes. The bristles also seemed quite a bit softer, which I assumed would seriously hinder quality of cleansing and longevity. I grew further anxious and annoyed when I first tried to put the head on my Clarisonic and it didn&#x27;t seem to fit. However, after a minute of twisting and turning, it finally clicked in. The fit isn&#x27;t completely perfect, causing some extra noise when using the device, but the bristle rotation is just as good as the original brand-name heads. Within one use, the formerly crushed bristles straightened themselves out (albeit slightly frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern was longevity. These really did seem to cleanse just as well, but considering the brand-name heads are $20 each and last 3 months, for this to be an actual deal I knew I needed to get at least a month and a half out of them (math is fun!). I&#x27;m happy to say that two months later, I&#x27;m definitely going to get at least another two weeks out of this thing. Though I&#x27;d switched between the brand-name acne and pore heads and preferred the acne model, I actually like these a lot more than I liked either of those models (still have to try their acne head, I initially avoided it because of a greater number of negative reviews in regards to the fit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, although these may sound a little funny in your device, they work just as well and last just about as long, meaning there&#x27;s not much reason to not give them a try! I personally wouldn&#x27;t have been ableto continue use of this pretty much life-changing device without these generic heads, and would have likely continued getting them even if they didn&#x27;t work quite as well (as long as they lasted just long enough to not be more expensive in the long-run), so I&#x27;m very happy to see that they really do just as good of a job!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my machine as well as other brushes I have purchased.  It seems to rattle and not be tight.  I have taken it off several times but it just doesn&#x27;t fit right.  The price was certainly great but again it is not as good as others I have purchased</li>
            <li> I got this generic brush heads from Sylvia&#x27;s Treasure and this brush heads are great quality.  There is absolutly no difference between those and the expensive clarisonic brush heads. I will be back for more of those! !</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for buying SIX of these generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, thinking I&#x27;d save some money. If you&#x27;re used to the authentic brush, you&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference. These don&#x27;t feel remotely close to cleaning my face as the real brushes do. I tried three of them so far, with the same results. Save yourself some time and skip these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend $$$ on the brand name ones--these work perfectly, do the exact same job, and cost half the price. I will absolutely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of these I have bought- the first set was great and worked just like my clarisonic brushes.  The second set- not so much.  They are clearly not made as well and the bristles aren&#x27;t as soft.  I chose to buy a clarisonic over the cheaper brands of facial &amp;#34;cleaning/exfoliation&amp;#34; devices so next time I will go with brushes that I know are going to be nicer/softer/better.</li>
            <li> I switched from sensitive skin brushes to these when they first came out. Work well and I have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> Tried these as an alternative to the overpriced brand name brushes, but they didn&#x27;t work with my Mia2.  They physically fit - although not as well as the brand name ones - but they vibrate the way the brand ones do - so using them was just like using a brush.  Will switch back to the brand name ones.  Based on the mixed reviews I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s just random whether you&#x27;ll get brushes that work.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to replace my brush heads on my Clarisonic - not sure why anyone would pay full price for the brand name.  These are excellent!</li>
            <li> We got these for my wife and she was very happy with them. They cost 1/4 of the cost and are nearly indistinguishable from the name brand. My wife did say that the bristles were a bit stiffer but were not a bother. We&#x27;ll be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price I will buy again these work fine will use and buy more. These brushes can cost me more with the oem.</li>
            <li> I understand that these are generic replacement brush heads but they feel a lot scratchier than the clairsonic ones. They fit the Mia and do the job, I want them a little gentler though</li>
            <li> Good price and quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found these! Such a great value over buying the brand name brush heads. The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall out, and it connected to my Clairisonic Mia2 just fine. I feel a lot more hygienic since it&#x27;s not a big deal to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Glad that I found these.  Much better price and work just as well as the named product one for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> After a short amount of use, the center bristles fell out.  When removing make-up, it would build up in the bristles.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with the Clarsonic brand</li>
            <li> so happy with my brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush head for about a month now and it works just as well as the pricier Clarisonic version. I will definitely be ordering these again in the future.</li>
            <li> Other than these, I&#x27;ve only used the original sensitive brush head that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2 but to me, these are just as good. Really cannot beat the price of these generics and so far, I have not seen any irritation or increase in blemishes as a result of switching over.</li>
            <li> Fit my Clairisonic face brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Does the job - what more can i ask?</li>
            <li> Thanks for an item that is just like the clairsonic. Clairsonic brushes are too expensive and Im glad there is a perfect match at a great price!!  It fit perfect and works great Theresa</li>
            <li> These brushes are made of a harsher plastic, and not at all competible to the original Clerasonic once.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a delicate or sensitive skin normally, but this brush scraped my skin and left it red and rug burned in apparance.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so clearly inferior that I am now ordering the real thing - save money and order the real ones. They last longer and clean better</li>
            <li> These work just fine. Was so glad to save a ton. Have MIA 2. Recommendations say replace every 4 mos.</li>
            <li> I too purchased these brush heads because of the price hoping they wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as some reviewers stated. I am not sure what one of the 1-star reviewers was talking about - I have had the original Clarisonic brush heads and the bristles don&#x27;t rotate. The bristles on this brush head are soft without any rough edges. It clicked in place perfectly on my generation 1 Mia. I feel like I got the same quality of clean from these brush heads as I did with the original Clarisonic brush heads. The price is right for a try!</li>
            <li> great price for toothbrush replacement. Delivered and worked as advertised. Good quality for generic product. I would recommend it to others looking for replacement at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Love the Clarisonic! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Definitely not sturdy like the Clarisonic heads. The bristles are extremely soft. I&#x27;m all about saving $, but only if the product delivers the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brush heads for my Clarisonic to avoid the name brand price. I have a Mia 2 and they work well. It takes a little bit of adjusting to get in and out but for the price I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand off Groupon trying to save a bit of money. Box says PAZ, and I had already looked at this brand on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush fits fine on my Mia2, but I think it fits too tightly, or something - because the bristles don&#x27;t rotate. If I loosely set the brush head on the handle, it works fine; but as soon as I try to secure the brush head onto the Mia2, it stops rotating/vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear the noise of the Mia2 being on, but it doesn&#x27;t spin the head. These brushes don&#x27;t work for me, and they were final sale on Groupon. Anyone want them if it works for them?!</li>
            <li> They look just like the original ones, and snapped right on, but when turned on they just made noise and the brush wouldn&#x27;t move back and forth.</li>
            <li> These work well as far as I can tell! No need to spend all that money on the clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> These fit my original Clarisonic. They vibrate and spin, most of the time but not all of the time. My face isn&#x27;t as clear as with the Clarisonic brand. I tried to save money but alas I am going back to Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly on Clarisonic Mia for a fraction of the price. Girlfriend had no problems with texture of brush heads.</li>
            <li> Awful did not fit the headset</li>
            <li> These fit a clarisonic Mia, and are less expensive, but the quality is eh, ok... Better than nothing and better than paying more per brush.. I&#x27;ll be looking for a different generic when I&#x27;m done with these</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I actually needed something a little stiffer than these replacement heads, but they were so much cheaper -- I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.</li>
            <li> These do not fit a clarisonic 2</li>
            <li> SUPER ROUGH ON MY SKIN! I do not have terribly sensitive skin but this was super rough, pulled on my face and was a little painful. I ended up buying the real deal</li>
            <li> good product at a good price.  timely delivery..</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews on Amazon and have to say I am very disappointed.  I had high hopes for this product to use with my Clarsonic Mia which would save me from having to spend $25 per replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly like the Clarsonic heads but when you attach (they attach fine) and turn on, the heads don&#x27;t move.  All you hear is the buzzing sound from the Clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every which way to try to make this work and it does not.  The only way the heads move is if it is loosely attached to the Mia but then you cannot use as it would fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Clarsonic Mia and think this is a cheap way to replace the heads think again.  I really advise you NOT to order and suck it up and order the Clarsonic heads.  I have learned my lesson!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I threw out the packaging and am unable to return them! :(</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are just like the expensive ones for the Clarisonic. I just saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I bought these because the official replacement heads are a little two pricey for me, but I was willing to try these. I originally used the brush for normal skin. It was a little soft for me so I decided to try the brush head for &amp;#34;deep pore cleansing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are definitely coarser and stiffer. I feel as though the surface of my skin is cleaner and the dead skin is scrubbed away thoroughly. Unfortunately, my face feels very tender and my problem areas are bright red.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t feel this is any concern because after a minute the color is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned when people said that the stronger brush was harsh on the face and caused acne. I can&#x27;t say I experienced this since I haven&#x27;t noticed any change when it comes to acne when I use or don&#x27;t use my Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can&#x27;t give this cheaper replacement 5/5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t perfectly fit my Clarisonic Mia 2. Yes, it does lock on and work fine, but once in a while it gets stuck and doesn&#x27;t move or it&#x27;s difficult to twist in.&lt;br /&gt;For a knock off, it really impressed me.</li>
            <li> Great value. Always buy them</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem much like the original clarisonic ones. The bristles seem much softer and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Mine just arrived today and will be going back tomorrow. They don&#x27;t fit easily or nicely on my Mia 2. I could probably get them to fit as snugly as the real deal but that might involve some jammin&#x27; on my part and no, I don&#x27;t mean the kind of jammin&#x27; you do with your friends when everyone brought their guitars! ..And I really don&#x27;t want to compromise my Mia experience with some rattle -y sound. I like the existing Zen-hum of my Mia 2. Some days it is all the Zen I get! ....So I will do what I did last year - wait for that bi-annual 20% off everything coupon to you know what beauty store for women and stock up.</li>
            <li> these definitely do the trick.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that some of the bristles seem to be coming out.  Only a couple, but....</li>
            <li> Purchased these replacement brush heads considering the dramatic price difference from the Clarisonic brand as well as the reviews that have been posted. I will never make that mistake again!!! I didn&#x27;t have any issues with fit or function; however after 2 months of use, my skin just isn&#x27;t responding the same as it has every since I began using my Clarisonic Pro and the name brand brush heads. I am using all of the same products with the only change being these generic brush heads and my skin has reverted back to consistent painful cystic acne breakouts with an influx of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with most users that the price difference was worth the try, but it&#x27;s going to take forever for the blemishes of this trial and error to disappear. Thanks but no thanks; I&#x27;ll be sticking to Clarisonic brand accessories for my Pro moving forward...</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original. Bristles are too soft, original bristles were had a thick heavy texture to it</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the fit for my Mia. These work very well. Would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints.  These replacement heads work just as good as the brand.  I will definitely re-buy this item again.</li>
            <li> these brushes will fit on the clarisonic mia 2.  However just received the real clarisonic deep pore brushes and they are NOTHING alike.  They do not have the same feel or look to them and they do not move like the real brushes either.  Waste of money.  The real ones are the way to go!!! Lesson learned the hard way</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic option for my mia ultrasonic cleanser. SO much better than paying $40 for the same brush at ulta.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic. That said, I thought a brush was a brush ... but it&#x27;s not. If you set them side-by-side, they look identical. But when you put one of them in, you&#x27;ll notice that the fit is sloppy, and the bristles aren&#x27;t as high quality. If you&#x27;re not picky and can live with that, these are your ticket. If you want the best performance, spend the money for the original replacements, even though they cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> Awful. Doesn&#x27;t work on my clarisonic Mia. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are Horrible Horrible brushes  not even close to real Clarisonic brush heads,They do not vibrate the same on your face which means that they don&#x27;t fit properly on the machine , and they are super scratchy. I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal. They are TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the clarisonic skin brush for more than a few years and while I use it on occasion, I was never really thrilled about it. I hated purchasing the replacement brushes because they just did not seem as if they were doing the job of exfoliating and they were too expensive to be mediocre. As a result I would use the brush twice in one sitting just to get that freshly scrubbed feeling (I know this is not advised by dermatologists but I know what my skin likes and needs). I saw these generic yet compatible brushes for a lower price and decided if they were ineffective, I would not deplete my bank account. I am truly satisfied with these brushes. They fit my &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; clarisonic pro like a charm and they are a bit stiffer which is what my skin likes as it truly feels as if there is true exfoliation occuring. I would advise anyone who has a clarisonic brush and who wears makeup to remove your makeup prior to using these brushes (or the original ones for that matter). In that way the makeup will not stain your brushes, thereby leaving residue on your skin. If you are a clarisonic brush owner, try these brushes; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price there good. They are a little stiff at first but get better so far I would buy again.</li>
            <li> So I went cheap and got these instead of the replacements made by the manufacturer of the brush.  Won&#x27;t do this again!  These brushes wouldn&#x27;t even stay in, popped out.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my classic clarisonic fits perfectly, vibrates perfectly why pay more?üòç</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a sceptic when it comes to generic replacements because so many of them don&#x27;t fit properly. However brush heads work just as well as name brand.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are fantastic, and a lot cheaper than the name brand. I suggest you rotate them because that will help them last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference between this generic and the original clarisonic brush heads. The bristles are to soft. You have to push to feel it on the skin. The Clarisonic feels very different. You do not have to apply any pressure for the clarasonic to feel like its working. I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Wow - these work great.  So much cheaper than the ones directly from Clarisonic!  I have had no trouble with them fitting and they are just like the real ones.  It is true that they do not fit with the plastic covers - but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad to have discovered these brush-heads.  The others were just too expensive.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble attaching these heads to my brush.  Upon first use I did notice a quiet but different buzzing sound that was mentioned by another reviewer, but I haven&#x27;t heard it again since that first use.  These heads work really well, though I agree that the bristles are slightly softer than the Clarisonic brand, so I&#x27;m really glad I got the deep pore cleansing instead of the normal or sensitive skin models.</li>
            <li> As other reviews state it does not fit correctly.  Does not swivel the 10 or so degrees it&#x27;s suppose to move.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the name brand brushes, even in my very old Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fit my Clairsonic and much cheaper than re-ordering directly from the Clairsonic company.</li>
            <li> These brush heads don&#x27;t vibrate.</li>
            <li> Ii put these on my Mia and they don&#x27;t rotate, they just&amp;#34;hum&#x27;.  Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Okay, but prefer the &#x27;brand name.&#x27;</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I prefer the acne brushes better.  Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> I cant tell the difference.  Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly in the machine.  They came in an original Clarisonic box with the protectors so I feel like I could give them as a gift.  The savings is substantial.</li>
            <li> I connected this brush head to my clarisonic and it didn&#x27;t vibrate at all! nothing!  returned right away.  I guess going name brand is a must with these.</li>
            <li> Just like the pricey versions! My face can&#x27;t tell the difference. I definitely plan on buying these in the future.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to fit on my Mia 2, so I removed carefully the inside of the generic deep pore cleansing head, and then removed the inside of the normal inside head of the one that came with the Mia 2.  The Mia 2 works great now, with the generic head attached it didn&#x27;t seem to vibrate;  then I put the original head on &amp; immediately felt a difference.  So, I decided to switch the inside parts, and walla, it worked.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Clarisonic brush heads. I am really glad I found these because it means I don&#x27;t have to go broke to keep my face clean and clear. Oh and the customer service is good, too. I remember a while back one of the brush heads broke and without any questions, they sent me new ones.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  Have experienced the wonderful joy of adult acne but also want anti aging protection from my products so I am not dried out and scaly!  This works perfectly and has smoothed out my skin n texture very well! No more flare ups every month!</li>
            <li> No comparison to the real thing. They looked the part and fit on the head, but the bristles were too soft, not what I would expect for something that claims to be &amp;#34;deep pore cleansing&amp;#34;. Plus it only vibrated, but didn&#x27;t feel any cleansing sensation like the clarisonic brushes. I guess I get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my clarisonic classic, but better than the original. The price cannot be beat, please keep them coming.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So economical and affordable, compared to the name brand.  They are gentle on my skin, and don&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> Clearly, these are generic brush heads.  Comparatively, they are a good value.  It is evident that they&#x27;re not of the same quality as genuine Clarisonic brush heads--i.e. wonky fit and loose brush fibers.  However when you realize that you only paid $7.50/ea, it becomes acceptable.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Wife while looking to save a few bucks over the Name Brand pieces. These arrived and appeared to be of decent quality until I actually inspected them up close. There was a alarming amount of loose bristles on the brush. It seemed as though every time I brushed the bristles against my palm, more and more fell off. I attached it to my Wife&#x27;s Mia 2 and it didn&#x27;t want to line up at all. I finally got it to line up after having the align the notches on the center portion first, then it allowed me to twist the head into place. After attaching the head I turn the unit on and noticed the center wasn&#x27;t moving and the unit was making a very strange vibrating sound compared to the normal brush. I pushed down on the center part and it seemed to start to vibrate. I chalked it up to misalignment on my part so I asked my Wife to give it a try as far as removing and re-installing the head. She experienced the same thing as far as it not vibrating after fumbling with getting it attached. Once gain pressing down on the center got it to vibrate. I must have removed and re-installed it about 10 times and this happened each and every time. On the last attempted I paid close attention to the vibration amount. It is easily half as less as much as the original Clairisonic brand head regardless of the setting. After seeing this and verifying it by re-installing the original head I immediately boxed these back up and contacted Amazon for a refund. You get what you pay for and I agree with my Wife, &amp;#34;Why put a $14 &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; part on a $150 name brand item?&amp;#34; Buyers beware as these are garbage and don&#x27;t work anywhere near as the original name brand pieces. I will be replacing her&#x27;s with OEM parts only.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite</li>
            <li> Given my oily skin, these pads are a blessing. I just have to be disciplined enough to use them twice a day!</li>
            <li> A fraction of the price of the name brand replacement heads. Fits my clairsonic Mia great</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They clear your face very well. They are offered at fair price. I would recommend they brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my clarisonic, a very reasonable priced replacement.  I cannot tell the difference between these and the original ones.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews but I can&#x27;t say that I agree. The bristles seem rougher but they don&#x27;t vibrate the same as the real thing. This is a problem since the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; part is what does most of the work to vibrate the gunk out of pores (at least, according to my esthetician). I used them for about three months and my pores are looking more and more clogged. I am coughing up the $ for the real thing.</li>
            <li> These work just fine for me. I notice no discernable difference between the generic and the clarisonic originals. Even if they don&#x27;t last as long they are still cheaper in the long run even if replaced more often.</li>
            <li> I compared these to the original that came with my product and they are exactly the same. Save some money!!! Love them!!</li>
            <li> I SO BADLY wanted these to be as good the Clarisonic brand...just because the originals can be difficult to replace due to relatively high cost and frequent replacement.  They are not as good, not by a long shot.  They are very harsh on the skin - not like the Clarisonic ones - which I have never had a problem with.  Spend a little more money and get Clarisonic brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest that they look exactly the same and fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly...but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!</li>
            <li> Great savings for what I consider to be just as good as the Clarisonic brand.  I have the Clarisonic PLUS and this fits great and I see no difference in the quality.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my old brush and this fit my Mio 2 just fine and feels great.  I loved the price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these.  Great quality product.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought,  never again with these fake stuff</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the name brand ones for a quarter of the price of the ones sold under the clarisonic brand name. I can&#x27;t tell the difference. After using these with my clarisonic, I wouldn&#x27;t pay for the brand name ones again.</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated Clarisonic user for four or five years now. I usually use the deep pore cleansing brush heads and recently thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying the generic kind. These really aren&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic brushes. I&#x27;d suggest just forking over the cash, or trying to find a gift voucher/Sephora discount so you can get a slightly lower price. I&#x27;ll use these for a bit since I paid for them, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t feel as clean. It&#x27;s probably better than not using a Clarisonic at all, but it&#x27;s really not using the brush to its full potential. And that&#x27;s why you invested so much money in it to begin with, right?. I&#x27;m convinced that everyone who thinks the Clarisonic is not worth the money is just using these lame brush heads...</li>
            <li> I would not waste your time. They don&#x27;t spin on the head of your clairsonic. Bummer I know. why are those brushes so danged high???</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean without drying me out! Also tightens up pores. Fits perfectly on my clarisonic Mia 2. Definitely recommend to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Considering these are a fraction of the price of Clarisonic manufactured brushes, they&#x27;re amazing. They fit my Mia 2 great and seem to work as effectively as the Clarisonic brushes I used to buy. I&#x27;m incredibly glad I found an alternative to their pricey brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great product and price even better because its generic and you won&#x27;t even know difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are much less expensive than the Clarisonic replacement heads. They work great! I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was delighted thinking that Im saving $$$$. But no, the middle part of the brush pops out and doesn&#x27;t go back in. Didn&#x27;t get to use it even once! It was too good to be true! Save your time and skin-buy the original one!</li>
            <li> The perfect replacement brush heads for my Clarisonic! Much cheaper than the name brand, but work just as well and fit my Mia 2 perfectly!</li>
            <li> These work great on my Clarisonic. My cheaper than the name brand ones!</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads. They are SO rough that it feels like it&#x27;s rubbing your skin raw. They are also hard to screw into place. There is a reason these are so cheap...</li>
            <li> Items came as described and shipping was quick.  They work as well as the Clarisonic ones I have previously purchased that cost a lot more.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> great replacements, but not what I was hoping for. I was hoping these heads would do more of a scrubbing than the regular heads that came with my clarisonic. They still don&#x27;t really exfoliate, which I guess is not their purpose. But it is a good daily washer, better than just a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Looked to be refurbished with what appeared to be calico cat fur in one of the brush heads. Amazon did a quick refund and I&#x27;m satisfied with that but will probably stick with the Clarisonic site for future replacements.</li>
            <li> Just like my Clarisonic but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Fits my clarisonic pro perfectly. Fast shipment and amazing price.</li>
            <li> just as good as the big names just better priced</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail today.  They work the same way as the name brand ones.  I have. Ever used the deep pore version from clarsonic so I can&#x27;t really compare the two, but so far I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> A great replacement for the expensive brand name.  I would purchase again.  There were some comments they did not fit good but mine fit fine.</li>
            <li> These do not work with the clarasonic, the mechanism won&#x27;t turn with these on it.  Do not buy these please!</li>
            <li> The only difference I noticed between these and the brand name brushes was that the plastic cap on these wasn&#x27;t as good as the official ones, which made replacing the brush a bit more difficult.  This was easily fixed by just holding onto a official clarisonic brush cap and using that one instead.</li>
            <li> I had to return, these as they did not work, after I put them on, they did not spin! I have one of the originals clarasonic facial brushes that came out.&lt;br /&gt;Then after I sent them back, they charged me a restocking fee!&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend them at all!&lt;br /&gt;If they worked, would be a different matter.</li>
            <li> Works like the expensive kind</li>
            <li> I had asked my mother to buy me replacement brushes for Christmas and I ended up with these. She took them out of the packaging and wrapped them nicely. I didn&#x27;t even realize they were not the real ones! My mom told me about a month later. After she told me I was pretty shocked. I no longer purchase the real ones and go with generic ones. I agree with another reviewer that they are slightly more rough than the real ones, but not enough to where they are bad. I highly recommend these if you are looking for a good set of brush heads that are going to do the job just as well as the branded ones. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> brussels fell off during first use. (knockoff clarisonic)</li>
            <li> The center part of the brush does not spin like it should.</li>
            <li> These work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads for a fraction of the price!  Great buy and find!!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy.  It makes it much more economical way to change brushes every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I love new brushes, and this makes it much cheaper, with no change in quality.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the original ones by Clarisonic, yet they work perfectly. I do think they&#x27;re slightly rougher than the Clarisonic ones, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. This was a really good buy.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fits easily on my Mia 2.  I read other reviews that said they didn&#x27;t fit or vibrate, but I have had no problems.  I felt like a few of the bristles were coming out, but not enough to make you question buying it.  The packaging is two little boxes, the bristles were not smashed.  The looked like new Clairsonic brushes.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These brush are very soft and fit my Clairsonic perfectly fine. The price is awesome compared to the Clairsonic brand. Honestly, I don&#x27;t find anything wrong with these brushes at all - they work great and feel wonderful to my skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement brush head for your Clairsonic device and don&#x27;t want to pay the full price for it, give these brushes a try. I love them and I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> The price was great better than one brush for 25.00. The quality is not as good as Clairisonic brush heads. Pretty much you get what you pay for you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Anyone that has rated that theirs rattled it may be because you don&#x27;t have it locked all the way in. They are a little difficult to get completely locked in but once you do they are perfect. I will totally buy again.</li>
            <li> These work just like the name brand ones, but are far less expensive. I have not had one moment of difficulty or negative experience with them. Not sure why others have, but for me it&#x27;s all good and will be what I use for replacements going forward.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what i thought.</li>
            <li> Fit but did not work anything like they should barely moved!</li>
            <li> This generic brush head does not fit my Clarisonic Plus in a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; way.  It also has makes loud noise when the machine is on</li>
            <li> Mine fits ok, but it doesn&#x27;t vibrate with the device. Have to push it at some angle for that to happen. Probably a defect since others were doing ok on theirs?</li>
            <li> Works fine, but you get what you pay for vs. the Clairsonic name brand.  The head didn&#x27;t fit completely tightly to the base so it rattles a bit when you use it. Also, it seems to smell &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; much faster than the name brand.</li>
            <li> These work great with my Clarisonic brush at 1/3 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering again when in need.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads does not work at all.</li>
            <li> The seller is great---arrived on time, but these brushes are nothing compared to the Clairsonic brand name ones. Powerless, ineffective and cheap. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> almost as good as original clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic Mia 2 and these brush heads are generally compatible (I&#x27;ve had an incident where one brush head had to be adjusted because it didn&#x27;t seem to be fitting right &#x3D; wasn&#x27;t vibrating... took it off and put it back on and it worked fine). GREAT price point compared to the actual Clarisonic replacement heads but the feel is noticeably different- these brush heads are a little more rough. They still work, just a little more abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li> This item does not fit the Mia. Do not purchase if that&#x27;s your Clarisonic. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this item at first, since it was not Clarisonic brand.  I read some reviews and decided to go for it since it was relatively inexpensive.  I decided I would write a review either way so that other shoppers could make an informed decision as well.  I got the new brushes and they are amazing!  Just like the name brand, if not better.  And given the savings, I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing replacement brushes.  I will be purchasing them again as soon as it is time to replace my current ones!</li>
            <li> These brushes state that they will fit ANY device! I have a claresonic and it constantly sticks/or the head gets stuck, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes work great and terrific price.</li>
            <li> love these... they work wonders</li>
            <li> Why pay more for a brush with plastic bristles. THis totally doest the job!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the real ones</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all with our Clarisonic. The ultrasonic vibration didn&#x27;t come through except sporadically - tossed both heads away.&lt;br /&gt;Non-repeater.</li>
            <li> A little bit rough but if you use the sonicare for a shorter period of time it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> These brush heads have zero power. I&#x27;ve ordered them before and they seemed to have been better quality. I&#x27;m already breaking out because these brush heads probably have the same power as using my hands. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought a twin pack and they are as good or better than the original brush head on my Clarisonic Mia.  I read the negative reviews before purchasing and figured for the price, I couldn&#x27;t lose much if they weren&#x27;t the best quality.  One review had some silliness about the head not rotating smoothly like the original.  Well - the heads don&#x27;t rotate in the machine anyway - they vibrate. The generic replacements vibrate just fine and I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d measure any difference in cleansing.  These are good quality, I like them and rate them as good or better than the original.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews foul you. I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this product deserves 5 stars. It works and feels just like the original brush head at half the price. I&#x27;m buying another pack before the price goes up.</li>
            <li> the first time i used it a few bristles came out, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the real clarisonic heads work and you can tell they are cheaply made</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this generic Clarisonic brushes and I love them, I have owned the original brushes also but they are just way to expensive to keep up with. I would defenetly recommend this product, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought these despite some people saying they produced more noise or didn&#x27;t fit the cover. At any rate I put one on in 2 seconds flat and they do do not make anymore noise than the originals. I will buy these again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had them For 1 month-ish and not one problem.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, as replacements are not cheap. But after trying these I realize you get what you pay for. Sure, technically they FIT on my Mia, but the brush head doesn&#x27;t vibrate at all. What&#x27;s the point if it doesn&#x27;t massage &amp; exfoliate your skin? Not worth it, just bite the bullet &amp; buy the correct ones. They cost per value is completely worth it here.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;head&#x27; fit perfectly, the other was very hard to put on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think they rotate as well as the name/original Clarisonic brushes.  As someone else said, you get what you pay for!  I won&#x27;t be ordering them again.  We&#x27;ve paid a good price for the original machine, why cheap out now?  Lesson learned.  If you take care of your brushes, they last longer anyway.  Buy the certified original.</li>
            <li> not good quality. can tell its made at a very cheap place. would not recommend this to other buyers</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Clarisonic Pro, and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these generic ones from the $25 heads.  Unlike another reviewer, I&#x27;ve had no problems with it locking, spinning, or vibrating.  Quick delivery and a great price.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little stiffer, a little more course than the original Clarisonic brand pore brush.  No issues with function, seems to work the same.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great Price!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> nice to did item that fits my Clarisonic but isn&#x27;t as expensive as the name brand</li>
            <li> These heads work awesome. I can tell the difference in my skin already</li>
            <li> I bought these from Paz Generics, having had good luck with nonbrand clarasonic brushes before.  I put the on my Mia, and they didn&#x27;t quite feel like a good fit; when I turned it on, the brush barely vibrated.  Washing my face with this brush  on my Mia did  not feel much different than just washing my face with a non-vibrating brush.  Returned them, and Amazon refunded my purchase and told me to keep the brushes.  They went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are cheaper for a reason.  Complete waste of money, they do not fit properly on the Clarisonic Mia 2.  Cause the brush to rattle and make a very loud noise.  Would never buy them again, will only purchase Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Neither of them worked.  I replaced them with other that I bought locally and it worked fine.  These are defective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought this. It works just like the original but way cheaper so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The fit is not right for a Clarisonic in the 1st place . 2nd is the bristles on the head, they are so soft, never could they exfoliate. I did try it 3 times thing maybe?? No way. Thru it away &amp; spent the money for a Clarisonic. don&#x27;t think its a deal, because you will waste your money on this one then buy the original !!!</li>
            <li> As good as Brand name! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are a good alternative for the price. They are a little more stiff than the originals, but then you won&#x27;t order these if you have sensitive skin anyway. They are intended for deeper scrubbing. For that purpose they are a good substitute for your next replacement. Since these are stiffer, they may last a little longer than the recommended 3-month change.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; the fact I found these replacement brush heads at a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; for my Deep Pore Clarisonic Cleaner.  The brush heads fit my Mia-2 cleaner perfectly and were much more economical than ordering replacement heads from the Clarisonic site.  PLEASE continue to carry them!-RK</li>
            <li> I bought the deep pore cleansing brush head but it&#x27;s extremely soft more like the sensitive head. I have the clarisonic Mia and it fits fine, but in terms of the functionality, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s giving me a thorough cleanse because of the soft bristles. But then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The brush heads work just the same as the name brand! I had no problem with them fitting onto my Clarisonic brush!</li>
            <li> These work just as good as clarisonic brand. You won&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the mailene generic brush heads</li>
            <li> These may have slightly more stiff bristles than the brand name, but I just run them under hot water for a second and they soften right up. Works/fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you are an extremely picky person then this product is not for you. I am not, so it was perfect for me. I think the bristles on the head feel exactly the same as on the Clarisonic heads. The only difference is that the heads do not fit 100% the way they should do they kind of jiggle a bit. But still works fine. I find the actual banner brand heads to be ridiculously overpriced so this product was great for me.</li>
            <li> These are comparable as the ones made by Clarisonic. I din&lt;br /&gt;t notice any difference in brushes and could not tell them apart.</li>
            <li> The brush feels just like the Clarisonic model to me.  I think the price is a great incentive to try these.</li>
            <li> Wobble and make a loud noise when attached and running. Bristles are limp compared to the original Clarisonic heads&#x27; and don&#x27;t clean the skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these for cheaper than the replacements at Macy&#x27;s.. however, even though they fit, snapped in they way they should, when I turned it on, they didn&#x27;t actually vibrate the way the original did.  Like no vibration at all.</li>
            <li> it fits and works fine on my clarsonic and cost a lot less then the brand name one</li>
            <li> These brushes cost far less than the name brand ones and fit my MIA perfectly and work great. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> For the price these work just as good as the clarisonic brand. The brush head doesn&#x27;t seem as soft, but I prefer it because it exfoliates better!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but these are wonderful!! They look and fit just like the name brand brush heads. The only difference that I can tell is that the bristles are more firm. However, maybe I was used to my 6 month + (aka worn out) brush head that I replaced with these!&lt;br /&gt;For the price you cannot go wrong. I highly recommend this. What a bargain!</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the real Clarisonic brush heads, which I have used and adored for several years.  They do not vibrate the same on your face (which must mean that they don&#x27;t fit properly on the brush), and they are super scratchy. I returned these promptly and ordered the real deal. They are TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.</li>
            <li> hated it.... these brush heads were not as soft or durable as the authentic clarisonic heads. i had a terrible experience and needed to replace them much sooner than the real deal ones. i will stick to the name brand product.</li>
            <li> I have a mia 2 and the bristles don&#x27;t vibrate. Although these are aupposed to be deep cleaning they are softer than the sensitive skin ones. I&#x27;ll spend the extra on name brand. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> When I connected the brush head to my Clarisonic, it didn&#x27;t vibrate at all! Returning items immediately!!  Lesson learned: You can&#x27;t buy everything generic.</li>
            <li> They look like the Clarisonic heads but leave a lot to be desired. They do rotate, but not as well as the originals. They&#x27;re not finished with the same care, which resulted in the feeling that it was scratching my face a bit. Any because they come 2 to the package, I have 2 things I don&#x27;t like instead of one. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Brush head did not easily fit in place and broke when forced in.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare this item to the OEM Clarisonic Deep Pore heads, but I do like these better than the OEM Normal and Sensitive brush heads. They fit perfectly, and work just like the OEMs I&#x27;ve tried. The difference is these provide a bit more friction for a more noticeable clean feeling, at a fraction of the cost. Will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Too soft. They are too soft to be effective but honestly I would buy again for the price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, no problem.</li>
            <li> Soft, perfect fit - can&#x27;t even tell the difference :)</li>
            <li> So happy I found this product! This is the EXACT replica of the real deal! Yay for saving money!</li>
            <li> Working great - this is my second order.</li>
            <li> I had such hope for these. The generic prospect didn&#x27;t bother me. I have had great luck with almost all purchases that I have made of generic items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the MIA 2. And the brushes felt fine as far as texture. The head seemed to be put together well. But it didn&#x27;t seem to lock in place properly so they don&#x27;t vibrate. Why I turn it on there is no vibration. I found that if I pushed down on the brush head it would start vibrating. But then it stops after a few seconds. It&#x27;s almost like it is not making a complete connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have compared it to the &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; brush head I got them to replace. They look a little different on the bottom but there is nothing I can see that would lead to it not functioning. I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works just like the pricey Clarisonic brushes. Fits well, lasts awhile, and would buy again</li>
            <li> Exactly like the originals</li>
            <li> Did not work with my Clarisonic Mia 2.  The brush head did not rotate (gyrate) at all.  I know the brushes do not spin, but they do move and these generics did not move at all.</li>
            <li> Fit the Clarisonic, but very noisy compared to the brand name heads.  First one broke after only a month.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless. They don&#x27;t even move when turned on. Buy the real ones, you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for most of my life and the Clarisonic Mia and these deep pore cleansing brushes have solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I got a little nervous seeing all of the negative reviews for these things - that they don&#x27;t fit, that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; - but I&#x27;m really, really thrilled to report that I didn&#x27;t experience any of those issues when I used them to wash my face last night! In fact, the brush feels slightly softer than the Clarisonic version. They&#x27;re otherwise identical to the Clarisonic heads, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Clarisonic, I&#x27;m not paying through the nose for your overpriced brushes anymore! So glad I found the generic ones. Get these - you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive replacement heads for my Clarisonic Mia. These were a way better deal than getting the replacements from Sephora or Ulta or even a Groupon deal.</li>
            <li> doesn &#x27;t fit the device</li>
            <li> They do the job but don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the name brand. The bristles feel different and for whatever reason make the buzz of the clarisonic much louder. I just ordered a name brand brush because I&#x27;m not satisfied with these.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a groupon deal because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention that it was generic.  It&#x27;s terrible.  The bristles feel different but the worst part is that they don&#x27;t fit into the handle properly and therefore it doesn&#x27;t operate properly.  Save your money.  This is a bunch of junk.  It&#x27;s compatible in the sense that it fits onto the handle, but unless you operate the same as the original it really isn&#x27;t compatible.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good Quality.. Good Price</li>
            <li> For a generic set these really do what they are supposed to and although the brush heads are a little rougher than the original, they work great and I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> not compatible with the mia, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate appropriately.</li>
            <li> These were really good for my skin when I used it with organic exfoliating creams I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re perfect for the price, and gave me a deep clean feeling. Nothing has gone wrong with the product as of late.</li>
            <li> Terrible. No wonder why they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I am not able to discern any difference in this brush and the more expensive ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bravo ! Glad to find this product</li>
            <li> not the same but works if you&#x27;re on a budget</li>
