            <li>Love the way it works, it so time consuming</li>

            <li>I love how it&#x27;s tapered</li>
            <li>I really love this iron.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>

            <li>Love</li>
            <li>It works great, looks pretty, and it&#x27;s worth $30 for sure</li>

            <li>Makes beautiful curls that last.</li>

            <li>Gets very hot too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you are looking for a different type of curl or to for a &amp;#34;quick-</li>
            <li>I could do anyone elses hair with it because you need to precisely line up the hair between the spirals.</li>
            <li>so glad I found this and for such a good price to boot</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and gets very hot so makes beautiful curls in her naturally short hair.</li>
            <li>Fun to use!</li>
            <li>Find a full styling glove to use with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>this curling iron effectively straightened my hair rather than enhancing my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>Me and my best friend bought the same exact wand without knowing, and we both use it every single time we want cute curls or waves..</li>
            <li>Also, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>This was my very first curling wand...</li>
            <li>The wand gives a nice, unique wavy sort of curl that cant be made with an average curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They lasted all day with only a very light amount of hair spray.</li>
            <li>The spirals are really pretty, but you have to hold the heat on them for quite a while</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got using this styler.</li>
            <li>But it gets REALLY hot.</li>
            <li>First iron to hold a curl for her all day.</li>
            <li>I managed to curl my whole head for the first time without the glove and managed not to burn myself.</li>
            <li>Other than that it worked great and curls lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this curler.</li>
            <li>It was also much quicker than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I figured the ridges would help me as a guide until I was ready to try one without them.</li>
            <li>but I am still very attached to this one.</li>
            <li>Curler heats up extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in purchasing a new curling iron and came across this styler.</li>
            <li>I found that the actual iron does a great job on my straight, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to and its hard work having to hold the hair, but this was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li>Have to be careful when using because it easily turns off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural curl to it</li>
            <li>and I found that this product creates soft, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this curler for anyone wanting to have soft spirals.</li>
            <li>It keeps slipping off (my hands and fingers are average size) and it is still easy to singe the back of your hand.  </li>
            <li>Literally, the other type of curling wand that is just straight with not ribs, slides off of my hair.</li>

            <li> the curls lasted a lot longer than my normal curling iron with the same amount or less hairspray too</li>
            <li> (I have long, think hair so it may be different for others).</li>
            <li> but it was just impossible to do my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 13 year old so that she could add a little body (curls &amp; waves) to her hair.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to curl with this.</li>
            <li> normally I have to curl half and then wrap the other half</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived just like I expected, in the time I expected it to show up.</li>
            <li> but I believe thats due to holding spray</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the three finger heat-proof glove is a joke.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Didn;t curl my hair at all -- a big mess and burned my fingers even with the silly finger glove.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> so it makes it hard to unwind.</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have to use hardly any hairspray and</li>
            <li> The glove is really hard to keep on and gets in the way.</li>
            <li> The spiral around the wand prevents you from curling in both directions, or at least I didn&#x27;t take the time to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Her hair is way too thick for this utensil.</li>
            <li> I mean like 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is hottest at the base of the unit (which the instruction manual states) and this is the only place where you&#x27;ll see the curl form.  </li>
            <li> off/ folding over to the thin side.</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy a miracurl or conair curl secret.</li>
            <li> Glove was fairly useless too since it kept falling</li>
            <li> This wand thing was really difficult with the spirals.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is terrible.  </li>

            <li> This item was returned.  It was given as a gift and they said they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to hold the hair onto the rod.  It seems the rods with clips are much better.</li>
            <li> I found that the actual iron does a great job on my straight, thick hair.  My only complaint is that the three finger heat-proof glove is a joke.  It keeps slipping off (my hands and fingers are average size) and it is still easy to singe the back of your hand.  Find a full styling glove to use with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in purchasing a new curling iron and came across this styler. The spiral guide is excellent in helping to hold the hair to the clipless wand. This came with a three finger glove that I found cumbersome. I managed to curl my whole head for the first time without the glove and managed not to burn myself. My hair has a natural curl to it and I found that this product creates soft, natural looking curls. They lasted all day with only a very light amount of hair spray. I&#x27;m planning to give one as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 13 year old so that she could add a little body (curls &amp; waves) to her hair.  She doesn&#x27;t used it that often, but that&#x27;s no fault in the product.  It comes with a safety glove and an auto shut-off.  Those are nice features.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is terrible.  *  The \\&quot;heat protective glove\\&quot; that it comes with only covers 3 fingers and is only protective against heat on one side.  You need to be right-handed to use the glove.  I&#x27;m a lefty, so I am unable to use this product safely.  *  The on/off buttons are situated in such a way that you&#x27;ll hit them while you&#x27;re curling your hair.  *  After trying out the product, I found that it doesn&#x27;t curl hair effectively.  It is hottest at the base of the unit (which the instruction manual states) and this is the only place where you&#x27;ll see the curl form.  I have naturally curly hair and this curling iron effectively straightened my hair rather than enhancing my natural curls.  This curling iron is a complete waste of money.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I really like this curler. The spirals are really pretty, but you have to hold the heat on them for quite a while (I have long, think hair so it may be different for others). I would definitely recommend this curler for anyone wanting to have soft spirals. It works great, looks pretty, and it&#x27;s worth $30 for sure</li>
            <li> Good product. It works as expected.  Seller did a great job. I encourage everyone to look into this as a gift or something you may want.</li>
            <li> This creates the PERFECT curls. It doesn&#x27;t take long at all to curl with this. I don&#x27;t use the glove because it&#x27;s too big on me, but WHO CARES. I love that it curls your hair amazingly and fast. Also, it gets very hot. Fun to use! I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron.  Heats to 400 degrees, does not damage hair.  Like the tapered end, helps curls to turn out well.  My 16 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Didn;t curl my hair at all -- a big mess and burned my fingers even with the silly finger glove.</li>
            <li> Styler won&#x27;t work on Granddaughter&#x27;s. Her hair is way too thick for this utensil. However her friend loves it so it has a good home.</li>
            <li> Hair gets caught in the rings so it makes it hard to unwind. Have to be careful when using because it easily turns off.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I have!!! Love the way it works, it so time consuming and I totally recommend this curling iron</li>
            <li> My hair gets stuck in the coils and gets pulled. Also, the plug keeps falling out of the wall- like it&#x27;s too small. Keep having to replug it in cc and then turn it on on again. Curls fine, except for the pulling hair bit.. wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> I had borrowed my girlfriends one time and it was so simple to use. I had to go out and buy one for myself. I love it!</li>
            <li> grand daughter was thrilled to receive this for christmas..so glad I found this and for such a good price to boot</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair and I have never been able to get my hair to stay curly or to even fit on a curler normally I have to curl half and then wrap the other half but this curler is longer and has way more spirals. I love how it&#x27;s tapered so the curls get gradually smaller twards the ends. Plus I don&#x27;t have to use hardly any hairspray and the curls stay in all day and even in to the next. I&#x27;m so happy with this product I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really love this iron. It&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my daughter and she loves the look of the curls. doesn&#x27;t work to good for shorter hair but I do believe that it was not made to curl shorter hair. We love it. Product is build well!</li>
            <li> I saw a girl on YouTube use this for Beyonce inspired hair and that&#x27;s exactly what I got using this styler. I let it heat up for awhile before using it and it gave me the best curls that lasted all night!</li>
            <li> I like to curl each side of my hair towards the back. The spiral around the wand prevents you from curling in both directions, or at least I didn&#x27;t take the time to figure it out. The curls come out kinked. I&#x27;m returning for a basic wand. Other than that it worked great and curls lasted a long time. It was also much quicker than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The spiral metal circling the curling rod must have been defective on ours. My daughters hair would get caught when we released the curl.  Just one hair but it hurt to get it out.  Not worth it.  Find a differnt tool without the spiral catch on it. Glove was fairly useless too since it kept falling off/ folding over to the thin side.</li>
            <li> This was my very first curling wand...I figured the ridges would help me as a guide until I was ready to try one without them. Now I&#x27;m a pro with the ones without the ridges but I am still very attached to this one. When it burns out on me, though I don&#x27;t see it doing that anytime soon, I will def buy another one. Gets very hot too!</li>
            <li> Love, love it! It is so easy to use and the curl stays in my hair perfectly!!!!!! I would recommend this product to every girl!</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand! I actally bought mine from a local department store.  It works great! I used it on my sew in and the curls came out beautifully. I like the middle coils because it helps to seperate sections of the hair.  Takes a little getting used to and its hard work having to hold the hair, but this was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  The wand gives a nice, unique wavy sort of curl that cant be made with an average curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh one thing.. it takes a while to heat up. When I say a while I mean like 8-10 minutes. But it gets REALLY hot. The curls hold well but I believe thats due to holding spray</li>
            <li> Curler heats up extremely fast. The glove is really hard to keep on and gets in the way. Makes beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it...easy to use and holds a curl very good.  First iron to hold a curl for her all day.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for 15 year old daughter.  She loves it!  Heats up quickly and gets very hot so makes beautiful curls in her naturally short hair.</li>
            <li> I tryed this curling iron just before the dance and I love it the curls lasted a lot longer than my normal curling iron with the same amount or less hairspray too Love It Im gunna buy it</li>
            <li> I have been searching to get the perfect curls. I will upload a youtube shortly in the next month or two. Literally, the other type of curling wand that is just straight with not ribs, slides off of my hair. THIS CURLING WAND IS A MIRACLE WORKER!!!!!!!!!!!! My hair is bouncy, beautiful curls, no ringlet. It makes a beautiful type of curl. It is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> The product arrived just like I expected, in the time I expected it to show up. Very easy and versatile to use, as well as a speedy heat up! This is a great product if you are looking for a different type of curl or to for a &amp;#34;quick-do&amp;#34; for the day.</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy a miracurl or conair curl secret. This wand thing was really difficult with the spirals. I thought it had a clamp but it was just impossible to do my own hair with it. I could do anyone elses hair with it because you need to precisely line up the hair between the spirals.</li>
            <li> Me and my best friend bought the same exact wand without knowing, and we both use it every single time we want cute curls or waves.. Its my go-to tool and I believe every girl needs it in her life!</li>
            <li> Grandaughter listed it for her christmas gift. She loves it.  Always shop amazon for my grandchildren christmas gifts. So easy and I don&#x27;t have to leave home.</li>
