            <li>and I do like this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Life changing top coat.</li>
            <li>I would continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>A must have, I love using it with my OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>and I said nope, it&#x27;s this Essie top coat that I bought.</li>
            <li>I have tried many quick drying top coats and none have ever approached the perfection that this product is!</li>
            <li>I love this polish so much, it dries really fast and gives a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>and it has stayed perfect all week long.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good fast drying top coat that would extend the life of my manicure.</li>
            <li>This top coat is great but make sure you apply it properly (seal the polish around the edge of your nail) and that your nails are buffed and shaped well.</li>
            <li>the drying process is good, but the nail polish is very</li>
            <li>This top coat is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>This particular top coat (Essie&#x27;s Good to Go Rapid Dry Top Coat) went to top of my list.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s left an amazing shine!</li>
            <li>Lasts a minimum of a week without a chip or any significant fading.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth with brush and dries quickly</li>
            <li>They have incredible colors and go on smoothly without streaks (usually)</li>
            <li>but it dries so fast that using nail polish is a more feasible endeavor than it would be otherwise.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries super fast and does what it says.</li>
            <li>Essie has a great product and I would certainly recommend this top coat, along with their other polishes!</li>
            <li>What will happen is the cheap nail color will flake off completely, but still have the essie top coat still attached.</li>
            <li>Cannot ask for a better top coat, especially for polishing on the go.</li>
            <li>Have tried a number of quick dry topcoats, Sally Hansen 100 is a good one too.</li>
            <li>I was using the Seche Vite products and although they were great at drying my nails quickly, the product seemed to cause my manicure to chip within a few hours and</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, actually dries quick, and did not have the issue of smudging as I&#x27;ve experienced with other Fast Drying top coats.</li>
            <li>And right before I went to bed I had to wash all of my make up off</li>
            <li>and also it helps your nails to dry faster love it !</li>
            <li>When I first used this I went to bed 30 minuets after I finished my nails</li>
            <li>Being an avid nail art enthusiast, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for polishes that just work.</li>
            <li>I apply about 6 layers total of this combination BEFORE top coat</li>
            <li>You are good to go a few minutes after you have polished.</li>
            <li>It dries extremely quick with no smudges and keeps a high shine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really any quicker than Sally&#x27;s quick top coat.</li>
            <li>It does the job well, it dries very fast and give a very glossy shine on your nails</li>
            <li>Work alright, but seems to chip so easily as in the entire nail polish comes of in one strip if you pull.</li>
            <li>Love Rapid Dry Top Coat, this is a necessity if you have no patience to sit and wait forever to dry your nails.</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails super shiny and makes my mani last longer I definitely do recommend this top coat</li>
            <li>It works really well with china glaze and OPI nail polishes as well.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s really glossy</li>
            <li>it dries fast, but it pill off in minutes.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly although similarly to some cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of the other finishes, but I heard this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I am happy with that because I normally get bored of my manicure color very fast.</li>
            <li>From normal to fast drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands of top coats.</li>
            <li>Very glossy and professional looking.</li>
            <li>It extends the life of my normal manicure by about 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick dry this is it!</li>
            <li>It works great on its own, but I use a base coat, regular polish, and gelous gel strengthened because I&#x27;m a food server and my nails need extra protection.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly, but it also tends to chip after a few days.</li>
            <li>With this top coat, the other layers are completely dry in seconds!!!</li>
            <li>It does dry extremely fast like stated in reviews</li>
            <li>I chose 4 stars instead of 5 because it really doesn&#x27;t last an entire week like the reviews said.  </li>
            <li>but I might try a few other top coats in the future.</li>

            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> If I use a cheaper, less quality nail polish, it won&#x27;t last nearly as long, but I&#x27;ve still noticed that the clear nail polish will stay on the color still.</li>
            <li> and they always take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for 5 minutes after application</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fully dry.  </li>
            <li> I still have to be a little careful because, since it&#x27;s so thick, the layers underneath will deny with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Hands down, or in this case--</li>
            <li> so no more scrapes and chips when I get too impatient to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Also used her diamond shine but that was a slow dry.  </li>
            <li> It seriously looks like you had your nails done professionally, no joke.</li>
            <li> But it does last several days - maybe 4-5 which isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I tried it over a nail polish that usually chips overnight</li>
            <li> Probably you should wait 30 minutes before going to bed, but no more sheet marks if I want to do my nails at night!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed a minute after painting my nails with this.</li>
            <li> Horrible and annoying!&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product! Finishes nails as if you&#x27;d got them done at the nail salon. Nice shine added and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I have tried many quick drying top coats and none have ever approached the perfection that this product is! Leaves a glossy &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; looking finish for days and days! I love it. The best. Hands down, or in this case--hands up!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a review about it on a blog that said it dries in a minute. I was disappointed a minute after painting my nails with this. It&#x27;s still a nice product but it&#x27;s not really any quicker than Sally&#x27;s quick top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this over all of my nail polishes every time I paint my nails and it will usually last me about 2 weeks especially if I use it with another essie color. If I use a cheaper, less quality nail polish, it won&#x27;t last nearly as long, but I&#x27;ve still noticed that the clear nail polish will stay on the color still. What will happen is the cheap nail color will flake off completely, but still have the essie top coat still attached. It works really well with china glaze and OPI nail polishes as well. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good fast drying top coat that would extend the life of my manicure. I was using the Seche Vite products and although they were great at drying my nails quickly, the product seemed to cause my manicure to chip within a few hours and the polish on my nails would come off in sheets. Horrible and annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essie good to go rapid dry coat seems to work best with my essie polishes, not a shocker there. It extends the life of my normal manicure by about 2 to 3 days. I am happy with that because I normally get bored of my manicure color very fast. This top coat is great but make sure you apply it properly (seal the polish around the edge of your nail) and that your nails are buffed and shaped well.</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much, it dries really fast and gives a flawless finish. When I first used this I went to bed 30 minuets after I finished my nails and I was praying that it wouldn&#x27;t smudge...I woke up the next morning and my nails were perfect!! No smudges, no bubbles, nothing! And right before I went to bed I had to wash all of my make up off and they didn&#x27;t get messed up at all! It seriously looks like you had your nails done professionally, no joke. I cannot tell you how amazing this stuff is, defiantly order more when I run out. Love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of the other finishes, but I heard this is one of the better ones. I didn&#x27;t use it for a semester and it still wasn&#x27;t globby. Definitely noticed made my nails shinier but last longer against outside forces.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast and does what it says. You are good to go a few minutes after you have polished. Gives a good polished sheen.</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polish. They have incredible colors and go on smoothly without streaks (usually) and I do like this top coat.  It dries pretty quickly although similarly to some cheaper brands.  It gets the job done but I might try a few other top coats in the future.</li>
            <li> I be tried many top coats and I can honestly say the Essie good to go is by far the best ! It keeps my nails super shiny and makes my mani last longer I definitely do recommend this top coat and also it helps your nails to dry faster love it !</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t last any longer than anything else out there but it dries so fast that using nail polish is a more feasible endeavor than it would be otherwise.</li>
            <li> Work alright, but seems to chip so easily as in the entire nail polish comes of in one strip if you pull. If you are looking for a quick dry this is it! Although, if you are looking for quality and long-lasting do not buy.</li>
            <li> Love Rapid Dry Top Coat, this is a necessity if you have no patience to sit and wait forever to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I tried it over a nail polish that usually chips overnight and it has stayed perfect all week long. I will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of top coats. From normal to fast drying. Essie has won me over with both! Being an avid nail art enthusiast, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for polishes that just work. I&#x27;ve had the best experience with Essie! This particular top coat (Essie&#x27;s Good to Go Rapid Dry Top Coat) went to top of my list. It goes on smooth, actually dries quick, and did not have the issue of smudging as I&#x27;ve experienced with other Fast Drying top coats. Plus it&#x27;s left an amazing shine! I have had it on a couple of days and my nails have no chipped. Nor have I experienced any polish shrinkage around the tips. Essie has a great product and I would certainly recommend this top coat, along with their other polishes!</li>
            <li> Life changing top coat. Was recommended by a friend and now must-have when doing my nails at home. Goes on so smooth with brush and dries quickly (best part) so no more scrapes and chips when I get too impatient to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It does the job well, it dries very fast and give a very glossy shine on your nails and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars instead of 5 because it really doesn&#x27;t last an entire week like the reviews said.  But it does last several days - maybe 4-5 which isn&#x27;t too bad.  It does dry extremely fast like stated in reviews and it does have one of the best glossy finishes that I&#x27;ve ever used like stated in reviews.  I would continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best hands down. My manicure lasts longer and looks great.</li>
            <li> BEST TOP COAT EVER! I will probably never use anything else. It works great on its own, but I use a base coat, regular polish, and gelous gel strengthened because I&#x27;m a food server and my nails need extra protection. I apply about 6 layers total of this combination BEFORE top coat and they always take forever to dry. With this top coat, the other layers are completely dry in seconds!!! I still have to be a little careful because, since it&#x27;s so thick, the layers underneath will deny with too much pressure. Great product!</li>
            <li> A must have, I love using it with my OPI nail polishes. Someone asked me if I had gel nails and I said nope, it&#x27;s this Essie top coat that I bought. So it&#x27;s really glossy it makes look like I have gel nails especially if you use 2 coats</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as sell as I had hoped. Will keep looking for something that will keep the tips of my nails polished.</li>
            <li> Have tried a number of quick dry topcoats, Sally Hansen 100 is a good one too. Also used her diamond shine but that was a slow dry.  Great shine and hardness too.    But this essie good to go is the best all around.  Lays out really nice and the shine is wonderful.  Lasts a minimum of a week without a chip or any significant fading.  Topcoat it again then and good to go.    I let it dry for 5 minutes after application and it&#x27;s fully dry.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> it dries fast, but it pill off in minutes. it leaves my nails very bright and shinny.  the drying process is good, but the nail polish is very tick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 starts</li>
            <li> Dries your nails in 5-10 minutes. Probably you should wait 30 minutes before going to bed, but no more sheet marks if I want to do my nails at night! Was recommended to me by a fellow nail polish addict at work--boy was she on the money! Very glossy and professional looking. Don&#x27;t know about it making your mani last longer--that&#x27;s not why i&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly, but it also tends to chip after a few days.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It dries extremely quick with no smudges and keeps a high shine. Cannot ask for a better top coat, especially for polishing on the go.</li>
