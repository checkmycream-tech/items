            <li>I got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great</li>
            <li>and we used the trimmers to fix the \\&quot;happy</li>
            <li>Not the end of the world, but it doesn&#x27;t make me too happy.</li>
            <li>but when I recieved this one the trimmer worked great</li>
            <li>: The attachments are great- haven&#x27;t found any hairs</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>However, for the price, it is great.    </li>
            <li>, this trimmer is still working great.</li>
            <li>Works great, the additional attachments make it quite versatile.</li>
            <li>This one is top notch!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 Conair trimmers and loved everyone.</li>
            <li>This is functionally a good trimmer but it has a ton of problems.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted that it took a charge.</li>
            <li>The shaver was good, but the trimmer was doing nothing.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Adjustments are fair.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>It is a good trimmer</li>
            <li>thats what i liked.</li>
            <li>The price was very affordable and the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li>Nice look as well.  </li>
            <li>that it works perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>Prefect i very loved very much as expected i really loved owesome owesome</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I retired a bulkier model for this one and am pleased with the change.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being very portable and versatile, it is also a great value.</li>
            <li>As for the trimmer itself I really love the \\&quot;3 day shave\\</li>
            <li>Using a platic bag is better.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone at the factory could show me how to put everything in it&#x27;s place</li>
            <li>i love.</li>
            <li>But I would never pay top MSRP for it like all the resellers are doing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay trimmer</li>
            <li>With reliability like this, there is no need to think about spending any more on a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about three months, and now the blade is not cutting as good as it used to.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the number of attachments, but after six months I only use one.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this trimmer The only problem so far is to keep all the accessories in the cradle, with that a side the trimmer works just great</li>
            <li>Three levels of trim is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with many attachments.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, well made and can trim any length of hair.</li>
            <li>the trimmer worked fine,...</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked fine, but stopped working after 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I only use this for light trims (around the kids ears and neck) and it works great for our needs.</li>
            <li>TIME IS ACCURATE</li>
            <li>Instead of using it I bought a cheap travel pouch for the attachments.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; like a cheap trimmer when you hold it.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to fit anywhere correctly, aside from the bottle of oil and the trimmer itself.    </li>
            <li>blade angle isn&#x27;t comfortable</li>
            <li>all these plastic pieces don&#x27;t really fit well in the holster..</li>
            <li>Great Product Overall!!</li>
            <li>It seems like a good value so far.  </li>
            <li>The Conair is has so many blade and guide options that it can easily handle any kind of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>And this lets me cut it quick and easily.</li>
            <li>I am still on the original charge after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well for the most part.</li>
            <li>It does clean trim for the beard.</li>
            <li>I think there may be a few too many accessories, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>, he is quite pleased and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it; for such a good trimmer, there are no replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually reading reviews to buy a good beard trimmer to repalce this one.    </li>
            <li>Only problem is all the attachments are supposed to sit in the holder it comes with and its really a pain, a bag would have been better, so far it&#x27;s holding the charge very good</li>
            <li>you minds well pay more for a better one that will last you a couple of years.</li>
            <li>&quot; it quickly trims the hair very very short, it makes it look like I shaved 24 hours ago and has a nice clean look to it.</li>
            <li>This has a good battery life and there is no need to charge for long time.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use and it covers a large number of trimming functions.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to clean and the razor doesn&#x27;t give a good, smooth and even trim!</li>
            <li>4 stars from me because it&#x27;s simple to use and the attachments seem to be pretty good quality too.</li>
            <li>One thing about the trimmers is that they work real well on the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>My husband has tried several of the attachments and liked them.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just be careful and you&#x27;ll be getting a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>... will be useful just for apairing and leveling.</li>
            <li>It remains charged for an ample amount of time and provides for an even cut to get the right length stubble</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on Amazon in May 2007 and so far, I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I bought this item after seeing mixed reviews on it on amazon, hoping it would be better than some said.    </li>
            <li>a product like this should last more than one year - period.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is great, the small pieces really aren&#x27;t the problem others seem to think.  </li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time.</li>
            <li>i just shove &#x27;em in the back and pretty sure i will lose these pieces</li>
            <li>I wanted to make folks aware of my experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>It comes with a variety of trimmers, but I wish it had one in between the first plastic piece and the blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively as a beard and mustache trimmer, so most of the accessories have been left with no use as of yet.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works really good, and battery has lasted for quite a while (I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard at least 3 times already on the first full charge, and have yet to need a recharge).     </li>
            <li>I love this, my hair grows fast, even my facial hair.</li>
            <li>The product picture you see on Amazon is pretty much how it&#x27;s going to look on your counter.</li>
            <li>I loved the trimmer while it worked so three stars :/.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be just as good and should last as long.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very owesome</li>
            <li>Very inconvienient</li>
            <li>So I may be needing to replace the whole thing soon despite</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  </li>
            <li>After doing a lot of research I recently bought this model and love it so far.</li>
            <li>I think this is a decent product for the money, but after only 6 months some of the attachments and trimmer blade broke because they&#x27;re cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>THIS ONE IS VERY OVERPRICED AT THE NEW PRICE    </li>
            <li>SO I figure you have to buy the whole thing over again to get a new blade.</li>
            <li>I had an older one that lasted over 6 years.</li>
            <li>a little more than nothing.    </li>
            <li>Lastly, there are no notches, numbers, or anything else to easily line up with the different head settings to make sure that if you take off the shaving head, you will still be getting the same shave the next time you put it on.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worked long enough to get the job done more than 3 times, and they were all when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>And, of course, all the little parts don&#x27;t fit in their tray very well.</li>
            <li>I had a new cord in 2 days.</li>
            <li>When it was brand new</li>
            <li>It was a refurbished product that was packaged as if it was brand new and never listed as refurbished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shopping for a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;d give this 4 1/2 stars only because the pieces and attachments don&#x27;t really fit well in the caddy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, esthetically the unit is very good , functionally - very mediocre.</li>
            <li>I returned it the next day for another exact one.     </li>
            <li>but it started acting funny in two weeks</li>
            <li>, first the turbo stopped working next the battery started to raise and lower the power of the blade itself and now if I charge it for a week it will work for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR CONAIR MODELS STILL AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE...</li>
            <li>We also used them to give the 4 year old a new look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the base was more functional and it came with a better manual explaining exactly what each attachment&#x27;s purpose was.</li>
            <li>We have a 14 month old who got a new hair cut from his 4 year old brother</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t trim as well as did my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>So far, I have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I guess this is done for a reason: so you have to keep buying complete sets instead of just replacing the blade.</li>
            <li>but cutting elements are far from perfect, not even simply sharp and well aligned.   </li>
            <li>He uses it all the time for trimming and says it is worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li>The 1 inch and 2 inch trimmer covers are the exact same size and there is no place for the 3rd in the stacker.</li>
            <li>Works decent enough.</li>
            <li>Most of the other models I looked at seemed designed for either long beards or very short stubble.</li>
            <li>Which I think is the most stupid engineering idea (well, from a consumer&#x27;s end, but from marketing it means MORE SALES!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product as described, the only problem so far is to keep all the accessories in the cradle, far from that everything is impecable</li>
            <li>I ran it over my beard, over and over... and it barely did anything.</li>
            <li>First of all, it speeds up and slows down by itself.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other trimmers under $20, this one feels very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Conair makes the only trimmers that get close enough to my face so when my old one needed replacing I got this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sitting here typing this with a half-trimmed beard, because once again, even though it charged for a full day, the battery on this trimmer ran down in less than 5 minutes.</li>

            <li> ... will be useful just for apairing and leveling.</li>
            <li> It remains charged for an ample amount of time and provides for an even cut to get the right length stubble</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon in May 2007 and so far, I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after seeing mixed reviews on it on amazon, hoping it would be better than some said.    </li>
            <li> a product like this should last more than one year - period.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great, the small pieces really aren&#x27;t the problem others seem to think.  </li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time.</li>
            <li> i just shove &#x27;em in the back and pretty sure i will lose these pieces</li>
            <li> I wanted to make folks aware of my experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of trimmers, but I wish it had one in between the first plastic piece and the blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively as a beard and mustache trimmer, so most of the accessories have been left with no use as of yet.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really good, and battery has lasted for quite a while (I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard at least 3 times already on the first full charge, and have yet to need a recharge).     </li>
            <li> I love this, my hair grows fast, even my facial hair.</li>
            <li> The product picture you see on Amazon is pretty much how it&#x27;s going to look on your counter.</li>
            <li> I loved the trimmer while it worked so three stars :/.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be just as good and should last as long.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very owesome</li>
            <li> Very inconvienient</li>
            <li> So I may be needing to replace the whole thing soon despite</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  </li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research I recently bought this model and love it so far.</li>
            <li> I think this is a decent product for the money, but after only 6 months some of the attachments and trimmer blade broke because they&#x27;re cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS VERY OVERPRICED AT THE NEW PRICE    </li>
            <li> SO I figure you have to buy the whole thing over again to get a new blade.</li>
            <li> I had an older one that lasted over 6 years.</li>
            <li> a little more than nothing.    </li>
            <li> Lastly, there are no notches, numbers, or anything else to easily line up with the different head settings to make sure that if you take off the shaving head, you will still be getting the same shave the next time you put it on.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worked long enough to get the job done more than 3 times, and they were all when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> And, of course, all the little parts don&#x27;t fit in their tray very well.</li>
            <li> I had a new cord in 2 days.</li>
            <li> When it was brand new</li>
            <li> It was a refurbished product that was packaged as if it was brand new and never listed as refurbished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shopping for a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;d give this 4 1/2 stars only because the pieces and attachments don&#x27;t really fit well in the caddy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, esthetically the unit is very good , functionally - very mediocre.</li>
            <li> I returned it the next day for another exact one.     </li>
            <li> but it started acting funny in two weeks</li>
            <li> , first the turbo stopped working next the battery started to raise and lower the power of the blade itself and now if I charge it for a week it will work for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR CONAIR MODELS STILL AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE...</li>
            <li> We also used them to give the 4 year old a new look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the base was more functional and it came with a better manual explaining exactly what each attachment&#x27;s purpose was.</li>
            <li> We have a 14 month old who got a new hair cut from his 4 year old brother</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t trim as well as did my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> So far, I have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I guess this is done for a reason: so you have to keep buying complete sets instead of just replacing the blade.</li>
            <li> but cutting elements are far from perfect, not even simply sharp and well aligned.   </li>
            <li> He uses it all the time for trimming and says it is worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li> The 1 inch and 2 inch trimmer covers are the exact same size and there is no place for the 3rd in the stacker.</li>
            <li> Works decent enough.</li>
            <li> Most of the other models I looked at seemed designed for either long beards or very short stubble.</li>
            <li> Which I think is the most stupid engineering idea (well, from a consumer&#x27;s end, but from marketing it means MORE SALES!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product as described, the only problem so far is to keep all the accessories in the cradle, far from that everything is impecable</li>
            <li> I ran it over my beard, over and over... and it barely did anything.</li>
            <li> First of all, it speeds up and slows down by itself.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other trimmers under $20, this one feels very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Conair makes the only trimmers that get close enough to my face so when my old one needed replacing I got this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here typing this with a half-trimmed beard, because once again, even though it charged for a full day, the battery on this trimmer ran down in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had to take my free hand, grab a pair of small scissors, and snip my beard hair that was trapped in the foil.    </li>
            <li> The charge on mine didn&#x27;t last long after about a month, and it died after two months.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money with this trimmer, buy a different brand or model and save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cost me much but felt it should have lasted at least a year.  </li>
            <li> and it runs a long time on a charge.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts long and you do not have to worry about bringing a charger with you if you go away.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall I have found is when it is used as a body trimmer, the blades do not cut the hair down enough for my taste, for this I would recommend a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> First of all, right out of the box I couldn&#x27;t figure out where all those tiny attachments went in the base.</li>
            <li> The only issue it has is the adjuster on the back fell off a few months ago, so I use some tweezers to change it when I need to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong shaver, and battery only lasts about six months and then will not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> but the battery never held a charge well - and it died completely in less than 1 year of moderate use.  </li>
            <li> The comb to get to the cutting blades is too fine.  </li>
            <li> Thats my only complaint like the last Conair</li>
            <li> I would just recommend a small container to put everything in for traveling purposes and since the holder only seems to hold everything so loosely.</li>
            <li> They fall off, and make it harder to get to the other attachments.</li>
            <li> It worked passably just long enough to make it too hard to return.    </li>
            <li> He likes the attachments that came with it, however, I have to agree with some of the other reviews about this item.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is stand is small for all the attachments.</li>
            <li> So I just put everything in a small open lid box in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> However the lightweight and small design makes it possible to get anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> But, at least I got a little tube of blade lubricant to use for my next trimmer...</li>
            <li> it was an improvement over my previous beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Also, the head of the shaver is much wider than the body and makes it a bit awkward to put in a travel kit.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review to warn others not to waste their money.    </li>
            <li> You can run it plugged in even on a completely dead battery,</li>
            <li> once the battery&#x27;s dead, the trimmer is trash.    </li>
            <li> This is the hugest waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, the light base often tips and dumps them all over when I pull the trimmer out.  </li>
            <li> This is a compact trimmer that combines enough power with a small enough cutting area to get into tight spots around the nose.  </li>
            <li> I had the base station is small and all the pieces are supposed to fit on there tightly.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the charging base really can&#x27;t store all the attachments efficiently.</li>
            <li> the crappy base has already been brought up but my trimmer was put together somewhat poorly and after the first use the button the back used to change the blade length</li>
            <li> However he has a hard time getting them all stored away in the little tray.  </li>
            <li> The storage tray to keep all the attachments together, is just too small.  </li>
            <li> We put them in a small container instead.  </li>
            <li> DATE WINDIOW TROO SMALL.</li>
            <li> The stand is useless though, ultimately difficult to put all the pieces in it and have it teetering ready to fall over and spill all the parts all over.</li>
            <li> I struggled, with 2 beard hairs stuck in the foil, trying to get the damn thing to just rip the hair out or at least cut it...</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, this trimmer does not hold its charge for very long, which can be quite inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer for Christmas 2007, and it has already failed after less than 1 months use.</li>
            <li> The markup on it is ridiculous, so hunt for another item.</li>
            <li> Was I so unlucky to get the same bad batch?    </li>
            <li> The tray for all the pieces was poorly thought-out.  </li>
            <li> but it needs to have a smaller base.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Battery life stinks, \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button is a gimmick and shouldn&#x27;t even be there, and you have to press it so hard it makes shaving/trimming a tight-fisted</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the base is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t charge it while you use it.</li>
            <li> The charger that was included was the wrong one and did not work.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will never be purchasing any Conair product ever again.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this product only 4 stars instead of 5 is the awful mount it has for the accessories and trimmer.</li>
            <li> I agree with poster who said her husband had trouble putting all the attachments into the base.  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to put the pieces in it.    </li>
            <li> BUT SOMEONE MUST HAVE GONE MAD!  </li>
            <li> Seduced by the possibility of going cordless, I (stupidly) purchased this product 3 times.</li>
            <li> All attachments beside the charging base.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am still on the original charge after a couple weeks of use.  It seems like a good value so far.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review to warn others not to waste their money.    I bought this item after seeing mixed reviews on it on amazon, hoping it would be better than some said.    It is horrible.  The charge on mine didn&#x27;t last long after about a month, and it died after two months.  The tray for all the pieces was poorly thought-out.  It was very difficult to put the pieces in it.    So, forget about buying this... it belongs in a garbage can!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base. The charger part of the trimmer is just too big. Even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments. He would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research I recently bought this model and love it so far. Unlike other trimmers under $20, this one feels very sturdy and well made. The attachments (and there are a lot) don&#x27;t seem likely to break which is a problem I&#x27;ve had before. Most of the other models I looked at seemed designed for either long beards or very short stubble. The Conair is has so many blade and guide options that it can easily handle any kind of facial hair.  &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the charging base really can&#x27;t store all the attachments efficiently. It isn&#x27;t worth the hassle. Instead of using it I bought a cheap travel pouch for the attachments. &lt;br /&gt;If not for that problem, I would have given this trimmer 5 stars. It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, well made and can trim any length of hair.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!!! My husband absolutly loves his trimmers.  He likes the attachments that came with it, however, I have to agree with some of the other reviews about this item.  The storage tray to keep all the attachments together, is just too small.  We put them in a small container instead.  One thing about the trimmers is that they work real well on the fine hairs.  We have a 14 month old who got a new hair cut from his 4 year old brother and we used the trimmers to fix the \\&quot;happy hair\\&quot; my son had.  They worked great!!!  We also used them to give the 4 year old a new look.  Like I said, they worked great!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this trimmer The only problem so far is to keep all the accessories in the cradle, with that a side the trimmer works just great</li>
            <li> I AM EDITING THE REVIEW BELOW FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  THE REVIEW STILL STANDS AS THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT BUT SOMEONE MUST HAVE GONE MAD!  I PURCHASED THE TRIMMER FOR $17.95 IN MAY 2009 AND IT IS NOW SELLING FOR ALMOST $60.  THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR CONAIR MODELS STILL AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE PRICE... THIS ONE IS VERY OVERPRICED AT THE NEW PRICE    This is a compact trimmer that combines enough power with a small enough cutting area to get into tight spots around the nose.  I travels well if you just take the trimmer accessories you need with you and leave the ones you seldom use at home. I retired a bulkier model for this one and am pleased with the change.  In addition to being very portable and versatile, it is also a great value.</li>
            <li> The comb to get to the cutting blades is too fine.  This thing will not let my beard hair get in to get cut.  I like the extras though and it runs a long time on a charge.  Signed, Hubby of Karen</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! Look elsewhere! I bought it at a local CVS thinking it was an improvement over my previous beard trimmer. Big mistake! This product will lose its charge after a short period of time. It is hard to clean and the razor doesn&#x27;t give a good, smooth and even trim!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. I have gone through several razors and on,y like electric ones.This one is top notch!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for the most part. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t charge it while you use it. Also, I&#x27;ve had a guard break on me after owning this for probably 6-10 months. Not the end of the world, but it doesn&#x27;t make me too happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 Conair trimmers and loved everyone. Lets see, this was a while ago but when I recieved this one the trimmer worked great however the AC adaptor to charge it did not. After an email to Conair I had a new cord in 2 days. As for the trimmer itself I really love the \\&quot;3 day shave\\&quot; it quickly trims the hair very very short, it makes it look like I shaved 24 hours ago and has a nice clean look to it. The trimmers always seem to last me around one year before I drop it or knock it off the sink then the blade peice always breaks. Just broke this one about 3 days ago. Now I&#x27;m looking for my fourth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here typing this with a half-trimmed beard, because once again, even though it charged for a full day, the battery on this trimmer ran down in less than 5 minutes. I&#x27;ve had this thing less than 6 months. When it was brand new I could maybe get my beard trimmed in one sitting if I hurried. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worked long enough to get the job done more than 3 times, and they were all when it was brand new. It worked passably just long enough to make it too hard to return.    My $10 Oster trimmer I bought 15 years ago still runs beautifully, but the guide comb broke. I&#x27;m going to see if I can just find replacement parts for it. You can run it plugged in even on a completely dead battery, something else this Conair piece of junk can&#x27;t do.    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> The unit stopped charging after a month. Also, the head of the shaver is much wider than the body and makes it a bit awkward to put in a travel kit. Lastly, there are no notches, numbers, or anything else to easily line up with the different head settings to make sure that if you take off the shaving head, you will still be getting the same shave the next time you put it on.     The blade itself seems higher-quality than the cheap Norelco I used to use, but otherwise this is not a great shaver.</li>
            <li> the trimmer worked fine,...but the battery never held a charge well - and it died completely in less than 1 year of moderate use.  once the battery&#x27;s dead, the trimmer is trash.    a product like this should last more than one year - period.</li>
            <li> This is functionally a good trimmer but it has a ton of problems.  the crappy base has already been brought up but my trimmer was put together somewhat poorly and after the first use the button the back used to change the blade length came off.  Granted its still usable but now i have to fish the button out of a bag to adjust it.  Somewhat of a hassle as one might imagine    Look for something else.</li>
            <li> This has a good battery life and there is no need to charge for long time. thats what i liked. Three levels of trim is pretty good. It does clean trim for the beard.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!  It was a refurbished product that was packaged as if it was brand new and never listed as refurbished. I could tell it was refurbished because it was not even fully cleaned. The charger that was included was the wrong one and did not work. The Conair customer support was not helpful at all. They wanted me to return the product by paying for postage with no reimbursement of postage and there were no guarantees that I would get a replacement or my money back. Needless to say, I will never be purchasing any Conair product ever again.</li>
            <li> I had an older one that lasted over 6 years. This one seems to be just as good and should last as long.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;d give this 4 1/2 stars only because the pieces and attachments don&#x27;t really fit well in the caddy. A diagram would have been helpful. The price was very affordable and the trimmer works great! I use it to keep that 2 day unshaven look. I turn a lot of heads on the street with this look. I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a 2007 Xmas present. Out of the box, it would not charge. I returned it the next day for another exact one.     This second one; I let it charged for whatever the instructions said.  I was delighted that it took a charge. After it was done \\&quot;charging\\&quot;, I turn it on and it died 10 seconds later. At this point, I was bout to chunk it.  However, I put it back in the box and will be writing to Conair for a refund OR some sort of apology for this charging problem.     Two items in a row...c&#x27;mon !! Was I so unlucky to get the same bad batch?    I&#x27;m shopping for a new trimmer now.</li>
            <li> Es un buen producto por su reconocida marca Conair y muy util gracias a todos los accesorios incluidos, la bateria dura el tiempo suficiente. Ideal para tratar el vello del rostro.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money with this product.  I was suprised at the quality and versatility of the clipper and attachments.  I feel like I got a deal !</li>
            <li> Product as described, the only problem so far is to keep all the accessories in the cradle, far from that everything is impecable</li>
            <li> I think there may be a few too many accessories, but it works great.  Once I&#x27;ve figured out what each of the tools are used for, it helped out.</li>
            <li> There is nothing not to like about this trimmer!  I love the way it works on my beard and mustache, and at 20.00 it is truly a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> I only use this for light trims (around the kids ears and neck) and it works great for our needs. I have no idea how it would do for heavier jobs.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t trim as well as did my old Norelco. Replacing the parts is a chore, too. The 1 inch and 2 inch trimmer covers are the exact same size and there is no place for the 3rd in the stacker. The shaver was good, but the trimmer was doing nothing. Thanks but I&#x27;m going back to Norleco.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The trimmer works well. My husband has tried several of the attachments and liked them. The caddie is a joke. Nothing stays in place and don&#x27;t bump it. Using a platic bag is better.   The trimmer is worth the price.</li>
            <li> not the best, not the worst. Does what it is supposed to do. Adjustments are fair. If you are used to a more expensive trimmer, you will probably not like it.</li>
            <li> So far, I have had no problems with this product. It remains charged for an ample amount of time and provides for an even cut to get the right length stubble you are looking for. The only downside is the holder. To try and get everything on it is a feat in itself. I would just recommend a small container to put everything in for traveling purposes and since the holder only seems to hold everything so loosely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon in May 2007 and so far, I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it. I agree with other reviewers that the base is useless. The product picture you see on Amazon is pretty much how it&#x27;s going to look on your counter. All attachments beside the charging base. I&#x27;m sure someone at the factory could show me how to put everything in it&#x27;s place but as soon you&#x27;d breathe on it, everything would fall. 4 stars from me because it&#x27;s simple to use and the attachments seem to be pretty good quality too. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the base was more functional and it came with a better manual explaining exactly what each attachment&#x27;s purpose was. But it&#x27;s a good product. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; like a cheap trimmer when you hold it. It has a good weight to it. Overall, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Owesome prodict, owesome very owesome i love. Prefect i very loved very much as expected i really loved owesome owesome</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great, the small pieces really aren&#x27;t the problem others seem to think.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that you cannot keep the shaver charging and in the holder at the same time for storage!  Very inconvienient; I wish I had known before buying it.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer for Christmas 2007, and it has already failed after less than 1 months use. The battery will no longer take a charge, and it will not turn on at all. Do not waste your money with this trimmer, buy a different brand or model and save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> For the low price, does the job well.  Easy to use with many attachments.  Nice look as well.  Only downside is stand is small for all the attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my son. He uses it all the time for trimming and says it is worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li> CON: I don&#x27;t use this every day, and when I do, I must charge it in advance.     PRO: The attachments are great- haven&#x27;t found any hairs I can&#x27;t cut to any desired length.</li>
            <li> I think this is a decent product for the money, but after only 6 months some of the attachments and trimmer blade broke because they&#x27;re cheap plastic.  Just be careful and you&#x27;ll be getting a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> First of all, right out of the box I couldn&#x27;t figure out where all those tiny attachments went in the base. Nothing seems to fit anywhere correctly, aside from the bottle of oil and the trimmer itself.    I used it today for the first time. I ran it over my beard, over and over... and it barely did anything. I changed the length of the blade setting... ran over my beard again.... a little more than nothing.    So I put the shaving foil head on the thing, started to shave my neckline, IMMEDIATELY snagged a hair, the shave coil doesn&#x27;t cut hair, it just rips it out. And I couldn&#x27;t even get it to do that right. I struggled, with 2 beard hairs stuck in the foil, trying to get the damn thing to just rip the hair out or at least cut it... it didn&#x27;t. I had to take my free hand, grab a pair of small scissors, and snip my beard hair that was trapped in the foil.    This is the hugest waste of money. I&#x27;m throwing mine away.    But, at least I got a little tube of blade lubricant to use for my next trimmer...</li>
            <li> Lots of sizes and attachments. Works decent enough. The stand is useless though, ultimately difficult to put all the pieces in it and have it teetering ready to fall over and spill all the parts all over. So I just put everything in a small open lid box in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the inner battery is finally showing signs of &#x27;memory&#x27; and dying out. I&#x27;ve had it since 2008 (its 2014 now). So I may be needing to replace the whole thing soon despite that it works perfectly fine! You cannot replace the battery, and it wont run off cord in the event the battery goes out. Which I think is the most stupid engineering idea (well, from a consumer&#x27;s end, but from marketing it means MORE SALES!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, for the life of the battery, it works. But I would never pay top MSRP for it like all the resellers are doing. The markup on it is ridiculous, so hunt for another item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who had simultaneous reactions of delight and chagrin.  He loves all of the different attachments and the grooming options they offer.  However he has a hard time getting them all stored away in the little tray.  He says it should have come with a diagram for where they all belong.  Other than that, he is quite pleased and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful sculptural design, plenty of attachments. One \\&quot;small\\&quot; but: but cutting elements are far from perfect, not even simply sharp and well aligned.   &lt;br /&gt;So, esthetically the unit is very good , functionally - very mediocre. For excellence and precision in trimming - Wahl is still the best, in my experience.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully for a variety of tasks. I would recommend it to anyone with facial hair of any type.</li>
            <li> When used on beards it has a tendency to pull hairs.  It&#x27;s not a very strong shaver, and battery only lasts about six months and then will not hold a charge.  Mine went in the recycle bin.  I will not buy another Conair.</li>
            <li> i had a cheaper Philips shaver but couldn&#x27;t use it because it was a 240V device and so picked up this one when it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many issues with this one:&lt;br /&gt;1) low power&lt;br /&gt;2) blade angle isn&#x27;t comfortable&lt;br /&gt;3) all these plastic pieces don&#x27;t really fit well in the holster.. i just shove &#x27;em in the back and pretty sure i will lose these pieces but it seems to be a trend will all the shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m managing with it though and won&#x27;t replace it. buy it if you need a simple beard trimmer if this is on sale</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked fine, but stopped working after 3 months.  It didn&#x27;t cost me much but felt it should have lasted at least a year.  If you have to replace a cheaper trimmer every 3 months you minds well pay more for a better one that will last you a couple of years.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, this trimmer does not hold its charge for very long, which can be quite inconvenient. Compounding the problem is that it won&#x27;t run while charging. And, of course, all the little parts don&#x27;t fit in their tray very well.</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer for my face and head. I trim about 3-4 times a week. I wanted to make folks aware of my experiences with this product. Seduced by the possibility of going cordless, I (stupidly) purchased this product 3 times. Each time, the rechargeable battery dies after 2-3 months. It&#x27;s an okay trimmer but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> DATE WINDIOW TROO SMALL. CANT EVEN SEE IT. TIME IS ACCURATE</li>
            <li> Only problem is all the attachments are supposed to sit in the holder it comes with and its really a pain, a bag would have been better, so far it&#x27;s holding the charge very good</li>
            <li> It is a good trimmer and I am happy with it.  The battery lasts long and you do not have to worry about bringing a charger with you if you go away.  It comes with a variety of trimmers, but I wish it had one in between the first plastic piece and the blade.  It seems like a big jump.  However, for the price, it is great.    EDIT: 4 YEARS later (2011), this trimmer is still working great. It is an excellent bang for the buck and will do whatever you need it to do. With reliability like this, there is no need to think about spending any more on a trimmer. The only issue it has is the adjuster on the back fell off a few months ago, so I use some tweezers to change it when I need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about three months, and now the blade is not cutting as good as it used to. It&#x27;s getting worn out. I see that the blade is detachable but, I can&#x27;t find any spare blades online for this trimmer. SO I figure you have to buy the whole thing over again to get a new blade. I&#x27;ve even looked on Conair&#x27;s website. I couldn&#x27;t believe it; for such a good trimmer, there are no replacement blades. I guess this is done for a reason: so you have to keep buying complete sets instead of just replacing the blade. Conair if you&#x27;re reading this, Consumer Advice: Make some Spare Replacement Blades!!</li>
            <li> I love this, my hair grows fast, even my facial hair. And this lets me cut it quick and easily. I only use 2 of the cutters, and 2 guards and store the rest in my closet. Thats my only complaint like the last Conair I had the base station is small and all the pieces are supposed to fit on there tightly. They fall off, and make it harder to get to the other attachments. So why put what you dont use in the station.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use and it covers a large number of trimming functions.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Works great, the additional attachments make it quite versatile.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best. The only downfall I have found is when it is used as a body trimmer, the blades do not cut the hair down enough for my taste, for this I would recommend a body trimmer. However the lightweight and small design makes it possible to get anywhere on your body. Great Product Overall!!</li>
            <li> I can´t trim details, can´t even align my moustache... will be useful just for apairing and leveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exclusively as a beard and mustache trimmer, so most of the accessories have been left with no use as of yet. The trimmer works really good, and battery has lasted for quite a while (I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard at least 3 times already on the first full charge, and have yet to need a recharge).     The reason I&#x27;m giving this product only 4 stars instead of 5 is the awful mount it has for the accessories and trimmer. I tried for over an hour trying to figure out where goes what, but was stumped. After that, I just put the accessories in a box and kept out the charger and the trimmer.    Still, I&#x27;d fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon.  I&#x27;m actually reading reviews to buy a good beard trimmer to repalce this one.    First of all, it speeds up and slows down by itself.  It doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  It takes me 20 minutes to trim my beard with this.    I was impressed by the number of attachments, but after six months I only use one.  I agree with poster who said her husband had trouble putting all the attachments into the base.  Also, the light base often tips and dumps them all over when I pull the trimmer out.  Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Battery life stinks, \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button is a gimmick and shouldn&#x27;t even be there, and you have to press it so hard it makes shaving/trimming a tight-fisted experience.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to toss it into the trash.</li>
            <li> Conair makes the only trimmers that get close enough to my face so when my old one needed replacing I got this one. I like it but it started acting funny in two weeks, first the turbo stopped working next the battery started to raise and lower the power of the blade itself and now if I charge it for a week it will work for 5 minutes. I loved the trimmer while it worked so three stars :/.</li>
