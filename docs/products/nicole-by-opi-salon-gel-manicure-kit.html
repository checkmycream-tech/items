            <li>Would be  great for beginners.</li>

            <li>A trick to keep it from lifting is to make sure that not one bit gets on your skin when you&#x27;re painting.  </li>
            <li>why I gave it an ok+ rating mark...</li>
            <li>Great gift thanks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both colors and love them both....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to go to the store and get additional colors :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Just got to figure out where to get more cleansing pads for it.</li>
            <li>You can use any gel polish with it also which I love.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Idea of this</li>
            <li>my hands,  just in my nails , the lamp work perfect and dry</li>
            <li>My first attempt lasted about 1 week, however, I did not do a good job ensuring that the polish was off my cuticle before using the UV light to cure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure no one likes to be blinded by that light</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fairly robust for a &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; to real gels.  </li>
            <li>It was really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice kit.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice kit.</li>
            <li>Completely happy with this product , the little lamp are perfect because I dont want to have all that blue light&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>The light works well</li>
            <li>The light works as it should and the two colors that came with</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re good, the nails come out looking professionally done.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product, so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll take off the whole business when I see her this week, but meanwhile my nails are protected!  </li>
            <li>polish set is cured by a light and remains sticky if not cured; so is true gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find nail polish that will stay on without having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I use a gelish topcoat same curing time.. and so much shiner.&lt;br /&gt;the light is good but needs to be more covered</li>
            <li>True gel is a goop that has to be blobbed on and then pushed around with a brush to even the surface.  </li>
            <li>polish set has a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; surface until wiped with rubbing alcohol; so does true gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>True gel is NOT a brush-on</li>
            <li>my nails are a wreck and the true gel is coming off</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it&#x27;ll look only as good as you can pain your nails.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift from my parents as I&#x27;m constantly painting my nails and refuse to pay for a manicure when I can do a good job myself.</li>
            <li>mine last a good 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li>it are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Polish is great but LED light is not very effective.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit in order to compare the LED light to the normal 36W UV light that is used for Shellac/gel coat polishes.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and works really well.  </li>
            <li>I read the steps and applied the red and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I believe after trying many of the various brands available, a lot has to do with the brush and consistency of the product.</li>
            <li>now own several polishes by Gelish and Gelaze -</li>
            <li>Sometimes life is unexpected :)</li>
            <li>I have painted my own nails for years with regular polish.</li>
            <li>I removed it after 12 days only because the edges where it was growing out started catching when I ran my hand through my hair.</li>
            <li>When I use Shellac, it takes much longer to dry but the shine is remarkable and consistency is glossy and durable upon finishing.</li>
            <li>or it will not work right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, it&#x27;s nice to have polish that is dry immediately.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will take some practice though :).</li>
            <li>and I would never use it, kind of a pearly pink.</li>
            <li>BUT you have to follow the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I did my first manicure without any research at all - just read and followed the directions that came with the kit.  </li>
            <li>The colors would last more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>My first manicure peeled off after about a week</li>
            <li>Colors are very glittery, love the red!</li>
            <li>Colors are very glittery, love the red! üòç</li>
            <li>But, miraculously, my polish stayed on that whole first week</li>
            <li>I have been using this system for the past month and find it equally as good as CND&#x27;s Shellac system.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I will stick to my original Shellac system with the 36W UV light because although it takes longer to dry, I notice longer-lasting polish and high shine results.</li>
            <li>Nails are not getting dry and they are healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Spread super glue on the edges of the gel, lapping over onto the natural nail.  </li>
            <li>nails a lot more and says they last longer then normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>I had to wait a month to use it because it had been years since I had painted my nails or even paid much attention to them, so I had to get them in decent shape first.  </li>
            <li>very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light is auto-timed for 30 sec; you don&#x27;t need to look at your watch (ok; I&#x27;m a Luddite -</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this system leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t exactly how they look on here or even on the box just an FYI, luckily they are not drastically different or offensive.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10-15 minutes to complete the entire process with NO dry time which is amazing because I used to always smudge my nails.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the base, polish &amp; top coats and find the brushes to be great.  </li>
            <li>color is a little sheer but beautiful not what is in the picture on the back of the box</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li>The pink in this kit is extremely light</li>
            <li>the gel comes off as a hunk (mine often does), paint the whole surface of the exposed natural nail with the glue.  </li>
            <li>light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, just a normal manicure</li>
            <li>manicurist gave me the following instructions for true gel that has lifted or parted company altogether with the natural nail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the pink and although it was sheer, it was a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>The first and second time I used it, I found that the polish didn&#x27;t seem to harden as efficiently as a salon job.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The red is a little more brown than &amp;#34;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I have come across so far..</li>
            <li>I ought to be embarrassed to say that I just picked off the old gel that was lifted, and painted over it with this stuff...</li>
            <li>and they were nowhere near this product.</li>
            <li>In 15 minutes I squeezed and pulled the foil and cotton off and the gel come almost completely off.</li>
            <li>polish set is a light-sensitive product (hence dark bottles); so is true gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m not a fan of the normal &#x27;nicole&#x27; polishes as the texture and quality is nowhere near traditional OPI.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe they weren&#x27;t under the light long enough, but no matter how long i kept them under</li>
            <li>, I do generally do 2 cycles.</li>
            <li>The finish on the nails holds the same shine as a professional manicure and/or acrylics.  </li>
            <li>She now does her nails about once every 1-2 weeks, and is constantly raving about how professional they look.</li>
            <li>I used the pink color, which is very forgiving for a newbie.  </li>
            <li>Matched with the base coat and top coat that came with the kit, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Initially, the lacquer wasn&#x27;t drying completely after 30 seconds and came off entirely when the tacky film was removed with the provided alcohol swabs.</li>
            <li>in fact I haven&#x27;t worn the same color twice, and they all work perfectly fine with this lamp, base and top</li>
            <li>I have thin nails that break and peel easy.</li>

            <li> The pink in this kit is extremely light</li>
            <li> the gel comes off as a hunk (mine often does), paint the whole surface of the exposed natural nail with the glue.  </li>
            <li> light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, just a normal manicure</li>
            <li> manicurist gave me the following instructions for true gel that has lifted or parted company altogether with the natural nail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the pink and although it was sheer, it was a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> The first and second time I used it, I found that the polish didn&#x27;t seem to harden as efficiently as a salon job.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The red is a little more brown than &amp;#34;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have come across so far..</li>
            <li> I ought to be embarrassed to say that I just picked off the old gel that was lifted, and painted over it with this stuff...</li>
            <li> and they were nowhere near this product.</li>
            <li> In 15 minutes I squeezed and pulled the foil and cotton off and the gel come almost completely off.</li>
            <li> polish set is a light-sensitive product (hence dark bottles); so is true gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m not a fan of the normal &#x27;nicole&#x27; polishes as the texture and quality is nowhere near traditional OPI.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe they weren&#x27;t under the light long enough, but no matter how long i kept them under</li>
            <li> , I do generally do 2 cycles.</li>
            <li> The finish on the nails holds the same shine as a professional manicure and/or acrylics.  </li>
            <li> She now does her nails about once every 1-2 weeks, and is constantly raving about how professional they look.</li>
            <li> I used the pink color, which is very forgiving for a newbie.  </li>
            <li> Matched with the base coat and top coat that came with the kit, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Initially, the lacquer wasn&#x27;t drying completely after 30 seconds and came off entirely when the tacky film was removed with the provided alcohol swabs.</li>
            <li> in fact I haven&#x27;t worn the same color twice, and they all work perfectly fine with this lamp, base and top</li>
            <li> I have thin nails that break and peel easy.</li>
            <li> , bc usually by two weeks, my nails have grown out too much, but the polish is still in tact.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit on a whim when Sam&#x27;s Club had it marked down to $20.  </li>
            <li> will say that is has stayed on my toes for over 10 days now and that the curing of the polish is terrific- completely dry and no waiting or worrying about &amp;#34;denting&amp;#34; the polish,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Colors are much thicker than the base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> ; (silver glitter) and &amp;#34;When Monkey&#x27;s Fly&amp;#34; (gold glitter).  </li>
            <li> run twice as long anyway.</li>
            <li> I do not particularly like red or pink polish, so</li>
            <li> is a sort-of sparkly pink, a little deeper than &amp;#34;Aphrodite&#x27;s Pink Nightie.&amp;#34;  (Note:  The new &amp;#34;Aphrodite&amp;#34; seems to be a deeper shade than it used to be.)  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe the dry time and</li>
            <li> so they dont&#x27; get dry.  </li>
            <li> What a difference not having to wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I cant really attest to the length of time the polish stays on for (well i definitely know 5 solid days) because I got bored with the red and took the polish off to try the pink.</li>
            <li> My next step is going to be to purchase a regular Opi Gelcolor since the curing process can be done with the lamp provided in this system (for a heck of a lot less money than other UV lamps alone).</li>
            <li> Those concerns haven&#x27;t come up with the gel line so far, they&#x27;re still not top of the line, but once it is cured you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> No sitting around waiting for all the coats to dry!</li>
            <li> It took me 20 minutes and they were DRY!  </li>
            <li> However,  I have been using it for nearly a month, am tough on my nails, and wanted to go with the gel polishes since they don&#x27;t chip the next day.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to use the alcohol wipes in the end because of one the the bad reviews, because her top coat wiped off.</li>
            <li> Not Really a Waitress.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular polish always wore off after a few days.</li>
            <li> buy it again; in fact, I bought some extra base and top coats.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not good with the regular polish, this won&#x27;t be any different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other at home gel manicures that don&#x27;t involve the lamp</li>
            <li> Your nails will be extremely sticky if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have bought other polishes from Sally Beauty Supply, so I have an array of colors.</li>
            <li> The base coat is the MUST :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a base coat, color, and top coat that are cured by LED</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d be saving a bundle on manicures by buying this little gadget.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of this kit because of the price.  </li>
            <li> So, for a manicure that lasts, I&#x27;d say that the rubbing alcohol before and after, and thin coats are key.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions a few times and I was so amazed at the outcome.</li>
            <li> ordinary polish chips ..</li>
            <li> I cut cotton rounds in four and used the small pieces on my nails and wrapped with a small piece of foil.</li>
            <li> but the only thing is that the Gel polish does not stay on long :(</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had this kit for at least two years now, and I still use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be a big pain to remove the gel, but after viewing some YouTube videos I just did it.</li>
            <li> phones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about 8 years, I have worn gels to protect my weak and splitting nails.  </li>
            <li> mine would last about 3-4 days that being said i feel like I over paid for it :(  </li>
            <li> Do use two thin coats, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve seen others say that it chipped, you need to do thin coats.</li>
            <li> I had to work at painting my layers thin and not getting any polish on my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> and my nails were rigid and weak!  </li>
            <li> I got this set for &amp;#34;emergency repairs&amp;#34; if I were unable to keep my weekly manicure appt (or she were unable to).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have tried over and over again to see if I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I just removed my fake nails that I had put on at a salon....</li>
            <li> base gel</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;topcoat is CRAP...</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband and he spend $69.00 on this crap at Sam&#x27;s Club.  </li>
            <li> This is completely worthless set.</li>
            <li> I always take a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol over my nails before applying the base coat, and you MUST use it again after you finish all the coats.</li>
            <li> worst one I&#x27;ve seen no shine at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great introduction to gel polish!  I now have several colors!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I just paid $39 for mine at SAMs Club! I love it already! Definitely will take some practice though :). I heard you can use Any polish. The base coat is the MUST :)</li>
            <li> I also purchased the product from Sam&#x27;s Club for $39 after the holiday season.  I cannot believe the dry time and the shine finish!  My first attempt lasted about 1 week, however, I did not do a good job ensuring that the polish was off my cuticle before using the UV light to cure.  The finish on the nails holds the same shine as a professional manicure and/or acrylics.  I am highly satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added to my gel polish by testing Opi&#x27;s Gelcolor line with the Nicole (same manufacturer).  I purchased 2 glitter gels by Opi, found on either Amazon or Ebay.  The colors are &amp;#34;Which is Witch&amp;#34; (silver glitter) and &amp;#34;When Monkey&#x27;s Fly&amp;#34; (gold glitter).  I used the silver glitter as an accent nail with the Nicole product/lamp, which worked like a charm.  My next step is going to be to purchase a regular Opi Gelcolor since the curing process can be done with the lamp provided in this system (for a heck of a lot less money than other UV lamps alone).</li>
            <li> got this kit at samsclub and did my nails 2 weeks ago.  Today is the 14th day and there is not one spot peeling.  A trick to keep it from lifting is to make sure that not one bit gets on your skin when you&#x27;re painting.  The pink in this kit is extremely light and I would never use it, kind of a pearly pink.</li>
            <li> why I gave it an ok+ rating mark...&lt;br /&gt;best base gel I have come across so far..&lt;br /&gt;pink color is a little sheer but beautiful not what is in the picture on the back of the box&lt;br /&gt;red is a gorgeous color but you will have to wipe off sticky layer before the topcoat or it will rub off on your brush&lt;br /&gt;topcoat is CRAP... worst one I&#x27;ve seen no shine at all.. I use a gelish topcoat same curing time.. and so much shiner.&lt;br /&gt;the light is good but needs to be more covered I&#x27;m sure no one likes to be blinded by that light&lt;br /&gt;if that works for you defiantly get it. but don&#x27;t over pay I got mine for 20 bucks at Sam&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I think this set is perfect!  Made sure I followed the directions, and the manicures have turned out perfect!  I leave the gel manicure on for 5 days, and off 2 days.  Nails are not getting dry and they are healthy.  I think the trick is to NOT leave the polish on 7 days a week - nails need time to breathe so they dont&#x27; get dry.  Since I received this kit, I have ordered 4 bottles of OPI gel polish through Amazon.  Am really really happy with this.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product, so far. I have used it several times, as well as, my daughter.</li>
            <li> Completely happy with this product , the little lamp are perfect because I dont want to have all that blue light&lt;br /&gt;in my hands,  just in my nails , the lamp work perfect and dry very well the gel nail polish and the two colors&lt;br /&gt;come in this box are so beautiful  too</li>
            <li> So easy to use and works really well.  I love the convenience of having salon quality nails in the comfort of my own home</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take an hour, as some have suggested.  15 min for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are much thicker than the base and top coats.  Do use two thin coats, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink is a sort-of sparkly pink, a little deeper than &amp;#34;Aphrodite&#x27;s Pink Nightie.&amp;#34;  (Note:  The new &amp;#34;Aphrodite&amp;#34; seems to be a deeper shade than it used to be.)  The red is a little more brown than &amp;#34;I&#x27;m Not Really a Waitress.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light is auto-timed for 30 sec; you don&#x27;t need to look at your watch (ok; I&#x27;m a Luddite - the rest of you would watch your cell phones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about 8 years, I have worn gels to protect my weak and splitting nails.  Love gel! I got this set for &amp;#34;emergency repairs&amp;#34; if I were unable to keep my weekly manicure appt (or she were unable to).  I ought to be embarrassed to say that I just picked off the old gel that was lifted, and painted over it with this stuff...but I&#x27;m not!  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll take off the whole business when I see her this week, but meanwhile my nails are protected!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff! mb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This is NOT a gel manicure set, per se.  I asked my manicurist to please clarify bcs I thought it was.  No, it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a base coat, color, and top coat that are cured by LED light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, just a normal manicure EXCEPT that drying is done with the LED lamp, rather than just air-drying.  Therefore, your manicure is &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is a brush-on product.  True gel is a goop that has to be blobbed on and then pushed around with a brush to even the surface.  It is not a brush-on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT a gel.  It is a LED light-cured polish set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it&#x27;s nice to have polish that is dry immediately.  And it&#x27;s fairly robust for a &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; to real gels.  Please note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This polish set is a light-sensitive product (hence dark bottles); so is true gel.&lt;br /&gt;-This polish set is cured by a light and remains sticky if not cured; so is true gel.&lt;br /&gt;-This polish set has a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; surface until wiped with rubbing alcohol; so does true gel.&lt;br /&gt;-This is a brush-on product, like a nail polish.  True gel is NOT a brush-on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My manicurist gave me the following instructions for true gel that has lifted or parted company altogether with the natural nail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Spread super glue on the edges of the gel, lapping over onto the natural nail.  That will keep what&#x27;s left of the gel on your nail until you can get help.&lt;br /&gt;-If the gel comes off as a hunk (mine often does), paint the whole surface of the exposed natural nail with the glue.  (I am using Bondini, which I bought on Amazon; see my review there; it&#x27;s the stuff in the bottle with the yellow label.)&lt;br /&gt;-When my nails are a wreck and the true gel is coming off, I remove it (acetone) and replace it with the base/color/top coat sequence of this product.  This seems stronger than base/color/top than air-dried polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again; in fact, I bought some extra base and top coats.</li>
            <li> I received this from my mother and step-father for Christmas. It works great. It was really easy to use. I am so excited to find nail polish that will stay on without having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive to use the alcohol wipes in the end because of one the the bad reviews, because her top coat wiped off. It didn&#x27;t! It worked great like it&#x27;s supposed to. Very pleased. Like one of the earlier reviewers suggested, get it at sams for $20. I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it&#x27;ll look only as good as you can pain your nails. If you&#x27;re not good with the regular polish, this won&#x27;t be any different. If you&#x27;re good, the nails come out looking professionally done.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it&#x27;s. Great gift thanks.  She&#x27;s doing here nails a lot more and says they last longer then normal nail polish.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift from my parents as I&#x27;m constantly painting my nails and refuse to pay for a manicure when I can do a good job myself. They bought it from Sams club around $60 and I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my girlfriends who are constantly  do their nails. It takes me about 10-15 minutes to complete the entire process with NO dry time which is amazing because I used to always smudge my nails. I&#x27;ve used both colors and love them both....I cant really attest to the length of time the polish stays on for (well i definitely know 5 solid days) because I got bored with the red and took the polish off to try the pink. I&#x27;ve used other at home gel manicures that don&#x27;t involve the lamp and they were nowhere near this product. Can&#x27;t wait to go to the store and get additional colors :)</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d be saving a bundle on manicures by buying this little gadget. Unfortunately. it left my nails feeling sticky instead. I thought maybe they weren&#x27;t under the light long enough, but no matter how long i kept them under they were still sticky. I ended up having to remove the nail polish.</li>
            <li> This works GREAT!!!I bought mine in Sams Club for $50.00 and I love it! Now I need to find some more polishes for it!</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and I love it. Works great. Just got to figure out where to get more cleansing pads for it.</li>
            <li> it works great! BUT you have to follow the directions exactly or it will not work right. once you get the hang of the process it will take you no time at all. mine last a good 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for the past month and find it equally as good as CND&#x27;s Shellac system.  I like the consistency of the base, polish &amp; top coats and find the brushes to be great.  I believe after trying many of the various brands available, a lot has to do with the brush and consistency of the product. I hope Nicole follows up this system with more colors!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband and he spend $69.00 on this crap at Sam&#x27;s Club.  I have tried over and over again to see if I&#x27;m doing something wrong and it usually only lasts a day or two before it starts peeling off.  I just did my nails on Saturday morning and by Saturday night three nails peeled off.  I wish I could get my money back.  This is completely worthless set.</li>
            <li> The light works well, I do generally do 2 cycles. The first and second time I used it, I found that the polish didn&#x27;t seem to harden as efficiently as a salon job. I thought it may be the polish, but 2 cycles works perfectly. I understand this is not &amp;#34;ideal&amp;#34;, however it&#x27;s a great price and the salon lights (my salon uses OPI) run twice as long anyway. I must say I&#x27;m not a fan of the normal &#x27;nicole&#x27; polishes as the texture and quality is nowhere near traditional OPI. Those concerns haven&#x27;t come up with the gel line so far, they&#x27;re still not top of the line, but once it is cured you can&#x27;t tell. The colors aren&#x27;t exactly how they look on here or even on the box just an FYI, luckily they are not drastically different or offensive. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered so this has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Where can I find additional polishes? I have googled Nicole by opi gel polish and it will only bring up the regular polish. Has anyone found the gel anywhere?</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a great buy-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the polish does NOT stay on-  it peels off in the matter of days.... ordinary polish chips .. this peels. I have followed the directions to the  &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;  and even tried curing longer. still peels off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that is has stayed on my toes for over 10 days now and that the curing of the polish is terrific- completely dry and no waiting or worrying about &amp;#34;denting&amp;#34; the polish,</li>
            <li> OPI nail products are considered the best by most professional manicurists.  I chose this kit because of the brand, and,the price couldn&#x27;t be beaten.  I was a little leary of this kit because of the price.  However,  I have been using it for nearly a month, am tough on my nails, and wanted to go with the gel polishes since they don&#x27;t chip the next day.  I was not disappointed.  The light works as it should and the two colors that came with it are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Polish is great but LED light is not very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it and will use it.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product and she loves it. She now does her nails about once every 1-2 weeks, and is constantly raving about how professional they look.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this kit from Sam&#x27;s Club for Christmas, and I am so happy that she did! I do not particularly like red or pink polish, so I went to Sally Beauty Supply and bought a nude color. Matched with the base coat and top coat that came with the kit, it worked just fine. To do both hands to completion, it took about 30 minutes, and once they were done, they were set! No sitting around waiting for all the coats to dry! I was worried that my first try wouldn&#x27;t look so good, but it turned out great. I don&#x27;t think I want to use regular polish ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve had this kit for at least two years now, and I still use it all the time. I always take a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol over my nails before applying the base coat, and you MUST use it again after you finish all the coats. Your nails will be extremely sticky if you don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen reviews from people saying their nails were sticky after. This is a crucial step. I have bought other polishes from Sally Beauty Supply, so I have an array of colors. I do my nails every two weeks, bc usually by two weeks, my nails have grown out too much, but the polish is still in tact. I&#x27;d also like to add, since I&#x27;ve seen others say that it chipped, you need to do thin coats. So, for a manicure that lasts, I&#x27;d say that the rubbing alcohol before and after, and thin coats are key.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit in order to compare the LED light to the normal 36W UV light that is used for Shellac/gel coat polishes. Surprisingly, there is a huge difference. While this polish system dries in a short amount of time (30 seconds), the polish quality is similar to regular polish. Initially, the lacquer wasn&#x27;t drying completely after 30 seconds and came off entirely when the tacky film was removed with the provided alcohol swabs. When I use Shellac, it takes much longer to dry but the shine is remarkable and consistency is glossy and durable upon finishing. In my opinion, this system leaves much to be desired. The polish came off like a flimsy sticker before two weeks were up. In the meantime, I will stick to my original Shellac system with the 36W UV light because although it takes longer to dry, I notice longer-lasting polish and high shine results. To each her own, but I&#x27;ll take longevity over shorter drying time any day.</li>
            <li> I just removed my fake nails that I had put on at a salon....and my nails were rigid and weak!  I read the steps and applied the red and LOVE it!  It took me 20 minutes and they were DRY!  Wow!  The sticky residue you just wipe away after the last step.  I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit on a whim when Sam&#x27;s Club had it marked down to $20.  I had to wait a month to use it because it had been years since I had painted my nails or even paid much attention to them, so I had to get them in decent shape first.  I did my first manicure without any research at all - just read and followed the directions that came with the kit.  I used the pink color, which is very forgiving for a newbie.  I now know that there is a bit of a learning curve when using this type of polish.  I had to work at painting my layers thin and not getting any polish on my cuticles.  But, miraculously, my polish stayed on that whole first week and I knew then that I was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I now own several polishes by Gelish and Gelaze - in fact I haven&#x27;t worn the same color twice, and they all work perfectly fine with this lamp, base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I am 47 and never dreamed I would one day be wearing blue fingernail polish.  Sometimes life is unexpected :)</li>
            <li> Pretty nice kit. Would be  great for beginners. It is really simple to do. Colors are very glittery, love the red!</li>
            <li> I have a red carpet manicure gel nail set and then I got this one at Sam&#x27;s club as a spare.  I only paid $19.95 for it but it works just as great as the $80 RCM one I have.  You can use any gel polish with it also which I love.  The colors would last more than 2 weeks but you have the growth so you need to remove and redo after 2 weeks.  I recommend this highly.  No chipping and continued shine.</li>
            <li> I got my kit at Sam&#x27;s Club for under $20. I have painted my own nails for years with regular polish. I read the instructions a few times and I was so amazed at the outcome. Beautiful. What a difference not having to wait for my nails to dry. I tried the pink and although it was sheer, it was a nice natural look. I removed it after 12 days only because the edges where it was growing out started catching when I ran my hand through my hair. The polish on the tips of my nails never worn off. Regular polish always wore off after a few days. I was afraid it was going to be a big pain to remove the gel, but after viewing some YouTube videos I just did it. I cut cotton rounds in four and used the small pieces on my nails and wrapped with a small piece of foil. In 15 minutes I squeezed and pulled the foil and cotton off and the gel come almost completely off. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Idea of this but the only thing is that the Gel polish does not stay on long :( mine would last about 3-4 days that being said i feel like I over paid for it :(  I can get a bottle or OPI and just paint my nails and that stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I used this on my fingers and toes. My first manicure peeled off after about a week but when I tried it on my toes, it has not come off or chipped and I have had it on over a month!</li>

            <li> I like the gel nail polish I got as a manicure and got this kit to do it at home. I have thin nails that break and peel easy. The kit comes with what you need to get started. The nail polish does not chip, but have noticed it peels away faster. Though I believe this is partly me and not avoiding cuticles and the side of my nail, but each application does seem to last longer than the last.</li>
