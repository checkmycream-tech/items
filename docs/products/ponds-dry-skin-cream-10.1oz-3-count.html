            <li>IS MUCH BETTER THAN REG  PONDS.</li>
            <li>My favorite cream for 35 years</li>
            <li>It is light weight and great for normal to oily skin types.</li>
            <li>, I thought that was an easy match.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to the skin and doesn&#x27;t make it shinny or oily :)</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my sin feeling super soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>This cream does smell nice and is very moisturizing, I just had to stop using it because my face broke out with pimples all over it.  </li>
            <li>I am now using this in place of Sothy&#x27;s Hydradvance light hydrating cream which retails for about $60.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth</li>
            <li>I am happy enough with it that I might even re-purchase it as my go to nightly body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Ponds feels so light.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth without me having to put powder on.</li>
            <li>&amp; i leave it on for few min,&lt;br /&gt; ITS GREAT !!</li>
            <li>so maybe I should have purchased the original formula of an oily skin formula if there is one.  </li>
            <li>After writing my original review where I said that this didn&#x27;t work for me, I have upgraded my rating from a 3 to a 4.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this cream at my local drug store and it is very light and feels nice on my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can smells it when you first put it on, which feels refreshing and clean to me.</li>
            <li>Great for dry winters.</li>
            <li>Calming to skin, great for dry weather.</li>
            <li>This cream is more light in consistency but really moisturizes like it says.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and easily get absorbed...</li>
            <li>this is great for wrinkles, pimples, and dry skin,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel real smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but not enough moisturizing benefits for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much struggles with skin most of my life.</li>
            <li>It does seem to keep those places more moisturized than my normal lotion.</li>
            <li>and it is very inexpensive and does the job!!</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li>It soaks quickly into my skin and leaves it smooth and feeling very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I use different products of Pond&#x27;s a lot, and this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>love this product, it makes your face feel alive</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>Amazon, where I use to buy books, and is an the easy way to buy this and that from, if you live in Norway, are selling the Ponds creams.</li>
            <li>Even on my dry sensitive skin, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I pair it with the Ponds for Dry skin (use that at night) and my skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li>I have used it many different ways: as an after bath moisturizer</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;lotion, or a first line on my skin</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t use too much this moisturizer dries quickly to a nice matte finish while my skin feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t tell it was face cream</li>
            <li>My acne is pretty dormant/normal, so for me to see my head in clusters of acne freaks me out.</li>
            <li>More product than the regular container.</li>
            <li>on my face, then i wash it off with hot water,&lt;br /&gt;then  </li>
            <li>So, overall, a great product to use, but be prepared that it&#x27;s not your average Pond&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Feels good and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>In my long history of facial products, I&#x27;ve learned what works and what doesn&#x27;t and to keep around a good supply</li>
            <li>which is a big plus for me since I have super oily skin!</li>
            <li>The jar is huge and will last forever.</li>
            <li>If I use too much it leaves a shiny film.</li>
            <li>but I think it is really evening out my skin in the colder weather.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Definitely way better than the old Pond&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My skin will generally handle most products, but it totally didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anylonger, but I was lucky enough to find it online.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major difference in my skin ever since the first day I started using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like the way it use to be.  </li>
            <li>The price is decent for such a large jar too!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it but</li>
            <li>I love the Pond&#x27;s products, However you can only get a few certain ones here in Kentucky and</li>
            <li>I am not sure I will even be able to finish the container as it has no benefit to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used and my skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li>On my way to Tromsø Norway by plain, they confiscated my lovely Ponds Caring Classic Cream, which I had bought from the US, and which I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li>Just enough moisturing but not too much.</li>
            <li>Creates sort of a barrier between your skin, keeping it moisturized, because sometimes my make up can be really drying on my skin, especially if I&#x27;m using powder or the creme to powder foundation</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This is not a typical Pond&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>This cream did not absorb very well and had a strange scent.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for something thats really rich in consistency (what you usually get from Pond&#x27;s,) then this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Originally I used the product only on my face, but since I didn&#x27;t want to let it go to waste, I tried it as a body moisturizer</li>
            <li>If you have super dry skin like mine, you would rather go with regular ponds (blue and white).</li>
            <li>I just needed a gentle nighttime moisturizer without any active ingredients and without anything that will make me break out with pimples.</li>
            <li>It was developed for use in extremely dry climates and it&lt;</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed a few pimples that appeared a couple days later.</li>

            <li> Smells so good really good cream</li>
            <li> This cream does smell nice and is very moisturizing, I just had to stop using it because my face broke out with pimples all over it.  I think it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> This is not a typical Pond&#x27;s product.  It was developed for use in extremely dry climates and it&lt;br /&gt;works wonders at hydrating my skin. I first found it in New Mexico when I was desperate to find&lt;br /&gt;something to help my skin hold moisture.  I have used it many different ways: as an after bath moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;lotion, or a first line on my skin then I put my regular face cream over it. I can&#x27;t live without it but&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect it to do the work of other Pond&#x27;s products. I have paid multiples for other products that&lt;br /&gt;do not do half the job of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for oily skin! Right after I shower, I put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or nothing. It just hydrates! :D Great for dry winters. Pond&#x27;s is the greatest. :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> Feels good and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I just needed a gentle nighttime moisturizer without any active ingredients and without anything that will make me break out with pimples. This is it! It&#x27;s light, goes on wonderfully, has a light nice fragrance and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s such a big jar it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t use too much this moisturizer dries quickly to a nice matte finish while my skin feels moisturized. If I use too much it leaves a shiny film. A little goes a long way with this product. I expect this jar to last me at least a year. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I can&#x27;t yet speak to the long term effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I just bought this cream at my local drug store and it is very light and feels nice on my skin.  At first, I couldn&#x27;t tell it was face cream but I think it is really evening out my skin in the colder weather.  The price is decent for such a large jar too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I use it during the day and the summer.  Just enough moisturing but not too much. Feels great, fresh and natural scent and a great price! Ponds, still the one after all these years!</li>
            <li> thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;I get everything perfect</li>
            <li> Calming to skin, great for dry weather. Not greasy, and scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset that I took a chance on this and it failed. My skin will generally handle most products, but it totally didn&#x27;t like this. I&#x27;ve heard of great things about Ponds, so I decided, \\&quot;Why not?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my luck ran out this time. At first, I noticed a few pimples that appeared a couple days later. I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t the moisturizer, maybe just a fluke from something else, ya know? Well, I lasted it longer and BOOM! I broke out with acne all on my forehead! I don&#x27;t usually get clusters of acne. My acne is pretty dormant/normal, so for me to see my head in clusters of acne freaks me out. I guess my skin didn&#x27;t like this moisturizer too well :/ Also, the smell is horrible. It literally smells like axe. Axe.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Excellent value was expecting smaller jars thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream! The jar is huge and will last forever. It is light weight and great for normal to oily skin types. It has a very light scent. I am now using this in place of Sothy&#x27;s Hydradvance light hydrating cream which retails for about $60. Great product, great buy! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have super dry skin like mine, you would rather go with regular ponds (blue and white). This one doesn&#x27;t keep my skin hydrated for long.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome product. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anylonger, but I was lucky enough to find it online. I use it every morning and every night before bed and my skin feels and looks really good.</li>
            <li> The rating of this product is based on my disappointment in its hydration claims.  Overall it&#x27;s good but not enough moisturizing benefits for me.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Ponds make-up remover and thought I would give this cream a try.  I am so glad I did.  It feels good on your face and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the Pond&#x27;s products, However you can only get a few certain ones here in Kentucky and this one I&#x27;ve never saw sold anywhere. Since it was Pond&#x27;s I decided to try it. I&#x27;m 32 and I have combination skin, it&#x27;s like the weather, give it a few minutes and it&#x27;ll change. In my long history of facial products, I&#x27;ve learned what works and what doesn&#x27;t and to keep around a good supply so I can go back and forth as the seasons and my skin changes. It works great when you wear it under your make-up. Creates sort of a barrier between your skin, keeping it moisturized, because sometimes my make up can be really drying on my skin, especially if I&#x27;m using powder or the creme to powder foundation and I don&#x27;t want to flake. Gals, if you have this problem then  you know what I&#x27;m talking about. On the or hand of this, when you use it just by itself, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you need to wash your face because there&#x27;s oil on it and everything is sticking to it. It makes my skin feel really smooth and that&#x27;s a plus for me. Just a few fingertips is all you need - Should last anyone who uses it sparingly well over a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product Pond&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Bottle was opened, seems like it was used or try for someone before.</li>
            <li> Even on my dry sensitive skin, this stuff works great. I pair it with the Ponds for Dry skin (use that at night) and my skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li> I usually use Ponds on my face but this product left a burning sensation. I only use it on thicker areas like elbows and legs. It does seem to keep those places more moisturized than my normal lotion. One thing I will say, this is 14oz. I didn&#x27;t realize how big that would be, but when I got it I died laughing. This thing is massive! Will definitely last you a looong time!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It feels great on.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use different products of Pond&#x27;s a lot, and this is a nice product. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something thats really rich in consistency (what you usually get from Pond&#x27;s,) then this is not for you. This cream is more light in consistency but really moisturizes like it says. If you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight, moisturizing, and great in smell, then go for this product. Oh yeah, this cream is also scented, not like other Pond&#x27;s creams. So, overall, a great product to use, but be prepared that it&#x27;s not your average Pond&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> love this product, it makes your face feel alive</li>
            <li> The best make-up remover I owned.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because everyone talks about how good Pond&#x27;s is but it just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I have oily skin though so maybe I should have purchased the original formula of an oily skin formula if there is one.  I love the scent and the cooling feel of the cream on my skin but it left me feeling slightly greasy so I had to stop using it.  Updated 6/09/15 After writing my original review where I said that this didn&#x27;t work for me, I have upgraded my rating from a 3 to a 4.  Originally I used the product only on my face, but since I didn&#x27;t want to let it go to waste, I tried it as a body moisturizer and I like it much better.  It soaks quickly into my skin and leaves it smooth and feeling very hydrated.  I know some people think the smell is &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; but I love it so I am happy to have found a use for this.  I am happy enough with it that I might even re-purchase it as my go to nightly body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Why discontinue when a good thing is selling?  Perfect for my face, feet and loving it! More product than the regular container.</li>
            <li> This product is very light but it does a great job moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish on your skin like some moisturizers do. I have eczema and occasionally get dry patches on my face under each eye. I have not experienced the dry patched since using this moisturizer. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This product it truly the fountain of youth. I have seen a major difference in my skin ever since the first day I started using it. Love love love it. and it is very inexpensive and does the job!! xo</li>
            <li> This cream did not absorb very well and had a strange scent. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad scent but it was just odd to me. I would not purchase this cream again. I am not sure I will even be able to finish the container as it has no benefit to me. Maybe I can use it on my feet or something. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face anymore though.</li>
            <li> Definitely way better than the old Pond&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like the way it use to be.  It&#x27;s so easy to apply on and smell good too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I use it in the morning and also night.  It keeps your skin soft and hydrated.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> The best hydrating cream of all ponds products... Use it all over my body like lotion.. Non greasy and easily get absorbed... Silky and softens the skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much struggles with skin most of my life. I used Neutrogena Day Moisturizer and Night Cream for years, as recommended by a friend. Both made my face shinny. So I&#x27;d have to powder up to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ponds feels so light. It&#x27;s cool to the skin and doesn&#x27;t make it shinny or oily :) It keeps my skin smooth without me having to put powder on. I love it! And it smells like aloe, just very lightly. You can smells it when you first put it on, which feels refreshing and clean to me. After a minute or so, there&#x27;s no fragrance. I use it day &amp; night :)</li>
            <li> this is great for wrinkles, pimples, and dry skin,&lt;br /&gt;first  i use  reg  noxema  on my face, then i wash it off with hot water,&lt;br /&gt;then  i apply this &amp; i leave it on for few min,&lt;br /&gt; ITS GREAT !!&lt;br /&gt;makes my face feel good,&lt;br /&gt;but like i said,&lt;br /&gt;i use noxema  first,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this,&lt;br /&gt;also  you can  FIND THIS IN SOME STORES  ( NOT ALL STORES CARRY THIS  THO  )&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN REG  PONDS.</li>
            <li> On my way to Tromsø Norway by plain, they confiscated my lovely Ponds Caring Classic Cream, which I had bought from the US, and which I have had for a long time. Well, I just have to import another, I thought that was an easy match. But I was wrong. Amazon, where I use to buy books, and is an the easy way to buy this and that from, if you live in Norway, are selling the Ponds creams. FANTASTIC!! But Amazon will not sell me the cream, don&#x27;t ask me why. So I had to buy another, and my choice fell on this. But this cream stinks heavily of something very artificial and it has a shiny artificial color. All in all it seems too arificial to put on our face. I will not use this cream, and not give it away, but throw it in the garbage. I will use the other cream I bought, the Ponds Clarant B3, which does not stink, and have no colour. Thank you. So, sorry to say, this cream is not for use on a human skin - I think of canser when I see it.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 months now. I use it as a night cream and apply it after I wash my face. It&#x27;s lightweight compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used and my skin absorbs it quickly. A little goes a long way! It moisturizes my face without making it feel greasy. When I run out, I will definitely be getting more!</li>
            <li> All is as it should be</li>
            <li> Great on my legs after shaving! After shaving, my skin gets a little bit irritated, so when I get out of the shower I put on this lotion. It soothes my skin instantly and refreshes it at the same time! Would recommend this for an after shaving lotion or anyone!</li>
            <li> Came quick and was very happy with my product</li>
            <li> Inexpensive cream and does the job, particularly when used in cold weather environments where skin gets very dry.  Use it all the time but, and other than Amazon, have a hard time finding it on local shelves .</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my sin feeling super soft and moisturized! It&#x27;s not greasy which is a big plus for me since I have super oily skin!</li>
            <li> Does a good job moisturizing my face. Use it daily in combination of my facial cleanser and sun screen. I&#x27;m still using this since 5+months ago and I still have some left.</li>
            <li> This Smells like mens shaving cream. I should have paid attention to The prior reviews about The consistency of The product. It is lotion in jar form. Got refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, it gives my skin a younger healthier look. It makes my skin feel real smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream for 35 years</li>
            <li> Amazing results, great price, great quality!</li>
