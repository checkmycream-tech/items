            <li>These are so good....</li>
            <li>Pricing was fair as well.</li>
            <li>And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze  the color ring onto the bottom of the head...</li>
            <li>I have used these heads before and always got good service from them.</li>
            <li>I expect these will be as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d rate these a good purchase.  </li>

            <li>&quot; they fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>That seemed fair</li>
            <li>good merchant to deal with and have no problem ordering from him again.</li>
            <li>Was looking in the store where we purchased unit, but could not find the replacement heads, so decided to go on line and found them at a good price and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought two packages of these and none were any good.  </li>
            <li>so it fit perfectly into the motor.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on schedule and was in good order.  </li>
            <li>If you need a good toothbrush head, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>The trick with these tooth brushes is to KEEP brushing for a good minute to 2 minutes ....</li>
            <li>Good price for a good product.  </li>
            <li>It makes sense to get a good price for a disposable part.</li>
            <li>These heads fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are just as good as the one that comes along with the tooth-brush.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are as good as the one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price and with free shipping no one came even close to their price.</li>
            <li>Because it is that good.</li>
            <li>It was the best deal I could find for genuine, Oral-B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Good choice for the electric toothbrush</li>

            <li>While I have to agree that the product description lacks clarity, I took a gamble based on the picture and was happy to receive heads that fit my system.</li>

            <li>My teeth feel amazing, and my gums are thoroughly cleaned, yet not sore.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit great and work well.</li>
            <li>You can try on your own if you want</li>
            <li>If you own a Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush, you&#x27;ll need these.</li>
            <li>Target now also sells their own brand of \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; replacement brushes under the label \\&quot;Up and Up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have used this kind of brush head for about 6 month</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get 4 heads instead of 3 in a lot of packages.</li>
            <li>Works great as it is an original replacement head for my toothbrush that my girlfriend CK bought me.</li>
            <li>They work great to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular model because of its lower price, expecting to receive the best bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand and they fit great.  </li>
            <li>WE GOT GREAT SERVICE FROM THIS COMPANY AND RECEIVED THE BRUSH HEADS QUICKLY.  </li>

            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral B EB17-4 Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads (4 FlexiSoft Adult Refills)]]The brushes are excellent and work well with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The right product and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How nice it is to have a very clean mouth</li>
            <li>i bought this for my electric tooth brush replacement, and oral b is alway has good reputation of making tooth brush, but please stay away with this one that sold here (Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)&lt;br /&gt;).</li>
            <li>good clean in just two minutes.  </li>
            <li>These are good and the spinning works to make you feel clean in the mouth, but your teeth won&#x27;t be any whiter.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the product, the toothbrushes came securely sealed in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>The price was great but the first brush head broke within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>There are some alternative specialized brushes you can buy, but I like these general ones best.</li>
            <li>This is the first time we have experienced problems with the brush heads.</li>
            <li>I thought they were great a first.</li>
            <li>Some prices are too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>This deal (on-line) was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>These are good brushes, love the way they clean.</li>
            <li>These sell for much more in the stores and along with the great price, was very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>VEry cheap also</li>
            <li>Excellent fresh, smooth, clean, polished feeling.</li>
            <li>The Oral B electric tooth brush changed my dental visits from, \\&quot;you need to brush better and floss more to improve the health of your</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m seeing it from many many people besides myself.</li>
            <li>I love this product,perfect for kids.</li>
            <li>I have always been well satisfied with Oral B products.</li>
            <li>I am always satisfied shopping @</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy these, they are cheaper, sure, but I bought them and</li>
            <li>I have uesd the Oral-B precision tooth brush for years and love it.</li>
            <li>My dentist says that most mechanical brushes aren&#x27;t any better than manual ones, except in the case of circular ones like these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal.</li>
            <li>I love these heads for my oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B electric toothbrush for a while now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>SURE IT SAYS SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads are much better than those so called OEM ones I got from ebay.  </li>
            <li>looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense).</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the return policy allows me to return it after so many months.</li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads do have an Oral-B logo on them, but the quality seems to be more in line with some no-name knockoffs that I have used.</li>
            <li>more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and would order again.  </li>
            <li>I like the quality of these brush heads better than the one that came with my tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I have used thia product for many years and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B brush heads are better made and made specifically for the product.</li>
            <li>I am just happy to receive them and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find that Amazon.com is the place to get these toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>I will definately be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love getting 4 of them.  </li>
            <li>much much better bicouse</li>
            <li>You better off buying them at a store.</li>
            <li>Love the color coding on the bristles - nothing I like better than not having to remember when I started using my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really love this toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I am glad I ordered these, and will do so again when it is time.</li>
            <li>I love it .... plus love that Amazon has these brush heads for cheaper than Target or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I have used many of these heads and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>They are the real thing and work great.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth oscillations, no wiggling, etc.  </li>
            <li>Floss-action: Not horrible, but</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; is a gimmick, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B brush heads for many years but have never tried this version.</li>
            <li>These are not the after market ones that everyone else was selling for more money.</li>
            <li>My dentist advised that I needed to brush better.  </li>
            <li>Miles better than cheaper battery powered brushes.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s somewhat gratifying to write a satisfied review.</li>
            <li>What more do you want.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B electric toothbrushes are great toothbrushes and these are the real Oral-B replacement heads for them.</li>
            <li>I am sure you must know about the flaw in this product by now.  </li>
            <li>BETTER THAN HAND BRUSH HEADS</li>
            <li>so I ordered some more.</li>
            <li>A good deal - right?  </li>
            <li>The store brands doesn&#x27;t fit the handle as good as the original ones do ....</li>
            <li>But in case they use this review for the cheap knock-off, too, consider before buying:  if the price is too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>The price was good and delivery was better than I hoped, so what&#x27;s not to like ;-).</li>
            <li>Some rate it higher than the Sonicare in getting good results.</li>
            <li>Product looks like the original, however, all 4 brushes broke after 2 days of usage each!</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head 4 Count, perfect fit for her device.  </li>
            <li>transaction was fast and most of all good deal.</li>
            <li>We were surprised and more than happy to receive apologized emails from Amazon and the supplier along with [] for our inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>These brush heads are only good for one time use and they are good to go in the trash.</li>
            <li>I would expect this better price when not in a \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; store, so I feel that I got a good price on the real thing.  </li>
            <li>They are sturdy, high quality original Oral B brush heads that are holding up beautifully, I have about 10 days of 2-3 sturdy brushings per day.  </li>
            <li>There was no difference between them and the original that came with the brush, and the price was phenomenal (because most of these heads are unreasonably expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is very good but basic for a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The mix of different brush lengths and material makes for a very good cleaning of your teeth.</li>
            <li>The old ones worked great.</li>
            <li>Ordering the 4-head deal is great, however, when mine arrived,&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was quite old and worn-out looking.  </li>
            <li>Suggestion to Amazon: find better suppliers that sell genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the product description and get the heads that ship free from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Arrived when expected in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with these so far.  </li>
            <li>Be sure use the gentler setting on the handle for them, and use light pressure.  </li>
            <li>I use this exact brush for my own kids, and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Was worried about these fitting as sometimes the replacements never quite fit well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real laugh.  </li>
            <li>This is impressive because I love black coffee, strong tea and cola beverages.</li>
            <li>years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good to clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d add my vote to the many reviewers before me:  this product did NOT perform as well as the original heads that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to know when it&#x27;s done too, since you can tell by the color of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in your mouth and can easily be swallowed.</li>
            <li>These brush heads were easy to install</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B Precision Clean brushes for many years and never had a problem - until I got a pack from Amazon this sprint.</li>
            <li>I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having these brushes available on line and promptly delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li>And as a result, I am happy to report that after buying this 4-pack of Oral-b brush heads through Amazon directly, I received the genuine oral-b product - made in Germany.  </li>
            <li>but they sure are clean.</li>
            <li>I love the way they clean.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year.</li>
            <li>Works really good except the brushes wear out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good brushes and a new head</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes as replacement for used brushes and they work fine.</li>
            <li>I bought these as replacement heads, haven&#x27;t needed to use them yet, so I assume they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>rec&#x27;d these in fine condition.</li>
            <li>They work fine on all three of the Oral-B toothbrushes my family uses.  </li>
            <li>Hey it works and does a fine job.</li>
            <li>also I&#x27;m always...amazed at how quick I receive items from Amazon!~</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time - no one likes pain in a dentist&#x27;s chair, and my exams are always great</li>
            <li>The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren&#x27;t worth what they charge for them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This replacement brush makes a lot of noise and the brush head doesn&#x27;t spin as strong as the original one I had.</li>
            <li>there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was cheap and the brushes arrived as described.</li>
            <li>Great bang for your buck especially in this economy.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are widely available, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH</li>
            <li>The supplier contact us immediately offered for free exchanges and free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered before brush heads for my ProfessionalCare that fit.</li>
            <li>This allows her to start brushing before she gets advanced motor skills.  </li>
            <li>The description says these heads fit ALL ORAL B</li>
            <li>and they confirmed.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and they were more than happy to replace the broken toothbrush heads (which have been perfect so far).</li>
            <li>Amazon claims that \\&quot;The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\\</li>
            <li>br /&gt;were confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 months&lt;</li>
            <li>Brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li>I would never purchase these again even though they are cheaper, you get what you pay for here, cheap substandard brusheads.</li>
            <li>I believe it is a genuine Oral-B and not a look-a-like knockoff.</li>
            <li>I hope this review will keep you from wasting YOUR time and money on the cheap imitations.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it was so tempting to get this cheap \\&quot;thought to be original\\&quot; alternative.</li>
            <li>ones I received appear genuine and have held up so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li>Fit my brush well</li>
            <li>After trying all the different Oral-B brush heads, and even a pack of generic brush heads, I keep coming back to this one because it has the best reach and the best performance.  </li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B for about 18 years and enjoy their products.</li>
            <li>Genuine replacement brush heads for my electric tooth brush at a reduced price and shipped to me when I need them.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap, however.</li>
            <li>I will look for genuine replacements.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B electric brush does such a great job.</li>
            <li>They fit and work like genuine</li>
            <li>The brush head that came originally with the toothbrush works perfectly fine until I got these.</li>
            <li>Oral B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brushes fit perfectly on my Oral B Professional Care&lt;br /&gt;battery operated rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much to say about them; they work great and make my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!!!</li>
            <li>As for me, my dentists have been very complimentary</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush gets the fresh from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>they clean well, but seem to lack the automatic wear indicators found in genuine Braun brush heads; are they counterfeit?</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty fast, looked good.</li>
            <li>Significant difference is observed compare to the original brush head come with the toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li>They are the original replacement parts for my electric toothbrush and work as they should.  </li>
            <li>The price was low, and after reading on the internet that this product is frequently pirated (a cheap copy of the original), these turned out to be original with the excellent quality you expect from Oral B.</li>
            <li>The brushes are identical to the original but when used will&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>These fit perfectly, and are marked as original product; at a fraction of the cost in local stores.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 packs of them myself and they&#x27;re real authentic Oral-B brush heads, solidly built.  </li>
            <li>I would like to post a picture of the original brush and the one Amazon sold me, but I cannot upload a picture (or do not know how to) and cannot be bothered to make and upload a video.  </li>
            <li>However, the ones I purchased look like the original ones</li>
            <li>they are original&#x27;s from oral b..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original stuff</li>
            <li>Out of the package of four brushes, The first one I used was OK.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but doesn&#x27;t feel as nifty as the original I bought before, even though they are labeled as originals.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought the unit on the advice of my Dentist.</li>
            <li>Take my advice and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time looking for a better price unless you are willing to buy knock-off replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These are not copies, original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>While they&#x27;re no match for the original, they still get the JOB done.</li>
            <li>The package of brushes purchased here worked as well as the original that came with the Oral-B,and worked with any problems.</li>
            <li>I like how they really clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are cheaply made and quickly develop a gap between the brushing head and the head retainer.  </li>
            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]dentist suggested I try a power toothbrush</li>
            <li>I like how clean these things make my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li>We politely refused the offer and pointed out that we still be able to use the products, the Soft Heads may even cost more.</li>
            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to pay $18 to $20 for these brushes at Bed &amp; Bath until I spotted these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are made to clean the nooks and crannies  </li>
            <li>I prefer Precision Clean</li>
            <li>Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)  </li>
            <li>After brushing with these heads my teeth and mouth feel clean all over.</li>
            <li>The brushes work just like they are supposed to, my mouth and teeth feel clean after a two minute brushing.</li>
            <li>They are a good value as compared to replacement heads available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>They promptly issued a full refund once I contacted them about the problem.</li>
            <li>I doubt that they are true Oral B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>It is a good idea to keep several replacement heads in stock to replace every 3 months or when the color begins to fade from the brush head.</li>
            <li>I have never had one for more than 10 days or two weeks, very mindful of this weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good choice, my choppers aren&#x27;t pearly white</li>
            <li>and this claim seems to be true.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes are essential if your power toothbrush is to continue to do a good job.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I mean if you&#x27;ve already had the electric toothbrush, you already know the Oral-B heads are the best thing for it.</li>
            <li>I bought some extras so my husband and I could share the oralB professional Healthy Clean Precision Rechargeable electric toothbrush which these fit on.</li>
            <li>The color-indicators don&#x27;t fade too quickly, which allows you to get the full long-lasting use of your brush head.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money for the original brand.  </li>
            <li>You are lucky if you get a weeks use out of each head.  </li>
            <li>am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li>I have tried store brand replacement brush heads, but they tend to fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my brushes quickly.</li>
            <li>Even brushing just once a day, you&#x27;re lucky if you get a month out of them.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product that I was getting at a National chain Pharmacy but at a much more acceptable price and the addition of one more brush in the package.</li>
            <li>but you end up spending more and have a lot more aggrivation with the generic.</li>
            <li>get high grades from the dental hygentist &amp; dentist for healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>I am able to reach all of my teeth with ease and my mouth is left feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the price of this item, especially since there&#x27;s 4 in a pack.  </li>
            <li>No problem with the brushes fitting the heads, all operation is normal.  </li>
            <li>, it is a great buy compare to the local stores, I highly recommand it.</li>
            <li>and they last a long time and do a superb job.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty straightforward.  </li>
            <li>Ordered from Amazon as the supplier and it was exactly as I got with the original brush.  </li>
            <li>Be aware!</li>
            <li>The bursh heads in the first package didn&#x27;t fit correctly and were constantly falling off or catching my lip and pinching it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li>They fit the Orab-B brushes very well, unlike some generics I have tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a whiter smile, I would suggest the Sonicare and combine it with using this Oral-B Precision.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite Oral B brush head to use for my Triumph 5000.</li>
            <li>But the soft ones are better.</li>
            <li>Now my teeth feel fresh every day.</li>
            <li>Was worth buying the Oral B brand replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These are not even worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>No disappointment on any level.</li>
            <li>Hope it was worth it.</li>
            <li>But, getting the 4-count (as opposed to a 3-pack package) makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Make sure you find the best deal, because they&#x27;re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!</li>
            <li>Super safe and gentle on my very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>These brushes are better than the standard type, really clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>We bought this with the subscribe-n-save program and even with that, it&#x27;s fairly pricey compared to other deals I see offered.  </li>
            <li>I have 11 others to go through right now.  </li>
            <li>The vendor is reliable, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Received the packet right away.</li>
            <li>Have tried others &amp; they do not feel right in our mouths.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suspect because on another ocassion I bought a \\&quot;SANDISK\\&quot; memory stick (on eBay) that didn&#x27;t seem to work right.</li>
            <li>Right after I bought a package of these, the oral B toothbrush gave out.  </li>
            <li>and I hope it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>They clean very well and don&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>I also brush my tongue at the very end to clean it off anything that has accumulated overnight or after sleeping.</li>
            <li>They are the real Oral-B replacement  Precision Clean Brush Heads.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes were stiffer than the original, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer the new brushes.</li>
            <li>It used to be the Sensitive one, but I like this one more because it&#x27;s slightly bigger and the way the bristles are shaped works better with my braces</li>
            <li>that apparently isn&#x27;t carrying them any more, instead opting to carry the &amp;#34;gum massaging version&amp;#34; which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>Having bought online, more than once, cheap knock-offs of the Oral-B replacement brush heads (packaged and advertised as if they were the real thing), I can say that it is worth the extra money to get the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Have gone through 3 of the 4 in the pack much too quickly.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks these brush heads get more loose than the original head did in a year.  </li>
            <li>I DO MIND VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>I had been using an old head for a long time and when I first tried this one it felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing that much, but after two or three uses it feels great.</li>
            <li>and I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Shame on you AAFES, but all in all my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I just use a normal tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I used the original brush head for about 3 months before I decided I needed a new one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to pass up this product because of the great price so I tried them anyway.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re buying directly from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>So, by association, they are guilty-- of being accomplises to the electric tooth brush that is very really truly the best one out there.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly what i asked for.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely reorder.</li>
            <li>I receive the package on time, the item match exactly as it descripe.  </li>
            <li>so much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are not the real McCoy!</li>
            <li>Balking at the price, I decided to try amazon first.</li>
            <li>will buy more replacement heads from a different seller.</li>
            <li>The first one I used turned out to be defective.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and such looks authentic</li>
            <li>They do say they fit: Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality and AdvancePower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, these brushes are genuine Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li>i think its always better to buy the same as brush company, atleast you know it will protect your gum</li>
            <li>I could not believe how fast this product was shipped!  </li>
            <li>The first brush head started making a wierd noise and pinched my tongue and cheeks within four uses.</li>
            <li>and I was not made aware of that before my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I somehow found the first three</li>
            <li>aware of this issue.  </li>
            <li>My first brush broke up in just 4 or 5 uses.</li>
            <li>The first day the first brush head fell apart.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my latest order came with the white center bristles, the kind that you should be avoiding.</li>
            <li>The packaging looks legit, and before you use one for the first time, product seems legit.</li>
            <li>The cost in my local Walmart was better than three times the price for a package of three ao</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We have used the same electric toothbrush for many years.</li>
            <li>and I was not made aware of that before my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.</li>
            <li>The warning that came with the order should have been my first sign of what was to follow.  </li>
            <li>When using the first head, the insides pulled out when I pulled it from the brushing unit.</li>
            <li>Been a regular buyer of this product and have always been satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li>They fit my Braun Oral-B \\&quot;3D Action Plaque Remover\\&quot; model, and they also fit my husband&#x27;s Braun Oral-B \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Cost much more at the drug store for the same thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks OralB, Braun, and Amazon !</li>
            <li>these last 6 months or more per head.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are in Oral B package as sold in department stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Value in buying the four pack as replacements are readily available as the old heads are replaced.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think the most basic type of brush head would also be the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>A quality product that does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Much better than the generic product which doesn&#x27;t stay on my Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li>These Oral-B Vitality/Precision Clean heads are not the same quality as the original head that came with my Oral-B Vitality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my new Oral Toothbrush I had switched back to manual for a while.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I am not hard on brushes but let them float on the tooth surfaces without applying any significant pressure and used the ones that came with the brush, for a long time.  </li>
            <li>this purchase was very reasonable and smart.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever return items but for this product it&#x27;s just best to return it as these brushes definitely do not work anything like the originals!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean a new way to accomplish a daily function!</li>
            <li>I have used Oral B FlossAction, Precision Clean, and Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>you order these ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL PRECISION CLEAN replacement brush heads, you get a tall, slender, sealed retail package with the Oral-B brand on it.  </li>
            <li>But what I can tell you is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles to do a good job of actually brushing your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the right product, at very good price and the corrupt politicians did not collect any sales tax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sensitive heads, simply is too soft, it is good for sesentive gums.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting out with an electric toothbrush or have really sensitive gums, it may be a good idea to start with these, but eventually you&#x27;ll want to graduate to something with firmer (but still soft)</li>
            <li>We have the Oral B toothbrush so these are the new heads to keep new brushes available.  </li>
            <li>It came in a European packaging, and most certainly did *not* have the same build quality as the ones available in the US stores.</li>
            <li>As long as the second shipment is fine, I&#x27;m okay with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads are fragile and break easily.  </li>
            <li>Beat Costco by a large margin.  </li>
            <li>I certainly would never repeat the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It seems Precision Clean is the new name with a new model number.</li>
            <li>I have the same problem, with the brush head generally working, but it doesn&#x27;t fit securely to the drive shaft.  </li>
            <li>replacement brush heads work fine at a big discount .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used two of the heads, but they were absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of which, we have found these brushes to be completely fine, definitely comparable to what we&#x27;ve always used.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the cheap imitation brushes which do NOT work!  </li>
            <li>I have a powered brush which is hard to find replacement heads for but these work very well and at a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>, this is an amazing value, especially since they are the actual name brand, not a knock off.</li>
            <li>THANK SO MUCH</li>
            <li>The item I received looks like real Oral-B product made in Germany.</li>
            <li>This one is also very noisy.</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li>to, maybe 3-6 months if you use them very frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go to Sams Club and get the real Oral B products.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amzn/UPS</li>
            <li>My mom finds these too much for her</li>
            <li>advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the reviews about \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; of this.  </li>
            <li>This one is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>The second one can&#x27;t even fit my Oral-B Vitality</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;No more broken/wobbly brush heads after two weeks of use as I experienced with the fake product or having the metal pin break out of the back of the brush head and end up between your cheek and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it is sold by and shipped from Amazon, you&#x27;ll get the real oral-b product.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how fast they came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>Your service was very prompt.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This can be very costly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this part were made of stainless and imbedded in the plastic (like the pin that secures the head)</li>
            <li>If you are careful to ensure that Amazon is the seller, you should be well satisfied.</li>
            <li>&quot; bristles will get between your teeth unless you have gaps or you really smash the bristles against your gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks once again</li>
            <li>How much it cost to me a year for tooth brush?</li>
            <li>These were reasonably prices and we have used them repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>Whole family uses these.</li>
            <li>They are very durable.  </li>
            <li>If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station.</li>
            <li>Found the price on Amazon to be MUCH cheaper than the retailers.</li>
            <li>Each of the oral-L B heads fit different bases.  </li>
            <li>The important thing about this &amp;#34;standing order&amp;#34; is that they are sent regularly</li>
            <li>These seem like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I will only buy these directly through Amazon or in a reputable store from now</li>
            <li>The brushhead becomes completely loose and does not vibrate in a smooth motion only right after the first use!!</li>
            <li>Should have gotten the soft ones!!!</li>
            <li>Good deal, it save me a lot of money compair to local store and other on-line store.  </li>
            <li>These are the real thing -- just be sure that they are fulfilled and shipped by Amazon.com and not any other vendors.</li>
            <li>Comparing with 3-month suggested replacement life from original product, it is obvious which one is really cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush and my teeth are still clean everyday.</li>
            <li>I understand that I can return the item (not convenient as I am now travelling outside the US) which is a good policy, but the whole point is that Amazon sells counterfeit goods (in my case highly likely) which is a huge black mark for me ever considering another on-line purchase with them.  </li>
            <li>The product in Image 1, the original design, is not the same as Image 2, the changed design, which I received.</li>
            <li>I find this brush head better at getting into the corners than other brush heads in the oral b line.</li>
            <li>When the fourth brush head started sounding like the first two had before their pins fell out, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and asked for instructions to return them.  </li>
            <li>I was sure these were the same replacement heads that came with my original Braun toothbrush, but evidently not.  </li>
            <li>the Precision Clean heads, is not too hard, not too soft, every time I brush with it, I feel my tooth very fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>The head becomes loose very quickly and done not oscillate like the real McCoy.</li>
            <li>It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  </li>
            <li>We use 4 types of Oral B brushes - regular precision clean, polish, floss paddle brush, and the power tip.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads become loose very quickly.</li>
            <li>Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!)</li>
            <li>The price was too low to be true, just $11.65 a pack.</li>
            <li>The brush heads work perfectly, exactly what I needed to replace my old worn-out brush.</li>
            <li>Also I seem to get a lot more saliva/water from my mouth dripping down the side of brush onto the toothbrush handle and onto my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s good to know they don&#x27;t phase the old brushes out and make you buy whole new toothbrush every couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Last a very long time, and worth far more than what is charged here.</li>
            <li>The Braun Oral-B does a much better job and with less effort.</li>
            <li>dentist sure tells me it is working from years of previous check ups.</li>
            <li>I am a soldier stationed over seas and I always have to buy this product from our military store called \\&quot;AAFES\\&quot; but what surprised me the most about this product was the price I paid for this online.  </li>
            <li>Same tips I buy at more than double the cost at Target and elsewhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am lucky that i did not swallow the pin which seperated from the back of the brush head</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m pulling out this particular item from my Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li>only regret is that I did not purchace more at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Either the product was defective, or mail packaging wasn&#x27;t adequate, but the spring in the brush broke at the second use.</li>
            <li>I was concerned my model is getting older</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, but it shouldn&#x27;t be your main brush head.</li>
            <li>It fits our older Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Clean my teeth completely, no plack buildup, no sore and swollen gums when I use these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>FOR MANY BRUSHING.THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH,BUT IT DOES DO,WHAT IT IS DESIGNED FOR.</li>
            <li>As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, more interested in looking like the original than acting like</li>
            <li>They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  </li>
            <li>They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the normal quality of this product or just a defective batch.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  </li>
            <li>Long before the blue wear indicator bristles show that the brush needs replacement, I have had the top oscillating brush part fall off.</li>
            <li>AVOID at any cost and go for something in the normal price range.  </li>
            <li>AMAZON; you should stop selling these brushes until the SELLER proves that these units are actually made by ORAL-B.</li>
            <li>Yet, everything about the item appeard normal, including the packaging (which I compared with a store-bought unit).</li>
            <li>The brush rides in this pivot, and any side-pressure (unavoidable in normal brushing) breaks the plastic shell.</li>
            <li>only because I can&#x27;t afford another one right now.</li>
            <li>This one actually came apart and broke in two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.</li>
            <li>This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, I decided to order them and see what happens, and would return them if they didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>OK... the money was completely wasted on the cheap imitation brushes.  </li>
            <li>The head on the replacement brush became loose and wobbly after exactly 2 months of use on the first head that I&#x27;ve just replaced again.  </li>
            <li>In theory, it&#x27;s great--you should either be able to brush in half the time or get your teeth twice as clean in the same amount of time because of the massively increased bristle area.  </li>
            <li>Sure, they may be a little more expensive, but it is worth it not to worry about the head breaking or the metal bit coming out while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li>AND THEY SEND ME NEW ONCE.THE PACKAGE</li>
            <li>I had to throw the brush heads out and buy new ones on eBay from sellers with 100% feedback.</li>
            <li>These are exactky the quality I expect in Oral B products, they are working well with the new toothbrush</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase them from Amazon for the New Oral-B Toothbrush I just purchased.</li>
            <li>and so we  remember to take new brush heads for our Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise we forget to change to new brushes which reduces the value of cleaning our teeth.</li>
            <li>They even work on my older model toothbrush that is so old it isn&#x27;t even listed on Oral-B&#x27;s website any longer.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t very flexible so they don&#x27;t really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest.</li>
            <li>The cheap knock-offs break within a few weeks; the real thing lasts until it is worn out on the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I expected this things to last more than that.</li>
            <li>The first was considerably noisier than the original head, but not wanting to waste it, I continued to use it anyway.</li>
            <li>First use of these new heads, I knew the quality was not the same.</li>
            <li>But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right-</li>
            <li>brush heads are definitely genuine, however they look different than the picture shown here because Oral B have changed them recently, if you go on the Oral B website you&#x27;ll see pictures of the old brush heads and the new improved ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If only the first fell apart, we can say it is an \\&quot;accident\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush.  </li>
            <li>They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should.</li>
            <li>The original head lasted for several months, but these do not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought a 3 pack of these brush heads and the first one I used broke the first time I used it, the 2nd a week later</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the price returns to normal and is sold from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>However it is in a European languarge and not the same quality as the one that came with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I put on the first one and it broke the second time i used it.</li>
            <li>In the local retail stores near me, only a 3-pack (made in Ireland) is available for this price.  </li>
            <li>Even \\&quot;brand new\\&quot;, these flexisoft brush heads are softer than the old one before I threw it out!</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see if the brush will last for 3 months of brushing.</li>
            <li>It was getting expensive, buying brush head replacements at a local drugstore, so I checked Amazon and was happy to find these reasonably priced ones.  </li>
            <li>However, these appear to be exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve been purchasing at (warehouse store).  </li>
            <li>There are other heads that offer a more excelent cleaning because of added cleaning devices such as rubber cleaning pics that move alone with the brush itself.</li>
            <li>None of the heads I received fit properly...they would constantly become loose and come off while I was brushing.  </li>
            <li>: This one is intended more for an extra tight pass along the gumline and around the edges of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Hard to say I love my toothbrush, but these do work well in my Oral-B handle.</li>
            <li>I have so far used 2 of the 4 brushes.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last much longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used 2 of the 4 so far.</li>
            <li>The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have a busy life and ordering supplies like this saves us a lot of time and running around town.</li>
            <li>Vibrates, doesn&#x27;t spin, head loosens and pinches, one lasts about a week, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to discover it it was leaching metals or toxics.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads don&#x27;t hold up nearly as well as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so she buys the sensitive bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]  </li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to be old stock and brittle.</li>
            <li>I think I had just gotten used to old bristles.</li>
            <li>Amazon 2 day Prime arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>had a lose head that could not be fixed</li>
            <li>I bought these from stuff4you to replace the stock one that came with my toothbrush (it was getting old).</li>
            <li>Although replacing the brushes on electric toothbrushes seems a bit pricy, this model mimicks the professional brushes at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Buy the real Braun heads and forget out these generic ones.</li>
            <li>* Flexi-Soft (now called Sensitive)</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my 11 year old who wore braces, but now wears retainers.</li>
            <li>If you cannot it fixed, I suggest you take your name off of it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to receive this product only a few days after placing the order.</li>
            <li>Such a big price difference, I thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Went to purchase a single oral B precision clean head in local department store.</li>
            <li>The brush mechanism is SO loose that I am not really sure if my teeth are getting the same good brushing.  </li>
            <li>so I bought an Oral B. I have tried several different models and am currently using the Precision Clean Model.</li>
            <li>cordless electric toothbrudh with easily interchangeable heads, small bruch to get around the topography of the mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fine for me but is a bit tougher on the teeth then the ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>So many reviewers had problems with the generics that I decided to spend the ridiculous price for the Oral-B originals.</li>
            <li>Keep teeth clean and gums firm.</li>
            <li>Although the price was great and shipping fast, I&#x27;m disappointed in the disparity of how the product is represented.</li>
            <li>I had exactly the same experience as the last reviewer.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that some of the descriptions on the packages are in German first with English underneath.</li>
            <li>I received the second batch and all four brushes did the same as the first set.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days.  </li>
            <li>They have a slightly bigger head than ones in the past, but I find them to be more comforting and fitting(hard to explain).</li>
            <li>It tends to cause more of a beating on the teeth due to the design of the bristles, some long and some short, instead of all one length.</li>
            <li>My only gripe with the Oral-B Precision Clean brush heads is that they&#x27;re a bit pricey, even compared to the other types of Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine why an original product from Oral standard will have such a head which is so tough to fit and pull out from its unit.</li>
            <li>Now I am not sure what replacement heads to buy because I cannot trust Amazon&#x27;s description of what tooth brushes they fit.</li>
            <li>Once you use a Oral B tooth brush you wont go back to normal tooth brushes again.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the replacement brushes from my local Osco or Walgreens -- 3 brushes for $23.  </li>
            <li>Be careful, even though theses brush heads look exactly like all the others for Oral-B brushes, they doesn&#x27;t work with the \\&quot;ProfessionalCare\\</li>
            <li>was normally purchasing replacement heads at one of the &#x27;big box&#x27; outlets</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife had expected</li>
            <li>you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>It is compact enough to fit in their little mouth.  </li>
            <li>The brush that arrived at my house looks a bit different since it&#x27;s the new Oral-B replacement brush head, but it seems fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The merchant contacted the manufacter and advised that they would send a new brushhead and a return label to send the fauly merchantise back.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Oral-B and also bought these replacements at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I use my oral-B last 15 years and I always need to buy new brush heads</li>
            <li>These brush heads made in Germany work pretty well, except somehow they don&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as Oral-B brush heads</li>
            <li>These Braun brushheads look and feel like the real thing but simply do not perform the same.  </li>
            <li>I took the precaution of reading a ton of the poor reviews here, and made sure I was getting these directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got the brushes within a few days and there is absolutely no difference from the ones I paid more for.  </li>
            <li>The circular brush can easily \\&quot;slide\\&quot; around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>These brush heads are great, expensive, but they last long.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing these replacement heads from numerous outlets over the past several years and find the price here the most favorable.  </li>
            <li>There are two major problems with this product.</li>
            <li>but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these.</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for a clean mouth, teeth, and gums.</li>
            <li>There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.  </li>
            <li>After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together.  </li>
            <li>but in the future I will be buying the softer sensitive teeth bristles instead.</li>
            <li>: Bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t stimulate the gums well enough.  </li>
            <li>Tyr to get the extra soft bristle type if you can find them.  </li>
            <li>A couple of the reviews suggest that this four-pack is somehow a \\&quot;decontented\\&quot; version, but I certainly can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference from any other OEM replacements I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li>As noted in other reviews, each quickly became loose and started pinching my lips.</li>
            <li>They wobble and do not fit right.  </li>
            <li>remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.  </li>
            <li>I of course have no way of knowing if I got lucky, versus there are no more fakes being shipped.  </li>
            <li>there is a costly problem with the replacement heads, genuine Braun at that: after a few uses, the brushhead becomes loose and must be discarded.</li>
            <li>This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally.  </li>
            <li>The original btushes that came with the&lt;br /&gt;motor lasted at least three months and never did break but</li>
            <li>real oral B. Be careful!</li>
            <li>, the FlossAction head is big, has 4 floss rubber around the head, I am not sure it really floss your tooth when you brush, brushing means clean your tooth, I find the brushing action with FlossAction is too harsh to my gums.</li>
            <li>They are not too soft, not too hard - just right.  </li>
            <li>Better buy the original from Wal-Mart, even if it is expensive because that lasts!!</li>
            <li>I experiences the same problems as all others did: all brush heads became loose, metal rods fell off, pinched my and my wife&#x27;s lips several times, until the whole brush head would fall apart.</li>
            <li>After few weeks of light use, the brush head became loose and wobbling causing extra noise, it pinched my lips and tongue.  </li>
            <li>On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth).</li>
            <li>But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I want people to be aware that the brush heads might not fit on their brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra buck because these do not clean your teeth at all!</li>
            <li>I recieved a new single replacement brushhead but no return label to send the rest of the brushheads back for replacements.</li>
            <li>The first two replacement heads exploded at the back of the plastic head and a little metal pin dislodged in my mouth while I was brushing.  </li>
            <li>The first brush head started making excess noise and suddenly lost its little metal pin within four uses.  </li>
            <li>they do not, the package clearly states DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete OR Cross Action Power.</li>
            <li>Kids love to bite down hard on toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the store bought heads, other than the high price.  </li>
            <li>These replacements are formerly known as flexiSoft, which have white center bristles instead of the original green bristles.</li>
            <li>Our first ones lasted about 6 months, which is normal for us as long as I keep my \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; instincts at bay (the enamel-wearing hard brushing that my dental hygienist sister has worked me away</li>
            <li>The brush head pops up a little, leaving a large gap between the head and the motor.</li>
            <li>When the fourth brush head started doing like the first, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and promptly wrote a bad review.</li>
            <li>I would not recomment these, I would have rather spent the extra money to make the tooth brush as effective as it has been over the past few years.</li>
            <li>heads come a little loose after just a few uses, and have pinched the inside of my mouth more than once or twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alternatively the head could be more solid plastic, and less air, thereby allowing the lateral force to be taken up in the headshell instead of breaking the delicate tube.</li>
            <li>opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  </li>
            <li>each one of them broke (the moving brush part came loose) after about 2 weeks, far before the bristles were showing any sign of wear, so actually they turned out to be way more expensive</li>
            <li>A week or two later the little metal pin would fall out and the whole thing would fall apart in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Either this is a complete fake, or there was a huge fault at the factory - causing all of these 1-star reviews.</li>

            <li> Pricing was fair as well.</li>
            <li> And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze  the color ring onto the bottom of the head...</li>
            <li> I have used these heads before and always got good service from them.</li>

            <li> good merchant to deal with and have no problem ordering from him again.</li>

            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> The trick with these tooth brushes is to KEEP brushing for a good minute to 2 minutes ....</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product.  </li>
            <li> It makes sense to get a good price for a disposable part.</li>
            <li> These heads fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are just as good as the one that comes along with the tooth-brush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are as good as the one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price and with free shipping no one came even close to their price.</li>
            <li> Because it is that good.</li>
            <li> It was the best deal I could find for genuine, Oral-B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Good choice for the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The heads fit and work flawlessly.  </li>

            <li> Perfect replacements and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The merchant did the right thing but the manufacturer is not the greatest.</li>

            <li> they were more cheap !!!</li>
            <li> This clean head brush did a very good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>

            <li> Really pleased with the service!</li>
            <li> While I have to agree that the product description lacks clarity, I took a gamble based on the picture and was happy to receive heads that fit my system.</li>
            <li> but happy these are still available let alone inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing, and my gums are thoroughly cleaned, yet not sore.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit great and work well.</li>
            <li> You can try on your own if you want</li>
            <li> If you own a Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush, you&#x27;ll need these.</li>
            <li> Target now also sells their own brand of \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; replacement brushes under the label \\&quot;Up and Up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of brush head for about 6 month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to get 4 heads instead of 3 in a lot of packages.</li>
            <li> Works great as it is an original replacement head for my toothbrush that my girlfriend CK bought me.</li>
            <li> They work great to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular model because of its lower price, expecting to receive the best bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand and they fit great.  </li>
            <li> WE GOT GREAT SERVICE FROM THIS COMPANY AND RECEIVED THE BRUSH HEADS QUICKLY.  </li>

            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral B EB17-4 Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads (4 FlexiSoft Adult Refills)]]The brushes are excellent and work well with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The right product and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How nice it is to have a very clean mouth</li>
            <li> i bought this for my electric tooth brush replacement, and oral b is alway has good reputation of making tooth brush, but please stay away with this one that sold here (Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)&lt;br /&gt;).</li>
            <li> good clean in just two minutes.  </li>
            <li> These are good and the spinning works to make you feel clean in the mouth, but your teeth won&#x27;t be any whiter.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with the product, the toothbrushes came securely sealed in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> The price was great but the first brush head broke within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> There are some alternative specialized brushes you can buy, but I like these general ones best.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we have experienced problems with the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I thought they were great a first.</li>
            <li> Some prices are too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> This deal (on-line) was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> These are good brushes, love the way they clean.</li>
            <li> These sell for much more in the stores and along with the great price, was very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> VEry cheap also</li>
            <li> Excellent fresh, smooth, clean, polished feeling.</li>
            <li> The Oral B electric tooth brush changed my dental visits from, \\&quot;you need to brush better and floss more to improve the health of your</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m seeing it from many many people besides myself.</li>
            <li> I love this product,perfect for kids.</li>
            <li> I have always been well satisfied with Oral B products.</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied shopping @</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy these, they are cheaper, sure, but I bought them and</li>
            <li> I have uesd the Oral-B precision tooth brush for years and love it.</li>
            <li> My dentist says that most mechanical brushes aren&#x27;t any better than manual ones, except in the case of circular ones like these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal.</li>
            <li> I love these heads for my oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B electric toothbrush for a while now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> SURE IT SAYS SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads are much better than those so called OEM ones I got from ebay.  </li>
            <li> looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense).</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the return policy allows me to return it after so many months.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads do have an Oral-B logo on them, but the quality seems to be more in line with some no-name knockoffs that I have used.</li>
            <li> more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and would order again.  </li>
            <li> I like the quality of these brush heads better than the one that came with my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have used thia product for many years and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B brush heads are better made and made specifically for the product.</li>
            <li> I am just happy to receive them and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find that Amazon.com is the place to get these toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I will definately be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love getting 4 of them.  </li>
            <li> much much better bicouse</li>
            <li> You better off buying them at a store.</li>
            <li> Love the color coding on the bristles - nothing I like better than not having to remember when I started using my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I am glad I ordered these, and will do so again when it is time.</li>
            <li> I love it .... plus love that Amazon has these brush heads for cheaper than Target or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have used many of these heads and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> They are the real thing and work great.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth oscillations, no wiggling, etc.  </li>
            <li> Floss-action: Not horrible, but</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; is a gimmick, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B brush heads for many years but have never tried this version.</li>
            <li> These are not the after market ones that everyone else was selling for more money.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised that I needed to brush better.  </li>
            <li> Miles better than cheaper battery powered brushes.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s somewhat gratifying to write a satisfied review.</li>
            <li> What more do you want.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrushes are great toothbrushes and these are the real Oral-B replacement heads for them.</li>
            <li> I am sure you must know about the flaw in this product by now.  </li>
            <li> BETTER THAN HAND BRUSH HEADS</li>
            <li> so I ordered some more.</li>
            <li> A good deal - right?  </li>
            <li> The store brands doesn&#x27;t fit the handle as good as the original ones do ....</li>
            <li> But in case they use this review for the cheap knock-off, too, consider before buying:  if the price is too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> The price was good and delivery was better than I hoped, so what&#x27;s not to like ;-).</li>
            <li> Some rate it higher than the Sonicare in getting good results.</li>
            <li> Product looks like the original, however, all 4 brushes broke after 2 days of usage each!</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head 4 Count, perfect fit for her device.  </li>
            <li> transaction was fast and most of all good deal.</li>
            <li> We were surprised and more than happy to receive apologized emails from Amazon and the supplier along with [] for our inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> These brush heads are only good for one time use and they are good to go in the trash.</li>
            <li> I would expect this better price when not in a \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; store, so I feel that I got a good price on the real thing.  </li>
            <li> They are sturdy, high quality original Oral B brush heads that are holding up beautifully, I have about 10 days of 2-3 sturdy brushings per day.  </li>
            <li> There was no difference between them and the original that came with the brush, and the price was phenomenal (because most of these heads are unreasonably expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is very good but basic for a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The mix of different brush lengths and material makes for a very good cleaning of your teeth.</li>
            <li> The old ones worked great.</li>
            <li> Ordering the 4-head deal is great, however, when mine arrived,&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was quite old and worn-out looking.  </li>
            <li> Suggestion to Amazon: find better suppliers that sell genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the product description and get the heads that ship free from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with these so far.  </li>
            <li> Be sure use the gentler setting on the handle for them, and use light pressure.  </li>
            <li> I use this exact brush for my own kids, and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Was worried about these fitting as sometimes the replacements never quite fit well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a real laugh.  </li>
            <li> This is impressive because I love black coffee, strong tea and cola beverages.</li>
            <li> years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good to clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d add my vote to the many reviewers before me:  this product did NOT perform as well as the original heads that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy to know when it&#x27;s done too, since you can tell by the color of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in your mouth and can easily be swallowed.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were easy to install</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Precision Clean brushes for many years and never had a problem - until I got a pack from Amazon this sprint.</li>
            <li> I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having these brushes available on line and promptly delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li> And as a result, I am happy to report that after buying this 4-pack of Oral-b brush heads through Amazon directly, I received the genuine oral-b product - made in Germany.  </li>
            <li> but they sure are clean.</li>
            <li> I love the way they clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year.</li>
            <li> Works really good except the brushes wear out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are good brushes and a new head</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes as replacement for used brushes and they work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these as replacement heads, haven&#x27;t needed to use them yet, so I assume they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d these in fine condition.</li>
            <li> They work fine on all three of the Oral-B toothbrushes my family uses.  </li>
            <li> Hey it works and does a fine job.</li>
            <li> also I&#x27;m always...amazed at how quick I receive items from Amazon!~</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time - no one likes pain in a dentist&#x27;s chair, and my exams are always great</li>
            <li> The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren&#x27;t worth what they charge for them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This replacement brush makes a lot of noise and the brush head doesn&#x27;t spin as strong as the original one I had.</li>
            <li> there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was cheap and the brushes arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck especially in this economy.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are widely available, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH</li>
            <li> The supplier contact us immediately offered for free exchanges and free shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered before brush heads for my ProfessionalCare that fit.</li>
            <li> This allows her to start brushing before she gets advanced motor skills.  </li>
            <li> The description says these heads fit ALL ORAL B</li>
            <li> and they confirmed.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and they were more than happy to replace the broken toothbrush heads (which have been perfect so far).</li>
            <li> Amazon claims that \\&quot;The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\\</li>
            <li> br /&gt;were confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 months&lt;</li>
            <li> Brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li> I would never purchase these again even though they are cheaper, you get what you pay for here, cheap substandard brusheads.</li>
            <li> I believe it is a genuine Oral-B and not a look-a-like knockoff.</li>
            <li> I hope this review will keep you from wasting YOUR time and money on the cheap imitations.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it was so tempting to get this cheap \\&quot;thought to be original\\&quot; alternative.</li>
            <li> ones I received appear genuine and have held up so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li> Fit my brush well</li>
            <li> After trying all the different Oral-B brush heads, and even a pack of generic brush heads, I keep coming back to this one because it has the best reach and the best performance.  </li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B for about 18 years and enjoy their products.</li>
            <li> Genuine replacement brush heads for my electric tooth brush at a reduced price and shipped to me when I need them.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap, however.</li>
            <li> I will look for genuine replacements.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric brush does such a great job.</li>
            <li> They fit and work like genuine</li>
            <li> The brush head that came originally with the toothbrush works perfectly fine until I got these.</li>
            <li> Oral B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brushes fit perfectly on my Oral B Professional Care&lt;br /&gt;battery operated rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say about them; they work great and make my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!!!</li>
            <li> As for me, my dentists have been very complimentary</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush gets the fresh from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> they clean well, but seem to lack the automatic wear indicators found in genuine Braun brush heads; are they counterfeit?</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty fast, looked good.</li>
            <li> Significant difference is observed compare to the original brush head come with the toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li> They are the original replacement parts for my electric toothbrush and work as they should.  </li>
            <li> The price was low, and after reading on the internet that this product is frequently pirated (a cheap copy of the original), these turned out to be original with the excellent quality you expect from Oral B.</li>
            <li> The brushes are identical to the original but when used will&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly, and are marked as original product; at a fraction of the cost in local stores.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of them myself and they&#x27;re real authentic Oral-B brush heads, solidly built.  </li>
            <li> I would like to post a picture of the original brush and the one Amazon sold me, but I cannot upload a picture (or do not know how to) and cannot be bothered to make and upload a video.  </li>
            <li> However, the ones I purchased look like the original ones</li>
            <li> they are original&#x27;s from oral b..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original stuff</li>
            <li> Out of the package of four brushes, The first one I used was OK.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but doesn&#x27;t feel as nifty as the original I bought before, even though they are labeled as originals.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought the unit on the advice of my Dentist.</li>
            <li> Take my advice and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time looking for a better price unless you are willing to buy knock-off replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These are not copies, original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> While they&#x27;re no match for the original, they still get the JOB done.</li>
            <li> The package of brushes purchased here worked as well as the original that came with the Oral-B,and worked with any problems.</li>
            <li> I like how they really clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are cheaply made and quickly develop a gap between the brushing head and the head retainer.  </li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]dentist suggested I try a power toothbrush</li>
            <li> I like how clean these things make my mouth feel.  </li>
            <li> We politely refused the offer and pointed out that we still be able to use the products, the Soft Heads may even cost more.</li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to pay $18 to $20 for these brushes at Bed &amp; Bath until I spotted these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are made to clean the nooks and crannies  </li>
            <li> I prefer Precision Clean</li>
            <li> Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)  </li>
            <li> After brushing with these heads my teeth and mouth feel clean all over.</li>
            <li> The brushes work just like they are supposed to, my mouth and teeth feel clean after a two minute brushing.</li>
            <li> They are a good value as compared to replacement heads available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> They promptly issued a full refund once I contacted them about the problem.</li>
            <li> I doubt that they are true Oral B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It is a good idea to keep several replacement heads in stock to replace every 3 months or when the color begins to fade from the brush head.</li>
            <li> I have never had one for more than 10 days or two weeks, very mindful of this weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good choice, my choppers aren&#x27;t pearly white</li>
            <li> and this claim seems to be true.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are essential if your power toothbrush is to continue to do a good job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I mean if you&#x27;ve already had the electric toothbrush, you already know the Oral-B heads are the best thing for it.</li>
            <li> I bought some extras so my husband and I could share the oralB professional Healthy Clean Precision Rechargeable electric toothbrush which these fit on.</li>
            <li> The color-indicators don&#x27;t fade too quickly, which allows you to get the full long-lasting use of your brush head.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money for the original brand.  </li>
            <li> You are lucky if you get a weeks use out of each head.  </li>
            <li> am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li> I have tried store brand replacement brush heads, but they tend to fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes quickly.</li>
            <li> Even brushing just once a day, you&#x27;re lucky if you get a month out of them.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product that I was getting at a National chain Pharmacy but at a much more acceptable price and the addition of one more brush in the package.</li>
            <li> but you end up spending more and have a lot more aggrivation with the generic.</li>
            <li> get high grades from the dental hygentist &amp; dentist for healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> I am able to reach all of my teeth with ease and my mouth is left feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the price of this item, especially since there&#x27;s 4 in a pack.  </li>
            <li> No problem with the brushes fitting the heads, all operation is normal.  </li>
            <li> , it is a great buy compare to the local stores, I highly recommand it.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time and do a superb job.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty straightforward.  </li>
            <li> Ordered from Amazon as the supplier and it was exactly as I got with the original brush.  </li>
            <li> Be aware!</li>
            <li> The bursh heads in the first package didn&#x27;t fit correctly and were constantly falling off or catching my lip and pinching it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li> They fit the Orab-B brushes very well, unlike some generics I have tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a whiter smile, I would suggest the Sonicare and combine it with using this Oral-B Precision.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite Oral B brush head to use for my Triumph 5000.</li>
            <li> But the soft ones are better.</li>
            <li> Now my teeth feel fresh every day.</li>
            <li> Was worth buying the Oral B brand replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These are not even worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> No disappointment on any level.</li>
            <li> Hope it was worth it.</li>
            <li> But, getting the 4-count (as opposed to a 3-pack package) makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Make sure you find the best deal, because they&#x27;re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!</li>
            <li> Super safe and gentle on my very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than the standard type, really clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> We bought this with the subscribe-n-save program and even with that, it&#x27;s fairly pricey compared to other deals I see offered.  </li>
            <li> I have 11 others to go through right now.  </li>
            <li> The vendor is reliable, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Received the packet right away.</li>
            <li> Have tried others &amp; they do not feel right in our mouths.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suspect because on another ocassion I bought a \\&quot;SANDISK\\&quot; memory stick (on eBay) that didn&#x27;t seem to work right.</li>
            <li> Right after I bought a package of these, the oral B toothbrush gave out.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> They clean very well and don&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> I also brush my tongue at the very end to clean it off anything that has accumulated overnight or after sleeping.</li>
            <li> They are the real Oral-B replacement  Precision Clean Brush Heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes were stiffer than the original, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer the new brushes.</li>
            <li> It used to be the Sensitive one, but I like this one more because it&#x27;s slightly bigger and the way the bristles are shaped works better with my braces</li>
            <li> that apparently isn&#x27;t carrying them any more, instead opting to carry the &amp;#34;gum massaging version&amp;#34; which I do not like.  </li>
            <li> Having bought online, more than once, cheap knock-offs of the Oral-B replacement brush heads (packaged and advertised as if they were the real thing), I can say that it is worth the extra money to get the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Have gone through 3 of the 4 in the pack much too quickly.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks these brush heads get more loose than the original head did in a year.  </li>
            <li> I DO MIND VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I had been using an old head for a long time and when I first tried this one it felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing that much, but after two or three uses it feels great.</li>
            <li> and I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Shame on you AAFES, but all in all my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I just use a normal tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I used the original brush head for about 3 months before I decided I needed a new one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pass up this product because of the great price so I tried them anyway.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you&#x27;re buying directly from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> So, by association, they are guilty-- of being accomplises to the electric tooth brush that is very really truly the best one out there.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I received exactly what i asked for.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely reorder.</li>
            <li> I receive the package on time, the item match exactly as it descripe.  </li>
            <li> so much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are not the real McCoy!</li>
            <li> Balking at the price, I decided to try amazon first.</li>
            <li> will buy more replacement heads from a different seller.</li>
            <li> The first one I used turned out to be defective.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and such looks authentic</li>
            <li> They do say they fit: Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality and AdvancePower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these brushes are genuine Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li> i think its always better to buy the same as brush company, atleast you know it will protect your gum</li>
            <li> I could not believe how fast this product was shipped!  </li>
            <li> The first brush head started making a wierd noise and pinched my tongue and cheeks within four uses.</li>
            <li> and I was not made aware of that before my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I somehow found the first three</li>
            <li> aware of this issue.  </li>
            <li> My first brush broke up in just 4 or 5 uses.</li>
            <li> The first day the first brush head fell apart.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my latest order came with the white center bristles, the kind that you should be avoiding.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks legit, and before you use one for the first time, product seems legit.</li>
            <li> The cost in my local Walmart was better than three times the price for a package of three ao</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We have used the same electric toothbrush for many years.</li>
            <li> and I was not made aware of that before my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.</li>
            <li> The warning that came with the order should have been my first sign of what was to follow.  </li>
            <li> When using the first head, the insides pulled out when I pulled it from the brushing unit.</li>
            <li> Been a regular buyer of this product and have always been satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> They fit my Braun Oral-B \\&quot;3D Action Plaque Remover\\&quot; model, and they also fit my husband&#x27;s Braun Oral-B \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Cost much more at the drug store for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks OralB, Braun, and Amazon !</li>
            <li> these last 6 months or more per head.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are in Oral B package as sold in department stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Value in buying the four pack as replacements are readily available as the old heads are replaced.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think the most basic type of brush head would also be the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> A quality product that does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Much better than the generic product which doesn&#x27;t stay on my Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These Oral-B Vitality/Precision Clean heads are not the same quality as the original head that came with my Oral-B Vitality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new Oral Toothbrush I had switched back to manual for a while.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure, I am not hard on brushes but let them float on the tooth surfaces without applying any significant pressure and used the ones that came with the brush, for a long time.  </li>
            <li> this purchase was very reasonable and smart.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever return items but for this product it&#x27;s just best to return it as these brushes definitely do not work anything like the originals!!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean a new way to accomplish a daily function!</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B FlossAction, Precision Clean, and Sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> you order these ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL PRECISION CLEAN replacement brush heads, you get a tall, slender, sealed retail package with the Oral-B brand on it.  </li>
            <li> But what I can tell you is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles to do a good job of actually brushing your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the right product, at very good price and the corrupt politicians did not collect any sales tax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sensitive heads, simply is too soft, it is good for sesentive gums.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out with an electric toothbrush or have really sensitive gums, it may be a good idea to start with these, but eventually you&#x27;ll want to graduate to something with firmer (but still soft)</li>
            <li> We have the Oral B toothbrush so these are the new heads to keep new brushes available.  </li>
            <li> It came in a European packaging, and most certainly did *not* have the same build quality as the ones available in the US stores.</li>
            <li> As long as the second shipment is fine, I&#x27;m okay with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are fragile and break easily.  </li>
            <li> Beat Costco by a large margin.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would never repeat the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It seems Precision Clean is the new name with a new model number.</li>
            <li> I have the same problem, with the brush head generally working, but it doesn&#x27;t fit securely to the drive shaft.  </li>
            <li> replacement brush heads work fine at a big discount .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two of the heads, but they were absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of which, we have found these brushes to be completely fine, definitely comparable to what we&#x27;ve always used.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the cheap imitation brushes which do NOT work!  </li>
            <li> I have a powered brush which is hard to find replacement heads for but these work very well and at a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li> , this is an amazing value, especially since they are the actual name brand, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> THANK SO MUCH</li>
            <li> The item I received looks like real Oral-B product made in Germany.</li>
            <li> This one is also very noisy.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li> to, maybe 3-6 months if you use them very frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go to Sams Club and get the real Oral B products.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amzn/UPS</li>
            <li> My mom finds these too much for her</li>
            <li> advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the reviews about \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; of this.  </li>
            <li> This one is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The second one can&#x27;t even fit my Oral-B Vitality</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;No more broken/wobbly brush heads after two weeks of use as I experienced with the fake product or having the metal pin break out of the back of the brush head and end up between your cheek and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it is sold by and shipped from Amazon, you&#x27;ll get the real oral-b product.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how fast they came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Fast service.  </li>
            <li> Your service was very prompt.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be very costly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this part were made of stainless and imbedded in the plastic (like the pin that secures the head)</li>
            <li> If you are careful to ensure that Amazon is the seller, you should be well satisfied.</li>
            <li> &quot; bristles will get between your teeth unless you have gaps or you really smash the bristles against your gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks once again</li>
            <li> How much it cost to me a year for tooth brush?</li>
            <li> These were reasonably prices and we have used them repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> Whole family uses these.</li>
            <li> They are very durable.  </li>
            <li> If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station.</li>
            <li> Found the price on Amazon to be MUCH cheaper than the retailers.</li>
            <li> Each of the oral-L B heads fit different bases.  </li>
            <li> The important thing about this &amp;#34;standing order&amp;#34; is that they are sent regularly</li>
            <li> These seem like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I will only buy these directly through Amazon or in a reputable store from now</li>
            <li> The brushhead becomes completely loose and does not vibrate in a smooth motion only right after the first use!!</li>
            <li> Should have gotten the soft ones!!!</li>
            <li> Good deal, it save me a lot of money compair to local store and other on-line store.  </li>
            <li> These are the real thing -- just be sure that they are fulfilled and shipped by Amazon.com and not any other vendors.</li>
            <li> Comparing with 3-month suggested replacement life from original product, it is obvious which one is really cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush and my teeth are still clean everyday.</li>
            <li> I understand that I can return the item (not convenient as I am now travelling outside the US) which is a good policy, but the whole point is that Amazon sells counterfeit goods (in my case highly likely) which is a huge black mark for me ever considering another on-line purchase with them.  </li>
            <li> The product in Image 1, the original design, is not the same as Image 2, the changed design, which I received.</li>
            <li> I find this brush head better at getting into the corners than other brush heads in the oral b line.</li>
            <li> When the fourth brush head started sounding like the first two had before their pins fell out, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and asked for instructions to return them.  </li>
            <li> I was sure these were the same replacement heads that came with my original Braun toothbrush, but evidently not.  </li>
            <li> the Precision Clean heads, is not too hard, not too soft, every time I brush with it, I feel my tooth very fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> The head becomes loose very quickly and done not oscillate like the real McCoy.</li>
            <li> It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  </li>
            <li> We use 4 types of Oral B brushes - regular precision clean, polish, floss paddle brush, and the power tip.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads become loose very quickly.</li>
            <li> Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!)</li>
            <li> The price was too low to be true, just $11.65 a pack.</li>
            <li> The brush heads work perfectly, exactly what I needed to replace my old worn-out brush.</li>
            <li> Also I seem to get a lot more saliva/water from my mouth dripping down the side of brush onto the toothbrush handle and onto my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s good to know they don&#x27;t phase the old brushes out and make you buy whole new toothbrush every couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Last a very long time, and worth far more than what is charged here.</li>
            <li> The Braun Oral-B does a much better job and with less effort.</li>
            <li> dentist sure tells me it is working from years of previous check ups.</li>
            <li> I am a soldier stationed over seas and I always have to buy this product from our military store called \\&quot;AAFES\\&quot; but what surprised me the most about this product was the price I paid for this online.  </li>
            <li> Same tips I buy at more than double the cost at Target and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am lucky that i did not swallow the pin which seperated from the back of the brush head</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m pulling out this particular item from my Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li> only regret is that I did not purchace more at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Either the product was defective, or mail packaging wasn&#x27;t adequate, but the spring in the brush broke at the second use.</li>
            <li> I was concerned my model is getting older</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, but it shouldn&#x27;t be your main brush head.</li>
            <li> It fits our older Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Clean my teeth completely, no plack buildup, no sore and swollen gums when I use these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> FOR MANY BRUSHING.THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH,BUT IT DOES DO,WHAT IT IS DESIGNED FOR.</li>
            <li> As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, more interested in looking like the original than acting like</li>
            <li> They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  </li>
            <li> They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the normal quality of this product or just a defective batch.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  </li>
            <li> Long before the blue wear indicator bristles show that the brush needs replacement, I have had the top oscillating brush part fall off.</li>
            <li> AVOID at any cost and go for something in the normal price range.  </li>
            <li> AMAZON; you should stop selling these brushes until the SELLER proves that these units are actually made by ORAL-B.</li>
            <li> Yet, everything about the item appeard normal, including the packaging (which I compared with a store-bought unit).</li>
            <li> The brush rides in this pivot, and any side-pressure (unavoidable in normal brushing) breaks the plastic shell.</li>
            <li> only because I can&#x27;t afford another one right now.</li>
            <li> This one actually came apart and broke in two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.</li>
            <li> This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, I decided to order them and see what happens, and would return them if they didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> OK... the money was completely wasted on the cheap imitation brushes.  </li>
            <li> The head on the replacement brush became loose and wobbly after exactly 2 months of use on the first head that I&#x27;ve just replaced again.  </li>
            <li> In theory, it&#x27;s great--you should either be able to brush in half the time or get your teeth twice as clean in the same amount of time because of the massively increased bristle area.  </li>
            <li> Sure, they may be a little more expensive, but it is worth it not to worry about the head breaking or the metal bit coming out while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> AND THEY SEND ME NEW ONCE.THE PACKAGE</li>
            <li> I had to throw the brush heads out and buy new ones on eBay from sellers with 100% feedback.</li>
            <li> These are exactky the quality I expect in Oral B products, they are working well with the new toothbrush</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase them from Amazon for the New Oral-B Toothbrush I just purchased.</li>
            <li> and so we  remember to take new brush heads for our Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise we forget to change to new brushes which reduces the value of cleaning our teeth.</li>
            <li> They even work on my older model toothbrush that is so old it isn&#x27;t even listed on Oral-B&#x27;s website any longer.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t very flexible so they don&#x27;t really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest.</li>
            <li> The cheap knock-offs break within a few weeks; the real thing lasts until it is worn out on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I expected this things to last more than that.</li>
            <li> The first was considerably noisier than the original head, but not wanting to waste it, I continued to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> First use of these new heads, I knew the quality was not the same.</li>
            <li> But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right-</li>
            <li> brush heads are definitely genuine, however they look different than the picture shown here because Oral B have changed them recently, if you go on the Oral B website you&#x27;ll see pictures of the old brush heads and the new improved ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If only the first fell apart, we can say it is an \\&quot;accident\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush.  </li>
            <li> They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should.</li>
            <li> The original head lasted for several months, but these do not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a 3 pack of these brush heads and the first one I used broke the first time I used it, the 2nd a week later</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the price returns to normal and is sold from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> However it is in a European languarge and not the same quality as the one that came with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I put on the first one and it broke the second time i used it.</li>
            <li> In the local retail stores near me, only a 3-pack (made in Ireland) is available for this price.  </li>
            <li> Even \\&quot;brand new\\&quot;, these flexisoft brush heads are softer than the old one before I threw it out!</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see if the brush will last for 3 months of brushing.</li>
            <li> It was getting expensive, buying brush head replacements at a local drugstore, so I checked Amazon and was happy to find these reasonably priced ones.  </li>
            <li> However, these appear to be exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve been purchasing at (warehouse store).  </li>
            <li> There are other heads that offer a more excelent cleaning because of added cleaning devices such as rubber cleaning pics that move alone with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> None of the heads I received fit properly...they would constantly become loose and come off while I was brushing.  </li>
            <li> : This one is intended more for an extra tight pass along the gumline and around the edges of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say I love my toothbrush, but these do work well in my Oral-B handle.</li>
            <li> I have so far used 2 of the 4 brushes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last much longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 2 of the 4 so far.</li>
            <li> The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have a busy life and ordering supplies like this saves us a lot of time and running around town.</li>
            <li> Vibrates, doesn&#x27;t spin, head loosens and pinches, one lasts about a week, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to discover it it was leaching metals or toxics.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads don&#x27;t hold up nearly as well as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so she buys the sensitive bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]  </li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed to be old stock and brittle.</li>
            <li> I think I had just gotten used to old bristles.</li>
            <li> Amazon 2 day Prime arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> had a lose head that could not be fixed</li>
            <li> I bought these from stuff4you to replace the stock one that came with my toothbrush (it was getting old).</li>
            <li> Although replacing the brushes on electric toothbrushes seems a bit pricy, this model mimicks the professional brushes at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Buy the real Braun heads and forget out these generic ones.</li>
            <li> * Flexi-Soft (now called Sensitive)</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my 11 year old who wore braces, but now wears retainers.</li>
            <li> If you cannot it fixed, I suggest you take your name off of it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive this product only a few days after placing the order.</li>
            <li> Such a big price difference, I thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Went to purchase a single oral B precision clean head in local department store.</li>
            <li> The brush mechanism is SO loose that I am not really sure if my teeth are getting the same good brushing.  </li>
            <li> so I bought an Oral B. I have tried several different models and am currently using the Precision Clean Model.</li>
            <li> cordless electric toothbrudh with easily interchangeable heads, small bruch to get around the topography of the mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works fine for me but is a bit tougher on the teeth then the ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> So many reviewers had problems with the generics that I decided to spend the ridiculous price for the Oral-B originals.</li>
            <li> Keep teeth clean and gums firm.</li>
            <li> Although the price was great and shipping fast, I&#x27;m disappointed in the disparity of how the product is represented.</li>
            <li> I had exactly the same experience as the last reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that some of the descriptions on the packages are in German first with English underneath.</li>
            <li> I received the second batch and all four brushes did the same as the first set.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days.  </li>
            <li> They have a slightly bigger head than ones in the past, but I find them to be more comforting and fitting(hard to explain).</li>
            <li> It tends to cause more of a beating on the teeth due to the design of the bristles, some long and some short, instead of all one length.</li>
            <li> My only gripe with the Oral-B Precision Clean brush heads is that they&#x27;re a bit pricey, even compared to the other types of Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine why an original product from Oral standard will have such a head which is so tough to fit and pull out from its unit.</li>
            <li> Now I am not sure what replacement heads to buy because I cannot trust Amazon&#x27;s description of what tooth brushes they fit.</li>
            <li> Once you use a Oral B tooth brush you wont go back to normal tooth brushes again.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the replacement brushes from my local Osco or Walgreens -- 3 brushes for $23.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, even though theses brush heads look exactly like all the others for Oral-B brushes, they doesn&#x27;t work with the \\&quot;ProfessionalCare\\</li>
            <li> was normally purchasing replacement heads at one of the &#x27;big box&#x27; outlets</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife had expected</li>
            <li> you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It is compact enough to fit in their little mouth.  </li>
            <li> The brush that arrived at my house looks a bit different since it&#x27;s the new Oral-B replacement brush head, but it seems fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The merchant contacted the manufacter and advised that they would send a new brushhead and a return label to send the fauly merchantise back.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Oral-B and also bought these replacements at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I use my oral-B last 15 years and I always need to buy new brush heads</li>
            <li> These brush heads made in Germany work pretty well, except somehow they don&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as Oral-B brush heads</li>
            <li> These Braun brushheads look and feel like the real thing but simply do not perform the same.  </li>
            <li> I took the precaution of reading a ton of the poor reviews here, and made sure I was getting these directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got the brushes within a few days and there is absolutely no difference from the ones I paid more for.  </li>
            <li> The circular brush can easily \\&quot;slide\\&quot; around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great, expensive, but they last long.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these replacement heads from numerous outlets over the past several years and find the price here the most favorable.  </li>
            <li> There are two major problems with this product.</li>
            <li> but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for a clean mouth, teeth, and gums.</li>
            <li> There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.  </li>
            <li> After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together.  </li>
            <li> but in the future I will be buying the softer sensitive teeth bristles instead.</li>
            <li> : Bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t stimulate the gums well enough.  </li>
            <li> Tyr to get the extra soft bristle type if you can find them.  </li>
            <li> A couple of the reviews suggest that this four-pack is somehow a \\&quot;decontented\\&quot; version, but I certainly can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference from any other OEM replacements I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews, each quickly became loose and started pinching my lips.</li>
            <li> They wobble and do not fit right.  </li>
            <li> remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.  </li>
            <li> I of course have no way of knowing if I got lucky, versus there are no more fakes being shipped.  </li>
            <li> there is a costly problem with the replacement heads, genuine Braun at that: after a few uses, the brushhead becomes loose and must be discarded.</li>
            <li> This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally.  </li>
            <li> The original btushes that came with the&lt;br /&gt;motor lasted at least three months and never did break but</li>
            <li> real oral B. Be careful!</li>
            <li> , the FlossAction head is big, has 4 floss rubber around the head, I am not sure it really floss your tooth when you brush, brushing means clean your tooth, I find the brushing action with FlossAction is too harsh to my gums.</li>
            <li> They are not too soft, not too hard - just right.  </li>
            <li> Better buy the original from Wal-Mart, even if it is expensive because that lasts!!</li>
            <li> I experiences the same problems as all others did: all brush heads became loose, metal rods fell off, pinched my and my wife&#x27;s lips several times, until the whole brush head would fall apart.</li>
            <li> After few weeks of light use, the brush head became loose and wobbling causing extra noise, it pinched my lips and tongue.  </li>
            <li> On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth).</li>
            <li> But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I want people to be aware that the brush heads might not fit on their brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra buck because these do not clean your teeth at all!</li>
            <li> I recieved a new single replacement brushhead but no return label to send the rest of the brushheads back for replacements.</li>
            <li> The first two replacement heads exploded at the back of the plastic head and a little metal pin dislodged in my mouth while I was brushing.  </li>
            <li> The first brush head started making excess noise and suddenly lost its little metal pin within four uses.  </li>
            <li> they do not, the package clearly states DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete OR Cross Action Power.</li>
            <li> Kids love to bite down hard on toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the store bought heads, other than the high price.  </li>
            <li> These replacements are formerly known as flexiSoft, which have white center bristles instead of the original green bristles.</li>
            <li> Our first ones lasted about 6 months, which is normal for us as long as I keep my \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; instincts at bay (the enamel-wearing hard brushing that my dental hygienist sister has worked me away</li>
            <li> The brush head pops up a little, leaving a large gap between the head and the motor.</li>
            <li> When the fourth brush head started doing like the first, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and promptly wrote a bad review.</li>
            <li> I would not recomment these, I would have rather spent the extra money to make the tooth brush as effective as it has been over the past few years.</li>
            <li> heads come a little loose after just a few uses, and have pinched the inside of my mouth more than once or twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alternatively the head could be more solid plastic, and less air, thereby allowing the lateral force to be taken up in the headshell instead of breaking the delicate tube.</li>
            <li> opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  </li>
            <li> each one of them broke (the moving brush part came loose) after about 2 weeks, far before the bristles were showing any sign of wear, so actually they turned out to be way more expensive</li>
            <li> A week or two later the little metal pin would fall out and the whole thing would fall apart in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Either this is a complete fake, or there was a huge fault at the factory - causing all of these 1-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Well its hard to say, the packaging looks right and the brushes look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used these brush heads for over 5 years now, and have never had the original Oral-B brush heads break down in less than a month as these ones did -- their brush heads became loose.</li>
            <li> However, the wrong items were shipped; we ordered the Precision Clean brush head but received the Soft head.</li>
            <li> The top part came loose the moment i brushed my teeth, and needless to say, it has been a wobbly&lt;br /&gt;brushing experience for the last three weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper than any replacement heads I&#x27;ve found, but it was more expensive in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  </li>
            <li> They do not last more than a week before the heads start to get loose and are unable to spin with any pressure.  </li>
            <li> They make different types of heads for these toothbrushes, but I have always preferred the small round head of the Precision Clean.  </li>
            <li> My orthodontist provides all his patients the Oral-B brushing system, I priced the replacement brushes at the local retailer I was surprised at the cost, when I found them at Amazon for less, I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> After one week of use the head becomes lose, pinches lips, tongue and gums, very noisy, excessive vibration.</li>
            <li> Been using Oral B professional precision brushes for years, and I know how great it is because I miss it terribly when I travel and use a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon.com directly, not some third parties which sold via Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like them</li>
            <li> (Yes, I&#x27;ve had the same Oral-B brush for a really long time.)  </li>
            <li> did not  last long  ,  all broke  </li>
            <li> They did not last as long as the products I&#x27;ve purchased in the grocery store or in Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time also.</li>
            <li> They also last as long as they are supposed to  - about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper type don&#x27;t work as well and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The brushes are firm enough yet soft enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> These heads last a long time</li>
            <li> I run the battery down to zero on the one I&#x27;m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use (10-20 minutes of cumulative brushing time).</li>
            <li> This item seem to be fake, as it breaks down very easily</li>
            <li> This outlasts a standard Oral-B toothbrush by a long shot!</li>
            <li> Visits to the dental hygienist have become far less traumatic (on both of us) since using this product.</li>
            <li> The brush heads don&#x27;t fit on the tooth brush properly and must be pushed down very hard.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an official 4 pack that comes with different color rings, but was 4 individual heads, all of which had the dark blue rings.  </li>
            <li> They begin to wobble and get loose after a short time of use.  </li>
            <li> When the brush heads are loose, they don&#x27;t rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brush head against your teeth; they can pinch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The brush assembly comes loose after a short, pinches your cheeks.</li>
            <li> The loose space between the brush and stem actually pinches the inside of my mouth as I brush.  </li>
            <li> This was a great price on Amazon, way less expensive than any of the hygiene or dental sites and common shopping sites.  </li>
            <li> Although I do not know how long it will last, I do feel it works better than the fake ones from previous Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, and brush is a little erratic.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive teeth/gums, these bristles may be a little stiff/painful for you.  </li>
            <li> (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They arew hard to find in stores, so getting them on line is a real treat.</li>
            <li> they have worked for me on at least two different models of Oral B high end electric brushes.  </li>
            <li> We live in a very rural area &amp; have been unable to find this particular product within a 100 mile radias.  </li>
            <li> I, too, was lured by the lower price here at Amazon, and did not pay much attention to those reviewers posting negative comments.</li>
            <li> Like many others have found, these \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; brushes are dangerous.</li>
            <li> When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example.</li>
            <li> I hope to have these for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has been working for a long time and was recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I shunned in retail stores due to unwanted changes Braun has made.</li>
            <li> These appear to be made with lesser quality than other replacements I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have noted other reviews echo these same</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other reviewer -</li>
            <li> To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  </li>
            <li> other words keep away from this seller, they either dont know what they are doing or a simply involved in fraud.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several weeks now, and they&#x27;re just like every other Oral-B replacement set I&#x27;ve bought--no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other generic heads</li>
            <li> I do recommend changing it out when the color indicator is completely faded - the difference between using a well-worn head and a new one was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that these replacement heads do not fit my oral B braun electric toothbrush, even though it says right in the description, &#x27;The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.&#x27;</li>
            <li> the replacement heads arrived just in time; especially since I had trouble finding this product locally.</li>
            <li> They do not fit properly, the connector part is slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> Tho each only last a few months</li>
            <li> There are four of us using them, and we have not had a single one break or be defective.</li>
            <li> a couple of years, neither of us have had a single problem with these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> On every one I&#x27;ve used so far, a small metal pin comes out when you are brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The reviews that discuss the fake oral-b products note that the product was purchased through a third party vendor in the Amazon Marketplace (or E-ba*) and not directly through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Both of the first two heads are defective, &amp; of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...</li>
            <li> it was on there, but it was way too loose.</li>
            <li> They were so loose that they would not stay put on the metal shaft of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Head gets wobbly, then loose, then</li>
            <li> after3 weeks you need to replace brush again ,brush after 3 weeks stars to cut your lips and tongue ,bicouse parts of brusk bicome so loose they cut</li>
            <li> It pays to look on Amazon because paying less for the same item just makes sense.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed less gum recession after only a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> Usually the price of the replacement brushes are much more expensive at the store.</li>
            <li> I, like so many others, have unknowingly purchased fake oral-b brush heads in the past.  </li>
            <li> The cost through Amazon is still less costly than through your local stores.</li>
            <li> These were slightly cheaper than my local CVS, and came with 4 rather than the 3 brush CVS pack.  </li>
            <li> They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> The actual brushing action felt weak as well.  </li>
            <li> So, be aware of unreasonable low price in the future, it may be fake!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s less than I would pay in a store locally.  </li>
            <li> Newer design heads not compatable with our currently used battery tooth brush from Crest/Braun/OralB. Heads last at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> In the past, I bought a cheaper brush head that did not perform as well or last as long.</li>
            <li> We really shouldn&#x27;t be suprised by the poor quality of these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Shipped immediately, and was using in only a few days.</li>
            <li> but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing.</li>
            <li> The head was very loose and wobbly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it.</li>
            <li> the one problem is that one head is very loose.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose</li>
            <li> but I just sent them back a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> After a week or two of use they become very loose and pinch your gums.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say here.</li>
            <li> The heads did not fit well on my Oral-B battery-operated toothbrush, they wore out faster and finally one ejected a piece of metal from it while in operation.  </li>
            <li> Which is just as well because the brushes seemed to be too rough on my gums.  </li>
            <li> the Generic fell apart just after a few uses each.</li>
            <li> I am partial to it because Oral-B teamed up with Braun and the items are made in Germany.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use these and we are now on the second round, with brushes #3 and 4.  </li>
            <li> But in practice, the head is so big that you can&#x27;t do a good job brushing behind your back teeth, and it&#x27;s even difficult to maneuver behind your front teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder why Amazon sells this kind of crap under the guise of a name brand?</li>
            <li> bristles feel wrong, they are supposed to be the same as the one in the stores, and yet they dont feel right, to dense or firm.</li>
            <li> But what can we say if the second also fell apart even just after half a month?!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time believing that all of the bad reviews are written by very nit-picky customers, so maybe I just got lucky.</li>
            <li> and I found myself with a small piece of metal that looked similar to a tack in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> These replacements are a total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a replacement other than from Oral-B</li>
            <li> Other than the German-language packaging</li>
            <li> read other reviews on the product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not waiting to see what other disasters will happen with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct.  </li>
            <li> what can one say other than &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The small rotating piece on the back of the head</li>
            <li> , I just feel like it reaches closer to the gumline, unlike the other brush heads</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to read instructions unless you know a foreign language</li>
            <li> is what I think of all the other Oral-B brush heads</li>
            <li> I tried to use the other three</li>
            <li> They pinch your cheeks when they wobble even when you are very careful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this 4 pack which even came with a free extra one, but when it came time to replace the head it came off in two pieces, requiring a pliers to remove the part stuck to the base, of course it was after the 30 days alloted to return , so I will use the heads  but will not buy anymore from this merchant</li>
            <li> After few weeks of use, the brush head became loose and wobbling.  </li>
            <li> I can only hope I do not experience the breakage other customers have complained about.</li>
            <li> and I constantly remind myself not to get complacent - also to change the brush head every 2-3 months or whenever the bristles look all worn and spread out as opposed to tightly knit around the small head ....</li>
            <li> Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price.</li>
            <li> Now my 6 month checkups hardly show any plaque since starting them.  </li>
            <li> The smaller head is easier to get into those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them.</li>
            <li> They are cheap rip offs or lets just say a \\&quot;Bad batch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes are expensive, but they&#x27;re the Real Deal because they Work (spin).</li>
            <li> If I spent half the price to get a fake one, I would expect it lasts at least half as long as the real product.</li>
            <li> They just stop spinning when kids bite down on them, and never breaks.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because other reviews said the product was inferior.  </li>
            <li> Not necessarily a reflection of the seller, but every single toothbrush head has broken.</li>
            <li> The heads become loose and one time I thought I lost a filling to find it was a small metal tube from the brush head.  </li>
            <li> less compared to Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco.</li>
            <li> Even with shipping it&#x27;s still about half price.  </li>
            <li> Product seems just like what I buy at the store, but for less cash.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I&#x27;m on the second package in a very short period.  </li>
            <li> Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> You have sent me different heads twice which is ridiculous</li>
            <li> The second head lasted a few weeks before a small piece behind the brush broke and rendered the brush relatively motionless.</li>
            <li> agree with a prior reviewer that the likelyhood of someone going to all the trouble of setting up a production line to produce fake knock-offs, at this price point, would be very low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the generic replacement heads and the quality is not nearly as good as the Oral B brand.</li>
            <li> Have discovered generics don&#x27;t work for long so forced to use brand name.</li>
            <li> The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year from Amazon because I was sick of going to the stores and trying to find this particular packet of toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it&#x27;s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle</li>
            <li> I think it a spurious product and not original.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t chip a tooth or swallow that little screw.  </li>
            <li> It literally broke up into little pieces in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Tooth brushes keep changing a little bit</li>
            <li> The bristles are in little groups: Oral B&#x3D;26,</li>
            <li> i did buy not original brushes bifore bicouse</li>
            <li> one thing to complain that is just little pricey for one little brush.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was a little concerned about ordering this after reading the multitude of reviews about fake/counterfeit brushes that people said they had received.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work well, but they still rattle just a little bit on my Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I have not had the destructive, painful experiences of some of the one-star raters, but was clear from the first use that it&#x27;s not the same product.</li>
            <li> Two of the four quickly failed as described by others (the heads became so loose they no longer worked) and a third one sometimes pinches the cheek.</li>
            <li> I felt something hard and found a small steel pin like device about 3/16 inches long with a diameter of about 1/32 in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral B brush for a few months and it took me forever to replace the head.  </li>
            <li> they charge me for brush+ shipping but never send me anything, after few calls and e-mails , I just let it go, never buy anything from  </li>
            <li> It appears as though the brush head does not fit snugly, but I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> It does not fit, thus the site caused me to buy</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> after  a few  days  of  </li>
            <li> When I discovered it was missing a unit, I emailed the seller, and they corrected the mistake by sending me another packet.</li>
            <li> The different colored bands allow sharing the more expensive base unit.  </li>
            <li> I even bled for a few time.</li>
            <li> These same replacement heads at a retail store are approximately $25 for a pack of 3.  </li>
            <li> Your selections are difficult to figure out how to complete.  </li>
            <li> There was a lot written on the Internet about inferior \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; brush heads, sold as Oral-B products, that fell apart after just a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and I always prefer this type of brush head for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!!</li>
            <li> It is a very poor imitation and the head did not even last for a Month!!</li>
            <li> no need to be so expensive but worth it in the end- unit lasts a long time and never had a single prob with brushes or handle or base</li>
            <li> So in the long run, the brand name is less expensive.</li>
            <li> The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage.</li>
            <li> and I have very little plaque or tarter at my visits.</li>
            <li> A small part broke off of both of them</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> The part that breaks is&lt;br /&gt;plastic and has a metal pin embedded, this is a small part but</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these heads with our Oral B Vitality brushes for the past three years and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the toothbrush itself or these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though the head LOOKS like an Oral-B head and is branded identically, it is not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have corrected this problem or not.  </li>
            <li> The small piece makes the</li>
            <li> I have a small jaw.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, kapoot!</li>
            <li> The small hole below the brush head pinches my lip</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase on line and deprive the CORRUPT politicians from collecting sales tax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buying these brushes in a regular chain store are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay $22 for 3 of them in Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li> There is no better toothbrush than this.  </li>
            <li> This is usually about 5-6 months after the brush head is installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dismantled the brush heads and discovered that the culprit is a thin hollow plastic tube molded into the headshell.</li>
            <li> No plaque at all, no tartar build-up, very few stains.</li>
            <li> They break faster than normal and I suspect they are bad fakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that almost all the negative reviews for this product have come within the past 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that&#x27;s hard to imagine:  </li>
            <li> hard to justify the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy but even for me these bristles are too hard.  </li>
            <li> Over time you get used to the hard bristles  </li>
            <li> Each brush replacement lasts at least 6 months, &amp; I don&#x27;t replace the brush until the color is faded.  </li>
            <li> I also complained to Customer Service since the padded envelope it came in also contained a neatly folded religous newsletter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kabat Enterprises, LLC / US Health Tests promptly refunded my money when I complained, and that is why I have removed my negative feedback for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope I could give it a negative 5*.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommends replacing the brush heads on an electric toothbrush at least once every six months.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE THEY FORCED ME TO DO</li>
            <li> Hope others are not so bad and last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt these are legitimate Oral-B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt whether it is</li>
            <li> Less expensive even with shipping, than I could have bought from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little difficult to put the colored ring on one but otherwise</li>
            <li> I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  </li>
            <li> it works - lack of essential description, bad rating!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured it was one bad brush that slipped by inspectors and put the second one on.</li>
            <li> I chalked it up to one bad product and put the second one on.  </li>
            <li> Not Good.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Some I bought were no good.  </li>
            <li> They were not cheap but not as expensive as those in the brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how expensive brushes can be and the handle is not cheap, either.</li>
            <li> BTW, I don&#x27;t brush hard either!  </li>
            <li> Hard to remember to use the electric brush!</li>
            <li> Very hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li> A bad brush head now and then but not whole packages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had metal pins come out in my mouth and broken bits of plastic while brushing.  </li>
            <li> complaint is a wrong model number is listed.</li>
            <li> It came halfway off the base while brushing yesterday... and the piece with bristles is starting to detach from the stem.  </li>
            <li> Avoid this rip-off.  </li>
            <li> They said they have not experienced this problem before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun/Oral-B since before Proctor and Gamble took over and the quality was never this poor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality.</li>
            <li> your customer service feedback is so poor that I have resorted to sending this review.  </li>
            <li> but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  </li>
            <li> Every one of these Oral B refill heads has broken in two weeks or less, making this a very expensive \\&quot;bargain\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So, just because they don&#x27;t look like the picture, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re fake...</li>
            <li> Also the one on ebay is the same bad quality!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe a toothbrush head can be dangerous, but these are.</li>
            <li> I had read a few bad reviews of these items before purchasing them.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but inconvenient if you&#x27;re sharing a base.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!</li>
            <li> The refills are expensive, however.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE ALL FAKE....</li>
            <li> This never happened with the expensive heads --</li>
            <li> People are reviewing the wrong product or wrong vendor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today.</li>
            <li> Obviously it is fake.</li>
            <li> I am still stuck with nine useless brushheads.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon, but</li>
            <li> Too expensive as oral b brand.</li>
            <li> it must be fake.</li>
            <li> These brush heads got way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The generic brush heads weren&#x27;t awful, but the bristles were a lot stiffer</li>
            <li> Because of the warnings about fake Oral-B brush heads, I was a bit apprehensive making this order.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads have very poor motion constraint.</li>
            <li> Very poor on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not too mention the horrible pinches it does on your lip because it is so loose and wobbly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been using the Oral-B brushes for years - through at least three base units.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with other store bought Oral-B products, but these have been awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> reviews complains how bad some of the fake brush replacement from/through Amazon is.</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews made me really skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that this one is falling apart, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are awful and please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sell these anywmore, these brushes are dangerous.</li>
            <li> It even broke into small pieces inside mouth while brushing (very dangerous!).</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> received the Euro-packaged Flexisoft, which are useless!</li>
            <li> Ordered another set which are dual brushes like a brush and floss and did not like it at all as it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but they are very expensive...</li>
            <li> and I know a good/new from a bad brush; these were soft/er out of the package than should be after 3+ months&#x27; use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ignore the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> So I asked myself, \\&quot;How bad</li>
            <li> The seller contacted me and said he will give me a refund and replace them at no charge if I would remove the bad review.</li>
            <li> But after 2 weeks of use they started performing badly.</li>
            <li> not saying the bad reviews are lying, but I have had zero problems.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years and have never been disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> the brush is worthless.</li>
            <li> ALL 4 were bad!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> were  the  worst  quality  ever  </li>
            <li> this  bad  product  anymore  !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> * Dual-Action: This is the worst of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is the toothbrush pinched my lips and tongue.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an official 4 pack that comes with different color rings, but was 4 individual heads, all of which had the dark blue rings.  Not a big deal, but inconvenient if you&#x27;re sharing a base.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed.  It is what it is.  Love the toothbrush gets the fresh from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> It came in a European packaging, and most certainly did *not* have the same build quality as the ones available in the US stores. I have used these brush heads for over 5 years now, and have never had the original Oral-B brush heads break down in less than a month as these ones did -- their brush heads became loose. I purchased this item from USHealthTests and Products. They promptly issued a full refund once I contacted them about the problem.</li>
            <li> WE GOT GREAT SERVICE FROM THIS COMPANY AND RECEIVED THE BRUSH HEADS QUICKLY.  I WOULD DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN IN A SECOND.  THANK SO MUCH FOR THE GOOD SERVICE.  I RECOMMEND ANYONE TO DEAL WITH THEM.</li>
            <li> I have so far used 2 of the 4 brushes.  A small part broke off of both of them and I found myself with a small piece of metal that looked similar to a tack in my mouth.  I don&#x27;t know if this is the normal quality of this product or just a defective batch.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these replacement heads from numerous outlets over the past several years and find the price here the most favorable.  The Oral B electric tooth brush changed my dental visits from, \\&quot;you need to brush better and floss more to improve the health of your gums\\&quot; to \\&quot;your gums are in excellent condition, keep up the good work\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Bought these from Mr Bargain some time ago. They break faster than normal and I suspect they are bad fakes. You can try on your own if you want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered replacement heads from various stores for years and never had a problem.  But these heads are faulty.  You are lucky if you get a weeks use out of each head.  I&#x27;ve had metal pins come out in my mouth and broken bits of plastic while brushing.  Not too mention the horrible pinches it does on your lip because it is so loose and wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem with Oral B quality control or just this vendor but I&#x27;ve never had this issue before and now I&#x27;m seeing it from many many people besides myself.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Amazon.com directly, not some third parties which sold via Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Fake products, stop working properly about 1 week of use. Significant difference is observed compare to the original brush head come with the toothbrush purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to rate even one star..... I bought a package of four brushes, and have used two. The brush heads fell apart after a very short period of time. If only the first fell apart, we can say it is an \\&quot;accident\\&quot;. But what can we say if the second also fell apart even just after half a month?! I have to write this review here... And I will never buy this product from here again.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on 12/12/2010. The item I received looks like real Oral-B product made in Germany. There is an Oral-B logo on each brush head. Although I do not know how long it will last, I do feel it works better than the fake ones from previous Amazon purchases. I checked Oral-B site. The buy from amazon link will take you to this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is a wrong model number is listed. The package I received says EB20-4, not EB17-4. EB17 heads should be FlexiSoft brush heads, which I intended to order. It seems Precision Clean is the new name with a new model number. Amazon should update the model number.</li>
            <li> These replacements are a total waste of money!  The top part came loose the moment i brushed my teeth, and needless to say, it has been a wobbly&lt;br /&gt;brushing experience for the last three weeks or so.  NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!</li>
            <li> Oral B is the automatic toothbrush our dentist recommends and we&#x27;ve used these for years. The refills are expensive, however. Local supermarkets sell a two-pack at the same price Amazon sells a four-pack. Buy &#x27;em here!</li>
            <li> This is the same product I shunned in retail stores due to unwanted changes Braun has made. The product in Image 1, the original design, is not the same as Image 2, the changed design, which I received. Although the price was great and shipping fast, I&#x27;m disappointed in the disparity of how the product is represented. I hesitate to say the item was misrepresented but am at a loss to call it anything else.</li>
            <li> these are the best. don&#x27;t accept substitutions</li>
            <li> I received exactly what i asked for.  They are the original replacement parts for my electric toothbrush and work as they should.  I got them for a fair price and i am happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year from Amazon because I was sick of going to the stores and trying to find this particular packet of toothbrush heads.  I like how they really clean my teeth.  My son now uses them and so does my boyfriend.  They really stand up to the everyday use.  I also like that you get 4 in a pack.  You don&#x27;t see that in the stores either.  The stores charge you \\&quot;an arm and a leg\\&quot; just for one toothbrush head. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used electric tooth brush since my dentist recommended. These brush heads are great, expensive, but they last long. I actually use them longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> The brush that arrived at my house looks a bit different since it&#x27;s the new Oral-B replacement brush head, but it seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> i bought this for my electric tooth brush replacement, and oral b is alway has good reputation of making tooth brush, but please stay away with this one that sold here (Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)&lt;br /&gt;). the quality is suck.</li>
            <li> I love this product,perfect for kids. transaction was fast and most of all good deal. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product, the toothbrushes came securely sealed in original packaging.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is not a bargain.  The brushes are cheaply made and quickly develop a gap between the brushing head and the head retainer.  The gap can pinch (has pinched my lip) your lip and bruise it.</li>
            <li> Used item as the original brush head wore out, fits perfectly. Will most likely reorder.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacements and the price was right. Shipping was cheap and the brushes arrived as described. They fit my toothbrush and my teeth are still clean everyday.</li>
            <li> We really shouldn&#x27;t be suprised by the poor quality of these brush heads. The have too be counterfit as the language on packaging indicates this.</li>
            <li> I receive the package on time, the item match exactly as it descripe.  Good deal, it save me a lot of money compair to local store and other on-line store.  Highly recommend.  Will buy again for my next order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral B brush for a few months and it took me forever to replace the head.  Just bought a pack of these and came on here to compare prices.  Should have gotten them here, because this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good brushes and a new head definitely makes a difference.  Easy to know when it&#x27;s done too, since you can tell by the color of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good clean in just two minutes.  A small price to pay for a clean mouth, teeth, and gums.</li>
            <li> I am a soldier stationed over seas and I always have to buy this product from our military store called \\&quot;AAFES\\&quot; but what surprised me the most about this product was the price I paid for this online.  I saved myself $10 even after I paid for the shipping.  Shame on you AAFES, but all in all my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I just use a normal tooth brush.  Once you use a Oral B tooth brush you wont go back to normal tooth brushes again.</li>
            <li> I GOT FOUR ORAL B REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS AND THEY WERE ALL FAKE....THEY BROKE IN 2 WEEKS ,I CONTACTED THE SELLER AND THEY SEND ME NEW ONCE.THE PACKAGE LOOKS COMPLETLY DIFFRENT THAN THE ONE THAT THEY SENT BEFORE...I HAD TO DELET THE FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY FORCED ME TO DO IT.DO NOT BUY FORM THIS SELLER</li>
            <li> I have owned my Oral-B toothbrush for years.  I normally buy the replacement brushes from my local Osco or Walgreens -- 3 brushes for $23.  Each brush replacement lasts at least 6 months, &amp; I don&#x27;t replace the brush until the color is faded.  I decided to try the Amazon brush replacements to save money -- $4 brushes for $12.  A good deal - right?  Wrong!  I purchased the brushes on 12/1/09.  I am already on my 3rd brush!  The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush.  As it wobbled, it pinched my tongue &amp; gums -- my tongue actually had bleeding cuts from it!  Both of the first two heads are defective, &amp; of poor quality.  This never happened with the expensive heads -- I never had a problem, I used them until the color faded, &amp; then threw them away.  I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads.  I will try all 4 heads to see if this is just a fluke, or if these are all of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> These are so good....so much better than regular toothbrush. you will definately feel the difference</li>
            <li> These sell for much more in the stores and along with the great price, was very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was satisifed with the quickness that my order was processed and received. Pricing was fair as well.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are not the real McCoy! There are two major problems with this product. 1. The brush heads don&#x27;t fit on the tooth brush properly and must be pushed down very hard. 2. The brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate back and forth properly.  It rotates when you turn it on, but the minute you apply pressure against your teeth, the brush head just vibrates vigorously but doesn&#x27;t actually move back and forth like it is supposed to.  I&#x27;ll probably contact Braun, but haven&#x27;t had a moment to do so yet.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The 4 pack power toothbrush head replacement will last me a while, and it was cheaper than buying in the store. Shipped immediately, and was using in only a few days. I do recommend this product to anyone that owns the Oral B Power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Went to purchase a single oral B precision clean head in local department store. Balking at the price, I decided to try amazon first. Ended up purchasing a quantity of 4 precision heads (including shipping) for about the same cost as the department store wanted for one.....WHAT A BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> they charge me for brush+ shipping but never send me anything, after few calls and e-mails , I just let it go, never buy anything from  Sold by: MR. BARGAIN</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the correct replacement heads for my toothbrush. They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should. But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right- it was on there, but it was way too loose. And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze  the color ring onto the bottom of the head... I got it on there but not without difficulty. I am still using the head on my toothbrush... only because I can&#x27;t afford another one right now. It came halfway off the base while brushing yesterday... and the piece with bristles is starting to detach from the stem.  Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last much longer.  This product is an imposter!</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement heads from USHealth through Amazon. The order arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I have used these heads before and always got good service from them. I expect these will be as good. I have always been well satisfied with Oral B products.</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied shopping @ Amazon. Great bang for your buck especially in this economy. Looking forward in making my next purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work &amp; great prices!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy these, they are cheaper, sure, but I bought them and each one of them broke (the moving brush part came loose) after about 2 weeks, far before the bristles were showing any sign of wear, so actually they turned out to be way more expensive then had I paid more and bought the Oral-B brand!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely not the same replacement heads I buy at my local stores. I have uesd the Oral-B precision tooth brush for years and love it. First use of these new heads, I knew the quality was not the same. I would not recomment these, I would have rather spent the extra money to make the tooth brush as effective as it has been over the past few years. I can only hope I do not experience the breakage other customers have complained about. Bristles are soft, and brush is a little erratic. The packaging is not in English, and these are claerly substandard.</li>
            <li> the replacement toothbrush wobbles and sometimes pinches my lip.  I will not be buying anymore from Amazon partners.  This may just be a counterfit. I also complained to Customer Service since the padded envelope it came in also contained a neatly folded religous newsletter.</li>
            <li> The head on the replacement brush became loose and wobbly after exactly 2 months of use on the first head that I&#x27;ve just replaced again.  These appear to be made with lesser quality than other replacements I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These are the standard heads for my Braun electric toothbrush. I don&#x27;t really have much to say about them; they work great and make my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> These Oral-B Vitality/Precision Clean heads are not the same quality as the original head that came with my Oral-B Vitality toothbrush. The original head lasted for several months, but these do not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 2 of the 4 so far. The first was considerably noisier than the original head, but not wanting to waste it, I continued to use it anyway. After about a week of regular use, the part of the head that rotates became looser and looser. It was falling apart. I threw that one away, and moved onto a second. This one is also very noisy. I&#x27;m afraid that this one is falling apart, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more replacement heads from a different seller. I do not recommend this seller&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty straightforward.  They are refill brushes for the Oral B electric toothbrush.  The price was low, and after reading on the internet that this product is frequently pirated (a cheap copy of the original), these turned out to be original with the excellent quality you expect from Oral B.</li>
            <li> I bought two eight packs an 6 out of the pack broke within one month use. The old ones worked great. Not sure what happened but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these.</li>
            <li> Personally I doubt these are actual Oral-B brush heads.  While the packaging looks OEM, the quality of these heads is vastly inferior to ones purchased off the shelf at Target/CVS/etc.  The price is clearly much lower, hence the interest in buying this 4-pack, but what you get might look like proper heads, but the performance is way off.  I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric brushes for over 10 years, and these heads behaved very differently.  After a few uses, the brush head piece started to loosen and shake and worsened over more time.  Eventually becoming so loose it would pinch your cheek or lips (ouch!) during operation.  Also, I noticed that the &#x27;blue indicator bristles&#x27; never changed color at all after 8-12 weeks of use.  I thought maybe one brush was bad, but all 4 in the package behaved this way, heads loosening and bristles always staying blue.  I have noted other reviews echo these same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is that these are NOT true Oral-B brush heads, but some kind of poor knock-off in Oral-B packaging (faked or reused).  By the way, this would be illegal in the US if it is true...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back to spending more $ at the brick-and-mortar stores where I can be confident about the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased several packets of this item.  The first one I used turned out to be defective.  I have 11 others to go through right now.  So, I gave it two stars and will hold off on a final opinion until I see how the others hold up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a replacement other than from Oral-B but these are OEM and work perfectly.  The price per head of under $3 was exceptional!!!</li>
            <li> I had exactly the same experience as the last reviewer.  All brushes came out of the box or in short order became defective.  They were so loose that they would not stay put on the metal shaft of the toothbrush handle, constantly detaching.  They can&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li> The price was great but the first brush head broke within 2 weeks. Hope others are not so bad and last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> The brushes are identical to the original but when used will&lt;br /&gt;not take any pressure as part of the drive in the head breaks&lt;br /&gt;and the brush is worthless. The original btushes that came with the&lt;br /&gt;motor lasted at least three months and never did break but these&lt;br /&gt;must be babied if you want them to last. The part that breaks is&lt;br /&gt;plastic and has a metal pin embedded, this is a small part but it&lt;br /&gt;is in your mouth and can easily be swallowed. Not Good.</li>
            <li> While I have to agree that the product description lacks clarity, I took a gamble based on the picture and was happy to receive heads that fit my system. Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year. The replacement heads are widely available, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH I DO MIND VERY MUCH. These were $10 for four and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brush heads and one of them has already fallen apart.  Do not buy them!</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement spin brushes on Amazon as the price including shipping was 50% (per brush basis) less compared to Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were obviously defective or counterfeit.  As noted in other reviews, each quickly became loose and started pinching my lips. A week or two later the little metal pin would fall out and the whole thing would fall apart in my mouth.  Other than the German-language packaging they appear identical to what&#x27;s found in retail stores.</li>
            <li> In 2005, my [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]dentist suggested I try a power toothbrush so I bought an Oral B. I have tried several different models and am currently using the Precision Clean Model. My checkups are a breeze. No plaque at all, no tartar build-up, very few stains. This is impressive because I love black coffee, strong tea and cola beverages. Kudos Oral B!</li>
            <li> I like how clean these things make my mouth feel.  My dentist says that most mechanical brushes aren&#x27;t any better than manual ones, except in the case of circular ones like these.  They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like them to, maybe 3-6 months if you use them very frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate these a good purchase.  The replacements brushes work for several different models of toothbrush.  They even work on my older model toothbrush that is so old it isn&#x27;t even listed on Oral-B&#x27;s website any longer.  At least it&#x27;s good to know they don&#x27;t phase the old brushes out and make you buy whole new toothbrush every couple of years.  There are some alternative specialized brushes you can buy, but I like these general ones best.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist ordered! Same tips I buy at more than double the cost at Target and elsewhere. I&#x27;ll be back when these wear out.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other reviewer - I seriously doubt these are legitimate Oral-B replacement heads.  After one week of use the head becomes lose, pinches lips, tongue and gums, very noisy, excessive vibration. Defective or knock-offs?</li>
            <li> I have found these heads to be of excellent quality. The price is great and ordering them thru Amazon is the most convenient way to get them. My wife and I have a busy life and ordering supplies like this saves us a lot of time and running around town. Five stars for quality and service.</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Oral-B Precision Clean\\&quot; and that was also listed on the package invoice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Euro-packaged Flexisoft, which are useless! I&#x27;ve used Flexisoft for years and I know a good/new from a bad brush; these were soft/er out of the package than should be after 3+ months&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kabat Enterprises, LLC / US Health Tests promptly refunded my money when I complained, and that is why I have removed my negative feedback for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posting this feedback to warn others of the product swap and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> everyone of the brush heads fell apart after a week&#x27;s use&lt;br /&gt;i am lucky that i did not swallow the pin which seperated from the back of the brush head&lt;br /&gt;obviously these are damaged goods being sold as good</li>
            <li> Just wanted to warn prospective buyers not to buy this item. It is a very poor imitation and the head did not even last for a Month!! Better buy the original from Wal-Mart, even if it is expensive because that lasts!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive this product only a few days after placing the order. I have used Oral B products for years, and this was a great price for replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had an excellent experience with the supplier. The items were shipped before the promised timeline. However, the wrong items were shipped; we ordered the Precision Clean brush head but received the Soft head. The supplier contact us immediately offered for free exchanges and free shipping. We politely refused the offer and pointed out that we still be able to use the products, the Soft Heads may even cost more. We were surprised and more than happy to receive apologized emails from Amazon and the supplier along with [] for our inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great customer service !!!</li>
            <li> We have been using the Oral-B brushes for years - through at least three base units. This is the first time we have experienced problems with the brush heads. Two of the four quickly failed as described by others (the heads became so loose they no longer worked) and a third one sometimes pinches the cheek. I have noticed that some of the descriptions on the packages are in German first with English underneath.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks these brush heads get more loose than the original head did in a year.  After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together.  The packaging and such looks authentic but I can&#x27;t believe it.  They pinch your cheeks when they wobble even when you are very careful.  I&#x27;m going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were easy to install and they were a great value from the merchant compared to store prices. It appears as though the brush head does not fit snugly, but I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> These appear to be after-market replacements manufactured in Ireland for the european market.  They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores.  The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base. Pinching lips is another wonderful feature.  Some prices are too good to be true.  This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally.  Avoid this rip-off.  Shame on Amazon for presenting this product to the unwary public!!!</li>
            <li> Be careful, even though theses brush heads look exactly like all the others for Oral-B brushes, they doesn&#x27;t work with the \\&quot;ProfessionalCare\\&quot; brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product description doesn&#x27;t tell you that, therefore I give 1 star only.&lt;br /&gt;The customer cannot see for what type of brush it works - lack of essential description, bad rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s of course not a rating of the brush itself since I couldnt try it but I want people to be aware that the brush heads might not fit on their brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging they work for example with the \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; brush. If that&#x27;s your brush you can probably go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered before brush heads for my ProfessionalCare that fit. Go for the ones called \\&quot;Oral B EB17-3\\&quot; they fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Vibrates, doesn&#x27;t spin, head loosens and pinches, one lasts about a week, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to discover it it was leaching metals or toxics.</li>
            <li> Web site suggested that this set of brushes often bought with the&lt;br /&gt;Oral B S-200 brush.  It does not fit, thus the site caused me to buy&lt;br /&gt;something that is unuseable.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly, and are marked as original product; at a fraction of the cost in local stores.</li>
            <li> I love these heads for my oral-b electric toothbrush. They clean very well and don&#x27;t hurt my gums. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Every one of these Oral B refill heads has broken in two weeks or less, making this a very expensive \\&quot;bargain\\&quot;.  These are not of the quality of the Oral B refills you can buy in a store.  Zero stars!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these heads with our Oral B Vitality brushes for the past three years and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the toothbrush itself or these replacement heads. There are four of us using them, and we have not had a single one break or be defective. They do a great job and we are happy with them!</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B Precision Clean brushes for many years and never had a problem - until I got a pack from Amazon this sprint. Either this is a complete fake, or there was a huge fault at the factory - causing all of these 1-star reviews. I experiences the same problems as all others did: all brush heads became loose, metal rods fell off, pinched my and my wife&#x27;s lips several times, until the whole brush head would fall apart. DO NOT BUY THIS! Amazon needs to do something about this product and manufacturer!!!</li>
            <li> this product is either factory seconds or they are knock-offs. The head becomes loose very quickly and done not oscillate like the real McCoy. These just vibrate. Go to Sams Club and get the real Oral B products. These are awful and please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought a 3 pack of these brush heads and the first one I used broke the first time I used it, the 2nd a week later and the third lasted a while longer but was on the verge of breaking for about a month. I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon but I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing because I feel like I basically paid $30 for one months use of a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads don&#x27;t hold up nearly as well as the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve bought at retail at W-mart.  They begin to wobble and get loose after a short time of use.  I doubt that they are true Oral B replacement heads.  I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the store bought heads, other than the high price.  I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I like this electric brush for myself, and for my baby.  She is two and cannot control a regular toothbrush properly.  This allows her to start brushing before she gets advanced motor skills.  As for me, my dentists have been very complimentary and I have very little plaque or tarter at my visits. No cavities.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head (4 ct.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to pay $18 to $20 for these brushes at Bed &amp; Bath until I spotted these on Amazon.  Even with shipping it&#x27;s still about half price.  I got the brushes within a few days and there is absolutely no difference from the ones I paid more for.  It pays to look on Amazon because paying less for the same item just makes sense.  This is a bargain and I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pass up this product because of the great price so I tried them anyway.  Well I&#x27;ve learned my lesson that if over 30% of customers are giving 1 or 2 stars to a product then it is best to stay away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement brush makes a lot of noise and the brush head doesn&#x27;t spin as strong as the original one I had. Also I seem to get a lot more saliva/water from my mouth dripping down the side of brush onto the toothbrush handle and onto my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back read other reviews on the product and I&#x27;m not waiting to see what other disasters will happen with these brushes.  I hardly ever return items but for this product it&#x27;s just best to return it as these brushes definitely do not work anything like the originals!!  I&#x27;ve noticed that almost all the negative reviews for this product have come within the past 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NB: I got mine through Mr. Bargain).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B electric toothbrush for a while now, and I love it. Seriously. Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time - no one likes pain in a dentist&#x27;s chair, and my exams are always great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]. Unfortunately, though the head LOOKS like an Oral-B head and is branded identically, it is not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I have not had the destructive, painful experiences of some of the one-star raters, but was clear from the first use that it&#x27;s not the same product. The plastic bristles aren&#x27;t very flexible so they don&#x27;t really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest. They simply don&#x27;t do the job the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two packs - I will probably return the second, as I&#x27;m not sure they will accept the first one that I opened.</li>
            <li> These are good and the spinning works to make you feel clean in the mouth, but your teeth won&#x27;t be any whiter.  If you are looking for a whiter smile, I would suggest the Sonicare and combine it with using this Oral-B Precision.  The 2 together are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have the same problem, with the brush head generally working, but it doesn&#x27;t fit securely to the drive shaft.  The brush head pops up a little, leaving a large gap between the head and the motor.</li>
            <li> These are knock offs!  They wobble and do not fit right.  The other reviewers are correct.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Product ordered is of great quality, price, and convienience.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> what can one say other than &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The description says these heads fit ALL ORAL B..they do not, the package clearly states DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete OR Cross Action Power. They do say they fit: Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality and AdvancePower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending them back hopefully!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buyer BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Works really good except the brushes wear out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these replacements from Amazon before and have had problems with receiving fakes. These are the real thing -- just be sure that they are fulfilled and shipped by Amazon.com and not any other vendors. Sure, they may be a little more expensive, but it is worth it not to worry about the head breaking or the metal bit coming out while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> I think it a spurious product and not original. Can&#x27;t imagine why an original product from Oral standard will have such a head which is so tough to fit and pull out from its unit. It even broke into small pieces inside mouth while brushing (very dangerous!). Not recommended at all.</li>
            <li> Yipee.  Thanks to amzn/UPS the replacement heads arrived just in time; especially since I had trouble finding this product locally.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these brushes are genuine Oral-B brushes.  I mention that because I was sold counterfeit brushes by a seller on Amazon; every brush literally fell apart in my mouth!  I&#x27;m lucky I didn&#x27;t chip a tooth or swallow that little screw.  I will only buy these directly through Amazon or in a reputable store from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth/gums, these bristles may be a little stiff/painful for you.  My mom finds these too much for her so she buys the sensitive bristle brushes.  [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]]  Personally, I don&#x27;t have any gum or sensitivity issues so these \\&quot;Precision\\&quot; brushes work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this model:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> THESE are the REAL authentic ones.  I called Oral-B and they confirmed.  I bought 2 packs of them myself and they&#x27;re real authentic Oral-B brush heads, solidly built.  Been using one of them for a couple months already, no problems.  Ignore the bad reviews.  People are reviewing the wrong product or wrong vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** MAKE SURE IT SAYS SHIPS FROM AND SOLD BY AMAZON.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIRD PARTY VENDORS!!!!!  *****</li>
            <li> i think its always better to buy the same as brush company, atleast you know it will protect your gum</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are much better than those so called OEM ones I got from ebay.  Actually none of the ebay stuff lasted longer than 2 weeks while these work well after 6 month.</li>
            <li> We order these by the truckloads, it seems.</li>
            <li> I had read a few bad reviews of these items before purchasing them. Like those reviewers before me, I found it was hard to ignore the low price. So I asked myself, \\&quot;How bad can they be\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads I received looked correct when compared to the brush heads I purchased locally (at much greater expense). When using them, however, I notice that the motion of the head is not nearly as controlled as the retail example. On the local retail version, the motion of the head is very well constrained to just an oscillating motion (partial rotations, back and forth). These brush heads have very poor motion constraint. The circular brush can easily \\&quot;slide\\&quot; around on its base which can very easily pinch your cheeks and/or lips (sometimes quite painfully).&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but the oscillating motion is much weaker resulting in a worse quality brushing. As poor as the action of these brush heads is, I can only imagine that they are a cheap \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, more interested in looking like the original than acting like it.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to pay the retail price for the real brush heads. Your mouth and your dentist will thank you.</li>
            <li> The packaging is different from those at [...] but the toothbrushes themselves are the same (look and quality). Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Been using the brush head for about a month and I have noticed no problems. Product seems just like what I buy at the store, but for less cash.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how fast this product was shipped!  I received it within 3 days.  The no shipping fee sold me.  I will definetly order again form this merchant.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price of these toothbrush replacements I thought \\&quot;what a deal\\&quot;. The first brush head started making a wierd noise and pinched my tongue and cheeks within four uses. The head was very loose and wobbly. I figured it was one bad brush that slipped by inspectors and put the second one on. Within days that one did the same thing. So I tried the third brush head. This one actually came apart and broke in two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses. When the fourth brush head started doing like the first, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and promptly wrote a bad review. The seller contacted me and said he will give me a refund and replace them at no charge if I would remove the bad review. That seemed fair so I did. I received the second batch and all four brushes did the same as the first set. I now assume these are factory rejects and I was not made aware of that before my purchase. I will not buy these online again. I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.[[ASIN:B0007W15WS BRAUN Replacement OralB Plaque Brushes 4Pack - EB17-4]]</li>
            <li> ORAL B PRECISION BRUSH HEADS ARE GREAT TO USE WITH YOUR ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH.IT FITS THE ORAL BRUSH,VERY WELL AS YOU USE IT FOR DAILY BRUSHING.IT COME IN A PACK OF 4 AND IT LAST FOR MANY BRUSHING.THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH,BUT IT DOES DO,WHAT IT IS DESIGNED FOR.</li>
            <li> Very hard to locate in stores. Newer design heads not compatable with our currently used battery tooth brush from Crest/Braun/OralB. Heads last at least 4 months. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> None of the heads I received fit properly...they would constantly become loose and come off while I was brushing.  The actual brushing action felt weak as well.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily a reflection of the seller, but every single toothbrush head has broken. I have never had a problem with other store bought Oral-B products, but these have been awful. I have contacted Oral-B and they were more than happy to replace the broken toothbrush heads (which have been perfect so far).</li>
            <li> Braun must have changed manufacturers or something.  Amazon claims that \\&quot;The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.\\&quot;  But the hole in the brush head that fits onto the toothbrush seems to be a fraction of a millimeter bigger because it barely stays on the toothbrush. The toothbrush does work, however. I have two identical Oral-B 3D excel toothbrushes purchased on 8/20/01.  To make the batteries last, I use one unit for 6 months or so, then I switch to the other unit.  I run the battery down to zero on the one I&#x27;m not using on my teeth by using it with an old brush head to scrub stuff in the bathroom or kitchen.  Only after the battery is completely run down do I recharge it.  Used brush heads--including a very old one I found while moving furniture--fit both units perfectly, so it&#x27;s not a question of wear on the toothbrush handle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have suggested that these are counterfeits, but that&#x27;s hard to imagine:  there could not be that huge a market to justify the expense of setting up a factory to duplicate something as specialized as this.  It&#x27;s even harder to imagine Amazon.com selling it. It&#x27;s more likely that Braun outsourced the product or had some kind of cost cutting change in their factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were 130-odd reviews when I did this one, and I notice that virtually all of the really bad reviews are relatively recent, and that the really good reviews are years and years old; taking my own observations into account, I am certain that the product has changed, and not for the better.</li>
            <li> These Oral-B replacement heads are defective.  On every one I&#x27;ve used so far, a small metal pin comes out when you are brushing your teeth.  Then the head gets all unstable and you have to insert another head. I&#x27;m not sure if they have corrected this problem or not.  The initial head that came with the brush didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> Fakes?  Well its hard to say, the packaging looks right and the brushes look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel wrong, they are supposed to be the same as the one in the stores, and yet they dont feel right, to dense or firm., just not like any of the Oral b heads I have ever used before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads come a little loose after just a few uses, and have pinched the inside of my mouth more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy things again? NO!  They are cheap rip offs or lets just say a \\&quot;Bad batch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the next thing to do is to contact amazon and complain about the seller, and to contact Oral B owners and send them these stating where and how purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words keep away from this seller, they either dont know what they are doing or a simply involved in fraud.....</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B electric toothbrush for quite some time and my dentist likes it. I do too, as I can access all tooth surfaces with ease. I ordered these brushes as replacement for used brushes and they work fine. Don&#x27;t leave home without using this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several weeks now, and they&#x27;re just like every other Oral-B replacement set I&#x27;ve bought--no problems at all.  A couple of the reviews suggest that this four-pack is somehow a \\&quot;decontented\\&quot; version, but I certainly can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference from any other OEM replacements I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  (Yes, I&#x27;ve had the same Oral-B brush for a really long time.)  The vendor is reliable, and the price is right.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the reviews about \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; of this.  Ordered from Amazon as the supplier and it was exactly as I got with the original brush.  I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head.  Seems to do a really great job and the gum massage seems top notch.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever felt my teeth after cleaning.  Does a great job will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Ordering the 4-head deal is great, however, when mine arrived,&lt;br /&gt;the packaging was quite old and worn-out looking.  My thoughts&lt;br /&gt;were confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 months&lt;br /&gt;of using them.  The small rotating piece on the back of the head&lt;br /&gt;broke off while brushing.  I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes the&lt;br /&gt;brush head rotate in a uniform patten.  When it breaks you can still&lt;br /&gt;use the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what&#x27;s the point in that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle.  Please&lt;br /&gt;be aware of this issue.  BTW, I don&#x27;t brush hard either!  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Having bought online, more than once, cheap knock-offs of the Oral-B replacement brush heads (packaged and advertised as if they were the real thing), I can say that it is worth the extra money to get the real thing.  The cheap knock-offs break within a few weeks; the real thing lasts until it is worn out on the bristles.  This one is the real thing.  But in case they use this review for the cheap knock-off, too, consider before buying:  if the price is too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Clean my teeth completely, no plack buildup, no sore and swollen gums when I use these brush heads.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years and have never been disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> A lot of 1* reviews complains how bad some of the fake brush replacement from/through Amazon is. I hope I could give it a negative 5*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this replacement pack from \\&quot;instock novelties\\&quot; through Amazon last October but didn&#x27;t use it until recently. I don&#x27;t think the return policy allows me to return it after so many months. The price was too low to be true, just $11.65 a pack. And it wasn&#x27;t. Obviously it is fake. My first brush broke up in just 4 or 5 uses. A pin in the back that supports the brush head fell off. The second one can&#x27;t even fit my Oral-B Vitality well. The vibration kicks it off in 5 seconds! I have to use my fingers to keep it stay in position. If I spent half the price to get a fake one, I would expect it lasts at least half as long as the real product. This one lasted only a couple of days. Comparing with 3-month suggested replacement life from original product, it is obvious which one is really cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the price returns to normal and is sold from Amazon directly. So, be aware of unreasonable low price in the future, it may be fake!</li>
            <li> Oral B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brushes fit perfectly on my Oral B Professional Care&lt;br /&gt;battery operated rechargeable toothbrush.  Color indicator on the brush shows when the brush needs to&lt;br /&gt;be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have tried store brand replacement brush heads, but they tend to fall apart quickly. Pay the extra money for the Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> The Brush Heads are great, i can&#x27;t complain.  They are not too soft, not too hard - just right.  They are excellent replacement brushheads for your OralB electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have used these brush heads for years.  My dental hygenist recommended this toothbrush years ago.  Now my 6 month checkups hardly show any plaque since starting them.  Highly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> This item seem to be fake, as it breaks down very easily and I had to spit out a piece of steel that came off the brush mechanism. I had to throw the brush heads out and buy new ones on eBay from sellers with 100% feedback. Suggestion to Amazon: find better suppliers that sell genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite Oral B brush head to use for my Triumph 5000. It used to be the Sensitive one, but I like this one more because it&#x27;s slightly bigger and the way the bristles are shaped works better with my braces, I just feel like it reaches closer to the gumline, unlike the other brush heads i&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads are definitely genuine, however they look different than the picture shown here because Oral B have changed them recently, if you go on the Oral B website you&#x27;ll see pictures of the old brush heads and the new improved ones. So, just because they don&#x27;t look like the picture, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re fake... Just make sure you&#x27;re buying directly from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The first two replacement heads exploded at the back of the plastic head and a little metal pin dislodged in my mouth while I was brushing.  Yesterday (12/15/08,) I spoke to a rep. at Amazon.com and they were going to contact the manufacturer and get a replacement pack shipped to me.  They said they have not experienced this problem before.  As long as the second shipment is fine, I&#x27;m okay with this purchase.  I do appreciate the personal phone call from the Amazon.com tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Brandt</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads do have an Oral-B logo on them, but the quality seems to be more in line with some no-name knockoffs that I have used. Long before the blue wear indicator bristles show that the brush needs replacement, I have had the top oscillating brush part fall off. 3 out of 4 heads fell apart within 2 weeks. I wonder why Amazon sells this kind of crap under the guise of a name brand?</li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use (10-20 minutes of cumulative brushing time). When the brush heads are loose, they don&#x27;t rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brush head against your teeth; they can pinch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth. And they can even come apart in your mouth. I&#x27;ve used a Braun/Oral-B since before Proctor and Gamble took over and the quality was never this poor. A bad brush head now and then but not whole packages. I&#x27;ve seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality. I&#x27;ve checked with Procter &amp; Gamble (Oral-B has been owned by P&amp;G since 2006) to determine whether these are counterfeit and am convinced that they are genuine Oral-B product, just terribly poor quality Oral-B product. Perhaps when P&amp;G took over Oral-B, they found ways to cut costs and quality has suffered as a result.</li>
            <li> I use these with my electric toothbrush. Of course I have bought off brand, but I go back to this name brand. These are the best for me.</li>
            <li> The brush head that came originally with the toothbrush works perfectly fine until I got these. These brush heads are only good for one time use and they are good to go in the trash. The brushhead becomes completely loose and does not vibrate in a smooth motion only right after the first use!! It happened to all four of the brushes!! The package looks like it is a reliable product that comes from the company. However it is in a European languarge and not the same quality as the one that came with the original toothbrush. The metal spring even gets rusty!! Don&#x27;t buy this. Also the one on ebay is the same bad quality! I only bought these because they are cheaper. get the expensiver one from target or just not the one with this packaging. It is worth the extra buck because these do not clean your teeth at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushheads from Health Beauty and Beyond. The first day the first brush head fell apart. The merchant contacted the manufacter and advised that they would send a new brushhead and a return label to send the fauly merchantise back. I recieved a new single replacement brushhead but no return label to send the rest of the brushheads back for replacements. The merchant did the right thing but the manufacturer is not the greatest. I am still stuck with nine useless brushheads. The product seemed to be old stock and brittle.</li>
            <li> The Braun is a great cordless toothbrush. The brush head is the difference. They are made to clean the nooks and crannies  and you can feel the difference after brushing with them. I tried the Sonic toothbrushes and didn&#x27;t care for them. The Braun Oral-B does a much better job and with less effort.</li>
            <li> These brush heads made in Germany work pretty well, except somehow they don&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as Oral-B brush heads I&#x27;ve bought at CVS.</li>
            <li> It is highly likely that Amazon sold me a counterfeit package of Oral-B replacement brushes for my Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush. I would like to post a picture of the original brush and the one Amazon sold me, but I cannot upload a picture (or do not know how to) and cannot be bothered to make and upload a video.  I understand that I can return the item (not convenient as I am now travelling outside the US) which is a good policy, but the whole point is that Amazon sells counterfeit goods (in my case highly likely) which is a huge black mark for me ever considering another on-line purchase with them.  Sorry Amazon, but your customer service feedback is so poor that I have resorted to sending this review.  Very poor on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because other reviews said the product was inferior.  However, the ones I purchased look like the original ones and they work well.  I will purchase more!</li>
            <li> I have a small jaw. I find this brush head better at getting into the corners than other brush heads in the oral b line.</li>
            <li> The are the originals and I trust the quality of Oral-B. I know the aftermarket are cheaper, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Delivery – great&lt;br /&gt;Functionality – great&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> Replacement oral-b brush heads at a very good price.  Exactly what I was looking for. Brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li> the product is what I ordered. the one problem is that one head is very loose. the order was received promptly and there were no problems placing the order. good merchant to deal with and have no problem ordering from him again. THANKS</li>
            <li> I purchased three packages of these replacement brush heads.  I am sorry to say I&#x27;m on the second package in a very short period.  The heads become loose and one time I thought I lost a filling to find it was a small metal tube from the brush head.  These may seem like a great price and good deal but they are NOT.  I will never purchase again.  Very disappointed and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for years, and these  don&#x27;t seem to be up to standard.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes quickly. Very happy with the price, service and product. Second time that I&#x27;ve bought my toothbrushes from Amazon. Give it a try and save a lot of money vs Department stores or Pharmacies. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and would order again.  Ordered another set which are dual brushes like a brush and floss and did not like it at all as it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Yup, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to.  My dentist noticed less gum recession after only a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> did not  last long  ,  all broke  after  a few  days  of  use  ,  so i  bought  the  ones imported  and  those are great  ,  but  the  ones  i bought through this seller  were  the  worst  quality  ever  , they  should  not  let  them sell  this  bad  product  anymore  !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product as it was described.  I like the quality of these brush heads better than the one that came with my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These replacements are formerly known as flexiSoft, which have white center bristles instead of the original green bristles. I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor. The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine. Unfortunately my latest order came with the white center bristles, the kind that you should be avoiding. Anyway, I&#x27;m pulling out this particular item from my Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li> I, too, was lured by the lower price here at Amazon, and did not pay much attention to those reviewers posting negative comments. Now I&#x27;m one of them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was normally purchasing replacement heads at one of the &#x27;big box&#x27; outlets but they were out of stock. Caught sight of the price and thought if they&#x27;re the same, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opionion: THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! The packaging looks legit, and before you use one for the first time, product seems legit. After a few uses, kapoot! Head gets wobbly, then loose, then gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with a prior reviewer that the likelyhood of someone going to all the trouble of setting up a production line to produce fake knock-offs, at this price point, would be very low. I believe, as others, that Braun simply started using an alternate source for production without paying attention to quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun, if you&#x27;re paying attention: Address this issue soon, as you will be losing a number of die-hard customers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, if you&#x27;re paying attention: Consider contacting your sellers about these obviously inferior products. They will tarnish your reputation also!</li>
            <li> Usually the price of the replacement brushes are much more expensive at the store. This deal (on-line) was too good to be true.  I&#x27;m already on my second brush head within one week.  The small hole below the brush head pinches my lip everytime it makes contact with it and the attachement doesn&#x27;t stay connected to the toothbrush.  Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days.  It literally broke up into little pieces in my mouth. Buy them at the store...</li>
            <li> The right product and great price.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase on line and deprive the CORRUPT politicians from collecting sales tax.&lt;br /&gt;This is the right product, at very good price and the corrupt politicians did not collect any sales tax.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I did not purchace more at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> But the soft ones are better. Should have gotten the soft ones!!! Still using them though until I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the price of this item, especially since there&#x27;s 4 in a pack.  Also the seller shipped asap and we received the item within 2 days!  Thanks</li>
            <li> These Braun brushheads look and feel like the real thing but simply do not perform the same.  I have used several of the brushheads from the package and they all start rattling after a couple of uses.  Definately substandard parts used in these heads.  I would never purchase these again even though they are cheaper, you get what you pay for here, cheap substandard brusheads.</li>
            <li> This is a product used every day and very satisfied with it .  I have used thia product for many years and will continue to do so.  This seller&#x27;s price and prompt delivery were marvelous.  The cost in my local Walmart was better than three times the price for a package of three ao this purchase was very reasonable and smart. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d add my vote to the many reviewers before me:  this product did NOT perform as well as the original heads that came with the brush.  While these do seem to brush my teeth well enough, every one of them (am now on # three out of a 4 pack) have regularly pinched my lips and tongue while in use.  And the last brush wobbled and fell apart while in use.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Tooth brushes keep changing a little bit and I could not find the brushes that I wanted in the local stores.  Thanks for having these brushes available on line and promptly delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes in my Braun 980TX and I could not ask for more, excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toothbrush? If you own a Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush, you&#x27;ll need these. This deal is a lot cheaper than buying the individual ones.</li>
            <li> Target now also sells their own brand of \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; replacement brushes under the label \\&quot;Up and Up\\&quot;. They are the same as the ones sold here at discounted prices. They are of very low quality. I tried Targets. They do not fit properly, the connector part is slightly bigger. They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B&#x3D;26, offbrand&#x3D;18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them. Note: there should be \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; inscribed on the arm of the replacement brush heads. If it is not there, it is definitely not theirs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this pack. Most likely these are fake brush heads and all four of the brush heads in my pack fell apart.</li>
            <li> In the past, I bought a cheaper brush head that did not perform as well or last as long. It also seemed to put a strain on the motorized part of the brush. The Oral-B brush heads are better made and made specifically for the product.</li>
            <li> I have had generic replacement brushes before and they simply don&#x27;t last.  It is best to stick with the brand.</li>
            <li> I used the original brush head for about 3 months before I decided I needed a new one so I bought these. They are a lot cheaper than at the store. I put on the first one and it broke the second time i used it. Put on another one and it broke within a week. Gave my fiance one and hers broke after a week. Pieces of junk DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Arrived and the product was as advertised.  It is a very good value for the replacement brush heads.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had been using an old head for a long time and when I first tried this one it felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing that much, but after two or three uses it feels great. I think I had just gotten used to old bristles. Now my teeth feel fresh every day.</li>
            <li> I, like so many others, have unknowingly purchased fake oral-b brush heads in the past.  The reviews that discuss the fake oral-b products note that the product was purchased through a third party vendor in the Amazon Marketplace (or E-ba*) and not directly through Amazon.  Those reviews also state to confirm that the product you are purchasing is sold by and shipped from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this order, I did just that.  And as a result, I am happy to report that after buying this 4-pack of Oral-b brush heads through Amazon directly, I received the genuine oral-b product - made in Germany.  In the local retail stores near me, only a 3-pack (made in Ireland) is available for this price.  Also, the $5 coupon helps as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more broken/wobbly brush heads after two weeks of use as I experienced with the fake product or having the metal pin break out of the back of the brush head and end up between your cheek and gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, do like I did.  If it is sold by and shipped from Amazon, you&#x27;ll get the real oral-b product.</li>
            <li> I love Oral-B products and I found the brush heads on Amazon for a great price ~ I could not resist!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use this product regularly. Amazon 2 day Prime arrived a day early. Product as expected. Too expensive as oral b brand. Have discovered generics don&#x27;t work for long so forced to use brand name.</li>
            <li> Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush.  There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, massaging your gums, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you&#x27;ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)&lt;br /&gt;The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for four Flexisoft EB17 heads for $24.99 (The EB17-4 just means there are four of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $12.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they&#x27;re all the exact same product, listed multiple times at different prices!</li>
            <li> I could not find these anywhere in the stores where I got them before.  Was&lt;br /&gt;pleased to find them.  I could not believe how fast they came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One had a lose head that could not be fixed,so now I have 3 toothbrushes, rather than one. These things happen.  I am just happy to receive them and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Either the product was defective, or mail packaging wasn&#x27;t adequate, but the spring in the brush broke at the second use. I expected this things to last more than that.</li>
            <li> Buying these brushes in a regular chain store are expensive.  These are a great deal and arrived in good packaging.  Fast service.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Received the packet right away. When I discovered it was missing a unit, I emailed the seller, and they corrected the mistake by sending me another packet. Really pleased with the service!</li>
            <li> Was worth buying the Oral B brand replacement heads. I&#x27;ve tried the generic replacement heads and the quality is not nearly as good as the Oral B brand.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren&#x27;t worth what they charge for them.  I don&#x27;t know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That&#x27;s a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you&#x27;re lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with.</li>
            <li> We live in a very rural area &amp; have been unable to find this particular product within a 100 mile radias.  We have used the same electric toothbrush for many years. Have tried others &amp; they do not feel right in our mouths.  I am so glad to find that Amazon.com is the place to get these toothbrush heads.  I will definately be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Was looking in the store where we purchased unit, but could not find the replacement heads, so decided to go on line and found them at a good price and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B FlossAction, Precision Clean, and Sensitive brush heads. I prefer Precision Clean, the FlossAction head is big, has 4 floss rubber around the head, I am not sure it really floss your tooth when you brush, brushing means clean your tooth, I find the brushing action with FlossAction is too harsh to my gums. The sensitive heads, simply is too soft, it is good for sesentive gums. the Precision Clean heads, is not too hard, not too soft, every time I brush with it, I feel my tooth very fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> Visits to the dental hygienist have become far less traumatic (on both of us) since using this product. The different colored bands allow sharing the more expensive base unit.  Last a very long time, and worth far more than what is charged here.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it makes my teeth more clean, I feel my mouth refreshed after each use, it is a great buy compare to the local stores, I highly recommand it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for quite a while but had always bought the head in supermarket. But 3 month ago I couldn&#x27;t find it in any supermarket then I bought this one. Shipped pretty fast, looked good. But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!! I even bled for a few time. Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one. But after about 3 months, the color on this one was not lost at all (my husband is using it too, so neither was his). I seriously doubt whether it is real oral B. Be careful!</li>
            <li> This was a great price on Amazon, way less expensive than any of the hygiene or dental sites and common shopping sites.  I love getting 4 of them.  I was concerned my model is getting older but happy these are still available let alone inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These same replacement heads at a retail store are approximately $25 for a pack of 3.  Since I only paid appx. $11 for a pack of 4, this is an amazing value, especially since they are the actual name brand, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this an is very happy with it. Tho each only last a few months these are cheaper that buying them local</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time.  Works great as it is an original replacement head for my toothbrush that my girlfriend CK bought me.</li>
            <li> I bought these from stuff4you to replace the stock one that came with my toothbrush (it was getting old). Even \\&quot;brand new\\&quot;, these flexisoft brush heads are softer than the old one before I threw it out! After just 1 1/2 weeks, it&#x27;s already started degrading, with the bristles splaying out and getting softer with each brush.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the electric toothbrush and with the replacement brushes.  Your service was very prompt.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of brush head for about 6 month and now i am ordering it again.it cleans my teeth perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that I was getting at a National chain Pharmacy but at a much more acceptable price and the addition of one more brush in the package. I believe it is a genuine Oral-B and not a look-a-like knockoff.</li>
            <li> These brushes work, period.  I originally bought the cheap imitation brushes which do NOT work!  Such a big price difference, I thought it worth a try.  OK... the money was completely wasted on the cheap imitation brushes.  I hope this review will keep you from wasting YOUR time and money on the cheap imitations.  These brushes are expensive, but they&#x27;re the Real Deal because they Work (spin).</li>
            <li> It died after 5 months and I had bought replacement brushes so now I have to get another one. 5 months? Not good.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the product description and get the heads that ship free from Amazon. It is a good idea to keep several replacement heads in stock to replace every 3 months or when the color begins to fade from the brush head. Excellent fresh, smooth, clean, polished feeling. Promotes healthier gum tissues without damage or encouraging recession.</li>
            <li> The first brush head started making excess noise and suddenly lost its little metal pin within four uses.  I chalked it up to one bad product and put the second one on.  Within days that one did the same thing and was pinching the inside of my mouth.  So I tried the third brush head.  This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses.  When the fourth brush head started sounding like the first two had before their pins fell out, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and asked for instructions to return them.  The seller has said I will receive a refund but I just sent them back a few days ago.  I now assume these were factory rejects and I was not made aware of that before my purchase.  I will not buy these online again.  I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store.</li>
            <li> Although replacing the brushes on electric toothbrushes seems a bit pricy, this model mimicks the professional brushes at the dentist&#x27;s office. One four pack should last the year.</li>
            <li> Your selections are difficult to figure out how to complete.  I bought these as replacement heads, haven&#x27;t needed to use them yet, so I assume they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> We use 4 types of Oral B brushes - regular precision clean, polish, floss paddle brush, and the power tip.  However, the power tip seems to be out of stock everywhere and I hope it is not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product.  After few weeks of light use, the brush head became loose and wobbling causing extra noise, it pinched my lips and tongue.  I am on the 3rd brush head now (out of the 4 pack I bought), they all broke the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.  That&#x27;s why it was so tempting to get this cheap \\&quot;thought to be original\\&quot; alternative. Be aware!</li>
            <li> I purchased this 4 pack which even came with a free extra one, but when it came time to replace the head it came off in two pieces, requiring a pliers to remove the part stuck to the base, of course it was after the 30 days alloted to return , so I will use the heads  but will not buy anymore from this merchant</li>
            <li> There was a lot written on the Internet about inferior \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot; brush heads, sold as Oral-B products, that fell apart after just a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ones I received appear genuine and have held up so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> i did buy not original brushes bifore bicouse they were more cheap !!! big big mistake after3 weeks you need to replace brush again ,brush after 3 weeks stars to cut your lips and tongue ,bicouse parts of brusk bicome so loose they cut ,soo a did buy this here at amazon and they work much much better bicouse they are original&#x27;s from oral b..</li>
            <li> Less expensive even with shipping, than I could have bought from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this vender.</li>
            <li> This was a great value on the items that I was looking for, and it always makes it easier with Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought two packages of these and none were any good.  The bursh heads in the first package didn&#x27;t fit correctly and were constantly falling off or catching my lip and pinching it.  All the heads in the second pack broke off within a week of putting them on.  Waste of money.  Buy the real Braun heads and forget out these generic ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric tooth brushes for&lt;br /&gt;years and would not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried them, try them now.</li>
            <li> These are not even worth the effort.  They do not last more than a week before the heads start to get loose and are unable to spin with any pressure.  AVOID at any cost and go for something in the normal price range.  The warning that came with the order should have been my first sign of what was to follow.  It said that some have been found to be defective and to return them if it happened.  ALL 4 were bad!</li>
            <li> The price for these Replacement heads was excellent.  Beat Costco by a large margin.  Would recommend to anyone using electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Brush heads become wobbly after a very short period of time making them unusable. Have gone through 3 of the 4 in the pack much too quickly. Suspect them of being fakes.</li>
            <li> These brush replacements look like they were produced for the European market. After a week or two of use they become very loose and pinch your gums. They should be recalled as defective and all purchasers should have their money refunded.</li>
            <li> Product looks like the original, however, all 4 brushes broke after 2 days of usage each! The price, the quality....it must be fake. Hands off!</li>
            <li> I had the same results as others who reviewed this product.  When using the first head, the insides pulled out when I pulled it from the brushing unit. The second head lasted a few weeks before a small piece behind the brush broke and rendered the brush relatively motionless. I am on the third head with hopes it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good to clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing to complain that is just little pricey for one little brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in December 2009 and it still has not been delivered in spite of my communications with Amazon and the dealer.!!!</li>
            <li> Like many others have found, these \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; brushes are dangerous. The brush assembly comes loose after a short, pinches your cheeks. On one unit the the metal piece that holds the brush to the stem protruded, didn&#x27; realize that until I saw blood. AMAZON; you should stop selling these brushes until the SELLER proves that these units are actually made by ORAL-B. I&#x27;m suspect because on another ocassion I bought a \\&quot;SANDISK\\&quot; memory stick (on eBay) that didn&#x27;t seem to work right. I called SANDISK, and after giving them the serial number per their request, I learned that the item was not made by SANDISK! Yet, everything about the item appeard normal, including the packaging (which I compared with a store-bought unit). These brush units may likewise be knockoffs, and the SELLER might not even realize this. I call upon the SELLER and AMAZON to investigate. Don&#x27;t sell these anywmore, these brushes are dangerous.</li>
            <li> Been a regular buyer of this product and have always been satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Made in Germany.  It&#x27;s the original stuff so it fit perfectly into the motor.  Would buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Oral-B toothbrushes for about twenty years.  Have not had a cavity since.  They make different types of heads for these toothbrushes, but I have always preferred the small round head of the Precision Clean.  It allows you to brush each tooth individually, if you want to.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d these in fine condition. A little difficult to put the colored ring on one but otherwise no problem.  Don&#x27;t expect to read instructions unless you know a foreign language - didn&#x27;t see any writing in English on the flip side.  Decent price.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on schedule and was in good order.  I would buy from them in the future.</li>
            <li> It is cheap for a reason.  You better off buying them at a store.</li>
            <li> 1/2 the cost if from a store and it came on time. All is well.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $22 for 3 of them in Wal Mart.  I don&#x27;t need to go there anymore, now that I can get them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is no better toothbrush than this.  It does the job and last longer then others too.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say here. I mean if you&#x27;ve already had the electric toothbrush, you already know the Oral-B heads are the best thing for it. These are it.</li>
            <li> Love the color coding on the bristles - nothing I like better than not having to remember when I started using my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  It was cheaper than any replacement heads I&#x27;ve found, but it was more expensive in the long run.  They did not last as long as the products I&#x27;ve purchased in the grocery store or in Walgreen&#x27;s.  The heads did not fit well on my Oral-B battery-operated toothbrush, they wore out faster and finally one ejected a piece of metal from it while in operation.  Fortunatley, no one got hurt, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk using them again.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush head. I am able to reach all of my teeth with ease and my mouth is left feeling very clean. If you need a good toothbrush head, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Hard to remember to use the electric brush!</li>
            <li> These brush heads got way too expensive.  Right after I bought a package of these, the oral B toothbrush gave out.  Which is just as well because the brushes seemed to be too rough on my gums.  I switched to Purisonic and I&#x27;m much happier.  Plus, you get a year&#x27;s supply of brush heads.</li>
            <li> Out of the package of four brushes, The first one I used was OK. Then the brush loosened up on the stem of the second and was pinching my tongue after a couple of weeks. The third came apart in my mouth after a couple of weeks. I felt something hard and found a small steel pin like device about 3/16 inches long with a diameter of about 1/32 in my mouth. The brush head was about 1/8 inches away from the stem. The last one has been used about a day and I hope it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but doesn&#x27;t feel as nifty as the original I bought before, even though they are labeled as originals.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.  I will be interested to see if the brush will last for 3 months of brushing.</li>
            <li> no need to be so expensive but worth it in the end- unit lasts a long time and never had a single prob with brushes or handle or base</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head 4 Count, perfect fit for her device.  Exactly what my wife had expected</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommends replacing the brush heads on an electric toothbrush at least once every six months.  It was getting expensive, buying brush head replacements at a local drugstore, so I checked Amazon and was happy to find these reasonably priced ones.  They fit my Braun Oral-B \\&quot;3D Action Plaque Remover\\&quot; model, and they also fit my husband&#x27;s Braun Oral-B \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a couple of years, neither of us have had a single problem with these brush heads.  We replace them when the blue indicator bristles signal that the brush head needs replacing (when the bristles have turned to half-white, half-blue).  This is usually about 5-6 months after the brush head is installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order these ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL PRECISION CLEAN replacement brush heads, you get a tall, slender, sealed retail package with the Oral-B brand on it.  The package contains 4 replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement brushes for our Braun Oral-B toothbrushes from a &amp;#34;large warehouse store&amp;#34; (named after the founder, Sam Walton) that apparently isn&#x27;t carrying them any more, instead opting to carry the &amp;#34;gum massaging version&amp;#34; which I do not like.  I decided to get them from Amazon.com rather than go looking all around town trying to find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive that they weren&#x27;t what I needed.  However, these appear to be exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve been purchasing at (warehouse store).  They work fine on all three of the Oral-B toothbrushes my family uses.  I recommend this item as a replacement brush.</li>
            <li> The store brands doesn&#x27;t fit the handle as good as the original ones do ....love it!! Try them and see.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was a little concerned about ordering this after reading the multitude of reviews about fake/counterfeit brushes that people said they had received. Ultimately, I decided to order them and see what happens, and would return them if they didn&#x27;t seem right. I&#x27;m happy to say that the ones I received were like the ones that came with the brush I ordered.  No complaints, have been holding up just as well, and seem to be cleaning just as well.  I of course have no way of knowing if I got lucky, versus there are no more fakes being shipped.  Either way, I am glad I ordered these, and will do so again when it is time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> Came as advertised. Fit my brush well and they last a long time and do a superb job. Good deal for the money. Cost much more at the drug store for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)  These work great .........I&#x27;m loving my new Oral Toothbrush I had switched back to manual for a while. My husband said he wanted to switch back also I&#x27;m always...amazed at how quick I receive items from Amazon!~</li>
            <li> The brush heads work perfectly, exactly what I needed to replace my old worn-out brush. They fit well, and do a really good job of cleaning my teeth. I hope to have these for a long time.</li>
            <li> This item is very good but basic for a power toothbrush. There are other heads that offer a more excelent cleaning because of added cleaning devices such as rubber cleaning pics that move alone with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B toothbrush heads for years and swear by them. My purchase before this one was the generic brand. I thought they were great a first. But after 2 weeks of use they started performing badly. I went through all 4 in 8 weeks. Now, these non-generic brushes are great. They have a slightly bigger head than ones in the past, but I find them to be more comforting and fitting(hard to explain). They last a long time also. The cost through Amazon is still less costly than through your local stores.</li>
            <li> Not going to rave. No complaints. These go to the best tooth brush ever. So, by association, they are guilty-- of being accomplises to the electric tooth brush that is very really truly the best one out there. Thanks OralB, Braun, and Amazon !</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand of oral brush for years and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The price was good and delivery was better than I hoped, so what&#x27;s not to like ;-).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral B EB17-4 Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads (4 FlexiSoft Adult Refills)]]The brushes are excellent and work well with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Vitality is a great idea: cordless electric toothbrudh with easily interchangeable heads, small bruch to get around the topography of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a costly problem with the replacement heads, genuine Braun at that: after a few uses, the brushhead becomes loose and must be discarded. I have never had one for more than 10 days or two weeks, very mindful of this weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be very costly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dismantled the brush heads and discovered that the culprit is a thin hollow plastic tube molded into the headshell. The brush rides in this pivot, and any side-pressure (unavoidable in normal brushing) breaks the plastic shell. If this part were made of stainless and imbedded in the plastic (like the pin that secures the head) the problem would be solved. Alternatively the head could be more solid plastic, and less air, thereby allowing the lateral force to be taken up in the headshell instead of breaking the delicate tube. An engineering flaw. The consequence of Braun trying to save a bit of plastic. Tsk tsk.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to pay $25 for replacement heads, so i ordered the generic ones for $4 and I got what I paid for. the Generic fell apart just after a few uses each. these last 6 months or more per head. hard to justify the price but you end up spending more and have a lot more aggrivation with the generic.</li>
            <li> This clean head brush did a very good job of cleaning my teeth. How nice it is to have a very clean mouth</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same great quality. I will buy them again when I run out in a year or so.</li>
            <li> I started buying these brushheads 3 years ago.  They are an excellent value.  Super safe and gentle on my very sensitive teeth they have worked for me on at least two different models of Oral B high end electric brushes.  Get it - it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy but even for me these bristles are too hard.  I bought a new Oral-B and also bought these replacements at the same time.  Over time you get used to the hard bristles  but in the future I will be buying the softer sensitive teeth bristles instead.</li>
            <li> These are exactky the quality I expect in Oral B products, they are working well with the new toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;also ordered from the outlet store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> At the local stores around here you can purchase a set of three heads for the price of this item which is a four-count.</li>
            <li> I bought these here because of the price. Originally I bought the unit on the advice of my Dentist. Good choice, my choppers aren&#x27;t pearly white but they sure are clean.</li>
            <li> Great OEM brush heads.</li>
            <li> Been using Oral B professional precision brushes for years, and I know how great it is because I miss it terribly when I travel and use a regular tooth brush. The trick with these tooth brushes is to KEEP brushing for a good minute to 2 minutes .... and I constantly remind myself not to get complacent - also to change the brush head every 2-3 months or whenever the bristles look all worn and spread out as opposed to tightly knit around the small head .... I also brush my tongue at the very end to clean it off anything that has accumulated overnight or after sleeping. Brush often. Brush with a great tooth brush and use Oral B. I love it .... plus love that Amazon has these brush heads for cheaper than Target or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> No disappointment on any level.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised and Oral-B product.  Good price for a good product.  It makes sense to get a good price for a disposable part.</li>
            <li> replacement brush heads work fine at a big discount . They are in Oral B package as sold in department stores at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> The mix of different brush lengths and material makes for a very good cleaning of your teeth. Value in buying the four pack as replacements are readily available as the old heads are replaced.</li>
            <li> We have used this Oral-B electric/rechargeable toothbrush for years. These heads fit perfectly. I have tried other generic heads but they did not perform as well as the Oral-B originals.</li>
            <li> This outlasts a standard Oral-B toothbrush by a long shot!</li>
            <li> Hey it works and does a fine job. Easy to use and clean a new way to accomplish a daily function!</li>
            <li> Hard to say I love my toothbrush, but these do work well in my Oral-B handle. It has been working for a long time and was recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> I have used many of these heads and have never had a problem. They are the real thing and work great. I will continue to purchase them from Amazon for the New Oral-B Toothbrush I just purchased.</li>
            <li> I took the precaution of reading a ton of the poor reviews here, and made sure I was getting these directly from Amazon.  They are sturdy, high quality original Oral B brush heads that are holding up beautifully, I have about 10 days of 2-3 sturdy brushings per day.  Nice smooth oscillations, no wiggling, etc.  My teeth feel amazing, and my gums are thoroughly cleaned, yet not sore.  Great brush heads.  These were slightly cheaper than my local CVS, and came with 4 rather than the 3 brush CVS pack.  I would expect this better price when not in a \\&quot;brick and mortar\\&quot; store, so I feel that I got a good price on the real thing.  If you are careful to ensure that Amazon is the seller, you should be well satisfied. My package was labeled Made in/Manufactured in Germany.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are just as good as the one that comes along with the tooth-brush. I found them effective and good at helping keep my teeth clean. The color rings help identify different brushes; just that the Yellow ring is almost indistinguishable (blends with white color of the head).</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are as good as the one that came with the toothbrush. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After trying all the different Oral-B brush heads, and even a pack of generic brush heads, I keep coming back to this one because it has the best reach and the best performance.  The generic brush heads weren&#x27;t awful, but the bristles were a lot stiffer so I was concerned that they would damage my teeth over time (there is such a thing as \\&quot;brushing too hard\\&quot;).  My only gripe with the Oral-B Precision Clean brush heads is that they&#x27;re a bit pricey, even compared to the other types of Oral-B brush heads.  You&#x27;d think the most basic type of brush head would also be the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I think of all the other Oral-B brush heads I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Flexi-Soft (now called Sensitive): Bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t stimulate the gums well enough.  If you&#x27;re just starting out with an electric toothbrush or have really sensitive gums, it may be a good idea to start with these, but eventually you&#x27;ll want to graduate to something with firmer (but still soft) bristles.&lt;br /&gt;* Floss-action: Not horrible, but the \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; is a gimmick, nothing more.  There&#x27;s no way the rubber \\&quot;floss\\&quot; bristles will get between your teeth unless you have gaps or you really smash the bristles against your gums.&lt;br /&gt;* ProWhite: Maybe it polishes, maybe it doesn&#x27;t.  But what I can tell you is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles to do a good job of actually brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* Dual-Action: This is the worst of the bunch.  In theory, it&#x27;s great--you should either be able to brush in half the time or get your teeth twice as clean in the same amount of time because of the massively increased bristle area.  But in practice, the head is so big that you can&#x27;t do a good job brushing behind your back teeth, and it&#x27;s even difficult to maneuver behind your front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* Power Tip: This one is intended more for an extra tight pass along the gumline and around the edges of your teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it, but it shouldn&#x27;t be your main brush head.</li>
            <li> Good!  no complaints about the brush.  get high grades from the dental hygentist &amp; dentist for healthy gums.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B brush heads for many years but have never tried this version. It works fine for me but is a bit tougher on the teeth then the ones I have used in the past. It tends to cause more of a beating on the teeth due to the design of the bristles, some long and some short, instead of all one length. The mechanics work well. My biggest concern is the price. It&#x27;s five times more expensive then the generics. So many reviewers had problems with the generics that I decided to spend the ridiculous price for the Oral-B originals. Hope it was worth it.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes, love the way they clean. They are official Oral B not knock offs like I accidentally purchased before.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my 11 year old who wore braces, but now wears retainers. She loves it and it works great for her.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and on time. I have used Oral-B for about 18 years and enjoy their products. The heads are great and indicate when to change them. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a cordless Oral-B 8850 toothbrush and it was going on 3 months that i have had it so i needed to replace the brush head.I went online to find replacement heads for it.Low and behold Amazon had the best price and with free shipping no one came even close to their price.These are not the after market ones that everyone else was selling for more money.They are the real Oral-B replacement  Precision Clean Brush Heads.After brushing with these heads my teeth and mouth feel clean all over.Thanks once again Amazon.com for having the best quality and the best price with free shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> this brush well over years. Whenever I have to buy the refills, I feel like I invent one because of the price. Every 3 months you change for 5 peoples. How much it cost to me a year for tooth brush? Well I can&#x27;t change it. Because it is that good.</li>
            <li> It was the best deal I could find for genuine, Oral-B replacement heads.  Take my advice and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time looking for a better price unless you are willing to buy knock-off replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Meets expectations.  It fits our older Braun electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s nice to get 4 heads instead of 3 in a lot of packages. So my husband &amp; I can both change our heads twice.</li>
            <li> The brand name is advertised as lasting 3 times longer than store brands. I have used both and this claim seems to be true. So in the long run, the brand name is less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.  I am partial to it because Oral-B teamed up with Braun and the items are made in Germany.  That means, to me, that they&#x27;ll last longer than a week, which I have come to expect from everything made in China.  I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B electric toothbrush since it was Braun.  Some rate it higher than the Sonicare in getting good results.</li>
            <li> These were reasonably prices and we have used them repeatedly.  They work great, as does the electric toothbrush itself.  I&#x27;d recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I just have these on auto order every 3 months. Whole family uses these. These are not copies, original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with these so far.  I&#x27;ve purchased generic store brand before and noticed they deteriorated a lot faster than the Oral B brand replacements.</li>
            <li> Good choice for the electric toothbrush I have had for years.  I love this brand and they fit great.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes.  While they&#x27;re no match for the original, they still get the JOB done.</li>
            <li> If this is the best they can do on replacement brushheads then it&#x27;s alright for the time being but they are very expensive...</li>
            <li> I tried the Sonicare for 6 months.  My dentist advised that I needed to brush better.  I switched to the Braun/Oral-B and like the smaller flexi-soft head.  The smaller head is easier to get into those hard to reach places.  My Hygenist noticed a difference in my next cleaning 6 months later.</li>
            <li> These heads were used on my Vitality brush and they are wonderful.  I love the way they clean.  I just wish they lasted longer than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am a pediatric dentist and I think this brush head is the perfect size for brushing your child&#x27;s teeth.  It is compact enough to fit in their little mouth.  Be sure use the gentler setting on the handle for them, and use light pressure.  I use this exact brush for my own kids, and they love it.  Miles better than cheaper battery powered brushes.  Tyr to get the extra soft bristle type if you can find them.  They are very durable.  As the parents all know. Kids love to bite down hard on toothbrushes.  There brush heads can take the abuse.  They just stop spinning when kids bite down on them, and never breaks.  [...]</li>
            <li> This was and always has been a very good project. So it&#x27;s somewhat gratifying to write a satisfied review. Cheers!</li>
            <li> Genuine replacement brush heads for my electric tooth brush at a reduced price and shipped to me when I need them.  What&#x27;s not to like?  Now I don&#x27;t have to remember to search for them, they come in my mail box.</li>
            <li> Ordered the four-pack replacement heads. In fact I&#x27;ll be getting a re-order every 4 months. The brushes work just like they are supposed to, my mouth and teeth feel clean after a two minute brushing. What more do you want.</li>
            <li> They fit the Orab-B brushes very well, unlike some generics I have tried.  They also last as long as they are supposed to  - about 3-4 months.  They aren&#x27;t cheap, however.</li>
            <li> I was sure these were the same replacement heads that came with my original Braun toothbrush, but evidently not.  The brush mechanism is SO loose that I am not really sure if my teeth are getting the same good brushing.  The loose space between the brush and stem actually pinches the inside of my mouth as I brush.  I certainly would never repeat the purchase.  I will look for genuine replacements.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe a toothbrush head can be dangerous, but these are. I didn&#x27;t know these were not built by Braun. If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station. The brush heads become loose very quickly. Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap, they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth. I have just ordered the Braun labeled heads and hopefully, they are up to the excellent quality of the originals. These replacements however should be avoided until the quality concerns are addressed. That&#x27;s my opinion anyway.</li>
            <li> Needed replacement brushes. Checked local Target, Walmart. Found the price on Amazon to be MUCH cheaper than the retailers. Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews made me really skeptical. I&#x27;ve only used two of the heads, but they were absolutely fine. There was no difference between them and the original that came with the brush, and the price was phenomenal (because most of these heads are unreasonably expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying the bad reviews are lying, but I have had zero problems. I have a hard time believing that all of the bad reviews are written by very nit-picky customers, so maybe I just got lucky.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than the standard type, really clean your teeth.  The cheaper type don&#x27;t work as well and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I bought some extras so my husband and I could share the oralB professional Healthy Clean Precision Rechargeable electric toothbrush which these fit on. They work great to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought this with the subscribe-n-save program and even with that, it&#x27;s fairly pricey compared to other deals I see offered.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s less than I would pay in a store locally.  When it&#x27;s time to get more, I will do some shopping around - curious about the low prices, concerned about reviews of a poor quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, we have found these brushes to be completely fine, definitely comparable to what we&#x27;ve always used.  (Which at times are the high-priced ones in the store.)  No problem with the brushes fitting the heads, all operation is normal.  My husband and I use these and we are now on the second round, with brushes #3 and 4.  Our first ones lasted about 6 months, which is normal for us as long as I keep my \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; instincts at bay (the enamel-wearing hard brushing that my dental hygienist sister has worked me away from!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, our experience has been, great product, no problems at all...I&#x27;d buy again but I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of price comparison next time too.</li>
            <li> The heads fit and work flawlessly.  They are a good value as compared to replacement heads available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work well, but they still rattle just a little bit on my Oral-B electric toothbrush. But, getting the 4-count (as opposed to a 3-pack package) makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are essential if your power toothbrush is to continue to do a good job. The package of brushes purchased here worked as well as the original that came with the Oral-B,and worked with any problems. The replacement brushes were stiffer than the original, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer the new brushes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that these replacement heads do not fit my oral B braun electric toothbrush, even though it says right in the description, &#x27;The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.&#x27; Now I am not sure what replacement heads to buy because I cannot trust Amazon&#x27;s description of what tooth brushes they fit.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrushes are great toothbrushes and these are the real Oral-B replacement heads for them. A quality product that does exactly what it says it does. Simple.</li>
            <li> Was worried about these fitting as sometimes the replacements never quite fit well. These were great and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Each of the oral-L B heads fit different bases.  What you sent me did not match my brush.  You have sent me different heads twice which is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Product worked well, good replacement heads for a great electronic tooth brush. I would recommend these to anyone with a braun electronic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with this purchase. Well worth the money for the original brand.  The heads fit great and work well.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric brush does such a great job. My orthodontist provides all his patients the Oral-B brushing system, I priced the replacement brushes at the local retailer I was surprised at the cost, when I found them at Amazon for less, I ordered them.  They delivery was the next day!!!  Great brushes, awesome delivery!!!</li>
            <li> The important thing about this &amp;#34;standing order&amp;#34; is that they are sent regularly and so we  remember to take new brush heads for our Oral-B toothbrushes.  Otherwise we forget to change to new brushes which reduces the value of cleaning our teeth.</li>
            <li> I use my oral-B last 15 years and I always need to buy new brush heads and I always prefer this type of brush head for everyday use. It is really good quality and cleans the teeth the best way. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> We have the Oral B toothbrush so these are the new heads to keep new brushes available.  We like our Oral B</li>
            <li> It feels like the dentist just finished cleaning my teeth! It fits in my mouth perfectly.  You can tell that research was actually used to make this brush head.</li>
            <li> Good price and works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Much better than the generic product which doesn&#x27;t stay on my Braun tooth brush. The generic ones come off in my mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is wonderful.  The brushes are firm enough yet soft enough to get the job done.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect in my oral B toothbrush. Original heads and very good for cleanning tooth. Worth every penny. VEry cheap also</li>
            <li> The manufacturer&#x27;s replacement brushes are excellent and durable but at almost $7/brush the pricing is outrageous.  Wait for a discount coupon if you can.</li>
            <li> Been using them for years.  They arew hard to find in stores, so getting them on line is a real treat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know where these were made but the performance leaves a lot to be desired.  The brush heads are fragile and break easily.  Just to be sure, I am not hard on brushes but let them float on the tooth surfaces without applying any significant pressure and used the ones that came with the brush, for a long time.  On several, the brush heads did not even work properly but just sat there and quivered instead of going back and forth so I just tossed them.</li>
            <li> These heads last a long time and I&#x27;ve had the same unit for ten years.  Keep teeth clean and gums firm.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head. I bought this particular model because of its lower price, expecting to receive the best bang for my buck.  After few weeks of use, the brush head became loose and wobbling.  The worst part is the toothbrush pinched my lips and tongue.  I tried to use the other three and they wound up the same way. Oral-B, what has happened to your quality control?  I am sure you must know about the flaw in this product by now.  If you cannot it fixed, I suggest you take your name off of it.</li>
            <li> BETTER THAN HAND BRUSH HEADS</li>
            <li> Because of the warnings about fake Oral-B brush heads, I was a bit apprehensive making this order.  The package looks legitimate, as do the brushes.  They fit and work like genuine so I ordered some more.</li>
            <li> These brush heads last a while and get your teeth feeling dentist-clean.  The color-indicators don&#x27;t fade too quickly, which allows you to get the full long-lasting use of your brush head.  I do recommend changing it out when the color indicator is completely faded - the difference between using a well-worn head and a new one was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for a year and I do like it very much.  I will continue to purchase the replacemennt heads.</li>
            <li> Great product I love the way it cleans. There is a pause every 30 seconds to let you know when  to do another section of teeth.</li>
            <li> I am, like others, bothered by the short bristle life, but then you should change toothbrushes every month or so. There is no after market brush, and I have tried numerous offerings, that seems to work with the Oral B, so this is it.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist sure tells me it is working from years of previous check ups. That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of brushes.  It seems like there are lots of clones and counterfeits out there.  I only buy the ones sold by Amazon.  Some I bought were no good.  These seem like the real thing.  They were not cheap but not as expensive as those in the brick and mortar stores.  I am amazed at how expensive brushes can be and the handle is not cheap, either.</li>
            <li> I have a powered brush which is hard to find replacement heads for but these work very well and at a good price.</li>
            <li> they clean well, but seem to lack the automatic wear indicators found in genuine Braun brush heads; are they counterfeit?</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Thanks a lot!!!</li>
