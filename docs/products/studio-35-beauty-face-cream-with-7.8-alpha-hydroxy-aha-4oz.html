            <li>There is better face creams out there.</li>

            <li>Love love love this cream.</li>
            <li>I know mostly women use this face cream</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, blemishes and wrinkles have began to disappear, and my face has a brighter, more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying the stone brand face cream.</li>
            <li>My pore size has reduced and I feel like my skin looks more youthful and supple.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face has a more even texture and tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see results for fine lines.</li>
            <li>an do not see any good skin results I also purchased other Studio 35 items and also do not like them either or see any good results</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best facial creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in acne for me, with this month being the first time I haven&#x27;t had a couple cystic acne pimples pop up right before my period!</li>
            <li>Great product, it prepares your face for day and night cremes, helps to remove dead skin and wrinkles, I would recommend this and will rebuy</li>
            <li>This face cream is truly a best kept secret.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s summer right now</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m here to tell you that it works just as great if not better for men.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel clean, smooth, firm, glowy and healthy..</li>
            <li>I ran upon this product browsing YouTube and such a great product that does actually do what it claims!  </li>
            <li>but 2 weeks later, i absolutely love it, a beauty must have</li>
            <li>Skin looks younger and better.</li>
            <li>( I used the cream 3 nights out of that first week)..</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft when I wake up in the morning now.</li>
            <li>so therefore I&#x27;m always using a bleaching cream which didn&#x27;t help but dries out my skin,this cream became my moisturizer, its really brightens and gave me that glow</li>
            <li>so I just use in morning and nite time,it doesn&#x27;t work fast on discolouration</li>
            <li>So now people are selling it for 4x as much.  </li>
            <li>Gives very noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much in wrinkle reduction, but because of how supple my skin feels now</li>
            <li>I currently use it right after a shower in the morning and put my makeup right over it</li>
            <li>The first few days i wasn&#x27;t sure if i like it or not</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this cream, Why?</li>
            <li>Ordinarily I am very sensitive to lotions like this</li>
            <li>Clear skin and blemishes are disappearing !</li>
            <li>I actually felt and saw a difference in my skin after the first week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 39 yr old female with combination skin, large pores and age spots.</li>
            <li>I know for certain that it has improved my skin and has corrected a crease in my brow that was starting to pop up that was an unexpected delight.</li>
            <li>However, the price set by the seller on Amazon was very high compared to the local Walgreens where you can purchase this.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly feel the exfoliating action of this face cream, which ladies need it.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and this cream caused me to brak out with pimples</li>
            <li>Like velvety soft.</li>
            <li>Above all this and that it is a drugstore face cream with a High End quality effect.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and make sure you are applying sunscreen religiously during the day as your skin will become sensitive to the sun!</li>
            <li>I purchased this on Amazon for that price due to Walgreens being out of this product, it sells quickly and was hard to find at first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still much cheaper than any other product out there</li>
            <li>did my test and only used Studio 35 Beauty face cream without mixing it with my Tretinoin and WOW, it is keeping up with the Tretinoin that I have not used since starting the test with this face cream.  </li>
            <li>I applied this cream daily every morning after cleansing and shaving and I noticed major improvements in my skin after the 7th day of use.  </li>
            <li>so my spots get pretty dark usually during the season - they haven&#x27;t much yet though).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is NOT sealed at all which I do not like; so trust is the name of the game.  </li>
            <li> Sadly Walgreens stopped selling it for $4.99.  </li>

            <li> Amazing product, saw this on YouTube and my moisturizer ran out so picked this up at walgreens for $7 something, one of the best purchase I ever made, my skin feels amazing and extremely moisturized. The first few days i wasn&#x27;t sure if i like it or not but 2 weeks later, i absolutely love it, a beauty must have and i love that walgreens has it for $7, don&#x27;t buy from Amazon</li>
            <li> I loved it! I see the differents. Skin looks younger and better. Please get more in stock. It makes a wonderful gift. I probably order five more.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face, honestly I reach for every product except this one. There is better face creams out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen YouTube users LaFemme5278, nurberxo, and 30plussome rave about this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last few weeks. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did want to note that the price here is inflated ($19.99) This is a Walgreens brand name product that you can get for $8-$9.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this cream, Why? I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks so therefore I&#x27;m always using a bleaching cream which didn&#x27;t help but dries out my skin,this cream became my moisturizer, its really brightens and gave me that glow,what I notice it soften the lines under my eyes ,After seen my results I start using it more often which irritates my skin so I just use in morning and nite time,it doesn&#x27;t work fast on discolouration but it does work cause honestly I have seen results,I could go on and on blabbing about my results from this cream :-) I have be using this product since 1 year now so I can rave about it,</li>
            <li> i am 65 and this product has improved the look of wrinkles and lines. People guess me at least 15 years younger. I buy at Walgreens for about 1/3 of this price. Love love love this cream. Can&#x27;t be without it. On my fourth jar.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 2 weeks &amp; I love it!  Clear skin and blemishes are disappearing ! Would definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> I know mostly women use this face cream but I&#x27;m here to tell you that it works just as great if not better for men.  I applied this cream daily every morning after cleansing and shaving and I noticed major improvements in my skin after the 7th day of use.  My skin is clearer, blemishes and wrinkles have began to disappear, and my face has a brighter, more youthful appearance.  I&#x27;d suggest giving a jar of this to your husband, dad, or as a gift for any man in your life who cares about his appearance. This face cream is truly a best kept secret.</li>
            <li> Truly a great product. It slogs off dead skin from your face and smooths out any blotchiness. However, the price set by the seller on Amazon was very high compared to the local Walgreens where you can purchase this. I purchased this on Amazon for that price due to Walgreens being out of this product, it sells quickly and was hard to find at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it and do not like it an do not see any good skin results I also purchased other Studio 35 items and also do not like them either or see any good results</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream ever.  Sadly Walgreens stopped selling it for $4.99.  So now people are selling it for 4x as much.  However even at this price it&#x27;s still much cheaper than any other product out there</li>
            <li> Great product, it prepares your face for day and night cremes, helps to remove dead skin and wrinkles, I would recommend this and will rebuy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just two weeks and I love the way my skin feels. I&#x27;m a 39 yr old female with combination skin, large pores and age spots. Cell turnover is faster with the alpha hydroxyl in it. My skin doesn&#x27;t look dull anymore and it may be fading some age spots I&#x27;ve had for a while, however I&#x27;ll have to use it a while longer to make a fair judgment on that note (it&#x27;s summer right now and I&#x27;m always outside so my spots get pretty dark usually during the season - they haven&#x27;t much yet though). I know for certain that it has improved my skin and has corrected a crease in my brow that was starting to pop up that was an unexpected delight. I currently use it right after a shower in the morning and put my makeup right over it and I use it at night after I wash my face. Ordinarily I am very sensitive to lotions like this but I haven&#x27;t broken out and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated at all, rather it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> was recommended by a youtuber and i use it as spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I actually felt and saw a difference in my skin after the first week( I used the cream 3 nights out of that first week).. It makes my face feel clean, smooth, firm, glowy and healthy..</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, because even though I&#x27;m a lady with oily skin, it feels sooo good in my skin and luxurious. I truly feel the exfoliating action of this face cream, which ladies need it. Above all this and that it is a drugstore face cream with a High End quality effect.</li>
            <li> This cream is not worth the money. You are better off buying the stone brand face cream. I am 53 years old and this cream caused me to brak out with pimples</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product and thought I would try it.  I only ordered one, which turned out to be a big mistake.  I should have ordered a dozen.  This stuff WORKS.  Over the past 20 years I have always mixed Tretinoin (RetinA) with my night cream.  Tretinoin (generic name) usually costs around $120 for 40 grams of product (prescription only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my test and only used Studio 35 Beauty face cream without mixing it with my Tretinoin and WOW, it is keeping up with the Tretinoin that I have not used since starting the test with this face cream.  I am sold on it and I will be reordering it again.  It is NOT sealed at all which I do not like; so trust is the name of the game.  This is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it if you want a beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 31 with fair skin prone to blotchiness, redness, dullness, and monthly cystic acne breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month every night after washing my face and some days also in the morning if I&#x27;m staying inside (no spf). This is by far one of the best facial creams I have ever used. Gives very noticeable results. My skin is super soft when I wake up in the morning now. Like velvety soft. My pore size has reduced and I feel like my skin looks more youthful and supple. I feel like my face has a more even texture and tone. Also I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in acne for me, with this month being the first time I haven&#x27;t had a couple cystic acne pimples pop up right before my period! That alone makes me a lifelong customer. I got this for 9.99 at my local walgreens. I haven&#x27;t noticed much in wrinkle reduction, but because of how supple my skin feels now I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see results for fine lines. It spreads evenly and a little goes a long way. Smells sort of like a sour glue smell or something and it stings for like 2 seconds after applying but all in all those are minor complaints and do not take away from my rating. I absolutely love this stuff! I bought the last one at my walgreens so I need to check the other one nearby and stock up. Great results for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I use it nightly as I have had discoloration on my forehead and cheeks for years now. I ran upon this product browsing YouTube and such a great product that does actually do what it claims!  A little goes a long way and make sure you are applying sunscreen religiously during the day as your skin will become sensitive to the sun!</li>
