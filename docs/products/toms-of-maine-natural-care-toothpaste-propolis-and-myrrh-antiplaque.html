    <ol>
            <li>The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li>awesome!  </li>
            <li>It is the best value, and they always produce a quality product.</li>
            <li>Great flavor, too boot!</li>
            <li>The best toothpaste ever was Burt&#x27;s Bees but they stopped making it so the closest thing is this one.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s the best stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Great product....</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>great taste and NO FLUORIDE ....</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s FLUORIDE FREE!!!</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain toxins and fluoride!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste for 15 years and feel good about making the purchase.</li>
            <li>So a good cup of coffee on your way to work won&#x27;t taste like paste!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>When all is said and done, my teeth feel totally clean after brushing and the cinnamon taste is very pleasant afterwards!  </li>
            <li>I love cinnamon and think this is a great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste I could find right now.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that the cinnamon flavor is very nice and refreshing...</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I decided to risk my money and try it--and was thrilled with the discovery.</li>
            <li>We love this flavor, but want fluoride in our toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s uses an environmentally friendly process-sourced fluoride, but we can&#x27;t find it in cinnamint any more!</li>
            <li>The cinnamon-clove flavor is not our favorite.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE Tom&#x27;s of Maine Cinnamon Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>I continued to buy it until one day my favorite grocery store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Great product for the whole family</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste flavor</li>
            <li>Love cinnamon toms.</li>
            <li>Cinnamint is my favorite Tom&#x27;s flavor, and it&#x27;s not always available at grocery stores and drugstores.  </li>
            <li>The thing I like the most about it is, of course, how clean it makes my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like still clean feeling with no taste in there for more than just an hour or two.</li>
            <li>In one I did fine the Cinnamon-Clove (see the product for my review on that flavor) but soon that flavor disappeared as well.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many, many brands and types of toothpastes, but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with the original products (floride-free)</li>
            <li>, this particular product is fluoride free which is very important.</li>
            <li>Rather, the flavor is understated, almost fine, and leaves your mouth with a fresh feeling that will not overwhelm others when in close conversation.</li>
            <li>If you are accustomed to toothpaste with a much more powerful kick your first taste of Cinnamint will be a surprise.</li>
            <li>True Mint]], and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good too at helping eliminate tastes that hang around in your mouth, like onions and such...</li>
            <li>so I will have about a years worth to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Since I cannot stand peppermint or spearmint (or any other kind of mint) but do love cinnamon</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the natural mouthwash with baking soda &amp; peppermint...</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more when I&#x27;m finished with the tubes I&#x27;ve already purchased.</li>
            <li>It is the only toothpaste I can find in a cinnamon flavor, and I love that.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste ever; it takes very little, lasts a long time, really cleans your teeth, and does it all without the sugary aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Yet I can squeeze it fairly easy to get to the last blob.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They changes the tube material and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So for now, this is my favorite toothpaste and they have some other funky flavors that I want to try.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive pallet and enjoy tasting anything prior to lunch, this is the paste for you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those seeking a high-quality toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It just makes your mouth feel fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also funny is how from time to time, for reasons of circumstance or accident, I end up having to use regular brand-name toothpaste like Colgate or Crest -- and I cannot stand how they taste.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s makes natural products.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s toothpaste proved to be far subtler than anything else I had ever had, and the mint in this is nearly undetectable.</li>
            <li>Also, I especially like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as some toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned Tom&#x27;s is perfection.</li>
            <li>much better than your usual mint flavors!  </li>
            <li>But rest assured it is not bland.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t open the box until it was too late to return it, and I found I had many tubes of toothpaste in a flavor I detest.</li>
            <li>The residual flavor after brushing with this is mild and replaced by what you&#x27;re eating within a few minutes after brushing.</li>
            <li>Just about every other toothpaste on the market has such a strong aftertaste that it truly ruins your morning.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other similar products.  </li>
            <li>a few days later I get cracks all over my lips which dry out and become scale like in a few more days.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Although the cinnamon flavor does fade, my mouth doesn&#x27;t get that stagnant feel and smell to it like it does with other toothpastes...</li>
            <li> So until then I will be buying the other flavors of Tom&#x27;s non-flouride toothpastes and gels.</li>
            <li> helps cut those way down.</li>
            <li> I am an ORAL CARE FANATIC... floss and brush after every single thing I eat or drink, and Water Pik user too.</li>
            <li> Because this stuff is getting hard to find I occasionally have to suffer through a tube of the common stuff everyone else is using</li>
            <li> What I want to stress for potential buyers is that the cinnamint flavor is subtle!</li>
            <li> Every other toothpaste I have ever used loses it&#x27;s &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; after less than an hour, but not this stuff!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.  </li>
            <li> I read a few other reviews of others who hate this toothpaste and thought how different we all are.</li>
            <li> This six-pack stocks me up with a savings of at least a dollar per tube.  </li>
            <li> I was addicted to it from the start.     </li>
            <li> it was startling for me to see this on store shelves.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find, so</li>
            <li> The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  </li>
            <li> My preteen loves it, she likes it handles her hormonal bad breath.</li>
            <li> no Fluoride rock on toms of maine remember all fluoride is bad for you</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe that crap isn&#x27;t getting the 1 star.</li>
            <li> But this version tastes awful!  </li>

            <li> My preteen loves it, she likes it handles her hormonal bad breath.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open the box until it was too late to return it, and I found I had many tubes of toothpaste in a flavor I detest. I&#x27;ll never use their stuff again, let alone order from them.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for over 30 years, and now can&#x27;t find it to purchase anywhere ... until now!  Hurray!  This is the best toothpaste ever; it takes very little, lasts a long time, really cleans your teeth, and does it all without the sugary aftertaste.  Finally!</li>
            <li> We love this flavor, but want fluoride in our toothpaste. Tom&#x27;s uses an environmentally friendly process-sourced fluoride, but we can&#x27;t find it in cinnamint any more! The cinnamon-clove flavor is not our favorite.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE Tom&#x27;s of Maine Cinnamon Toothpaste. I have been finding recently that fewer and fewer stores carry the cinnamon flavor. I am not a fan of peppermint or spearmint anything so when I found the Cinnamon flavor I was hooked. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores and I found it on Amazon so I went and bought the 6 pack so I will have about a years worth to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Cinnamint is my favorite Tom&#x27;s flavor, and it&#x27;s not always available at grocery stores and drugstores.  This six-pack stocks me up with a savings of at least a dollar per tube.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.  It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006.  Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom&#x27;s alone to manage their business according to their original principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s makes natural products.  The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf.  It contains \\&quot;flavor,\\&quot; whatever that is, \\&quot;saccharine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;propylene glycol.\\&quot;  The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze.  One advantage of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Tom&#x27;s for years.  The toothpaste comes in many flavors.  On Amazon, you can find [[ASIN:B001EJOQAG Peppermint]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPJS Spearmint]], [[ASIN:B0000532QH Fennel]], [[ASIN:B001EJOQGK Orange-Mango]], [[ASIN:B001EJOPUC Cinnamint]], [[ASIN:B000MANVT0 Wintermint]],  [[ASIN:B001EJOR14 Apricot]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUBS Soothing Mint]], [[ASIN:B002K8QUD6 True Mint]], and [[ASIN:B0000532QK Gingermint]], among others.  I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming.  The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom&#x27;s.  Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites.  The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.</li>
            <li> All of my dental care products are from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  Outstanding results.  The only product(s) that I don&#x27;t care for are the \\&quot;Wicked Fresh\\&quot; line... they all leave a funky film and after taste in your mouth &amp; on your teeth.  I&#x27;m sticking with the original products (floride-free) and I LOVE the natural mouthwash with baking soda &amp; peppermint... awesome!  Please don&#x27;t change a thing Tom&#x27;s of Maine!!</li>
            <li> I grew up on Crest and Colgate, and it was only a few years ago that I discovered Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste. Since I cannot stand peppermint or spearmint (or any other kind of mint) but do love cinnamon it was startling for me to see this on store shelves. I decided to risk my money and try it--and was thrilled with the discovery. Tom&#x27;s toothpaste proved to be far subtler than anything else I had ever had, and the mint in this is nearly undetectable. (The cinnamon is subtle too, but clearly there.) I was addicted to it from the start.     I continued to buy it until one day my favorite grocery store stopped carrying it. I also checked a couple of chain drug stores, and while they still carried Tom&#x27;s they, like the grocery store, refused to carry the cinnamint or even to order it for me in quantity. I searched every local grocery and drug store I could find, but never did see it. In one I did fine the Cinnamon-Clove (see the product for my review on that flavor) but soon that flavor disappeared as well. So I checked Amazon. Thankfully, they carry both, and I have ordered two six-packs of each.     What I want to stress for potential buyers is that the cinnamint flavor is subtle! If you are accustomed to toothpaste with a much more powerful kick your first taste of Cinnamint will be a surprise. But rest assured it is not bland. Rather, the flavor is understated, almost fine, and leaves your mouth with a fresh feeling that will not overwhelm others when in close conversation. I highly recommend this product for those seeking a high-quality toothpaste.</li>

Although the cinnamon flavor does fade, my mouth doesn&#x27;t get that stagnant feel and smell to it like it does with other toothpastes... it&#x27;s like still clean feeling with no taste in there for more than just an hour or two. I like that a lot. It&#x27;s really good too at helping eliminate tastes that hang around in your mouth, like onions and such... helps cut those way down. It just makes your mouth feel fresh for a long time. I have used many, many brands and types of toothpastes, but this one is by far my favorite. Oh, and it&#x27;s FLUORIDE FREE!!! YAY!!!</li>
            <li> I love cinnamon and think this is a great tasting toothpaste. I wish it came in a non-flouride form, though. So until then I will be buying the other flavors of Tom&#x27;s non-flouride toothpastes and gels.</li>
            <li> Great product for the whole family</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpaste so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other similar products.  All I can say is that the cinnamon flavor is very nice and refreshing...much better than your usual mint flavors!  Also, I especially like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as some toothpastes.  When all is said and done, my teeth feel totally clean after brushing and the cinnamon taste is very pleasant afterwards!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more when I&#x27;m finished with the tubes I&#x27;ve already purchased.</li>
            <li> I get a lip rash when I start using Toms propolis myrrh toothpaste. It starts out with a little numbness on my lips during the first few uses and a few days later I get cracks all over my lips which dry out and become scale like in a few more days.  I did not realize it was the tooth paste until I took an unplanned break from using it for a month and restarted using it later and the same thing happened again.</li>
            <li> Great product.... no Fluoride rock on toms of maine remember all fluoride is bad for you so try to avoid it at all costs</li>
            <li> It is the only toothpaste I can find in a cinnamon flavor, and I love that. I&#x27;ve been buying Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste for 15 years and feel good about making the purchase. I always buy the 6 pack. It is the best value, and they always produce a quality product.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t contain toxins and fluoride!! Great flavor, too boot!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I could find right now. The best toothpaste ever was Burt&#x27;s Bees but they stopped making it so the closest thing is this one. I like the cinnamint one, it reminds me of Burt&#x27;s. I would prefer a toothpaste that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate and believe me, I have looked, but found none that I like. At least this one does not foam as much so I tolerate it. So for now, this is my favorite toothpaste and they have some other funky flavors that I want to try.</li>
            <li> I usually use the peppermint flavor whole care Toms, but I&#x27;ve used Cinnamint flavor before too.  But this version tastes awful!  I won&#x27;t be buying this one again</li>
            <li> great taste and NO FLUORIDE ....</li>
            <li> I read a few other reviews of others who hate this toothpaste and thought how different we all are. For me it&#x27;s the best stuff out there. Just about every other toothpaste on the market has such a strong aftertaste that it truly ruins your morning. The residual flavor after brushing with this is mild and replaced by what you&#x27;re eating within a few minutes after brushing. So a good cup of coffee on your way to work won&#x27;t taste like paste!&lt;br /&gt;Also, this particular product is fluoride free which is very important. Because this stuff is getting hard to find I occasionally have to suffer through a tube of the common stuff everyone else is using and I can&#x27;t believe that crap isn&#x27;t getting the 1 star. If you have a sensitive pallet and enjoy tasting anything prior to lunch, this is the paste for you.</li>
            <li> Cinnamint. What can I say? It&#x27;s my favorite Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste flavor and it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find, so I&#x27;ve been buying in bulk and plan to hoard it for years to come. What&#x27;s also funny is how from time to time, for reasons of circumstance or accident, I end up having to use regular brand-name toothpaste like Colgate or Crest -- and I cannot stand how they taste. As far as I&#x27;m concerned Tom&#x27;s is perfection.</li>
            <li> Love cinnamon toms. They changes the tube material and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much toothpaste. Yet I can squeeze it fairly easy to get to the last blob.&lt;br /&gt;Efficient delivery.</li>
