            <li> With a bit of cover up, its completely invisible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s flat and it does not look shiny.</li>
            <li> It blends in with my skin and it will work for the limited time I need it while performing on stage.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how you can see a black dot in the middle of it.</li>
            <li> It also looks like I have a giant black head.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s no more noticeable than any other clear retainer.</li>
            <li> it does take a sec to get in tho.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I found it and a few days later it fell out in the shower and went down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too long for my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for a little over two years now</li>
            <li> A little harsh if you accidentally pinch your nose together</li>
            <li> but I had so much trouble getting the screw that was placed by the piercer out that it irritated my nose</li>
            <li> A lot longer than my usual studs.</li>
            <li> I guess I must have thick nostrils.</li>
            <li> and it still feels uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Undetectable. .. Fast shipping and GREAT customer service!!! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Perfect timing exactly was a I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The stud does its job. It hides the hole very well. Although it stings just a bit getting in, thats the nature of the bone stud. With a bit of cover up, its completely invisible. Perfect for work.</li>
            <li> A lot longer than my usual studs. The end was kind of sharp and evey time I blow my nose It would cut me and make me bleed.</li>
            <li> Does not fall out fits perfectly</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for a little over two years now and so it is very easy for my to change the jewelry without any discomfort. THOUGH when i got this the tapered ball end was kind of sharp and poking my skin as I tried to get it in. Not the smoothest application but once you do it it through, you can&#x27;t even feel it</li>
            <li> Good fit, it&#x27;s 18g (I know some said it was too big) Great shipping, ordered Sunday night and showed up Saturday afternoon. A little harsh if you accidentally pinch your nose together and it hits your septum, but I would expect that from any bone style nose stud. And, it&#x27;s no more noticeable than any other clear retainer. If someone is looking for it they&#x27;ll see it but just at a glance (like at work) it isn&#x27;t super easy to spot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this piece but one thing is that it kept falling out. Other than that it&#x27;s good to use for work or for places you cant have nose jewelry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too long for my nose and the end is kind of sharp. I also don&#x27;t like how you can see a black dot in the middle of it. However, I do like that it&#x27;s flat and it does not look shiny. It blends in with my skin and it will work for the limited time I need it while performing on stage.</li>
            <li> It was awesome but i lost it so i will order another one. Thanks guys!!</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted. It slipped out of my hand and I lost it on the bathroom floor :p</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even tell I had a nose piercing at all! It&#x27;s invisible and super comfortable! Love it! Would totally recommend to anyone who is looking to cover up their piercing! Great price too! So happy!</li>
            <li> will buy more!!&lt;br /&gt;fyi..it does take a sec to get in tho.&lt;br /&gt;but once you do it&#x27;s Amazing üëçüèºüëåüèº‚úåüèºÔ∏è</li>
            <li> Fell out the first night I had it in bed. I found it and a few days later it fell out in the shower and went down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually too short for me. I guess I must have thick nostrils. I wish it were a bit longer. I&#x27;ve had my nostril piercing for about 3 months and wanted to switch to this to hide the hole for religious events but I had so much trouble getting the screw that was placed by the piercer out that it irritated my nose and I bled a tiny bit. It got swollen on the inside so the short length of this bone almost didn&#x27;t make it to the bottom of the hole. I hope the swelling goes down soon so I can try and push it through better. Ugh</li>
            <li> Love it. Fits perfectly</li>
            <li> Does exactly what&#x27;s needed, make my nose ring invisible</li>
            <li> Putting the nose ring on hurt cuz I guess the nose ring I had had was skinnier than this one and it made me tear cuz I had to force this one in. It&#x27;s been three days with it on and it still feels uncomfortable. It also looks like I have a giant black head. I&#x27;m still searching for something better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what  I  wanted  and needed for work. Perfect!</li>
            <li> exact as describe works perfect to hide my piercing</li>
            <li> My granddaughter was delighted with the stud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. It fits well, the length is perfect, and you can barely tell I have my nose pierced while I&#x27;m wearing. Speedy shipping as well. Love it.</li>
            <li> i only gave it two stars because it infected my nose</li>
            <li> love the product, just what i needed</li>
            <li> Fits well, came next day. Ive gotten two orders now lol</li>
