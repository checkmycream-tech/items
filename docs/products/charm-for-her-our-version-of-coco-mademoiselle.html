            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Smells just like the real thing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>the scent hmmmmm so beautiful. ..</li>
            <li>Very good service and good presentation</li>
            <li>A great find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it since I knew this before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>It smells so great just like the original one I can&#x27;t tell the difference. .</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife after she&#x27;d smelled mademoiselle in the magazines and fell in love, and well I love her</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is better than the drug store stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had the original, you&#x27;ll want this one!  </li>
            <li>Not as strong a fragrance</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with the fragrance, a very close match to Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell, i gave it away honestly.</li>
            <li>I usually go light on fragrances - spraying them in the air and walking through the mist.</li>
            <li>The musky bottom notes aren&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like, and there&#x27;s a prominent alcohol scent on first spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so close to the original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn the original and now</li>
            <li>Close but not the original.</li>
            <li>Just like the original.  </li>
            <li>True, and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT the real thing, but it&#x27;s not terrible either.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Thinking positive here - this is actually a good feature if you want to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; before going out (rather than reeking of strong perfume all day), if you live in a small apartment and don&#x27;t want to gas your roommates, if you want to use it was a hair mist, or use it as a linen/room spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfume fades fast</li>
            <li>Very close to Chanel Coco Mademoiselle.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading the reviews, knowing it was a replica and wouldn&#x27;t have the staying power of the real thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a really close approximation.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Definitely not near as strong</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it smells the same.</li>
            <li>Need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li>, this is very close to the same thing</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and for the price worth the money</li>
            <li>I need to spray this directly on myself to be able to notice a fragrance a few hours later.</li>

            <li> However, the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> SCENT DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG AT ALL</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long, so I re-apply at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> But does not last long.</li>
            <li> The scent is dead on, but like others have reviewed, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I buy it just for a little present for my wife</li>
            <li> You could probably buy this and then buy a smaller bottle of the real thing and use this spray to support the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> but in my case a plus for work due to policy on perfumes.</li>
            <li> Its water down.</li>
            <li> the only complaint is that smell fades within a few hours instead of lingering like expensive perfume does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is weak.</li>
            <li> i was tired to give always  flowers</li>

            <li> Was very pleased with the fragrance, a very close match to Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle at a fraction of the cost. Not as strong a fragrance but in my case a plus for work due to policy on perfumes.</li>
            <li> Almost a replica of Coco&#x27;s perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Very good service and good presentation but my wife used it had no smell at all</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it smells the same. Definitely not near as strong</li>
            <li> The perfume fades fast you have to constantly keep spraying. Its water down.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Very close to Chanel Coco Mademoiselle.  However, the smell does not last long. Need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the real thing!!!!!!! I bought it for my wife after she&#x27;d smelled mademoiselle in the magazines and fell in love, and well I love her so I wanted her to have it without having to spend a hundred dollars, this is very close to the same thing the only complaint is that smell fades within a few hours instead of lingering like expensive perfume does.</li>
            <li> Some are not what I&#x27;m looking for. It a false advertising</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a review and I must say it was spot on. I absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s so close to the original.  A great find.  Only downside is,  you do have to re spray in the evening.</li>
            <li> SCENT DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG AT ALL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn the original and now this. I can&#x27;t tell a big difference in the fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t last as long, so I re-apply at the end of the day. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Close but not the original.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell, i gave it away honestly.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and for the price worth the money</li>
            <li> The scent is dead on, but like others have reviewed, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews, knowing it was a replica and wouldn&#x27;t have the staying power of the real thing. True, and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a really close approximation. The musky bottom notes aren&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d like, and there&#x27;s a prominent alcohol scent on first spray but hey, that&#x27;s what you get with a replica. This is better than the drug store stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is weak. I usually go light on fragrances - spraying them in the air and walking through the mist. I need to spray this directly on myself to be able to notice a fragrance a few hours later. Thinking positive here - this is actually a good feature if you want to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; before going out (rather than reeking of strong perfume all day), if you live in a small apartment and don&#x27;t want to gas your roommates, if you want to use it was a hair mist, or use it as a linen/room spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m torn. It&#x27;s NOT the real thing, but it&#x27;s not terrible either. You could probably buy this and then buy a smaller bottle of the real thing and use this spray to support the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells great! But does not last long. I&#x27;m happy with it since I knew this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> It smells so great just like the original one I can&#x27;t tell the difference. . This product must have in my purse.. the scent hmmmmm so beautiful. ..</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Just like the original.  If you&#x27;ve had the original, you&#x27;ll want this one!  Great price.</li>
            <li> I buy it just for a little present for my wife i was tired to give always  flowers thanks</li>
