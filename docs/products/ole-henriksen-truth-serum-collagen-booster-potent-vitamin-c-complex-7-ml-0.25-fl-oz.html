            <li>One of the best face treatments ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading that the best type of serum to use is one with Vitamin C</li>
            <li>C is excellent for great skin.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a beautiful and youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>The serum is great though.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>The product itself is a good product</li>
            <li>I have used the product before and loved it</li>
            <li>My skin does feel refreshed after using it and it smells good to boot.</li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It smells great and seems to work on smoothing out fine lines and giving illuminosity.  </li>
            <li>Love this for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin glow and its not heavy at all!</li>
            <li>1st bottle was free samples, got to love it so ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li>Apply to clean face in the morning.</li>
            <li>May have to order a full size of this soon.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering a full size</li>
            <li>Face looks more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I got my first bottle with the purchase of a Clarisonic and figured hey, it&#x27;s free, might as well try it.</li>
            <li>It appears more soft, supple, and youthful.</li>
            <li>This is a small sample and a great way to try the product without committing to $50 for an ounce.  </li>
            <li>There is not a warning on the label about this possibility and buyers should be aware.</li>
            <li>It was one third of the cost, guess I should have known better.</li>
            <li>First thing on your skin in the morning to give it a day-long boost.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I began using this as part of a larger skin care routine change so while I can&#x27;t say for sure that this serum is the only cause of my better looking skin, I feel like it has something to do with it.</li>
            <li>This one is more of a jell and left my face sticky , I was looking for the oil based truth serum .</li>
            <li>It really helps minimize puffiness.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Even around my eyes, it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, and this small, affordable bottle of it is cool</li>
            <li>I usually apply this to my damp face, right out of the shower, and then apply moisture surge over night mask from Clinique on top of this.</li>
            <li>Actually, if you do the math, you are getting 1/4 oz for 1/4 the price of a full one oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I think I like it, feels good on my skin, but it is more of the sample size :(</li>
            <li>Also the size of the bottle was so small it was more like a sample would not buy again for the price listed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the last 5 days and looked in the mirror to see where my huge sun spot is from the drivers window, and I had to look super hard to see where is was.  </li>
            <li>My mouth developed canker sores and I couldn&#x27;t eat any foods with acid in them.</li>
            <li>And as far as the quality: I have sensitive and somewhat oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me or make me oilier.</li>
            <li>I used it less than a week, hard to say if its doing any good to my skin.</li>
            <li>The one I got for free was 2x this size and lasted about 7 months, so I&#x27;m guessing this one will last half that.</li>
            <li>The bottle is small, but only one pump is more than enough for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>careful to much will burn</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was not the size the ad claimed.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It smells great and makes my skin glow and its not heavy at all!</li>
            <li> Love this for my skin. Vit.C is excellent for great skin. 1st bottle was free samples, got to love it so ordered on amazon. Good price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  It really helps minimize puffiness.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a good product but I was really dissapointed about how small the bottle was when I received it. That why I gave it 3 stars. it&#x27;s almost like a sample size. It&#x27;s only .25ounces. But I guess you get what you pay for. The serum is great though.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised. However, I had a bad reaction to the amount of vitamin C in the product. My mouth developed canker sores and I couldn&#x27;t eat any foods with acid in them. I cut vitamin C out of my diet and changed my toothpaste, but the problem persisted. I didn&#x27;t think about this product&#x27;s vitamin C  as a cause until I went on a trip and didn&#x27;t use it for several days. My mouth improved immediately. So I discarded the product. There is not a warning on the label about this possibility and buyers should be aware.</li>
            <li> This was very different than the one I purchased from Sephora originally, different smell and consistency. It was one third of the cost, guess I should have known better.</li>
            <li> great product. Fast service.</li>
            <li> This was tiny and not worth the money. I have used the product before and loved it but this was like water.</li>
            <li> First thing on your skin in the morning to give it a day-long boost.  Follow with moisturizer/sun screen.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells great and seems to work on smoothing out fine lines and giving illuminosity.  Face looks more vibrant.  I do notice some sloughing of skin in the evening as collagen must be working renewing skin cells.  I had no irritation from this.  May have to order a full size of this soon.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and this small, affordable bottle of it is cool cause I can&#x27;t bring myself to drop $55 or $78 on a larger bottle. Someone&#x27;s review said it was a rip off because it&#x27;s so small, but if you do the math compared to the larger bottle, you can see it&#x27;s actually not overpriced. And as far as the quality: I have sensitive and somewhat oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me or make me oilier. Even around my eyes, it&#x27;s gentle. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin tone (brightness) since I started using it. A+ \\&quot;OOO-lah\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Apply to clean face in the morning. Just couple drops. One of the best face treatments ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Truth Serum for a couple months now.  It gives my skin a beautiful and youthful glow.  Before using this my complexion was dull and for the last decade I had small bumps on my upper lip that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of even with expensive facials, now those bumps almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of Truth Serum I took a break for a couple weeks and it showed, and the bumps returned.  This is a small sample and a great way to try the product without committing to $50 for an ounce.  Actually, if you do the math, you are getting 1/4 oz for 1/4 the price of a full one oz bottle.</li>
            <li> It did not work on the hyper-pigmentation on both cheeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It is much smaller then I thought so it was gone before I knew it but I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I got my first bottle with the purchase of a Clarisonic and figured hey, it&#x27;s free, might as well try it. I was super sad when the bottle ran out, so I turned to Amazon for my refill needs. The bottle is small, but only one pump is more than enough for my face and neck.

My skin does feel refreshed after using it and it smells good to boot. I&#x27;ve been reading that the best type of serum to use is one with Vitamin C so I plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few short weeks and already I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin. It appears more soft, supple, and youthful. I usually apply this to my damp face, right out of the shower, and then apply moisture surge over night mask from Clinique on top of this. Works well. I believe I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> this is really small but I have been using it now for almost a month and I&#x27;m not even halfway done with the bottle. It brightens my skin. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 5 days and looked in the mirror to see where my huge sun spot is from the drivers window, and I had to look super hard to see where is was.  Will be ordering a full size</li>
            <li> I think I like it, feels good on my skin, but it is more of the sample size :( I used it less than a week, hard to say if its doing any good to my skin.</li>
