            <li>I love this set!  </li>
            <li>I think it is better to let someone else do it for you!</li>
            <li>I had been introduced to cupping 5 years ago and was aware of the marvelous results they yield.  </li>
            <li>Love em!</li>
            <li>I especially loved how fast it got here!</li>
            <li>Very much like that the cupping set comes in a nice travel kit, and the cups works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>they are easy to use and work great</li>
            <li>The price was amazing for the quality and quantity.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen is amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing deal I have to say.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve started working with the silicon cups and they are amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>The ambiance isn&#x27;t as nice, I don&#x27;t get to lie on a heated table and no one is serving me tea when I cup at home</li>
            <li>The case keeps things nice and organized.</li>
            <li>I will wait on until I&#x27;m more experienced. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have two sets in order to be able to do one side of the body at one time.  </li>
            <li>The price is a nice bet to see if this home therapy is for you.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I requested and received this cupping set as a gift and am loving it.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if they offered a glass option.  </li>
            <li>Nice case if you use it to carry around.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>Greatest of cups, works very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and works great!</li>
            <li>I really just can&#x27;t fully express how happy I am with this set!</li>
            <li>WOuld is nice about it</li>
            <li>Thanks for another job well done and happy customer !</li>
            <li>Waited a long time to find the best quality and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I buy very good.</li>
            <li>The kit is neatly assembled and very handy to transport and store in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the best looking cupping set for the most reasonable price, I placed an additional order with this seller.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li>the cups work fine without the extension, able to get good suction.  </li>
            <li>If you have gone to an acupuncturist and experienced cupping first hand, you will understand the benefits of cupping and why having your own cupping set would be a good idea ;-)  </li>
            <li>I will use them on myself, and Im pleased at how easily I can reach my own neck with the extender, but I will not use them on clients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the seller and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li>This product is of good quality: the edge of the cups is smooth, which is important.  </li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>If you understand cupping you will love it too.</li>
            <li>So glad that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>I am really glad I decided to get this item.</li>
            <li>When sucking comes at a premium, make sure you use premium quality cups.  </li>
            <li>Just wish there were more instruction... on where and what they were used for.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li>I will ordering more</li>
            <li>Love this cupping set.</li>
            <li>My client&#x27;s love</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m finding more and more uses for it and customers are requesting cupping.</li>
            <li>Everything in the set works well and my practitioner found it most satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I wished they would offer more #2, #3, #4 and #5&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;the suction plunger works well and the extension hose still works and hasn&#x27;t cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>all I would say it&#x27;s an ok set.</li>
            <li>The clients I use cupping on love it and the change they have felt</li>
            <li>and I am glad she likes it.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to buy, especially at this great price!</li>
            <li>I like cupping and my clients find it to be a most acceptable and helpful modality for relief of muscular pain.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller via amazon, and their solution is to replace sub par product with more sub par product.</li>
            <li>Our massage therapists love this set.</li>
            <li>After using them for a while, I have noticed that I am able to pin point my pain and cup just what is needed.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They are one of my favorite purchases this year.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t have the strength to do deep tissue massage, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I used a set at my Therapist&#x27;s place &amp; they worked much better, even though it was the identical set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this set.</li>
            <li>I bought two sets and gave one to my grand daughter who is going to nursing school, and she loves it too.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea that more oxygen and release of toxins may help my recovery.</li>
            <li>I like it not glass because if you accidently drop it is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love cupping</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>better than going to the doctor.</li>
            <li>This is good cupping set, but care full when use this with pressure pointers do not suck it to strong because it will hurt you to the bone</li>
            <li>To be able to offer this modality to clients is just another unique gift you can add to your list of services!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality plastic and comes in a very nice case.</li>
            <li>I am sure this will get better as I become more familiar with this set</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re still able to use it, but it falls off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only effective but great quality</li>
            <li>The instruction is very clear and the picture adds great to the operation of working with the cup.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, I would recommend it to anybody and especially to professionals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Typically glass would be recommended over plastic cups for sliding because glass can provide a smooth surface edge for skin contact that would allow the product to glide over the skin with the use of appropriate oil and maintain suction without causing damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, this is a great pump cup set, HOWEVER it says in the description that these can be boiled to sterilize (which is why I bought them), but when they arrived, it is clearly stated in the instructions that they cannot be boiled.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Very Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>I wish there were some more detailed instructions or treatment protocols</li>
            <li>I decided to order this because I heard so much good reviews from my peers, and how much easier it is to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted and more!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and fantastic carrying case!</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to regulate suction by the number of pulls of the pump trigger.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>These pop off and aren&#x27;t as easily manipulated during cupping session.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and patients tolerate it without complaints.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This set works so well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use just YouTube it if you don&#x27;t already know how.</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>THE PLASTIC CUPS WERE MANUFACTURED UPTO STANDARD , NICELY PACKED AND CONTAINED IN A NICE SUITE CASE LIKE A LAP TOP.</li>
            <li>This cupping set would be perfectly fine if it were not for two issues.  </li>
            <li>It is also light and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li>Suction- MORE than adequate.</li>
            <li>the suction on the cups isn&#x27;t fabulous if the size is anything less than perfect for the area of the body you are working on.</li>
            <li>It is low  in cost, has great suctioning and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good quality cupping massage set I ever have before, I used to bought some very cheap prices, but after used just a few time then it look like start to crack on the head of the cup.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for stationary cupping,but you can move them around with a little practice.</li>
            <li>I enjoy working with this product.  </li>
            <li>My clients enjoy this modality</li>
            <li>This set includes five different sized cups, but I find the largest three sizes to be the most effective and covers more area.</li>
            <li>fantastic purchase</li>
            <li>Work well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing cupping for a few months and this cupping set is awesome.</li>
            <li>light the candles &amp; turn on the massage music - have some fun!</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the best deal so far on amazon when it comes to prices and the amount of cups you get.</li>
            <li>For a beginner in cupping, this one is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I really am excited and can&#x27;t wait to get started using these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have so many cups in different sizes, but I would rather have another silicon set.</li>
            <li>Other than that, washes easy, great storage, highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I was shopping around for a good cupping set and low and behold</li>
            <li>Items were received in good condition and worked properly.</li>
            <li>If you put too much pressure on them, i am sure they could break.</li>
            <li>But if your looking for something to massage yourself with and get the full affect of a cupping treatment I would go to a therapist that knows how to use them.</li>
            <li>Obviously tricky matching the cup size to the location so that you get a good seal.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it came with more detailed instructions or tips on how to use the cups more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I also gently pull up on the cup while it is attached for more tissue stretching.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>The cups seal very wel l and the suction has been more than adequate.</li>
            <li>and it arrived surprisingly quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a super set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure for the first two or three months of having this</li>
            <li>I think it is a worthy buying.</li>
            <li>The cupping set is awesome and the only draw back</li>
            <li>The basics are easy enough that anyone can use this medical tool and enjoy great results.</li>
            <li>It has a variety of sizes of cups (with additional magnets for direct point stimulation if desired) and the extension hose allows me to get cups accurately placed on most areas of my own back, shoulders, neck, etc.  </li>
            <li>Great for breaking up adhesions associated with old injuries and many other things.</li>
            <li>The cups are pretty good quality and they work terrific.</li>
            <li>far\\&quot; and too much may give you a rash, its strong stuff.</li>
            <li>and it has not failed me!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough how much i love these cups!</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and I love it!</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;Great buy folks!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with many cups of different sizes.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine&#x27;s eyes are always red, after he \\&quot;cups\\&quot; (lol), his eyes clear up tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This item was definitely worth what i paid for it</li>
            <li>All of the cupping materials were in good condition, but the carry case was torn and will not last much longer.</li>
            <li>i would have liked 4 or so larger cups though.</li>
            <li>These were bought for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li>It is handy to have a personal set.</li>
            <li>As the cost was so low, I had to purchase my own set.</li>
            <li>A lot of fun to work with</li>
            <li>Got the cupping set quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use only the problem when squeeze the handle for air, the head piece comes off easily off and on.</li>
            <li>The suction is very strong but made from low grade plastic.  </li>
            <li>but I love it more then my other kit!</li>
            <li>It is more convenient, easier to use and much more efficient than my previously bought &amp;#34;dragon&amp;#34; set made in Vietnam.</li>
            <li>The cups are easy to clean; for those using the wet cupping method this is important.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, comes with clear directions and is as advertised.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much that we ended up ordering a second one for a family member.</li>
            <li>I use it on daily basis, because it gives a great and relaxing feeling to my back after using it.</li>
            <li>Really relieves the knots quickly.</li>
            <li>The ording time was very fast</li>
            <li>Overall - a very good alternative to traditional old fashion</li>
            <li>Im going to get more silicone cups since they can be left in place or used for cupping massage.  </li>
            <li>My first time trying to detach the tube from the suction gun the attachment piece broke off from the tube.  </li>
            <li>This is the same quality set used by the TCM practitioner I see on a regular basis, very solid and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>first part of the exposed wires are not sealed straws.&lt;br /&gt;Hand</li>
            <li>Everything went swimmingly for me the first time.</li>
            <li>Extension pump Broke first day</li>
            <li>How can anyone think that this is a logical solution?  </li>
            <li>Much easier than fire cupping!</li>
            <li>love the air hose so that you can put the cups on your own body in hard to reach places!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the glass cups that the professional masseuses use, but the plastic is heavy enough and the variety is nice.</li>
            <li>its so good for each part of body especially the back.</li>
            <li>it feels like the little korean lady is right in the comfort of my own home...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much, which I was very nervous about.</li>
            <li>It is just as good or if not better than what they use at my Acupuncturist.  </li>
            <li>It can be used easily by anybody, safer than the traditional cupping equipment.  </li>
            <li>It has different size of cups and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Has been tremendous in healing chronic pain that was years old.</li>
            <li>A fellow student, who was actually taught how to use these, has a set, and I marveled at how easy they were to use.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the case that this comes in, which keeps things organized and easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and the product looks professional.  </li>
            <li>Months later, still using these and working just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply them and to take them down.</li>
            <li>Since getting them, i&#x27;m not using this as much.</li>
            <li>Too much money for this lack of quality product.</li>
            <li>It was shipped on time and is more durable than expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>Gua Sha takes too much time and too much work.</li>
            <li>Very helpful set.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>i cant really rate this product..</li>
            <li>it really help relieve pressure on my husband&#x27;s shoulder.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve appreciated directions to product.</li>
            <li>They are durable and really help to ease pain.</li>
            <li>and I am very please with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The extension doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>Thanks  Galina</li>
            <li>Work really well to release muscle sore/ache.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>thanks for the info.  </li>
            <li>This really helps my trigger spots on my body.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s whole family had a family cupping night!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My wife has done this on my back a couple of times and it feels just great, But don&#x27;t get scared when you look at your back the next day.</li>
            <li>First, the extension tube, that one would use to say, cup one&#x27;s back, breaks far too easily.  </li>
            <li>The tube repeatedly falls off the cups and the suction is not near as strong as the silicone cups.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel better right away for those small aches and pains.</li>
            <li>At the first sign of blemish I wash my face and put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Great anytime after a face wash, if I do it before bed every night, my face is always clear in the morning</li>
            <li>The only con to this is it sometimes leave red marks the size of the cups on your skin for several days, but it is a good indicator of the status of your health.</li>
            <li>Small instruction manual would have been nice.</li>
            <li>None the less, i&#x27;m glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li>Quality of materials is decent for the price.</li>
            <li>I would be more cautious about recommending them if you were using them on multiple patients as proper sterile technique</li>
            <li>It is a decent set for at home use.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to treat myself on my upper back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>One has to be careful not to over pump, the suction can be too strong.</li>
            <li>It seems to be as high a quality as the one my practioner uses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Sturdy high quality plastic.</li>
            <li>Durability,withstand high heat with no foggy as stated.</li>
            <li>Yes they cups are plastic, but high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li>I thought it was high quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;edit: the suction connector on this set did break with normal use.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I had bruises on the problematic parts of my back,but that is normal and well known about cupping.</li>
            <li>They are pretty easy to use with the pump, and I can put the cups on my lower back by myself, however it&#x27;s harder to do the shoulders without help.</li>
            <li>In fact, the &#x27;hickies&#x27; on my back give proof that you really do not need more than 4 or 5 pumps.   </li>
            <li>Also why it is important to actually know where specific points are located...</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find an acupuncturist in the small town I live in (or the surrounding areas)</li>
            <li>Unlike The next time I buy the first type.</li>
            <li>I would try the silicone cups first because they are easier to use especially if your just doing work on yourself.</li>
            <li>You just cant get the full affect if your trying to do it yourself, especially your back.</li>
            <li>sure what the little red things are for and no instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li>My only thing with them, is that if I pump too many pumps, I can not let out just a little bit of air.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have wished is for the little booklet that comes with it to be more extensive and legible.</li>
            <li>this what i have been looking for easy to use,nice case,glad i bought the extension for hard to reach areas would recommend highly</li>
            <li>The case is cheap, arrived broken and split, the cups don&#x27;t hold very well and the plunger doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li>This cupping set came in yesterday and I have to say WOW.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and it is very convenient</li>
            <li>When my shoulder gets sore, on go the cups--helps considerably.  </li>
            <li>Plus, my 1-year old loves to grab them and through them on the floor</li>
            <li>My daughter who is 8 years old can even use these cups to give me cupping.</li>
            <li>Seeing as I&#x27;m new to this form of alternative medicine, I wish they sent some information as to general placement and desired effects.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for everyone else, I highly suggest you experience cupping therapy by a professional BEFORE trying to this on yourself at home - if not done properly you can leave marks or welts on your body.. or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for this particular set, I rate it TEN STARS!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the more expensive sets I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The pump is high quality and develops a lot of vacuum.</li>
            <li>as with anything, i think it does help my intense pain with immediate help, but for long term help... time will tell.</li>
            <li>No real instruction on exactly where to use the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34;, but there is plenty of information on the web if one has an interest.</li>
            <li>I prefer using the hand pump only because it creates more suction, but the extension cord is convenient if you wanted to do it on hard to get areas.</li>
            <li>It handle the wear and tear of my 3 year old and 1 year old trying to help daddy fix his sore back  </li>
            <li>This cupping set is much higher quality than other cupping sets I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use this on my shoulders and entire back.</li>
            <li>nobody has tried it with this particular product (or this specific brand&#x27;s similar products even), would you mind giving it a shot and posting some feedback?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not a healthcare professional and did not do extensive \\&quot;research\\&quot; before chosing this set.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful to not use too much pressure,but these do the trick.</li>
            <li>They really help with the pain and inflammation for a lot of the harder cases.</li>
            <li>Im not pleased with the way the lip &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; into the flesh even with mild suction.  </li>
            <li>Ten minutes later, full range of motion with only a slight tightness remaining.</li>
            <li>The cups are several times more efficient than a massage, especially on stiff muscles.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the suction gun does not deliver adequate suction in one or two pumps and eventually is simply unable to provide any real suction at all.</li>
            <li>I know English a little I give the star by how much it work.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this AcuZone set!</li>
            <li> I love this set!  </li>
            <li> I think it is better to let someone else do it for you!</li>
            <li> I had been introduced to cupping 5 years ago and was aware of the marvelous results they yield.  </li>
            <li> Love em!</li>
            <li> I especially loved how fast it got here!</li>
            <li> Very much like that the cupping set comes in a nice travel kit, and the cups works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> they are easy to use and work great</li>
            <li> The price was amazing for the quality and quantity.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen is amazing.</li>
            <li> An amazing deal I have to say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve started working with the silicon cups and they are amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> The ambiance isn&#x27;t as nice, I don&#x27;t get to lie on a heated table and no one is serving me tea when I cup at home</li>
            <li> The case keeps things nice and organized.</li>
            <li> I will wait on until I&#x27;m more experienced. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have two sets in order to be able to do one side of the body at one time.  </li>
            <li> The price is a nice bet to see if this home therapy is for you.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I requested and received this cupping set as a gift and am loving it.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if they offered a glass option.  </li>
            <li> Nice case if you use it to carry around.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> Greatest of cups, works very well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and works great!</li>
            <li> I really just can&#x27;t fully express how happy I am with this set!</li>
            <li> WOuld is nice about it</li>
            <li> Thanks for another job well done and happy customer !</li>
            <li> Waited a long time to find the best quality and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I buy very good.</li>
            <li> The kit is neatly assembled and very handy to transport and store in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li> Since this is the best looking cupping set for the most reasonable price, I placed an additional order with this seller.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> the cups work fine without the extension, able to get good suction.  </li>
            <li> If you have gone to an acupuncturist and experienced cupping first hand, you will understand the benefits of cupping and why having your own cupping set would be a good idea ;-)  </li>
            <li> I will use them on myself, and Im pleased at how easily I can reach my own neck with the extender, but I will not use them on clients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the seller and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality: the edge of the cups is smooth, which is important.  </li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> If you understand cupping you will love it too.</li>
            <li> So glad that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> I am really glad I decided to get this item.</li>
            <li> When sucking comes at a premium, make sure you use premium quality cups.  </li>
            <li> Just wish there were more instruction... on where and what they were used for.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li> I will ordering more</li>
            <li> Love this cupping set.</li>
            <li> My client&#x27;s love</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finding more and more uses for it and customers are requesting cupping.</li>
            <li> Everything in the set works well and my practitioner found it most satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I wished they would offer more #2, #3, #4 and #5&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;the suction plunger works well and the extension hose still works and hasn&#x27;t cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> all I would say it&#x27;s an ok set.</li>
            <li> The clients I use cupping on love it and the change they have felt</li>
            <li> and I am glad she likes it.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to buy, especially at this great price!</li>
            <li> I like cupping and my clients find it to be a most acceptable and helpful modality for relief of muscular pain.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller via amazon, and their solution is to replace sub par product with more sub par product.</li>
            <li> Our massage therapists love this set.</li>
            <li> After using them for a while, I have noticed that I am able to pin point my pain and cup just what is needed.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They are one of my favorite purchases this year.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t have the strength to do deep tissue massage, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I used a set at my Therapist&#x27;s place &amp; they worked much better, even though it was the identical set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this set.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets and gave one to my grand daughter who is going to nursing school, and she loves it too.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea that more oxygen and release of toxins may help my recovery.</li>
            <li> I like it not glass because if you accidently drop it is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love cupping</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> better than going to the doctor.</li>
            <li> This is good cupping set, but care full when use this with pressure pointers do not suck it to strong because it will hurt you to the bone</li>
            <li> To be able to offer this modality to clients is just another unique gift you can add to your list of services!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality plastic and comes in a very nice case.</li>
            <li> I am sure this will get better as I become more familiar with this set</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re still able to use it, but it falls off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only effective but great quality</li>
            <li> The instruction is very clear and the picture adds great to the operation of working with the cup.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, I would recommend it to anybody and especially to professionals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Typically glass would be recommended over plastic cups for sliding because glass can provide a smooth surface edge for skin contact that would allow the product to glide over the skin with the use of appropriate oil and maintain suction without causing damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, this is a great pump cup set, HOWEVER it says in the description that these can be boiled to sterilize (which is why I bought them), but when they arrived, it is clearly stated in the instructions that they cannot be boiled.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Very Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I wish there were some more detailed instructions or treatment protocols</li>
            <li> I decided to order this because I heard so much good reviews from my peers, and how much easier it is to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted and more!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and fantastic carrying case!</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to regulate suction by the number of pulls of the pump trigger.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> These pop off and aren&#x27;t as easily manipulated during cupping session.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and patients tolerate it without complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This set works so well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use just YouTube it if you don&#x27;t already know how.</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> THE PLASTIC CUPS WERE MANUFACTURED UPTO STANDARD , NICELY PACKED AND CONTAINED IN A NICE SUITE CASE LIKE A LAP TOP.</li>
            <li> This cupping set would be perfectly fine if it were not for two issues.  </li>
            <li> It is also light and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li> Suction- MORE than adequate.</li>
            <li> the suction on the cups isn&#x27;t fabulous if the size is anything less than perfect for the area of the body you are working on.</li>
            <li> It is low  in cost, has great suctioning and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good quality cupping massage set I ever have before, I used to bought some very cheap prices, but after used just a few time then it look like start to crack on the head of the cup.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for stationary cupping,but you can move them around with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I enjoy working with this product.  </li>
            <li> My clients enjoy this modality</li>
            <li> This set includes five different sized cups, but I find the largest three sizes to be the most effective and covers more area.</li>
            <li> fantastic purchase</li>
            <li> Work well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing cupping for a few months and this cupping set is awesome.</li>
            <li> light the candles &amp; turn on the massage music - have some fun!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the best deal so far on amazon when it comes to prices and the amount of cups you get.</li>
            <li> For a beginner in cupping, this one is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I really am excited and can&#x27;t wait to get started using these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have so many cups in different sizes, but I would rather have another silicon set.</li>
            <li> Other than that, washes easy, great storage, highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for a good cupping set and low and behold</li>
            <li> Items were received in good condition and worked properly.</li>
            <li> If you put too much pressure on them, i am sure they could break.</li>
            <li> But if your looking for something to massage yourself with and get the full affect of a cupping treatment I would go to a therapist that knows how to use them.</li>
            <li> Obviously tricky matching the cup size to the location so that you get a good seal.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it came with more detailed instructions or tips on how to use the cups more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I also gently pull up on the cup while it is attached for more tissue stretching.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> The cups seal very wel l and the suction has been more than adequate.</li>
            <li> and it arrived surprisingly quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a super set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure for the first two or three months of having this</li>
            <li> I think it is a worthy buying.</li>
            <li> The cupping set is awesome and the only draw back</li>
            <li> The basics are easy enough that anyone can use this medical tool and enjoy great results.</li>
            <li> It has a variety of sizes of cups (with additional magnets for direct point stimulation if desired) and the extension hose allows me to get cups accurately placed on most areas of my own back, shoulders, neck, etc.  </li>
            <li> Great for breaking up adhesions associated with old injuries and many other things.</li>
            <li> The cups are pretty good quality and they work terrific.</li>
            <li> far\\&quot; and too much may give you a rash, its strong stuff.</li>
            <li> and it has not failed me!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough how much i love these cups!</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and I love it!</li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Great buy folks!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with many cups of different sizes.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine&#x27;s eyes are always red, after he \\&quot;cups\\&quot; (lol), his eyes clear up tremendously.  </li>
            <li> This item was definitely worth what i paid for it</li>
            <li> All of the cupping materials were in good condition, but the carry case was torn and will not last much longer.</li>
            <li> i would have liked 4 or so larger cups though.</li>
            <li> These were bought for my own personal use.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li> It is handy to have a personal set.</li>
            <li> As the cost was so low, I had to purchase my own set.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to work with</li>
            <li> Got the cupping set quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use only the problem when squeeze the handle for air, the head piece comes off easily off and on.</li>
            <li> The suction is very strong but made from low grade plastic.  </li>
            <li> but I love it more then my other kit!</li>
            <li> It is more convenient, easier to use and much more efficient than my previously bought &amp;#34;dragon&amp;#34; set made in Vietnam.</li>
            <li> The cups are easy to clean; for those using the wet cupping method this is important.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, comes with clear directions and is as advertised.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much that we ended up ordering a second one for a family member.</li>
            <li> I use it on daily basis, because it gives a great and relaxing feeling to my back after using it.</li>
            <li> Really relieves the knots quickly.</li>
            <li> The ording time was very fast</li>
            <li> Overall - a very good alternative to traditional old fashion</li>
            <li> Im going to get more silicone cups since they can be left in place or used for cupping massage.  </li>
            <li> My first time trying to detach the tube from the suction gun the attachment piece broke off from the tube.  </li>
            <li> This is the same quality set used by the TCM practitioner I see on a regular basis, very solid and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> first part of the exposed wires are not sealed straws.&lt;br /&gt;Hand</li>
            <li> Everything went swimmingly for me the first time.</li>
            <li> Extension pump Broke first day</li>
            <li> How can anyone think that this is a logical solution?  </li>
            <li> Much easier than fire cupping!</li>
            <li> love the air hose so that you can put the cups on your own body in hard to reach places!  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the glass cups that the professional masseuses use, but the plastic is heavy enough and the variety is nice.</li>
            <li> its so good for each part of body especially the back.</li>
            <li> it feels like the little korean lady is right in the comfort of my own home...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much, which I was very nervous about.</li>
            <li> It is just as good or if not better than what they use at my Acupuncturist.  </li>
            <li> It can be used easily by anybody, safer than the traditional cupping equipment.  </li>
            <li> It has different size of cups and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Has been tremendous in healing chronic pain that was years old.</li>
            <li> A fellow student, who was actually taught how to use these, has a set, and I marveled at how easy they were to use.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the case that this comes in, which keeps things organized and easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and the product looks professional.  </li>
            <li> Months later, still using these and working just fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply them and to take them down.</li>
            <li> Since getting them, i&#x27;m not using this as much.</li>
            <li> Too much money for this lack of quality product.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time and is more durable than expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Gua Sha takes too much time and too much work.</li>
            <li> Very helpful set.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  </li>
            <li> i cant really rate this product..</li>
            <li> it really help relieve pressure on my husband&#x27;s shoulder.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve appreciated directions to product.</li>
            <li> They are durable and really help to ease pain.</li>
            <li> and I am very please with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The extension doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Thanks  Galina</li>
            <li> Work really well to release muscle sore/ache.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> thanks for the info.  </li>
            <li> This really helps my trigger spots on my body.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s whole family had a family cupping night!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife has done this on my back a couple of times and it feels just great, But don&#x27;t get scared when you look at your back the next day.</li>
            <li> First, the extension tube, that one would use to say, cup one&#x27;s back, breaks far too easily.  </li>
            <li> The tube repeatedly falls off the cups and the suction is not near as strong as the silicone cups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Makes you feel better right away for those small aches and pains.</li>
            <li> At the first sign of blemish I wash my face and put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Great anytime after a face wash, if I do it before bed every night, my face is always clear in the morning</li>
            <li> The only con to this is it sometimes leave red marks the size of the cups on your skin for several days, but it is a good indicator of the status of your health.</li>
            <li> Small instruction manual would have been nice.</li>
            <li> None the less, i&#x27;m glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li> Quality of materials is decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I would be more cautious about recommending them if you were using them on multiple patients as proper sterile technique</li>
            <li> It is a decent set for at home use.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to be able to treat myself on my upper back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> One has to be careful not to over pump, the suction can be too strong.</li>
            <li> It seems to be as high a quality as the one my practioner uses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> Durability,withstand high heat with no foggy as stated.</li>
            <li> Yes they cups are plastic, but high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li> I thought it was high quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;edit: the suction connector on this set did break with normal use.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I had bruises on the problematic parts of my back,but that is normal and well known about cupping.</li>
            <li> They are pretty easy to use with the pump, and I can put the cups on my lower back by myself, however it&#x27;s harder to do the shoulders without help.</li>
            <li> In fact, the &#x27;hickies&#x27; on my back give proof that you really do not need more than 4 or 5 pumps.   </li>
            <li> Also why it is important to actually know where specific points are located...</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find an acupuncturist in the small town I live in (or the surrounding areas)</li>
            <li> Unlike The next time I buy the first type.</li>
            <li> I would try the silicone cups first because they are easier to use especially if your just doing work on yourself.</li>
            <li> You just cant get the full affect if your trying to do it yourself, especially your back.</li>
            <li> sure what the little red things are for and no instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li> My only thing with them, is that if I pump too many pumps, I can not let out just a little bit of air.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have wished is for the little booklet that comes with it to be more extensive and legible.</li>
            <li> this what i have been looking for easy to use,nice case,glad i bought the extension for hard to reach areas would recommend highly</li>
            <li> The case is cheap, arrived broken and split, the cups don&#x27;t hold very well and the plunger doesn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li> This cupping set came in yesterday and I have to say WOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and it is very convenient</li>
            <li> When my shoulder gets sore, on go the cups--helps considerably.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my 1-year old loves to grab them and through them on the floor</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 8 years old can even use these cups to give me cupping.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I&#x27;m new to this form of alternative medicine, I wish they sent some information as to general placement and desired effects.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, for everyone else, I highly suggest you experience cupping therapy by a professional BEFORE trying to this on yourself at home - if not done properly you can leave marks or welts on your body.. or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for this particular set, I rate it TEN STARS!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the more expensive sets I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The pump is high quality and develops a lot of vacuum.</li>
            <li> as with anything, i think it does help my intense pain with immediate help, but for long term help... time will tell.</li>
            <li> No real instruction on exactly where to use the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34;, but there is plenty of information on the web if one has an interest.</li>
            <li> I prefer using the hand pump only because it creates more suction, but the extension cord is convenient if you wanted to do it on hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> It handle the wear and tear of my 3 year old and 1 year old trying to help daddy fix his sore back  </li>
            <li> This cupping set is much higher quality than other cupping sets I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this on my shoulders and entire back.</li>
            <li> nobody has tried it with this particular product (or this specific brand&#x27;s similar products even), would you mind giving it a shot and posting some feedback?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not a healthcare professional and did not do extensive \\&quot;research\\&quot; before chosing this set.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to not use too much pressure,but these do the trick.</li>
            <li> They really help with the pain and inflammation for a lot of the harder cases.</li>
            <li> Im not pleased with the way the lip &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; into the flesh even with mild suction.  </li>
            <li> Ten minutes later, full range of motion with only a slight tightness remaining.</li>
            <li> The cups are several times more efficient than a massage, especially on stiff muscles.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the suction gun does not deliver adequate suction in one or two pumps and eventually is simply unable to provide any real suction at all.</li>
            <li> I know English a little I give the star by how much it work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only one minor thing is the extension tube that it comes with.</li>
            <li> But this is not really a big deal in the long run.</li>
            <li> within the first month my only #2 cup cracked in multiple places and a few weeks later one of my # 1 cups cracked in a few places.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was scary at first, but I was starting to feel it go away after the first 2 cups was down.</li>
            <li> works well, but would prefer some of the cups to have a curved edge to secure the cup in the hard to reach areas of the body (small, curvy spots like the elbow, etc.)</li>
            <li> Well made product and the cups worked as expected with no vacuum leakage.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on long term durability.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about so far after a few trial uses.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave on too long though.</li>
            <li> we make a point to have amateur \\&quot;cupping\\&quot; nights &amp; try new areas or running cupping.</li>
            <li> All the guns appear to be similar with other sets.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> and I did not have to wait very long to start my process.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had surgery on my knee 2x&#x27;s, so it swells occasionally from being so active.  </li>
            <li> However the  manual is too   limited.    </li>
            <li> I slide the cup along muscles with a thin film of oil applied to the skin first.</li>
            <li> I have seen several bad reveiws about this showing it being cheap.</li>
            <li> Had set for 4 days now with absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;K.S. Choi does not offer Prime, also extremely costly when ordering from their website because of overpriced shipping fee</li>
            <li> The set works well and it was a small investment, I am a physical therapist who would like to try cupping but would not have put out a lot of money for the opportunity.  </li>
            <li> peak converter not right one that my technician want to small in website show bigger wt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very physically active, climbing hills, yoga, XMA, basketball, etc.</li>
            <li> were a little skeptical at first but changed their minds after application.</li>
            <li> Even it has a tube (assessories) but still hard to use myself to my back.</li>
            <li> The end of the hose that connects to the cup does not stay securly fastened to the cup, but that is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I was really afraid I was buying lesser quality because the price is so modest compared to other sets I have researched.</li>
            <li> My husband is not good at using equipment but he had no problem doing my back today with these cups.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see this item ship so quickly.</li>
            <li> Watch your portions though, a \\&quot;little goes</li>
            <li> I believe I paid a little over $50 for this set</li>
            <li> have had minor issues with the pump interface to the extension or directly to a cup being very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything missing.</li>
            <li> The bruises dissapeared after few days.</li>
            <li> Just need pump 2 times and give for 15 min and all your trouble went away.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on Amazon a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I would rate 4 as it&#x27;s missing the packaging label of what each cup size is.</li>
            <li> Those bruises take a few days to fade.</li>
            <li> I used it mainly to cure this cold</li>
            <li> can be a bit awkward , and if you are a larger person, you may be unable to reach certain areas without help.</li>
            <li> As some are frustrated with lack of \\&quot;instructions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;**The Red Acupressure Tips: Place under the cups, as you draw suction, it will apply pressure to the middle of the flesh that was pulled up.</li>
            <li> Although I am in Oriental Medical school and prefer to use fire cupping for my patients, it is rather difficult to use them on myself...</li>
            <li> 2.4 lbs when i got it to small and wt.only&lt;</li>
            <li> Oh, and don&#x27;t apply excessive force to your stuff and it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> I like the set, but sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to get the cups to seal.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well with some patients, its hard to set up by yourself</li>
            <li> The cups are made of really thick and hard plastic</li>
            <li> This was disappointing, but I still like the cups and have bought a second set to use for my family.</li>
            <li> At least I was.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy this because the low price</li>
            <li> We are getting tired of \\&quot;gua</li>
            <li> Yes, the item came well packed, nothing broken and just as advertised.</li>
            <li> you can use any time when you have painful but not more than 7-10 min</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and plan to buy a different cupping set.</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with this product  </li>
            <li> and we are having to pull the lever from one side; a bit uncomfortable (hence the 4 starts).  </li>
            <li> Instead of going to expensive and time consuming sessions of cupping therapy, I decided to buy this cupping set for the convenience of doing it anytime at home.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not work as well as the glass cups.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be afraid of this -</li>
            <li> My homeopathic medicine assistant used this cupping set on me when I had a cold.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was definitely worth what i paid for it and it arrived surprisingly quickly. Its plastic....the suction on the cups isn&#x27;t fabulous if the size is anything less than perfect for the area of the body you are working on. And the suction isn&#x27;t fool proof. but it does work. There is a reason that the more expensive units cost what they do. having said that, if you can&#x27;t afford a more expensive unit, where the cups are glass, this one will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve started working with the silicon cups and they are amazingly effective. Since getting them, i&#x27;m not using this as much. They are so simple. None the less, i&#x27;m glad i purchased this. It is a good deal for the price, including the shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish you could purchase extra handles for this kit. It works great though!</li>
            <li> Bought this set to use on my family and in my massage practice.  Im not pleased with the way the lip &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; into the flesh even with mild suction.  Ive used traditional glass cups for years and although Ive been warned about plastic cups I had hoped these wouldnt bite.  I will use them on myself, and Im pleased at how easily I can reach my own neck with the extender, but I will not use them on clients.  Do not even think about using them for slide or massage cupping techniques.  Because of the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; they will not move or slide once suctioned.  Im going to get more silicone cups since they can be left in place or used for cupping massage.  Quality of materials is decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Price and Shipping: Kangzhu&lt;br /&gt;K.S. Choi does not offer Prime, also extremely costly when ordering from their website because of overpriced shipping fee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of Cup: K.S. Choi&lt;br /&gt;K.S. Choi&#x27;s suction cups are made thinner,  and the shape of a cup makes big difference for its feel and the strength of suction on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other: about the same in different reasons&lt;br /&gt;Kangzhu uses cardboad box and suction gun somehow started not working well  after using about 5 times.  K.S. choi&#x27;s extension tube is the worst, the rubber is junk!!  A part of it started splitting soon after.  If the tube didn&#x27;t break, I would give K S Choi cupping set five stars.</li>
            <li> I enjoy working with this product.  The end of the hose that connects to the cup does not stay securly fastened to the cup, but that is my only complaint.  My clients enjoy this modality</li>
            <li> Got the cupping set quickly and it was exactly as described. Works great! I&#x27;m really pleased with the seller and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The case is cheap, arrived broken and split, the cups don&#x27;t hold very well and the plunger doesn&#x27;t work very well either. Too much money for this lack of quality product.</li>
            <li> This cupping set would be perfectly fine if it were not for two issues.  First, the extension tube, that one would use to say, cup one&#x27;s back, breaks far too easily.  My first time trying to detach the tube from the suction gun the attachment piece broke off from the tube.  Secondly, the suction gun does not deliver adequate suction in one or two pumps and eventually is simply unable to provide any real suction at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed and plan to buy a different cupping set.</li>
            <li> I love this AcuZone set! It is more convenient, easier to use and much more efficient than my previously bought &amp;#34;dragon&amp;#34; set made in Vietnam. Very good product, I would recommend it to anybody and especially to professionals.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with many cups of different sizes.  The price was amazing for the quality and quantity.  I can&#x27;t think of anything missing.</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality: the edge of the cups is smooth, which is important.  It can be used easily by anybody, safer than the traditional cupping equipment.  I even travel with some cups.  I have referred this product to my friends and some doctors.  They all like it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  I am not a healthcare professional and did not do extensive \\&quot;research\\&quot; before chosing this set.  It seems to have been a good deal.  The only thing I would have wished is for the little booklet that comes with it to be more extensive and legible.</li>
            <li> This has been a great set. I was really afraid I was buying lesser quality because the price is so modest compared to other sets I have researched. I have had this set for about a month and it has performed beautifully. It seems to be as high a quality as the one my practioner uses. Now I, or a family member, can cup me at my convenience and I save $70. The ambiance isn&#x27;t as nice, I don&#x27;t get to lie on a heated table and no one is serving me tea when I cup at home but...&lt;br /&gt;This is a super set. You won&#x27;t regret the purchase if you need a cupping set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: It has been two years since I got this set. I still love it. If you understand cupping you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this set!  So glad that I ordered it.  I was going to pay $90/hr for a cupping massage in my area and now I can use it on areas anytime I want.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> This is the same quality set used by the TCM practitioner I see on a regular basis, very solid and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> perfect quality. we make a point to have amateur \\&quot;cupping\\&quot; nights &amp; try new areas or running cupping. light the candles &amp; turn on the massage music - have some fun! as with anything, i think it does help my intense pain with immediate help, but for long term help... time will tell. i just keep trying. don&#x27;t be afraid of this - it&#x27;s great for problem areas or chronic pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: the suction connector on this set did break with normal use. we&#x27;re still able to use it, but it falls off easily. i haven&#x27;t found a replacement part yet or i&#x27;d link it.</li>
            <li> very good products !!</li>
            <li> Well made product and the cups worked as expected with no vacuum leakage.  However, it did not help the issue we were trying to resolve.</li>
            <li> This was an exceptional product. It was shipped on time and is more durable than expected. The case keeps things nice and organized. I would purchase this again in the future!</li>
            <li> This set was recommended my by my physical therapist, who uses it in his practice.</li>
            <li> This is a great cupping set! I&#x27;m a student in Traditional Chinese Medicine and have used it with practice patients for colds/flus aches and pains and it has not failed me! Easy to use, easy to clean and fantastic carrying case! I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Traditionally, we use fire in the cup method. We are getting tired of \\&quot;gua sha\\&quot; too. Gua Sha takes too much time and too much work. I decided to order this because I heard so much good reviews from my peers, and how much easier it is to use. We couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores here, so we had to purchase it online. This cupping set came in yesterday and I have to say WOW. It took my back pain away. It was scary at first, but I was starting to feel it go away after the first 2 cups was down. I used it mainly to cure this cold I&#x27;m having. I think I will be using this set as a massage therapy from now on! Just pump once and it does its job. I left it on for 5 mins. You don&#x27;t need to leave on any longer. I think it is better to let someone else do it for you! It has an extended tube for you to do it yourself. I will wait on until I&#x27;m more experienced. :)</li>
            <li> These cups work well for me. I have to be careful to not use too much pressure,but these do the trick.</li>
            <li> If you have gone to an acupuncturist and experienced cupping first hand, you will understand the benefits of cupping and why having your own cupping set would be a good idea ;-)  Meanwhile, for everyone else, I highly suggest you experience cupping therapy by a professional BEFORE trying to this on yourself at home - if not done properly you can leave marks or welts on your body.. or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular set, I rate it TEN STARS!!  Excellent quality, exceptional value!</li>
            <li> Ever since we received these our clients have been happy with the treatments this kit provides! Great quality and great results.</li>
            <li> All of the cupping materials were in good condition, but the carry case was torn and will not last much longer.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy cups. They get the job done and a speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I used this on my husband and son and then I let my husband use this on me.  I loved this product and my husband and son were a little skeptical at first but changed their minds after application.</li>
            <li> Works Great.  Good Quality.  Chose this set because it came with carrying case and extension air hose.  I can already tell a difference since I have been using this cupping set. It may or may not work for you, but iir works for me!</li>
            <li> Very helpful set. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it is very convenient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once because it did not come with any instructions.  It appears to be good quality but I actually do not have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with this product  It handle the wear and tear of my 3 year old and 1 year old trying to help daddy fix his sore back  Great suction  Fast shipping  No damages</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It is just as good or if not better than what they use at my Acupuncturist.  Has everything you need to work on yourself.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist. I haven&#x27;t properly learned cupping in a class but only have watched videos. So me and a therapist friend exchange cupping and we try things as we go along. This is a very good set, I like that its plastic in case one falls on the floor. and I like that its a pump, I wouldn&#x27;t wana be messing around with the fire cups. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to do cupping.</li>
            <li> The cups are pretty good quality and they work terrific. My daughter and I have been using them.  I had been introduced to cupping 5 years ago and was aware of the marvelous results they yield.  The gun handle broke and we are having to pull the lever from one side; a bit uncomfortable (hence the 4 starts).  But we have been using the cups every day, for 3 weeks now.  It&#x27;s good to have two sets in order to be able to do one side of the body at one time.  Delivery was super fast and the product looks professional.  Since this is the best looking cupping set for the most reasonable price, I placed an additional order with this seller.  All the guns appear to be similar with other sets.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Instead of going to expensive and time consuming sessions of cupping therapy, I decided to buy this cupping set for the convenience of doing it anytime at home. I mainly use this on my shoulders and entire back. This set includes five different sized cups, but I find the largest three sizes to be the most effective and covers more area. The cups are made of really thick and hard plastic so I have used this for over two years without anything breaking yet. I prefer using the hand pump only because it creates more suction, but the extension cord is convenient if you wanted to do it on hard to get areas. Also, it is best to use the red pointy things inside the suction cup because it brings the best results. For about ten to fifteen minutes each session, my body feels relief of tension and stress. I have bought several sets of these for family and friends who prefer this to massage therapy. The only con to this is it sometimes leave red marks the size of the cups on your skin for several days, but it is a good indicator of the status of your health. The price is a nice bet to see if this home therapy is for you.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great set and it works.</li>
            <li> Came to me on time and the quality is great. I was so happy to pay the price I paid and will be buying some for friends and family.</li>
            <li> Perfect massage cupping set. So easy to use. Just pull the pump handle and you get the suction you want. They are perfect for stationary cupping,but you can move them around with a little practice. My daughter is a massage therapist and I gave her the set. I am going to purchase another set to keep at my house.</li>
            <li> This is good cupping set, but care full when use this with pressure pointers do not suck it to strong because it will hurt you to the bone</li>
            <li> this is a really good face cream. At the first sign of blemish I wash my face and put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Great anytime after a face wash, if I do it before bed every night, my face is always clear in the morning, that&#x27;s nice. Watch your portions though, a \\&quot;little goes far\\&quot; and too much may give you a rash, its strong stuff.</li>
            <li> Hello folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a review, rather is a question.  I realize the product description includes a note stating this product is NOT recommended for slide cupping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone used it for this purpose?  Could you give feedback on this, please?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically glass would be recommended over plastic cups for sliding because glass can provide a smooth surface edge for skin contact that would allow the product to glide over the skin with the use of appropriate oil and maintain suction without causing damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nobody has tried it with this particular product (or this specific brand&#x27;s similar products even), would you mind giving it a shot and posting some feedback?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these!!! fantastic purchase</li>
            <li> I requested and received this cupping set as a gift and am loving it.  The kit is neatly assembled and very handy to transport and store in its original packaging.  Although I am in Oriental Medical school and prefer to use fire cupping for my patients, it is rather difficult to use them on myself...that is where this cupping set is great!  It has a variety of sizes of cups (with additional magnets for direct point stimulation if desired) and the extension hose allows me to get cups accurately placed on most areas of my own back, shoulders, neck, etc.  Since I am only using it on myself, it does not bother me that the cups cannot be autoclaved nor should the plastic be subjected to extensive bleaching for sterilization/cleaning purposes.  I would be more cautious about recommending them if you were using them on multiple patients as proper sterile technique could either be a problem to achieve or may severely shorten the longevity of these cups since they are plastic.</li>
            <li> Sturdy high quality plastic. Works well. Easy to regulate suction by the number of pulls of the pump trigger.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried to use magnets. Overall - a very good alternative to traditional old fashion, glass made suction cups.</li>
            <li> have not used it yet, i am looking to get properly trained to use the cupping system until then i cant really rate this product..</li>
            <li> My husband is not good at using equipment but he had no problem doing my back today with these cups. Great set.</li>
            <li> Plastic parts inside the box straws distorted.&lt;br /&gt;The first part of the exposed wires are not sealed straws.&lt;br /&gt;Hand pump well.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I buy very good. Unlike The next time I buy the first type.</li>
            <li> No complaints with this set.  Would be nice if they offered a glass option.  Great build/material.  Nice case if you use it to carry around.</li>
            <li> its so good for each part of body especially the back. i strongly recommend it. you can use any time when you have painful but not more than 7-10 min</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my cupping set. I am really glad I decided to get this item. Great buy.</li>
            <li> When sucking comes at a premium, make sure you use premium quality cups.  It would be a 5 star rating, but that damn handle has a tendency to break over time and the replacement piece is $15.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time.  Work well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Months later, still using these and working just fine.  When my shoulder gets sore, on go the cups--helps considerably.  I&#x27;m happy with this product and for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> For a beginner in cupping, this one is super easy to use.  It does work!  it really help relieve pressure on my husband&#x27;s shoulder.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve appreciated directions to product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have so many cups in different sizes, but I would rather have another silicon set. These pop off and aren&#x27;t as easily manipulated during cupping session.</li>
            <li> Just wish there were more instruction... on where and what they were used for.</li>
            <li> Love em! Use them with all of my patients!  They really help with the pain and inflammation for a lot of the harder cases.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. It has worked well in the clinic. Easy to use and patients tolerate it without complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure for the first two or three months of having this I just made everyone who came to my house try this. It doesn&#x27;t hurt very much, which I was very nervous about. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Everything went swimmingly for me the first time. Just make sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use only the problem when squeeze the handle for air, the head piece comes off easily off and on.</li>
            <li> it was very nice quality. I will definitely recommend it to other people. the price of this product is good.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars but I have only used it once so I cannot comment on long term durability. It is easy to use, comes with clear directions and is as advertised. Pump delivers Good suction</li>
            <li> My wife researched and found this item as being a possible item to help her back and shoulder pain. She liked it so much that we ended up ordering a second one for a family member.</li>
            <li> they are easy to use and work great</li>
            <li> This cupping set is much higher quality than other cupping sets I have purchased.  Plus, my 1-year old loves to grab them and through them on the floor and I haven&#x27;t had any break yet.  They are durable and really help to ease pain.</li>
            <li> This cupping set is truly a premium quality product. It&#x27;s very easy to apply them and to take them down. I use it on daily basis, because it gives a great and relaxing feeling to my back after using it. In the beginning I had bruises on the problematic parts of my back,but that is normal and well known about cupping. The bruises dissapeared after few days. They signalize where a problem is in your body. It&#x27;s recommended to use it only for couple of minutes in the beginning. The cups are several times more efficient than a massage, especially on stiff muscles.  They are a great tool to fight with cellulitis too.</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for a good cupping set and low and behold I found this! This is pretty much the best deal so far on amazon when it comes to prices and the amount of cups you get. I especially loved how fast it got here! The only one minor thing is the extension tube that it comes with. It doesn&#x27;t give the same suction power when not used. Other than that it works perfect.</li>
            <li> So happy with this. Loving it.</li>
            <li> Items were received in good condition and worked properly.</li>
            <li> Durability,withstand high heat with no foggy as stated. I will ordering more</li>
            <li> I already have two of these sets and bought a third one for a friend.  We are both massage therapists.</li>
            <li> March 14, 2011    This is a good product.  However the  manual is too   limited.    Edna D</li>
            <li> I know English a little I give the star by how much it work.&lt;br /&gt;The peak converter not right one that my technician want to small in website show bigger wt. 2.4 lbs when i got it to small and wt.only&lt;br /&gt;1.3 lbs not match with my equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;nichakul</li>
            <li> Love this cupping set. It&#x27;s high quality plastic and comes in a very nice case. I have used to quite a lot and I am very please with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good set but it is not as good as the glass cups that they use in a doctors office.  It is a decent set for at home use.  Unfortunately, it does not work as well as the glass cups.</li>
            <li> I have seen several bad reveiws about this showing it being cheap. I  almost did not purchase this item because of the bad reviews. I purchased and recieved this item and am really impressed. Yes, the item came well packed, nothing broken and just as advertised. Yes they cups are plastic, but high quality. If you put too much pressure on them, i am sure they could break. Handle with care and use wisely. I have used twice and am thoughouly impressed. It works well, the tube works, the magnetic points work, the cupping works. It states you do not need oils becuase it is not designed for moving, but actually it works well also. It is a great kit to start with and practice. I am sure I will probabaly get a glass set eventually, but these work great today. Had set for 4 days now with absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> the cups work fine without the extension, able to get good suction.  I was hoping to be able to treat myself on my upper back and shoulders.  The extension doesn&#x27;t work very well and I could not get good results.</li>
            <li> Greatest of cups, works very well. I believe I paid a little over $50 for this set and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. Have done a lot of cupping successfully.</li>
            <li> Was told by my Acupuncturist to bough this cupping set.  It is perfect and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to use as an extra but I love it more then my other kit!</li>
            <li> So, this is a great pump cup set, HOWEVER it says in the description that these can be boiled to sterilize (which is why I bought them), but when they arrived, it is clearly stated in the instructions that they cannot be boiled.  This was disappointing, but I still like the cups and have bought a second set to use for my family.</li>
            <li> Waited a long time to find the best quality and great price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this set. Easy to use, clean and works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it for cupping and cupping massage.  It is low  in cost, has great suctioning and is easy to use.  My client&#x27;s love the  after effects.  It is also light and easy to carry.  I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> To preface this review, I would like to say that I am a fire cupping snob. At least I was. If I can get another set at the same price, I will be ordering a second set.  This cupping set was perfect out of the box. Suction- MORE than adequate. In fact, the &#x27;hickies&#x27; on my back give proof that you really do not need more than 4 or 5 pumps.   Ironically, the set arrived just a couple of hours after I put a crick in my neck. Ten minutes later, full range of motion with only a slight tightness remaining. The Acupressure points work WONDERS.   I really just can&#x27;t fully express how happy I am with this set!</li>
            <li> Very much like that the cupping set comes in a nice travel kit, and the cups works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> The tube repeatedly falls off the cups and the suction is not near as strong as the silicone cups. Disappointed. I bought 2 sets of silicone and they work great!!!!</li>
            <li> great quality, love them.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the little red things are for and no instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li> Extension pump Broke first day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing cupping for a few months and this cupping set is awesome. Highly recommend it. It&#x27;s not only effective but great quality</li>
            <li> Works great .. affordable price too.</li>
            <li> We like it.  Thanks  Galina</li>
            <li> Work really well to release muscle sore/ache. Just need pump 2 times and give for 15 min and all your trouble went away. You will definite need 2nd person to put the cup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very physically active, climbing hills, yoga, XMA, basketball, etc. Can&#x27;t afford  massages, especially athletic deep tissue.  I&#x27;ve had surgery on my knee 2x&#x27;s, so it swells occasionally from being so active.  I bought this, &amp; after 1st 15min session, swelling went away.  My aches/pains after each session go away as if I had a deep tissue massage, so I can keep on being physical.  It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive.  A friend of mine&#x27;s eyes are always red, after he \\&quot;cups\\&quot; (lol), his eyes clear up tremendously.  Great investment for me!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is great quality. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and wanted to &#x27;dabble&#x27; in cupping. This is a quality set and I&#x27;m finding more and more uses for it and customers are requesting cupping. Great for breaking up adhesions associated with old injuries and many other things.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough how much i love these cups!</li>
            <li> Everything in the set works well and my practitioner found it most satisfactory. The carrying case is very convenient. The pump worked well. The cups are easy to clean; for those using the wet cupping method this is important. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> works well, but would prefer some of the cups to have a curved edge to secure the cup in the hard to reach areas of the body (small, curvy spots like the elbow, etc.)</li>
            <li> within the first month my only #2 cup cracked in multiple places and a few weeks later one of my # 1 cups cracked in a few places.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t used them a lot so i still have enough to do a job. I wished they would offer more #2, #3, #4 and #5&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;the suction plunger works well and the extension hose still works and hasn&#x27;t cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would say it&#x27;s an ok set. Dist. K.S. Choi won&#x27;t replace cracked cups.</li>
            <li> Great set of cups, really good quality.</li>
            <li> Good deal and it works</li>
            <li> This cupping set works great. I am a massage therapist and as part of my education I learned how to use them. They are different from glass cups but I think these are easier to use without the hassle of using fire to take out the air. The clients I use cupping on love it and the change they have felt and I have seen is amazing. As for using them on myself I use them on my legs and sometimes the back. But if your looking for something to massage yourself with and get the full affect of a cupping treatment I would go to a therapist that knows how to use them. You just cant get the full affect if your trying to do it yourself, especially your back. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting these if you have no clue on how to use them. I would try the silicone cups first because they are easier to use especially if your just doing work on yourself.</li>
            <li> for deep tissue work.  I bought it as a gift and it seems to be just what my massuese wanted.  I see her using it on facebook and I am glad she likes it.</li>
            <li> Good value.  Nothing to complain about so far after a few trial uses.  Obviously tricky matching the cup size to the location so that you get a good seal.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It has different size of cups and is really easy to use. The price is good too. I think it is a worthy buying.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered this.  My only wish is that it came with more detailed instructions or tips on how to use the cups more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy. It comes in a very nice case. WOuld is nice about it is that you can boil it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, just wish the link is longer. I have a some issues when placing the cups by myself...</li>
            <li> Not as good as the glass cups that the professional masseuses use, but the plastic is heavy enough and the variety is nice. I would not hesitate to buy, especially at this great price!</li>
            <li> I use this product in my acupuncture practice. I like cupping and my clients find it to be a most acceptable and helpful modality for relief of muscular pain. I use it a lot for a back treatment</li>
            <li> I purchased this product just over 30 days ago. It now does not hold suction on several of the cups. I contacted the seller via amazon, and their solution is to replace sub par product with more sub par product. How can anyone think that this is a logical solution?  Anyway, stay away from this product and company.</li>
            <li> Our massage therapists love this set.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great set works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Small instruction manual would have been nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best kit I have tried. The cups can fall 6\\&quot; onto tile flooring and dont break, and can handle boiling for cleaning. The pump is high quality and develops a lot of vacuum. I have, and would again recommend this kit. NOT some knockoff junk. Has been tremendous in healing chronic pain that was years old. Five stars. Oh yeah, ot has an awesome case too.</li>
            <li> Very effective modality and durable. No issues</li>
            <li> I used this for my wife back pain and it is work. Price is good too. Even it has a tube (assessories) but still hard to use myself to my back.</li>
            <li> This set is great: quality and price.  Exactly like the more expensive sets I&#x27;ve used.  I haven&#x27;t used the pressure pointers at all- so no comment on those.  The cups seal very wel l and the suction has been more than adequate.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Prompt shipment. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The cupping set is awesome and the only draw back is the proper training to use them. I have used them on my hip and thigh area and around the shoulder. Really relieves the knots quickly.</li>
            <li> The cups are wonderful. After using them for a while, I have noticed that I am able to pin point my pain and cup just what is needed. I can literally find the toxic areas by myself. The extension tube allows me to be able to cup anywhere on my body, which is great. My only thing with them, is that if I pump too many pumps, I can not let out just a little bit of air. I have to release the cup and start all over. But this is not really a big deal in the long run. I recommend these cups. As a massage therapist, I can work on someone&#x27;s entire back at the same time OR just do pin pointing therapy. Also, the pressure points are awesome to use as well! To be able to offer this modality to clients is just another unique gift you can add to your list of services! I love them. They are one of my favorite purchases this year.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  lots of cups.  Great case for storage.  i would have liked 4 or so larger cups though.</li>
            <li> enviaron a tiempo el pedido y el producto es de muy buena calidad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ellos tienen todas las estrellas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best regards</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want o pay a lot of money for a cupping set. These were bought for my own personal use. They are pretty easy to use with the pump, and I can put the cups on my lower back by myself, however it&#x27;s harder to do the shoulders without help. I have been pleased with them so far. The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and I can honestly say they are excellent quality. I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li> THE PLASTIC CUPS WERE MANUFACTURED UPTO STANDARD , NICELY PACKED AND CONTAINED IN A NICE SUITE CASE LIKE A LAP TOP. IT IS PERFECT.  NASSER</li>
            <li> Very good product and delivery .</li>
            <li> I bought this set on Amazon a few years ago. It has been a wonderful thing to have for self treatment and treatment on friends. An amazing deal I have to say. One has to be careful not to over pump, the suction can be too strong. I check in often when using it on someone else. I slide the cup along muscles with a thin film of oil applied to the skin first. I also gently pull up on the cup while it is attached for more tissue stretching. This feel good and I think aids circulation. I also use it on scar tissue to break up the scar. It is handy to have a personal set.</li>
            <li> Very good product and it is easy to use. For those who don&#x27;t have the strength to do deep tissue massage, this is perfect. Recommended to a friend.</li>
            <li> They are great and the sucktion is really good. I use them everyother week for my husband and I and they work like a charm</li>
            <li> This is a good set for cupping. I like the set, but sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to get the cups to seal. I used a set at my Therapist&#x27;s place &amp; they worked much better, even though it was the identical set.</li>
            <li> I study Shaolin Kung Fu, and am constantly injuring myself. A fellow student, who was actually taught how to use these, has a set, and I marveled at how easy they were to use. As the cost was so low, I had to purchase my own set. The basics are easy enough that anyone can use this medical tool and enjoy great results. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. It doesn&#x27;t replace my current one made out of glass however it makes it easier if you want to do cupping on yourself. It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really am excited and can&#x27;t wait to get started using these. They were all received with great packing and speedy service . Thanks for another job well done and happy customer !</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality cupping massage set I ever have before, I used to bought some very cheap prices, but after used just a few time then it look like start to crack on the head of the cup.</li>
            <li> Works well for shoulder pain. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to work with</li>
            <li> Recognizing that I have no frame of reference to compare this to, it seems like a well made product. I especially appreciate the case that this comes in, which keeps things organized and easy to carry around.  No real instruction on exactly where to use the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34;, but there is plenty of information on the web if one has an interest. Best yet, this seems to have provided some relief to chronic neck pain. I knocked off one star because the extension hose that allows you to put cups on your back should be longer ---it can be a bit awkward , and if you are a larger person, you may be unable to reach certain areas without help.</li>
            <li> This Premium Quality Cupping set is a good investment.  It&#x27;s definitely user friendly.  My daughter who is 8 years old can even use these cups to give me cupping. I&#x27;m glad I found this set.</li>
            <li> Durable and excellent quality product. I would rate 4 as it&#x27;s missing the packaging label of what each cup size is.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works great.</li>
            <li> this product is perfect, good quality and good price!! I was afraid to buy this because the low price but now I love it!!!</li>
            <li> the set is everything my acapuncturist said it would be!!  I bought two sets and gave one to my grand daughter who is going to nursing school, and she loves it too.  question??????  could this be the  $87.36  that was charged to my American express card on  7/12/13 that I couldn&#x27;t identify?  thanks for the info.  jk</li>
            <li> This really helps my trigger spots on my body. I love the idea that more oxygen and release of toxins may help my recovery. This does hurt at the beginning, but, the pain sub signs gradually.</li>
            <li> This set works so well and is easy to use. Makes you feel better right away for those small aches and pains. Don&#x27;t leave on too long though. Those bruises take a few days to fade.</li>
            <li> My homeopathic medicine assistant used this cupping set on me when I had a cold. She said it&#x27;s easy to use and it works!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband who is a massage therapist and he loves it. It comes in a case which keeps every cup in place and well organized. He also mentioned that the cups are good for &amp;#34;sliding&amp;#34; which I guess is something to look for when buying a cupping set.</li>
            <li> As described. and guys! THE RED POINTERS they go inside the cups and attach. When you suck the cup to the skin the pointer will indent the skin. That&#x27;s what they are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to attach the hose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Not enough suction for all areas of the body.</li>
            <li> This cupping set is very easy to use! Much easier than fire cupping! I thought it was high quality and I have had no issues with the extension tube. I have used it several times and I love it! Great buy!</li>
            <li> it is good product. but i don&#x27;t use it for along time</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cups so several people can use the kit at the same time.  My daughter&#x27;s whole family had a family cupping night!&lt;br /&gt;I love the air hose so that you can put the cups on your own body in hard to reach places!  This is a world class starter kit!</li>
            <li> I was recommended these by my acupuncturist. I am an LMT and practice cupping regularly. They work finonominally!</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see this item ship so quickly. Its exactly what I wanted and more! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; Exactly as described; Very Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to release my back pain.  It seem to work well.  The suction is very strong but made from low grade plastic.  I hope the plastic will last.  The cups are made from hight quality plastic but work well.  I like it not glass because if you accidently drop it is ok.  Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find an acupuncturist in the small town I live in (or the surrounding areas) like I had in California, this set has helped keep me centered and my meridians in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> My wife has done this on my back a couple of times and it feels just great, But don&#x27;t get scared when you look at your back the next day. Your back will look like Mike Tyson worked you over once or twice, but it gos away in a day or two. My only regret is that I don&#x27;t have it done to me enough.</li>
            <li> Good for release the pain</li>
            <li> bought this after getting it done to me in Korea....it feels like the little korean lady is right in the comfort of my own home...great product.</li>
            <li> I love cupping it&#x27;s so beneficial to circulation! Easy to use just YouTube it if you don&#x27;t already know how.</li>
            <li> this what i have been looking for easy to use,nice case,glad i bought the extension for hard to reach areas would recommend highly</li>
            <li> The set works well and it was a small investment, I am a physical therapist who would like to try cupping but would not have put out a lot of money for the opportunity.  It seems to work well with some patients, its hard to set up by yourself so you&#x27;d need someone else to help apply the cups if you are using to for personal issues.  I wish there were some more detailed instructions or treatment protocols</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need it anymore. I am being treated with surgury now. I would like a refund, and return it.</li>
            <li> I love it and I believe in cupping for ailments...... better than going to the doctor.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet, but the product looks very good. Can&#x27;t wait to use them. The quality of the product is excellent.  The instruction is very clear and the picture adds great to the operation of working with the cup.  The ording time was very fast and I did not have to wait very long to start my process.  By all means purchase the kit and happy cupping.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this set of cups. It has all I need for now. The cups are sturdy and all the parts seem like they should hold up if not abused.&lt;br /&gt;I have had minor issues with the pump interface to the extension or directly to a cup being very difficult to remove. I am sure this will get better as I become more familiar with this set</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any part break yet and the product seems good. Seeing as I&#x27;m new to this form of alternative medicine, I wish they sent some information as to general placement and desired effects. Plenty of stuff online though but it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to dig for.</li>
            <li> Great product, provides excellent suctioning, easy to use. One must be knowledgeable with the equipment bc it is just a set, not a BOOK. As some are frustrated with lack of \\&quot;instructions.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;**The Red Acupressure Tips: Place under the cups, as you draw suction, it will apply pressure to the middle of the flesh that was pulled up. Also why it is important to actually know where specific points are located...otherwise, the results will just suck, no pun intended ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Great buy folks! Oh, and don&#x27;t apply excessive force to your stuff and it won&#x27;t break. Other than that, washes easy, great storage, highly recommended!!!</li>
