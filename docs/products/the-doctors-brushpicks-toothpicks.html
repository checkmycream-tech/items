            <li>Best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li>The great Ed Walter recommended these.</li>
            <li>Keeps gumline in great shape.</li>
            <li>So happy I bought a case pack of 12 as I never wanted to run out.</li>
            <li>They feel great (like a gum massage) and help remove pieces of food with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Great when you&#x27;re in the office or on the road and can&#x27;t be bothered with flossing.</li>
            <li>I still floss at night, but these are great for after meals.  </li>
            <li>Great invention</li>
            <li>This is great when you can&#x27;t stop everything &amp; brush NOW.</li>
            <li>Great value for the toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Both worked great</li>
            <li>They are a great alternative/accompaniment to dental floss.</li>
            <li>They do a great job.  </li>
            <li>These must be doing something since my dentist thinks I do a great job flossing.</li>
            <li>But I am just happy to have them and can share them with someone else who has also had difficulties finding them in stores.</li>
            <li>Great job.</li>
            <li>Great value to share with a friend.</li>
            <li>My twice yearly dental checkups are great.  </li>
            <li>Now they are in packs of 275 but they are still the great quality they were over 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Great packing.  </li>
            <li>They are great for removing food from your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>brush end of the pick is great for getting out food between the teeth and the indentations on the pick</li>
            <li>and I can tell after I used the 4 I tried, that I&#x27;ll get much more \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; out of these picks than any floss!!  </li>
            <li>Still love them!!</li>
            <li>These things are amazing!  </li>
            <li>Using these is kind of addicting!</li>
            <li>These are the best of all brushpicks as I have tried many brands.</li>
            <li>Awesome and hold up so much better than what you see in the store.  </li>
            <li>These are the best toothpicks; and have bought these more than once from Amazon.</li>
            <li>At CVS, the Doctors bush picks were the best value at 250 for $3.89 and were on par with DenTek Slim Brush (32 for $5.99) with getting in between the most teeth.  </li>
            <li>Really good product - my dentist is happy</li>
            <li>The Worlds Best Tooth Pick, Love them, could not find them it town</li>
            <li>It is amazing great.</li>
            <li>Good product, the best toothpicks available, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where all of the good reviews came from.  </li>
            <li>Get good dental reports.</li>
            <li>Use of the brush end of the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks\\&quot; seems to have a good result on dental health.</li>
            <li>Good report from my dentist when I have my oral exam</li>
            <li>Good price compare to retail store price</li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>help you get a good grip on it.  </li>
            <li>and he said that explained that was probably one of the reasons why my teeth were in as good of a condition as they were.</li>
            <li>These are the best picks in the world to keep your teeth clean</li>
            <li>I have used this product and am impressed with its capacity to clean in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product twice and have been VERY pleased with their service.</li>
            <li>Great help to promote healthy gums...</li>
            <li>Sadly, many shops seem to have stopped stocking these (BrushPicks), so it was great to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks have added greatly to my arsenal of being better at taking care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now my gums never bleed and my dentist says they look healthy as ever!</li>
            <li>Try them--- you will love them!</li>
            <li>I bought these expecting them to be better than flossing, instead they cut my gums!  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, the best toothpicks I have found and used---and I have used a large variety.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find them on the internet and have since ordered a dozen of them twice.  </li>
            <li>So, I give them a package of their own.</li>
            <li>He has a pack in every vehicle we own and probably every room in our house.</li>
            <li>but i have to say that Amazon kindly rectified this for me.</li>
            <li>My husband now has his own container.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is thrilled when they receive.</li>
            <li>We still floss, but these are great to get things out from between teeth cleanly and to &amp;</li>
            <li>I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN SAVING US HUGE DENTAL PROBLEMS AND ENSUING BILLS.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly which is great.  </li>
            <li>As an adult who wears braces, this product is AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>Hope you, enjoy feeling &#x27;picked on,&#x27; in a GOOD way.</li>
            <li>These are the most effective toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Made of very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>If caught in a pinch, I&#x27;m sure it can probably be used as a \\&quot;tiny\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>OK, so I love beef jerky.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, love the brush picks, wish I was using one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better then floss</li>
            <li>Better than floss</li>
            <li>most don&#x27;t work:</li>
            <li>In the two years that I have been using Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks, my gums are healthy and not one cavity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using stim-u-dents for many years.</li>
            <li>To me these seem so much better.</li>
            <li>Great value, I bought a whole case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li>I hope that lasts awhile.  :-)</li>
            <li>I love these picks.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and since then my dental check ups have been much better and continue to get better.  </li>
            <li>and she says my gums are in much better condition now.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I have them with me always.</li>
            <li>I like to buy them in bulk because as I offer friends a brushpick after dinner, they love them and want to know where to buy them.</li>
            <li>Everyone we give them to love them too.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried lots of different detal devices, these are the best.</li>
            <li>favorite of my husband and myself.  </li>
            <li>I had no cavaties but my gums could be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I will use the Doctors most of the time and based on construction of the DenTek</li>
            <li>I love them and the way they get everything out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Strangely, many dentists know nothing about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can use these for a quicker and easier cleaning in the car before a meeting just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>Great toothpick I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Now she has a box in each \\&quot;popular\\&quot; location in the house, and many more boxes in reserve.  </li>
            <li>It easy to use and clean good your mouth.</li>
            <li>Cheap and reliable way of getting it!</li>
            <li>I love them and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Do a better job than dental floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen them on the Continent, so now we make sure to take plenty along when we travel.  </li>
            <li>I have just run out of them and ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love these toothpicks.</li>
            <li>They work better than flossing.</li>
            <li>Tighter teeth can mostly be better dealt with.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered the largest supply of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpick instead of floss for many years now and have not had any cavities.  </li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>I have been using these for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I received it right on schedule and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased I can continue using this superior product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of \\&quot;between tooth cleaner\\&quot; and this rises straight to the top!  </li>
            <li>It help us to clean our teeth easily anytime after we ate, make us feel good and clean.</li>
            <li>, I think the Listerine is important to make sure you are not transferring bacteria as you in and out between all of your teeth.</li>
            <li>and I think, for me both are way more comfortable than using Glide dental floss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these picks for years and they really get in between the teeth for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having tight teeth,,,the Doctors Brush Picks and DenTek Slim Brush worked best for me and got between the most teeth.  </li>
            <li>These Brushpicks have a pick on one end and a brush on the other which make them really awesome.  </li>
            <li>end easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>arriced very very quickly after placing my order.  </li>
            <li>It can get easily between the teeth, often from either side... front or back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to get under a crown.</li>
            <li>Flexible and strong</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Those will go to my son who has space between his teeth and will work just fine in his case.  </li>
            <li>If you are caught with no toothbrush, no problem, just use this product and dental floss and you will be fine.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite item to carry for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li>If they did, they&#x27;d be absolutely perfect for my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>Really impressed by the little brush they have on the end.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference in my gums with it</li>
            <li>One of those GREAT simple solutions to one of life&#x27;s age-old problems.</li>
            <li>These are great for cleaning between your teeth (not in public please).</li>
            <li>They are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for having this product available for purchase.</li>
            <li>These picks are so simple, so great.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I now buy them by the \\&quot;case\\&quot; instead of at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The dentist told me I have fabulous dental health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior than anything else out there.</li>
            <li>Love these picks and love the quantity, thanks</li>
            <li>The brush on one end quickly removes stuck food from between teeth and they are then easily disposable.</li>
            <li>just brushing my teeth and using brushpicks the checkups are all 2&#x27;s for the gum measurement which is excellent, no more 3 and 4 pockets.</li>
            <li>So the 2 that I won&#x27;t buy again (because they are just to large to fit between more of my teeth teeth) would be the CVS and GUM picks.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using them, my dental visits are far more pleasurable; cleanings are quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>My teeth are always clean.  </li>
            <li>I always seem to cut the corners of my mouth when I use dental floss to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>Well, even \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; get a bit of food between their teeth from time to time and there is nothing faster, gentler and more satisfying than a Doctor&#x27;s BrushPick.</li>
            <li>They quit carrying these at WallyWorld and the ones we could find locally were just not as good.</li>
            <li>so, so much easier and more convenient.  </li>
            <li>Still they are very effective for removing the last little bits and are a great idea to use even before brushing.  </li>
            <li>they clean much, much better than normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t replace floss, but are a great supplement to get to the more open areas between teeth that regular toothpicks aren&#x27;t fine enough to handle, and floss can loosen debris, but not remove as effectively.  </li>
            <li>Very good toothpicks for cleaning.in small gap between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time!</li>
            <li>The bristles are thin and the perfect composition.</li>
            <li>love the toothpicks, the shape is not perfectly round on one end</li>
            <li>I rarely endorse a product, but this one deserves every accolade it gets.  </li>
            <li>These picks are superb because the &#x27;brush&#x27; end is thin.</li>
            <li>My dental checkups went far better once I picked these up as a habit, and I haven&#x27;t flossed with a string in over 5 years.</li>
            <li>better than any wood pick and better than any of the other plastic picks that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are better than floss and better than any other brand of brush picks.</li>
            <li>(being bendable where you need it), I will try and extend them for more than one use, by swishing them in mouthwash to get them as sterile as possible after rinsing them clean.  </li>
            <li>We love these things I&#x27;ve been using them several times a day for years to get the space below my bridge work clean before brushing.</li>
            <li>A pick is a pick is a pick, right?</li>
            <li>Price is right, and they were shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who wants to ensure they clean well between the teeth.</li>
            <li>When Wal-Mart stopped carrying the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and substituted what my wife and I felt was an inferior brand, we went to the net and ordered a long time supply of the good ones!  </li>
            <li>certainly learned my lesson about buying a case of something I&#x27;ve never tried before!</li>
            <li>I know I probably shouldn&#x27;t do that, but unless I find the DenTek in a larger/more economical quantity amount, the Doctors brand wins on economy and the DenTek wins when it comes to being able to reach and clean between the back molars as well as most of my other teeth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, cleans completely in one stroke.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find them on Amazon and to pay, even with shipping, less than we paid per pack at the store.  </li>
            <li>Product is as described and delivery is VERY fast.</li>
            <li>I used to have some bleeding between a couple of my teeth when I first used these brushpicks, but no bleeding when I flossed.  </li>
            <li>First time users will probably bleed</li>
            <li>Now I have enough for a year or more.</li>
            <li>We love these and use them daily.</li>
            <li>The 250 count pack is a saving over the smaller packs sold in many drugstores.</li>
            <li>Love them, use them several times per day.</li>
            <li>Much better than the wooden or bamboo toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the dental floss!</li>
            <li>Consistently reliable</li>
            <li>I have ordered these same BrushPicks many times in the past and have always been very satisfied with their quality and with the quick response from the supplier.</li>
            <li>I like how they are soft, gentle, and slip easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li>He won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add a positive items here.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not a complete substitute for floss, but they come mighty close!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to carry around, well maybe not this large size, but you can use these to refill their smaller sized container.</li>
            <li>It just fit and brush out the food debris, much better than floss and other bulky interdental brushes that most of the time do not fit in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Certainly a life saver while one is out after a meal or</li>
            <li>Now I order a large quantity</li>
            <li>But ... when you need one, you REALLY want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very discreet and work</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much they catch after I&#x27;m done using the straight side of the pick.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gentle and they do the job.  </li>
            <li>If you couldn&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks!</li>
            <li>There is a end that looks like a fish barb, which doesn&#x27;t remove much food, but cuts.  </li>
            <li>I also give them to friends who like them as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Really like these.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves these</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend these pics, from this seller!  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>These have really helped my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle on your gums.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend them to everyone, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have used many other types of floss and flossers.</li>
            <li>I ended up with more than I anticipated, due to a mix-up with ordering.</li>
            <li>My dentist has commented repeatedly on the improved health of my gums due to better \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; habits.  </li>
            <li>They help clean your teeth, but nothing that a regular toothpick can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>I discovered brushpicks a number of years ago and now can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>I went for a more expensive ones, but they feel much much better.</li>
            <li>it has been more and more difficult to find these plastic toothpicks for my wife in stores.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried and have found out the simple effectiveness of this small inexpensive fantastic instrument.[[ASIN:B001ET6ZWI</li>
            <li>My gums are tight and healthy, and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I cannot COUNT how many people I have turned on to these little wonders.</li>
            <li>All were shocked at first by the gift, but within a day or two I would get a call, or a tap on the back, or even a hug because these little picks make most folks very, very happy!</li>
            <li>I am very happy getting compliments from my dentist, the secret is these little Doctors Brushpicks.</li>
            <li>But each time I use a new pick</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without brushpicks now .</li>
            <li>At one point in my young life I thought it was very cool to walk down the street, wood tooth pick dangling from one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are really tight and the brush tips seem to break off too easily.</li>
            <li>Looked it up on Amazon and found exactly what I wanted and what I have been using for several years.  </li>
            <li>like the brushpicks because one end is a toothpick and the other a tiny brush that gets in between teeth better than a pick.  </li>
            <li>Would go ahead and get this pack of 12 rather than the smaller ones, even though you may want to try them out first.</li>
            <li>Recent studies have shown brushing just twice a day, and not after ever meal, is optimal, but you need to floss after each meal and preferably snack, pretty much any time you chew solid food.  </li>
            <li>They provide a nice massaging action.....but be a little careful not to overuse.</li>
            <li>The brush picks works great getting meat, fish or chicken out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any sold just as refills, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer Prime shipping on the soft picks, so I decided to try these brushpicks instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to using the soft picks, I wouldn&#x27;t dislike these so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I found out that Amazon carried them.</li>
            <li>I was told about the GUM Soft Picks.  </li>
            <li>and I found them to be too soft and would bend over.  </li>
            <li>Then I went to the old backup, Amazon, and there they were.  </li>
            <li>we prefer them to the &#x27;soft picks&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>They are small enough to get under the gums and between the teeth, and are far more useful than traditional wooden picks.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m using one right now, not unusual because I go through these like candy.</li>
            <li>They easily remove anything and everything -- no space too small.</li>
            <li>The CVS&#x27; brand Interdental Brush &amp; Toothpick (120 picks for $1.99 in the travel section, aqua in color) as they were a better value than the CVS brand competition to the other name brand picks where I found the other 3 items, go figure.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was strange, but I guess I just got much deeper between the teeth when I used brushpicks.  </li>
            <li>Those complaining about bleeding, that would seem to be expected at first.</li>
            <li>The soft pick has tiny, soft bristles all the way around, so you just slide it in and out.</li>
            <li>Then my mother explained to me that seven year old \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; should never do such a thing.</li>
            <li>These are really well designed for my personal needs, and I will continue to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li>snack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use no other method these days as they have me spoiled.</li>
            <li>Avoid gum disease with these - I&#x27;m 69 and have never had a gum problem - I believe these are a major reason.</li>
            <li>The toothpicks bend to fit between hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>I tried them  CVS&#x27; out, and found them about the same diameter as the GUM Soft Picks.  </li>
            <li>I only  wish the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that the US customs and the Royal Mail make extra postage charges other than what you pay on the site</li>
            <li>, the other end has a small \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with delicate tines that can reach under the gum flaps, much like floss, but more gently.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is my guilt over using a disposable plastic toothpick, but the wooden ones can&#x27;t come close to doing the job on these old gums.  </li>
            <li>This 12 pack should last a few years, well worth the investment for your teeth.</li>
            <li>these picks are one of those small conveniences that make life a little better.  </li>
            <li>I will say both picks bend and break quickly; I have to use at least two picks</li>
            <li>Unlike flossing, which can be messy and requires a certain amount of privacy, using a brushpick is something you can do while you&#x27;re working or driving.  </li>
            <li>There is a little brush on one end that gently massages your gums.</li>

            <li> So happy I bought a case pack of 12 as I never wanted to run out.</li>
            <li> They feel great (like a gum massage) and help remove pieces of food with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Great when you&#x27;re in the office or on the road and can&#x27;t be bothered with flossing.</li>

            <li> But I am just happy to have them and can share them with someone else who has also had difficulties finding them in stores.</li>
            <li> Great job.</li>
            <li> Great value to share with a friend.</li>
            <li> My twice yearly dental checkups are great.  </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> brush end of the pick is great for getting out food between the teeth and the indentations on the pick</li>
            <li> and I can tell after I used the 4 I tried, that I&#x27;ll get much more \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; out of these picks than any floss!!  </li>
            <li> Still love them!!</li>

            <li> These are the best toothpicks; and have bought these more than once from Amazon.</li>
            <li> At CVS, the Doctors bush picks were the best value at 250 for $3.89 and were on par with DenTek Slim Brush (32 for $5.99) with getting in between the most teeth.  </li>
            <li> Really good product - my dentist is happy</li>
            <li> The Worlds Best Tooth Pick, Love them, could not find them it town</li>

            <li> Get good dental reports.</li>
            <li> Use of the brush end of the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks\\&quot; seems to have a good result on dental health.</li>
            <li> Good report from my dentist when I have my oral exam</li>
            <li> Good price compare to retail store price</li>

            <li> help you get a good grip on it.  </li>

            <li> These are the best picks in the world to keep your teeth clean</li>
            <li> I have used this product and am impressed with its capacity to clean in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice and have been VERY pleased with their service.</li>
            <li> Great help to promote healthy gums...</li>
            <li> Sadly, many shops seem to have stopped stocking these (BrushPicks), so it was great to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks have added greatly to my arsenal of being better at taking care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now my gums never bleed and my dentist says they look healthy as ever!</li>
            <li> Try them--- you will love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting them to be better than flossing, instead they cut my gums!  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the best toothpicks I have found and used---and I have used a large variety.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find them on the internet and have since ordered a dozen of them twice.  </li>
            <li> So, I give them a package of their own.</li>
            <li> He has a pack in every vehicle we own and probably every room in our house.</li>
            <li> but i have to say that Amazon kindly rectified this for me.</li>
            <li> My husband now has his own container.  </li>
            <li> Everyone is thrilled when they receive.</li>
            <li> We still floss, but these are great to get things out from between teeth cleanly and to &amp;</li>
            <li> I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN SAVING US HUGE DENTAL PROBLEMS AND ENSUING BILLS.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly which is great.  </li>
            <li> As an adult who wears braces, this product is AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Hope you, enjoy feeling &#x27;picked on,&#x27; in a GOOD way.</li>
            <li> These are the most effective toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Made of very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> If caught in a pinch, I&#x27;m sure it can probably be used as a \\&quot;tiny\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OK, so I love beef jerky.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, love the brush picks, wish I was using one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better then floss</li>
            <li> Better than floss</li>
            <li> most don&#x27;t work:</li>
            <li> In the two years that I have been using Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks, my gums are healthy and not one cavity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using stim-u-dents for many years.</li>
            <li> To me these seem so much better.</li>
            <li> Great value, I bought a whole case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> I hope that lasts awhile.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love these picks.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and since then my dental check ups have been much better and continue to get better.  </li>
            <li> and she says my gums are in much better condition now.  </li>
            <li> I make sure I have them with me always.</li>
            <li> I like to buy them in bulk because as I offer friends a brushpick after dinner, they love them and want to know where to buy them.</li>
            <li> Everyone we give them to love them too.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried lots of different detal devices, these are the best.</li>
            <li> favorite of my husband and myself.  </li>
            <li> I had no cavaties but my gums could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I will use the Doctors most of the time and based on construction of the DenTek</li>
            <li> I love them and the way they get everything out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Strangely, many dentists know nothing about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use these for a quicker and easier cleaning in the car before a meeting just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> Great toothpick I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Now she has a box in each \\&quot;popular\\&quot; location in the house, and many more boxes in reserve.  </li>
            <li> It easy to use and clean good your mouth.</li>
            <li> Cheap and reliable way of getting it!</li>
            <li> I love them and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Do a better job than dental floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen them on the Continent, so now we make sure to take plenty along when we travel.  </li>
            <li> I have just run out of them and ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love these toothpicks.</li>
            <li> They work better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Tighter teeth can mostly be better dealt with.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered the largest supply of them.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of \\&quot;between tooth cleaner\\&quot; and this rises straight to the top!  </li>
            <li> It help us to clean our teeth easily anytime after we ate, make us feel good and clean.</li>
            <li> , I think the Listerine is important to make sure you are not transferring bacteria as you in and out between all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> and I think, for me both are way more comfortable than using Glide dental floss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these picks for years and they really get in between the teeth for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having tight teeth,,,the Doctors Brush Picks and DenTek Slim Brush worked best for me and got between the most teeth.  </li>

            <li> Cheap, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Those will go to my son who has space between his teeth and will work just fine in his case.  </li>
            <li> If you are caught with no toothbrush, no problem, just use this product and dental floss and you will be fine.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite item to carry for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li> If they did, they&#x27;d be absolutely perfect for my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> Really impressed by the little brush they have on the end.</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference in my gums with it</li>
            <li> One of those GREAT simple solutions to one of life&#x27;s age-old problems.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning between your teeth (not in public please).</li>
            <li> They are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for having this product available for purchase.</li>
            <li> These picks are so simple, so great.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I now buy them by the \\&quot;case\\&quot; instead of at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The dentist told me I have fabulous dental health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior than anything else out there.</li>
            <li> Love these picks and love the quantity, thanks</li>
            <li> The brush on one end quickly removes stuck food from between teeth and they are then easily disposable.</li>
            <li> just brushing my teeth and using brushpicks the checkups are all 2&#x27;s for the gum measurement which is excellent, no more 3 and 4 pockets.</li>
            <li> So the 2 that I won&#x27;t buy again (because they are just to large to fit between more of my teeth teeth) would be the CVS and GUM picks.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using them, my dental visits are far more pleasurable; cleanings are quick and easy!  </li>
            <li> My teeth are always clean.  </li>
            <li> I always seem to cut the corners of my mouth when I use dental floss to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> Well, even \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; get a bit of food between their teeth from time to time and there is nothing faster, gentler and more satisfying than a Doctor&#x27;s BrushPick.</li>
            <li> They quit carrying these at WallyWorld and the ones we could find locally were just not as good.</li>
            <li> so, so much easier and more convenient.  </li>
            <li> Still they are very effective for removing the last little bits and are a great idea to use even before brushing.  </li>
            <li> they clean much, much better than normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t replace floss, but are a great supplement to get to the more open areas between teeth that regular toothpicks aren&#x27;t fine enough to handle, and floss can loosen debris, but not remove as effectively.  </li>
            <li> Very good toothpicks for cleaning.in small gap between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time!</li>
            <li> The bristles are thin and the perfect composition.</li>
            <li> love the toothpicks, the shape is not perfectly round on one end</li>
            <li> I rarely endorse a product, but this one deserves every accolade it gets.  </li>
            <li> These picks are superb because the &#x27;brush&#x27; end is thin.</li>
            <li> My dental checkups went far better once I picked these up as a habit, and I haven&#x27;t flossed with a string in over 5 years.</li>
            <li> better than any wood pick and better than any of the other plastic picks that I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are better than floss and better than any other brand of brush picks.</li>
            <li> (being bendable where you need it), I will try and extend them for more than one use, by swishing them in mouthwash to get them as sterile as possible after rinsing them clean.  </li>
            <li> We love these things I&#x27;ve been using them several times a day for years to get the space below my bridge work clean before brushing.</li>
            <li> A pick is a pick is a pick, right?</li>
            <li> Price is right, and they were shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who wants to ensure they clean well between the teeth.</li>
            <li> When Wal-Mart stopped carrying the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and substituted what my wife and I felt was an inferior brand, we went to the net and ordered a long time supply of the good ones!  </li>
            <li> certainly learned my lesson about buying a case of something I&#x27;ve never tried before!</li>
            <li> I know I probably shouldn&#x27;t do that, but unless I find the DenTek in a larger/more economical quantity amount, the Doctors brand wins on economy and the DenTek wins when it comes to being able to reach and clean between the back molars as well as most of my other teeth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, cleans completely in one stroke.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find them on Amazon and to pay, even with shipping, less than we paid per pack at the store.  </li>
            <li> Product is as described and delivery is VERY fast.</li>
            <li> I used to have some bleeding between a couple of my teeth when I first used these brushpicks, but no bleeding when I flossed.  </li>
            <li> First time users will probably bleed</li>
            <li> Now I have enough for a year or more.</li>
            <li> We love these and use them daily.</li>
            <li> The 250 count pack is a saving over the smaller packs sold in many drugstores.</li>
            <li> Love them, use them several times per day.</li>
            <li> Much better than the wooden or bamboo toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the dental floss!</li>
            <li> Consistently reliable</li>
            <li> I have ordered these same BrushPicks many times in the past and have always been very satisfied with their quality and with the quick response from the supplier.</li>
            <li> I like how they are soft, gentle, and slip easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add a positive items here.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not a complete substitute for floss, but they come mighty close!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to carry around, well maybe not this large size, but you can use these to refill their smaller sized container.</li>
            <li> It just fit and brush out the food debris, much better than floss and other bulky interdental brushes that most of the time do not fit in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Certainly a life saver while one is out after a meal or</li>
            <li> Now I order a large quantity</li>
            <li> But ... when you need one, you REALLY want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very discreet and work</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much they catch after I&#x27;m done using the straight side of the pick.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gentle and they do the job.  </li>
            <li> If you couldn&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks!</li>
            <li> There is a end that looks like a fish barb, which doesn&#x27;t remove much food, but cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also give them to friends who like them as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> Really like these.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves these</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend these pics, from this seller!  </li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> These have really helped my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle on your gums.  </li>
            <li> i would recommend them to everyone, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used many other types of floss and flossers.</li>
            <li> I ended up with more than I anticipated, due to a mix-up with ordering.</li>
            <li> My dentist has commented repeatedly on the improved health of my gums due to better \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; habits.  </li>
            <li> They help clean your teeth, but nothing that a regular toothpick can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I discovered brushpicks a number of years ago and now can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> I went for a more expensive ones, but they feel much much better.</li>
            <li> it has been more and more difficult to find these plastic toothpicks for my wife in stores.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried and have found out the simple effectiveness of this small inexpensive fantastic instrument.[[ASIN:B001ET6ZWI</li>
            <li> My gums are tight and healthy, and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I cannot COUNT how many people I have turned on to these little wonders.</li>
            <li> All were shocked at first by the gift, but within a day or two I would get a call, or a tap on the back, or even a hug because these little picks make most folks very, very happy!</li>
            <li> I am very happy getting compliments from my dentist, the secret is these little Doctors Brushpicks.</li>
            <li> But each time I use a new pick</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without brushpicks now .</li>
            <li> At one point in my young life I thought it was very cool to walk down the street, wood tooth pick dangling from one&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really tight and the brush tips seem to break off too easily.</li>
            <li> Looked it up on Amazon and found exactly what I wanted and what I have been using for several years.  </li>
            <li> like the brushpicks because one end is a toothpick and the other a tiny brush that gets in between teeth better than a pick.  </li>
            <li> Would go ahead and get this pack of 12 rather than the smaller ones, even though you may want to try them out first.</li>
            <li> Recent studies have shown brushing just twice a day, and not after ever meal, is optimal, but you need to floss after each meal and preferably snack, pretty much any time you chew solid food.  </li>
            <li> They provide a nice massaging action.....but be a little careful not to overuse.</li>
            <li> The brush picks works great getting meat, fish or chicken out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any sold just as refills, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer Prime shipping on the soft picks, so I decided to try these brushpicks instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to using the soft picks, I wouldn&#x27;t dislike these so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I found out that Amazon carried them.</li>
            <li> I was told about the GUM Soft Picks.  </li>
            <li> and I found them to be too soft and would bend over.  </li>
            <li> Then I went to the old backup, Amazon, and there they were.  </li>
            <li> we prefer them to the &#x27;soft picks&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> They are small enough to get under the gums and between the teeth, and are far more useful than traditional wooden picks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m using one right now, not unusual because I go through these like candy.</li>
            <li> They easily remove anything and everything -- no space too small.</li>
            <li> The CVS&#x27; brand Interdental Brush &amp; Toothpick (120 picks for $1.99 in the travel section, aqua in color) as they were a better value than the CVS brand competition to the other name brand picks where I found the other 3 items, go figure.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was strange, but I guess I just got much deeper between the teeth when I used brushpicks.  </li>
            <li> Those complaining about bleeding, that would seem to be expected at first.</li>
            <li> The soft pick has tiny, soft bristles all the way around, so you just slide it in and out.</li>
            <li> Then my mother explained to me that seven year old \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; should never do such a thing.</li>
            <li> These are really well designed for my personal needs, and I will continue to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li> snack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use no other method these days as they have me spoiled.</li>
            <li> Avoid gum disease with these - I&#x27;m 69 and have never had a gum problem - I believe these are a major reason.</li>
            <li> The toothpicks bend to fit between hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I tried them  CVS&#x27; out, and found them about the same diameter as the GUM Soft Picks.  </li>
            <li> I only  wish the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the US customs and the Royal Mail make extra postage charges other than what you pay on the site</li>
            <li> , the other end has a small \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with delicate tines that can reach under the gum flaps, much like floss, but more gently.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is my guilt over using a disposable plastic toothpick, but the wooden ones can&#x27;t come close to doing the job on these old gums.  </li>
            <li> This 12 pack should last a few years, well worth the investment for your teeth.</li>
            <li> these picks are one of those small conveniences that make life a little better.  </li>
            <li> I will say both picks bend and break quickly; I have to use at least two picks</li>
            <li> Unlike flossing, which can be messy and requires a certain amount of privacy, using a brushpick is something you can do while you&#x27;re working or driving.  </li>
            <li> There is a little brush on one end that gently massages your gums.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they have been hard to find, so when I discovered Amazon sold them in bulk we were right there.</li>
            <li> The brushpick is twice as long as the soft pick, so it&#x27;s harder to get it in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Years of daily use after regular flossing has resulted in a long series of semi-annual Dentist cleanings with no return visits for further work.</li>
            <li> Unlike wooden picks, they are much sharper and slightly curved and can access the tight spaces between most teeth at least half way, sometimes the entire width of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The DenTek has a green, small, solid plastic cylinder you hold at one end and a super slim metal filament with tiny brush like filaments going 360 degrees around the metal filament.  </li>
            <li> My dental technician thought I had started flossing which I have trouble doing and normally don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so my teeth are a little hard to clean as well as needed.  </li>
            <li> In case anyone would like to know, today I compared the Doctors Brush Pick (250 pkg)the GUM Soft Picks, DenTek Slim Brush for Tight Teeth and CVS&#x27;</li>
            <li> However, after buying my second pack and throwing away the second plastic case, I got online to see if I could purchase the picks  in larger quantities, without the extra cases, which are a waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> My Dentist is surprised how little plaque I am getting.</li>
            <li> little soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The age-old drugstore solution for me in the past has been the minty, balsa-like, wooden &#x27;Stimudents&#x27; as once moistened (takes a while of moistening), could be jammed (molded) between the teeth and were soft enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Have to use quite a few as the brushes are soft</li>
            <li> the dentist asked how long it had been since I saw a dentist - before he examined my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I had been pleased with my previous experience with these toothpicks or I</li>
            <li> All the other toothpicks with brushes out there are too big for between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I first learned of these little plastic toothpicks when a dental hygienist gave me a small box of them along with a tooth brush at the end of my visit.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a couple years now, after trying other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking of possibly snapping off the Doctors brand tooth pick end (the no bristle portion) and seeing if I can make them a little shorter to reach between my back molars from the tongue angle</li>
            <li> I prefer them over other similar toothpick-type products.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find around where we live, so I ordered them online.</li>
            <li> Boots, the local chain of drugstores, didn&#x27;t carry them, so we walked all over London and finally found some brushpicks in a small pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> The other end is stiff enough to get at those food paticles that lay on the flat suface of a tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> One end is a very small and thin brush that easily slips between the teeth for a floss like effect.  </li>
            <li> Myself and some co-workers went in on a box of these bad boys and couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to return them, after three tries with negotiating.</li>
            <li> I ordered a whole freakin case because my husband is so addicted to them.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about them is you can bring them to work (in an office environment) and use them after lunch, and its not obnoxious, like the dudes who go in the bathroom and floss all up in your face, and then they get crap on the mirror and don&#x27;t wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and bought every other brand out there.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brand plastic toothpicks and they don&#x27;t even compare to this one.</li>
            <li> The brushpick is also sharp on both ends, and as I try to work the bristles between my molars, I end up poking my gums.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks have a sharp end for reaching between teeth and removing food that has become stuck.  </li>
            <li> Like the brush on once end as well as the pick on the other.</li>
            <li> is the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with plastic bristles on one end and a plastic tooth pick on the other.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands when I ran out of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews</li>
            <li> Have used these daily for over 8 years and even carry them in a small container in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Whishing they are a little harder.  </li>
            <li> so they reach into difficult places where food gets trapped, and the little brush at the other end is just the right size and holds up well</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks for years but they&#x27;ve been increasingly hard to find in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I hate to floss, but I love to pick my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The blade dislodges whatever is there and files down pesky tartar.  </li>
            <li> Dental floss always just pushes food and junk down into my gums.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with any other toothpick.</li>
            <li> You have to kind of twist the brushpick while it&#x27;s between your teeth, which is awkward and slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , these are by comparison harsh, cheaply made, and painful to use.</li>
            <li> little brush fits in the smallest spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the bristles were a little tougher.</li>
            <li> These little brush picks help me remove debris that gets lodged between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> These little babies make the difference in our dentist appointments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic toothpick with little plastic &amp;#34;threads&amp;#34; sticking out of the business end.</li>
            <li> I give these out as little gifts.  </li>
            <li> surprise that this is one of the few items on Amazon that has all five star</li>
            <li> Of course in all 4, there were a few teeth that even the Doctors and DenTek couldn&#x27;t get between.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these instead of flossing for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> We both have gum problems and you can get down between the teeth with the small brush</li>
            <li> Purchased as a less expensive alternative to the gold standard [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not lucky enough to have braces as a kid</li>
            <li> I also like that they are small and come with a little case that takes up very little room in my cosmetic pouch.</li>
            <li> The GUM Brush Picks were quick to crumple when they couldn&#x27;t slide between the teeth, so that was annoying.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this product in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> No more tree-trunk toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once when we were traveling through Europe, we ran out of brushpicks and nearly went crazy.  </li>
            <li> Very harsh on gums.</li>
            <li> I have hard to get to teeth</li>
            <li> I can hardly leave the house without them.  </li>
            <li> they work in those hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> I ordered another dozen recently and gave them away as Christmas stocking suffers.  </li>
            <li> The GUM and CVS had the largest diameter and therefore got between the least amount of teeth for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Nobody likes to floss, at least nobody I know, but the BrushPicks makes the task</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the best picks in the world to keep your teeth clean</li>
            <li> My teeth are really tight and the brush tips seem to break off too easily.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price...I will not run out of these for quite some time!</li>
            <li> I think these brushpicks are great.  I used to have some bleeding between a couple of my teeth when I first used these brushpicks, but no bleeding when I flossed.  I thought this was strange, but I guess I just got much deeper between the teeth when I used brushpicks.  Then I had the idea to dip them into Listerine each time I go between my teeth.  Now, I don&#x27;t have any bleeding at all and my teeth feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the Listerine is important to make sure you are not transferring bacteria as you in and out between all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Since my husband &amp; I found these brushpicks we won&#x27;t use anything else. We both have gum problems and you can get down between the teeth with the small brush end easily. We have them in both cars and take them on trips too. Sometimes they have been hard to find, so when I discovered Amazon sold them in bulk we were right there. Thank you for making it easier to have them on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> The brush picks is an awesome tooth pick.  The brush picks works great getting meat, fish or chicken out of your teeth. The best tooth pick on the market!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> U know feeling when wood toothpick breaks and there is some left in Ur mouth? No problems with that one! Flexible and strong</li>
            <li> These Brushpicks have a pick on one end and a brush on the other which make them really awesome.  The brush end works great between teeth I could never get a regular toothpick into.  The fact that they are flexible only adds to the ease of using them. If caught in a pinch, I&#x27;m sure it can probably be used as a \\&quot;tiny\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite item to carry for a quick brush.  The brush on one end quickly removes stuck food from between teeth and they are then easily disposable.</li>
            <li> When Wal-Mart stopped carrying the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks and substituted what my wife and I felt was an inferior brand, we went to the net and ordered a long time supply of the good ones!  Don&#x27;t know how I got by without them (well, I do, but flossing while you drive is a tad awkward)- these picks are one of those small conveniences that make life a little better.  My only problem is my guilt over using a disposable plastic toothpick, but the wooden ones can&#x27;t come close to doing the job on these old gums.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I got this one just for trying out. It is amazing great. It just fit and brush out the food debris, much better than floss and other bulky interdental brushes that most of the time do not fit in between the teeth. My soniccare cannot dislodge like this between the teeth. I am glad that I tried and have found out the simple effectiveness of this small inexpensive fantastic instrument.[[ASIN:B001ET6ZWI The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks, 250 picks, Colors May Vary (Pack of 12)]]</li>
            <li> OK, so I love beef jerky.  Love it!  But the damn stuff gets caught in between my teeth.  So I started using these brush picks, and its gets all the left over jerky pieces out.  I use 3-4 of these bad boys every day.  I never used to floss, but I do now, and boy do I prefer the brush picks over the floss.  The nice thing about them is you can bring them to work (in an office environment) and use them after lunch, and its not obnoxious, like the dudes who go in the bathroom and floss all up in your face, and then they get crap on the mirror and don&#x27;t wipe it off.  Nasty man.  Anyway, love the brush picks, wish I was using one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Better then floss&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Have to use quite a few as the brushes are soft&lt;br /&gt;- First time users will probably bleed</li>
            <li> I ran out and bought every other brand out there. Nothing compares. All the other toothpicks with brushes out there are too big for between my teeth. These are the best i have ever used. After lots of searching i found these on Amazon thank goodness and bought a case. I wonder if these are being discontinued at the stores? Don&#x27;t waste your time with any other toothpick. My husband even loves and is always begging me for one, lol.</li>
            <li> My Dentist is surprised how little plaque I am getting. I have been using them for over a year and they are difficult to obtain here in Las Vegas. Simple answer  I ordered a case of them on Amazon.com. Best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> The great Ed Walter recommended these. Its a thin plastic toothpick with a brush at one end and a pick at the other.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush fits in the smallest spaces between teeth.  Keeps gumline in great shape. The blade dislodges whatever is there and files down pesky tartar.  Better than floss because BPs don&#x27;t dislodge your crowns.  Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Brushpicks ... an absolutely &#x27;brilliant&#x27; toothpick solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpicks ... mundane ... boring ... invisible ... at every restaurant cash register. They come in all sizes and shapes in the drugstore. You never think about them. But ... when you need one, you REALLY want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why most don&#x27;t work: Too fat to get between your teeth. Inflexible (you have to spend 5 minutes chomping and moistening the end in your mouth). They have a brush on the end that&#x27;s so big you could wash baby bottles with it. The list of poor design ideas goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The age-old drugstore solution for me in the past has been the minty, balsa-like, wooden &#x27;Stimudents&#x27; as once moistened (takes a while of moistening), could be jammed (molded) between the teeth and were soft enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Brushpicks. The brush is the perfect size and design. The bristles are thin and the perfect composition. Easy to use, cleans completely in one stroke. So happy I bought a case pack of 12 as I never wanted to run out. One of those GREAT simple solutions to one of life&#x27;s age-old problems.</li>
            <li> As an adult who wears braces, this product is AWESOME!! Flossing with all of those wires in my way was a pain. And do you know how embarrassing it is to end up with food in your braces after lunch at work? These picks do the trick.  They are very discreet and work very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents, this is a great way to get your kids (with or without braces) to create awesome oral hygiene habits.  Teeth don&#x27;t last forever unless you take care of them!</li>
            <li> Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks are terrific.  Since I have started using them, my dental visits are far more pleasurable; cleanings are quick and easy!  Every time that I went to the dentist, I had terrible plague build up and always at least one cavity.  In the two years that I have been using Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks, my gums are healthy and not one cavity.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using stim-u-dents for many years. I have to say I wish I heard of these back then. I do wish the bristles were a little tougher. But each time I use a new pick I just use the bristle side in a different section. I can&#x27;t believe how much they catch after I&#x27;m done using the straight side of the pick. My mouth feels so much cleaner. Dental floss always just pushes food and junk down into my gums. To me these seem so much better. Except of course floss can reach places these can&#x27;t, so you can&#x27;t eliminate floss. This 12 pack should last a few years, well worth the investment for your teeth. Those complaining about bleeding, that would seem to be expected at first.</li>
            <li> These are great for cleaning between your teeth (not in public please). They quit carrying these at WallyWorld and the ones we could find locally were just not as good.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Have tried other brand plastic toothpicks and they don&#x27;t even compare to this one. Best toothpick ever made! No more broken wood between the teeth. I will never use a wooden toothpick again. Great value, I bought a whole case.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of \\&quot;between tooth cleaner\\&quot; and this rises straight to the top!  I carry them around, keep them in every bathroom.  They&#x27;re gentle and they do the job.  They&#x27;re not a complete substitute for floss, but they come mighty close!  I still floss at night to be thorough.  If you couldn&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks!</li>
            <li> These have replaced my dental floss and my dentist can&#x27;t tell the&lt;br /&gt;difference.  My teeth are always clean.  And you only need one&lt;br /&gt;hand instead of two and they are easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li> They feel great (like a gum massage) and help remove pieces of food with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Great when you&#x27;re in the office or on the road and can&#x27;t be bothered with flossing. (please don&#x27;t pick in front of co-workers, it&#x27;s gross)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy these locally at the Pharmacy, but have not seen them in a while.  Myself and some co-workers went in on a box of these bad boys and couldn&#x27;t be happier :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my gums never bleed and my dentist says they look healthy as ever!</li>
            <li> I was not able to find this product in stores anymore.  Looked it up on Amazon and found exactly what I wanted and what I have been using for several years.  I received it right on schedule and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased I can continue using this superior product.  Generic BrushPicks do not even come close to The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks.  They are fantastic.  I keep them in my purse, car and at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love &#x27;em.  I still floss at night, but these are great for after meals.  My wife just found out about them and keeps using them all up so I ordered the case of 12 containers with 250 picks each.  I hope that lasts awhile.  :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. Very harsh on gums. Made of very cheap plastic. I went for a more expensive ones, but they feel much much better.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice and have been VERY pleased with their service. Product is as described and delivery is VERY fast. A+ seller.</li>
            <li> I love these picks. I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store any longer. Now I have enough for a year or more. Thank you for having this product available for purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently started using [[ASIN:B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks 40 pieces (Pack of 6)]], which I picked up at the drug store. I like how they are soft, gentle, and slip easily between my teeth. I also like that they are small and come with a little case that takes up very little room in my cosmetic pouch. However, after buying my second pack and throwing away the second plastic case, I got online to see if I could purchase the picks  in larger quantities, without the extra cases, which are a waste of plastic. I couldn&#x27;t find any sold just as refills, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer Prime shipping on the soft picks, so I decided to try these brushpicks instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the numerous glowing reviews, I went in for the case. A pick is a pick is a pick, right? Not at all. The brushpick is twice as long as the soft pick, so it&#x27;s harder to get it in the back of my mouth. The brushpick is also sharp on both ends, and as I try to work the bristles between my molars, I end up poking my gums. Ouch! The soft pick has tiny, soft bristles all the way around, so you just slide it in and out. The brushpick only has two rows of not-as-soft bristles. You have to kind of twist the brushpick while it&#x27;s between your teeth, which is awkward and slightly uncomfortable. I will say both picks bend and break quickly; I have to use at least two picks each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t gotten used to using the soft picks, I wouldn&#x27;t dislike these so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly learned my lesson about buying a case of something I&#x27;ve never tried before!</li>
            <li> I always seem to cut the corners of my mouth when I use dental floss to clean my teeth so when I spotted these in a local grocery store several years ago I decided to try them.  These little brush picks help me remove debris that gets lodged between my teeth.  My dental hygienist approves of my using brush picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the picks so I went to Albertson&#x27;s to buy them.  I didn&#x27;t find them at Albertson&#x27;s so I went to CVS Drug Store to get them.  CVS didn&#x27;t have them.  I went to Safeway and couldn&#x27;t find them there.  If I had found a competitor&#x27;s brand I would have bought them.  The stores had no brush picks.  Zilch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to find Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks on line at Amazon.com.  I ordered the bundle so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> These picks are so wonderful for getting bits of food out from between your teeth, massaging your gums, and removing plaque. I cannot COUNT how many people I have turned on to these little wonders. Try them--- you will love them!</li>
            <li> Amazon Verified Purchase:  I bought these expecting them to be better than flossing, instead they cut my gums!  There is a end that looks like a fish barb, which doesn&#x27;t remove much food, but cuts.  I don&#x27;t know where all of the good reviews came from.  Not only that, if you buy these, don&#x27;t expect to get your money back if you don&#x27;t like them.  Not even Amazon could make him refund all of my money, but I had to pay postage and a \\&quot;re-stocking fee.\\&quot;  I didn&#x27;t bother to return them, after three tries with negotiating.</li>
            <li> These picks are so simple, so great. I haven&#x27;t flossed in years and my dentist and hygienist both say that my gums are \\&quot;in flawless shape\\&quot; -- they were amazed when I showed them what I use 2-4 times a day. I keep a pack in my car, one in my living room, bedroom, etc. They easily remove anything and everything -- no space too small. And they stimulate the gums well. Using these is kind of addicting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these picks for years and they really get in between the teeth for a good cleaning. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am very happy getting compliments from my dentist, the secret is these little Doctors Brushpicks. Easy to use, easy to carry. These are the best of all brushpicks as I have tried many brands.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a less expensive alternative to the gold standard [[ASIN:B000SVIDGO Bulter Soft Picks 40 pieces (Pack of 6)]], these are by comparison harsh, cheaply made, and painful to use.</li>
            <li> I first learned of these little plastic toothpicks when a dental hygienist gave me a small box of them along with a tooth brush at the end of my visit. I was an instant convert. Soon I found myself roaming the tooth pick and floss section of drug stores and supermarkets searching for these elusive BrushPicks. I gave boxes to family, to friends, to office colleagues. All were shocked at first by the gift, but within a day or two I would get a call, or a tap on the back, or even a hug because these little picks make most folks very, very happy! At one point in my young life I thought it was very cool to walk down the street, wood tooth pick dangling from one&#x27;s mouth. Then my mother explained to me that seven year old \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; should never do such a thing. Well, even \\&quot;young ladies\\&quot; get a bit of food between their teeth from time to time and there is nothing faster, gentler and more satisfying than a Doctor&#x27;s BrushPick.</li>
            <li> I keep packs of these picks in my purse, in the kitchen and on my makeup table.  I also give them to friends who like them as much as I do.  I have gaps of varying sizes between teeth and like having the two different ends on these picks to poke out food.  They are somewhat flexible, don&#x27;t break off and get stuck between teeth as wooden picks sometimes do. Even after brushing and flossing these picks will sometimes poke out a missed particle.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these same BrushPicks many times in the past and have always been very satisfied with their quality and with the quick response from the supplier.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product several years ago when I was visiting a friend in Florida.  She gave me her container that she had in her purse.  The downside to this is that I could never find them in a store in Arizona.  I was thrilled to find them on the internet and have since ordered a dozen of them twice.  I let people in my office try them and ended up giving all but 2 containers away.  I ordered another dozen recently and gave them away as Christmas stocking suffers.  Of course I kept several containers for myself.  Everyone I know just loves them!  They are the only toothpick to use.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Even my dentist is impressed with these.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a couple years now, after trying other similar products.  They don&#x27;t replace floss, but are a great supplement to get to the more open areas between teeth that regular toothpicks aren&#x27;t fine enough to handle, and floss can loosen debris, but not remove as effectively.  No more tree-trunk toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a pack in my office, at home, in my car.  I initially bought the smaller packages, and now refill them from the bigger 250 pack.</li>
            <li> Really like these.  Use them after meals instead of flossing.  Get good dental reports.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks have a sharp end for reaching between teeth and removing food that has become stuck.  Unlike wooden picks, they are much sharper and slightly curved and can access the tight spaces between most teeth at least half way, sometimes the entire width of the teeth.  This allows one to get all of the food out and relieve that nasty feeling of having something embedded that exerts pressure on the gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the other end has a small \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with delicate tines that can reach under the gum flaps, much like floss, but more gently.  Still they are very effective for removing the last little bits and are a great idea to use even before brushing.  Certainly a life saver while one is out after a meal or snack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use no other method these days as they have me spoiled.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not lucky enough to have braces as a kid so my teeth are a little hard to clean as well as needed.  I started using the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks\\&quot; about two years ago.  My teeth feel cleaner and since then my dental check ups have been much better and continue to get better.  My dental technician thought I had started flossing which I have trouble doing and normally don&#x27;t and she says my gums are in much better condition now.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants to ensure they clean well between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The best dentist alternative !!</li>
            <li> You got to get this.I have hard to get to teeth I can not get to with floss.This thing get every where.With out having both hands in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Had a difficult time finding these.  Price is right, and they were shipped promptly.  Yay!</li>
            <li> We have been looking everywhere for these brush picks!!!!!!  Awesome and hold up so much better than what you see in the store.  Great help to promote healthy gums...</li>
            <li> I discovered brushpicks a number of years ago and now can&#x27;t live without them! I make sure I have them with me always. I like to buy them in bulk because as I offer friends a brushpick after dinner, they love them and want to know where to buy them. So, I give them a package of their own. The first time! Can&#x27;t be without my brushpicks!!</li>
            <li> These picks work.  One end is a very small and thin brush that easily slips between the teeth for a floss like effect.  The other end is stiff enough to get at those food paticles that lay on the flat suface of a tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than any wood pick and better than any of the other plastic picks that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;No surprise that this is one of the few items on Amazon that has all five star ratings.&lt;br /&gt;They arriced very very quickly after placing my order.  I ordered on a Saturday and got them USP on Monday.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the best toothpicks I have found and used---and I have used a large variety.  Needless to say I had been pleased with my previous experience with these toothpicks or I would not have purchased a pack of 12 boxes.</li>
            <li> We use these quite regularly. We still floss, but these are great to get things out from between teeth cleanly and to &amp;#34;pre-floss.&amp;#34; I use one every evening and often after meals.</li>
            <li> I credit BrushPicks for saving my gums.&lt;br /&gt;With just brushing my teeth and using brushpicks the checkups are all 2&#x27;s for the gum measurement which is excellent, no more 3 and 4 pockets.</li>
            <li> These toothpicks are my husband&#x27;s favorites. Everyone we give them to love them too. There is a little brush on one end that gently massages your gums. Great invention</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks for years but they&#x27;ve been increasingly hard to find in the local stores.  I was delighted to find them on Amazon and to pay, even with shipping, less than we paid per pack at the store.  We bought a case and now we&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;We like the brushpicks because one end is a toothpick and the other a tiny brush that gets in between teeth better than a pick.  We&#x27;ve tried lots of different detal devices, these are the best.</li>
            <li> I was buying the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks at Walmart until they stopped carrying them. I was surprised when I found out that Amazon carried them. I now have a several year supply. I don&#x27;t like to floss so I use the brushpick instead. I have tried several different brands but none of them compare with the Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks. An excellent product!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful! Disposable, compact a box lasts ages.  This is great when you can&#x27;t stop everything &amp; brush NOW.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves these</li>
            <li> I have used the Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks for several years. The problem was local stores quit carrying the 250 count packet. Thanks to Amazon I now have a life time supply ( and buying the twelve pack box I saved a lot of money from over the counter puchases).</li>
            <li> Great value for the toothpicks. Really impressed by the little brush they have on the end. Would go ahead and get this pack of 12 rather than the smaller ones, even though you may want to try them out first.</li>
            <li> favorite of my husband and myself.  I have them in my purse and in our vehicles.</li>
            <li> We love these and use them daily.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothpicks; and have bought these more than once from Amazon. Like the brush on once end as well as the pick on the other.</li>
            <li> In case anyone would like to know, today I compared the Doctors Brush Pick (250 pkg)the GUM Soft Picks, DenTek Slim Brush for Tight Teeth and CVS&#x27; Interdental brush and toothpick .  I bought all 4 and tried them all today after going for my 6 month dental cleaning yesterday.  I had no cavaties but my gums could be better. I hate flossing and asked if there was an alternative. I was told about the GUM Soft Picks.  I looked them up here at Amazon and the GUM website and seeing that CVS was supposed to carry them, took a trip there and bought 4 differnt kinds/brands to see how they would fare, figuring I&#x27;d use them all up eventually.  Here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tight teeth,,,the Doctors Brush Picks and DenTek Slim Brush worked best for me and got between the most teeth.  Of course in all 4, there were a few teeth that even the Doctors and DenTek couldn&#x27;t get between.  The GUM and CVS had the largest diameter and therefore got between the least amount of teeth for cleaning. The GUM Brush Picks were quick to crumple when they couldn&#x27;t slide between the teeth, so that was annoying. At CVS, the Doctors bush picks were the best value at 250 for $3.89 and were on par with DenTek Slim Brush (32 for $5.99) with getting in between the most teeth.  The Doctors and Dentek are different \\&quot;animals in that the Drs. is the \\&quot;brush\\&quot; with plastic bristles on one end and a plastic tooth pick on the other.  The DenTek has a green, small, solid plastic cylinder you hold at one end and a super slim metal filament with tiny brush like filaments going 360 degrees around the metal filament.  The Doctors pick isn&#x27;t bendable on the pick end.  The DenTek&#x27;s metal filament can be bent at 90 degrees for back teeth.  Both worked great and I think, for me both are way more comfortable than using Glide dental floss and I can tell after I used the 4 I tried, that I&#x27;ll get much more \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; out of these picks than any floss!!  The CVS&#x27; brand Interdental Brush &amp; Toothpick (120 picks for $1.99 in the travel section, aqua in color) as they were a better value than the CVS brand competition to the other name brand picks where I found the other 3 items, go figure.  I tried them  CVS&#x27; out, and found them about the same diameter as the GUM Soft Picks.  So the 2 that I won&#x27;t buy again (because they are just to large to fit between more of my teeth teeth) would be the CVS and GUM picks.  Those will go to my son who has space between his teeth and will work just fine in his case.  The Doctors Brush Picks are the best VALUE but I do wish the end with the tiny plastic filaments would bend like the DenTek.  If they did, they&#x27;d be absolutely perfect for my tight teeth.  I&#x27;m thinking I will use the Doctors most of the time and based on construction of the DenTek (being bendable where you need it), I will try and extend them for more than one use, by swishing them in mouthwash to get them as sterile as possible after rinsing them clean.  I know I probably shouldn&#x27;t do that, but unless I find the DenTek in a larger/more economical quantity amount, the Doctors brand wins on economy and the DenTek wins when it comes to being able to reach and clean between the back molars as well as most of my other teeth.  I was thinking of possibly snapping off the Doctors brand tooth pick end (the no bristle portion) and seeing if I can make them a little shorter to reach between my back molars from the tongue angle and hopefully that will work.  I don&#x27;t know yet.  So that is my experience and thought if you were considering this type of product that seeing the differences between each, might help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush picks for several years now. I love them and the way they get everything out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the best picks and brushes for cleaning teeth without a toothbrush. I take them everywhere. Strangely, many dentists know nothing about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.C.</li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend these pics, from this seller!  We are almost out and will be reordering soon!  Once you try this type of pic, you will be hooked.  G&amp;P</li>
            <li> My meals are \\&quot;moveable feasts\\&quot;...I sometimes eat in the kitchen, in the dining room or in the den. Where ever I eat, you will find Brush Picks! They are a necessity in&lt;br /&gt;good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> We love these things I&#x27;ve been using them several times a day for years to get the space below my bridge work clean before brushing.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can use these for a quicker and easier cleaning in the car before a meeting just to be sure.</li>
            <li> A friend showed me these. They are a great alternative/accompaniment to dental floss. They are easy to carry around, well maybe not this large size, but you can use these to refill their smaller sized container. I keep them in my car, one at work and of course at home. I prefer them over other similar toothpick-type products.</li>
            <li> I have been using these instead of flossing for a few years now.  They do a great job.  My hygienist is impressed.  I have laser treatments on my gums every 6 months.  Diabetes contributes to gum disease issues.  At my last check-up I only had 4 spots that needed treatment and they were on my very back bottom teeth.  My hygienist asked me what I had done differently.  I said just lots of using the Dr. brush picks (after I eat anything).  I have tried other brands when I ran out of these and I found them to be too soft and would bend over.  Now I order a large quantity so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> These little babies make the difference in our dentist appointments.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and these are awesome.  I can hardly leave the house without them.  Even the dentist approves!</li>
            <li> My daughter shared her brush pics with me and now I share them with all my friends.</li>
            <li> This was my third purchases already.  I gave them to my relatives and friends. They all like to use them.</li>
            <li> Really good product - my dentist is happy</li>
            <li> I really like these. I am not really good about flossing. These must be doing something since my dentist thinks I do a great job flossing.</li>
            <li> love the toothpicks, the shape is not perfectly round on one end so they reach into difficult places where food gets trapped, and the little brush at the other end is just the right size and holds up well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist.  We got these to give o patients as samples.  It&#x27;s a lot easier than flossing and works well.</li>
            <li> I have used many other types of floss and flossers. With this product there is no comparison. It&#x27;s far superior than anything else out there. I notice a huge difference in my gums with it and so does my hygienist. Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews I&#x27;ll add a positive items here. I liked them so much that I now buy them by the \\&quot;case\\&quot; instead of at Walgreen&#x27;s. These are really well designed for my personal needs, and I will continue to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li> Sadly, many shops seem to have stopped stocking these (BrushPicks), so it was great to find them on Amazon. I ended up with more than I anticipated, due to a mix-up with ordering. But I am just happy to have them and can share them with someone else who has also had difficulties finding them in stores. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband. They are hard to find around where we live, so I ordered them online. I ordered a whole freakin case because my husband is so addicted to them. He has a pack in every vehicle we own and probably every room in our house. He won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> Use of the brush end of the \\&quot;Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks\\&quot; seems to have a good result on dental health. Years of daily use after regular flossing has resulted in a long series of semi-annual Dentist cleanings with no return visits for further work. The 250 count pack is a saving over the smaller packs sold in many drugstores.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. Awesome.</li>
            <li> These Brushpicks are wonderful! they clean much, much better than normal toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Avoid gum disease with these - I&#x27;m 69 and have never had a gum problem - I believe these are a major reason.</li>
            <li> Great toothpick I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR YEARS .....ALWAYS AFTER EATING SOMETHING.  I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN SAVING US HUGE DENTAL PROBLEMS AND ENSUING BILLS.</li>
            <li> These have really helped my teeth.  I have a number of bridges, which are difficult to floss under.  I use the BrushPicks regularly after every meal or snack.  My dentist has commented repeatedly on the improved health of my gums due to better \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; habits.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> it has been more and more difficult to find these plastic toothpicks for my wife in stores.  Then I went to the old backup, Amazon, and there they were.  Now she has a box in each \\&quot;popular\\&quot; location in the house, and many more boxes in reserve.  Great job.</li>
            <li> I ordered a lifetime supply of these and always have a container at work, in my cars, and at home.  They are small enough to get under the gums and between the teeth, and are far more useful than traditional wooden picks.</li>
            <li> It easy to use and clean good your mouth. you can carry them in your purse and leave some in my car.</li>
            <li> Love these picks and love the quantity, thanks</li>
            <li> Best toothpicks ever made.  All my friends use these.</li>
            <li> Item has been slowly fading from drugstore counter. Now I can get it from amazon. Cheap and reliable way of getting it!</li>
            <li> I love them and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothpicks you can buy  ----- I have people come and ask me for one .  :)</li>
            <li> Love them, use them several times per day. Good report from my dentist when I have my oral exam</li>
            <li> Great value to share with a friend. Do a better job than dental floss.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss, but I love to pick my teeth.  I used to use wooden toothpicks, but they had their limitations.  Some years ago I switched to The Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks.  My twice yearly dental checkups are great.  My gums are tight and healthy, and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years.  I rarely endorse a product, but this one deserves every accolade it gets.  I keep Brushpicks in my purse and on my kitchen shelf.  Every time I eat anything at all, I take one out and use it to massage my gums and remove all the food between my teeth.  Unlike flossing, which can be messy and requires a certain amount of privacy, using a brushpick is something you can do while you&#x27;re working or driving.  Once when we were traveling through Europe, we ran out of brushpicks and nearly went crazy.  Boots, the local chain of drugstores, didn&#x27;t carry them, so we walked all over London and finally found some brushpicks in a small pharmacy.  I&#x27;ve never seen them on the Continent, so now we make sure to take plenty along when we travel.  Pat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 5, 2013:  Still using Doctor&#x27;s Brushpicks several times each day!  Still love them!!</li>
            <li> The Worlds Best Tooth Pick, Love them, could not find them it town anymore so had to oder them, because they are the best.</li>
            <li> Every5thing was perfect, just what I wanted.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The toothpicks bend to fit between hard to reach places.  Gets food out you didn&#x27;t know was there.  The bristles are gentle on your gums.  You will be addicted to them forever.</li>
            <li> I was in the States when i bought these in 2009. They were in packets of 250 then. I have just run out of them and ordered more. Now they are in packs of 275 but they are still the great quality they were over 4 years ago. Will be looking out for these in the UK. A word of warning though. Please be aware that the US customs and the Royal Mail make extra postage charges other than what you pay on the site but i have to say that Amazon kindly rectified this for me. Pedro x</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without brushpicks now . it&#x27;s comforting, massaging. In fact, I&#x27;m using one right now, not unusual because I go through these like candy. Weirdly addicting.</li>
            <li> I love these toothpicks. They work better than flossing. I order a bunch of them and always have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Best tooth pick in the world!  Excellent size for use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take the word &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; literally. It&#x27;s a plastic toothpick with little plastic &amp;#34;threads&amp;#34; sticking out of the business end. They help clean your teeth, but nothing that a regular toothpick can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Much better than the wooden or bamboo toothpicks. Very good toothpicks for cleaning.in small gap between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little soft.  Whishing they are a little harder.  Good price compare to retail store price</li>
            <li> Good product, the best toothpicks available, in my opinion.  Shipping and delivery on time.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are the best.  Price was good.</li>
            <li> The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks have added greatly to my arsenal of being better at taking care of my teeth.  These picks are superb because the &#x27;brush&#x27; end is thin. It can get easily between the teeth, often from either side... front or back.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s easy to get under a crown. Tighter teeth can mostly be better dealt with. I am glad I ordered the largest supply of them. My husband says I bought enough to last a lifetime. We have some in the car or in my purse for after dinner in a restaurant.  I don&#x27;t want to use wood picks anymore.  Hope you, enjoy feeling &#x27;picked on,&#x27; in a GOOD way.</li>
            <li> These are the most effective toothpicks.</li>
            <li> these are better than floss and better than any other brand of brush picks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpick instead of floss for many years now and have not had any cavities.  Much easier to use than the dental floss!</li>
            <li> So everyone knows flossing is the real key to dental health, especially your gums.  Recent studies have shown brushing just twice a day, and not after ever meal, is optimal, but you need to floss after each meal and preferably snack, pretty much any time you chew solid food.  Nobody likes to floss, at least nobody I know, but the BrushPicks makes the task so, so much easier and more convenient.  My dental checkups went far better once I picked these up as a habit, and I haven&#x27;t flossed with a string in over 5 years.</li>
            <li> i love them i would recommend them to everyone, and the price is reasonable. they work in those hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> Great packing.  This is the best product on the market for your teeth.  If you are caught with no toothbrush, no problem, just use this product and dental floss and you will be fine.  Of course, it won&#x27;t help your breath from stinking of onions or garlic but you won&#x27;t get cavities.  The dentist told me I have fabulous dental health.</li>
            <li> Consistently reliable</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and love them.  My husband now has his own container.  As you age, the space between your teeth tend to enlarge and it can be quite embarrassing when you are eating out.  This is the solution..</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are great for removing food from your teeth.  I periodically will give to friends and they thank me profusely.  They say it is the best give I have ever given them.  Who would have thought.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine a gift for a couple of dollars would warrant such praise.</li>
            <li> Helps when flossing does get something between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I only  wish the bristles were soft.</li>
            <li> It help us to clean our teeth easily anytime after we ate, make us feel good and clean.</li>
            <li> I give these out as little gifts.  Everyone is thrilled when they receive. Great product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just great!  we prefer them to the &#x27;soft picks&#x27;.  They provide a nice massaging action.....but be a little careful not to overuse.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have been using these for 5 years.  They work!</li>
            <li> Use them regularly.  I like them.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly which is great.  I have used this product and am impressed with its capacity to clean in between your teeth.  Your dentist will notice.</li>
            <li> Have used these daily for over 8 years and even carry them in a small container in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I also buy them by the case of 12 (250 picks) for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;The brush end of the pick is great for getting out food between the teeth and the indentations on the pick help you get a good grip on it.  Wood toothpicks can&#x27;t do the trick and they splinter and leave pieces between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;When I went in for a dental appointment the dentist asked how long it had been since I saw a dentist - before he examined my teeth.  I told him at least four years and he started to lecture me on how I needed to come in twice a year.  After he checked my teeth he backed off and said that the only problem he saw was the crown that broke off.&lt;br /&gt;I told him I used the plastic brushpicks and he said that explained that was probably one of the reasons why my teeth were in as good of a condition as they were.</li>
