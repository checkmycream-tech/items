            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this, but it feels like plain water and does nothing more than wet one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> It will last me a long time and gives me radiant, glowing skin!</li>
            <li> other toners dry out skin.</li>
            <li> (of course he doesn&#x27;t know what I originally spent on the products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> Not much, but what got me what the shipping charges.</li>
            <li> So i purchased Dead Sea over Gratiae simply because it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I have been using this product for years, I have tried other products</li>
            <li> I use this product along with other Premier Dead Sea line</li>
            <li> All it does is make my skin feel tight, and smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I was using a Revlon product received this product also dripping and a portion gone very disappointed in the shipping does not seem to be any better then</li>
            <li> this product was the worst toner I ever used, it did not remove any of my make up, I bought dior and also had a left over lush toner and made the comparisment, would have given it zero stars if I could have.</li>
            <li> but the price was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I just hate the way they leave my skin feeling like it needs to be washed.  </li>
            <li> the bottle design is very bad ..please improve.</li>

            <li> The premier products are the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used.  When I first purchased them I spent so much money that I told myself - oh well just pretend you had a facelift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it was the best advise I ever gave myself!  I have not regretted using the Premier Products!  And now the price is so very affordable I can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more important, my complexion had never looked so good!  Even my husband agrees.  (of course he doesn&#x27;t know what I originally spent on the products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give Premier a try - you&#x27;ll be delighted you did and you&#x27;ll feel so good.</li>
            <li> This is good product ..but when i was received ..it was leaking ...the bottle design is very bad ..please improve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake.it&#x27;s different with the ture primier product.I don&#x27;t believe use lower price can get good deals in the future.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this, but it feels like plain water and does nothing more than wet one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> This is a new product  for me, so far I am liking it, It has a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I have been using this product for years, I have tried other products but I always come back to premier because of the size and the quality.</li>
            <li> This works pretty nice along with my other Premier Products BUT, I purchased mine from Cosmetic4less and when it was sent it had leaked. Not much, but what got me what the shipping charges. I ordered 2 of the toners and they sent both of them (in the same package) but charged for 2 separate orders. I will update as I continue using this product. It does smell good and feels good. But, the seller will not be helpful if you have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Told me they didn&#x27;t think I would be happy no matter what they did.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shave and feel refreshed without my pours being dried up perfect I will re buy this</li>
            <li> This toner is just so so. I don&#x27;t see what the hype is all about, honestly. While it didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, I gave it two stars for the high price. I had better results with the Glytone toner. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a while.  i just came back from a very long deployment and this kept my skin looking great and clear.</li>
            <li> I know so many skin care programs include the use of toner.  I just hate the way they leave my skin feeling like it needs to be washed.  Tried it several different times then I just ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month along with the moisture lotion for the face and the face serum.  The the sand papery quality of my skin has become softened; but, even better, the age spots on my neck and throat area have lightened remarkably. I recommend this product for both conditions.</li>
            <li> this product was the worst toner I ever used, it did not remove any of my make up, I bought dior and also had a left over lush toner and made the comparisment, would have given it zero stars if I could have.</li>
            <li> thank you it an honour to shop with you. Do add me on instagram: usana9884025</li>
            <li> I like this product. It makes my face feel clean and fresh. I use it after cleasning my face, morning and night and it keeps my skin moist.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I fell in love with it. Makes my face feel so good. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> love these products, skin feels clean and fresh.very gentle on face. price is great fast shipping. other toners dry out skin. not premier</li>
            <li> Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry and love the pump feature.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different because the weather was changing. So i purchased Dead Sea over Gratiae simply because it was cheaper. However after compering the 2 i prefer Gratiae.</li>
            <li> The Premier Toner is gentle and an effective toner. It is cost effective and lasts a long time. I have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This toner feels light, clean, refreshing and non-oily. Love this product. Highly recommended. Price on Amazon reasonable too</li>
            <li> Light and soaks into skin right away. Works perfectly with other Premier Dead Sea products, which are the best skin products I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> This stuff is &amp;#34;True Gold&amp;#34; in a bottle. It is heavenly. I love the scent. I love how refreshing it feels against my skin. It really helps replenish and is a wonderful toner. It was worth the price and the wait. It will last me a long time and gives me radiant, glowing skin! So thankful I bought this!!</li>
            <li> I use this product along with other Premier Dead Sea line and I love it my skin is clean and clear...great product, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon I would recommend to my friends but I can&#x27;t let them know my secret to great skin</li>
            <li> Cleans good and won&#x27;t dry my skin. Doesn&#x27;t smell either. Will get more when need to. Def recommend it. S</li>
            <li> So far I have continued to use this on my face and neck along with the milk cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing any problems for me. Initially I thought it was a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night but i don&#x27;t see any benefit yet. Maybe it is yet to come. I am a big fan of natural products and thought this would help quench my skin, but we&#x27;ll see what happens. All it does is make my skin feel tight, and smell like roses.</li>
            <li> The Vivo Per Lei toner cost a little more, but it is much better and easier to use. I will not buy the Premier toner again.</li>
            <li> Perfect toner and brand</li>
            <li> Awesome price for an amazing product...</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning to clean up then apply the Dead Sea Mineral Enriched Moisturizing Cream.  I clean my face at night and also apply the moisturizer.  It does a beautiful job. Plus the facial peel is an important part.</li>
            <li> I was using a Revlon product received this product also dripping and a portion gone very disappointed in the shipping does not seem to be any better then the off the shelf walmart products wont purchase it again</li>
            <li> I sampled some of the Premier Dead Sea products at a home show and was very impressed but the price was ridiculous. The prices here are about 20% of retail. Some of the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
