            <li>/&gt;These easy-to-use towelettes supply the user with an SPF of 30 that holds up easily for ninety minutes.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>RIDE A MOTORCYCLE AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOMETHING EASY TO USE AND EASY TO PACK.  </li>

            <li>No weird smell, very smooth application, portable and practical in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I never heard about these packets sooner, but I am so glad I know about and am using them now.</li>
            <li>However, these are just so convenient, easy to use, and effective, that I use it much more frequently as I should.  </li>
            <li>If you ride a bike, if you are in a hurry, or just want some back-up available, this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li>These towelettes are fantastic for the face.</li>
            <li>they work great, and u can rub on your head too if you have shorter hair and back of neck.</li>
            <li>These packets fit conveniently in your bag or pocket.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me from a local online mom&#x27;s group and I&#x27;ve found it to be a great resource.</li>
            <li>While that&#x27;s great, what really sold me on this product is the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and holds up very well against sweat and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy, super convenient, can go through the wash and still be used.  </li>
            <li>The original description was that these were just towelettes.</li>
            <li>The whole purpose of me buying this for my boyfriend who works out in the field and needed something quick and easy to apply for those sunny days!</li>
            <li>They protect us against the hot Georgia sun; they are easy to carry in a purse or pocket, and they are super-easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>GREAT FOR TRAVEL AND GAVE TO OTHER TRAVELERS</li>
            <li>We have ordered these particular towelettes twice and are greatly pleased.  </li>
            <li>Luckily for me, the company I work for found SunX Sunscreen</li>
            <li>These have become a new favorite in our house.  </li>
            <li>I liked the ample supply of sunscreen and the dry towelette to clean my hands.</li>
            <li>I thought they were pre-moistened towelettes for easy application, but I can just as easily apply any suncreen to a rag and rub it on with the same effort.</li>
            <li>not as good as other brands</li>
            <li>I drive a convertible sports car and have the top down most of the time.</li>
            <li>My husband and son detest applying regular lotion sunscreens, but they love the ease of the towelettes.  </li>
            <li>Last year, you sold moistened towellettes which was just a better approach.</li>
            <li>Data are preliminary, but studies have found a link between higher concentrations of oxybenzone and health harms.</li>
            <li>The small packets of sunscreen are perfect to carry in the back of my car and in my golf bag.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using these wipes all Summer long.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to use, especially when you need to reapply a sunscreen outdoors.</li>
            <li>One study has linked oxybenzone to endometriosis in older women; another found that women with higher levels of oxybenzone during pregnancy had lower birth weight daughters.    </li>
            <li>The packets make it so much easier than carrying a bottle, spray or tube of Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure I can say are not greasy, but the bottles of other stuff i have been using are wicked greasy in comparison when putting on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; Use it mainly when I play golf or boating.</li>
            <li>Bought these for our trip to Destin, FL, which I highly recommend for a vacation Destination.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well with my three year old granddaughter that has tactile defensiveness.</li>
            <li>Nice way to have sunscreen without the mess especially when traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that it will live up to</li>
            <li>use these daily while fixing and flying aircraft in the hot sunny weather.</li>
            <li>No messy bottle to pass around!  </li>
            <li>]first this time and will cross check with Amazon&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>These are not just &#x27;towelettes&#x27;, they include a wipey to clean off your skin then apply the suncreen in the other packet.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants access to sunscreen without the weight of carrying an entire bottle or tube in your purse or backpack.  </li>
            <li>This was the only sunscreen towelettes we could find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am very cautious about ingredients that mimic estrogen, especially in my daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scary how young many kids are when entering puberty these days!</li>
            <li>The sunscreen had little if any fragrance and rubbed in quickly.  </li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>I checked out this brand due to the positive reviews I read.</li>
            <li>the quality of these towelettes is low (disintegrate fast) and the lotion on them is a cream, not a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>Kind of useless.</li>
            <li>AS DESCRIBED - TWO SEPARATE PACKETS, NOT A SINGLE PRE-MOISTENED CLOTH</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone in the telecommunications field, construction, farming or any other occupation that involves work outdoors.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend them to anyone in the telecommunications field, construction, farming or any other occupation that involves work outdoors.</li>
            <li> They kept me burn free, and protected, without the greasy mess that usually comes with sunblock.</li>
            <li> The packets are small enough to stash in a wallet, and the pouch doesn&#x27;t break down or tear until you&#x27;re ready to open it.  </li>
            <li> Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and long sleeves (if you can stand them in the heat)</li>
            <li> MONEY WASTED AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.  </li>
            <li> I used these on a trip to Italy last summer, and even am liking them over some lotions spouse bought lately for beach a couple miles away where i live.</li>
            <li> Today, I attended a baseball game that had me right out in the sun, and I had no adverse effect from being there.</li>
            <li> The product label made it unclear that the towelettes are dry and packaged separately.</li>
            <li> This is a packet of sunscreen and a separate dry wipe.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, out weather conditions have not contituted the full use and effect of this product yet.  </li>
            <li> Tubes are likely to explode or go bad out in the AZ heat but these have lasted just fine.</li>
            <li> What I received was a twin-packet which included a creamy sunscreen in one and a dry towelette in the other.  </li>
            <li> These are so convenient that I can stick a few of them in my pack for such emergencies.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> Guess I didn&#x27;t read carefully.</li>
            <li> My family is light-skinned, and we have had two incidences of skin cancer, so we are extremely careful about sun exposure!  </li>
            <li> As someone with past total body irradiation treatment, I just have to avoid prolonged sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> this product (and any other towelette) is no longer approved for the sunscreen protection per the Cancer Society.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t throw your money away on this or any other towelette product.</li>
            <li> apply the sunscreen, simply pass the towelette over any exposed body parts and you&#x27;re covered for roughly two hours of hard work or play.  </li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed; however, when I used this product I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what purpose the dry towelettes served.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s previous reviews, on which I based my purchase.</li>
            <li> The towelettes do not spill and make a mess like the bottles of lotion can.  </li>
            <li> helped without the mess.</li>
            <li> Little mess and always with me, I also don&#x27;t have to worry about a leaky bottle in my bag.</li>
            <li> I keep a few packets in my purse and about 30 minutes before I leave work</li>
            <li> PRODUCT DID NOT FIT ANY OF MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> They are also helpful when travelling by air because a few can be put in the small-size toiletry bag required for carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how difficult it was to find the list of ingredients.</li>

            <li> Great for the 72&#x3D;hr. kit and backpacking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several years now, and find them an excellent value.  One towelette covers face, neck, arms, and legs.  Easy to store in my golf bag, gym bag, and glove compartment. 30 SPF is plenty; lasts 3-4 hours without needing to reapply, even in sweaty South Florida summers.</li>
            <li> I love having these things around. I mountain bike and hike a lot so sun protection is a must. I always try to remember to apply plenty of sunscreen from a tube before a ride or hike, but sometimes I forget to bring the tube. These are so convenient that I can stick a few of them in my pack for such emergencies. They won&#x27;t leak like a tube could do and are small so I don&#x27;t mind having them as a permanent feature in my pack. I also store some in my vehicles. Tubes are likely to explode or go bad out in the AZ heat but these have lasted just fine.</li>
            <li> Love them. Perfect for long rides on the motorcycle.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to use, especially when you need to reapply a sunscreen outdoors. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however the company \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; to ship the product when promised.  I had to call and inquire after the time the product should have arrived to find out that it had not been shipped.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Took a couple of these packets to the State Fair. Used one and I was protected all day. These things are so convenient. The packets make it so much easier than carrying a bottle, spray or tube of Sunscreen.  The great thing is they work just as good.</li>
            <li> I ride my bike or golf, sometimes I am out longer then expected and this sunscreen touch up is just perfect. Little mess and always with me, I also don&#x27;t have to worry about a leaky bottle in my bag.</li>
            <li> We have used these at three 11:00am football games this year and they have been Awesome!!  Very convenient and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just started playing golf and the towelettes are a lot neater and more convenient than carrying a bottle of suntan lotion.  The towelettes do not spill and make a mess like the bottles of lotion can.  I would recommend towelettes to anyone who is in the sun a lot and needs a fast convenient way to keep the sun from getting the best of you.</li>
            <li> I drive a convertible sports car and have the top down most of the time. In winter I&#x27;m not so bothered by sun exposure - but summer is entirely different.  I use to try keeping sunscreen lotion in my trunk but the hassle of putting it on, having goopy stuff all over the place, and even having it leak out into my trunk discouraged me from using it.  Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a hunch and it has paid of in spades. I keep a few packets in my purse and about 30 minutes before I leave work I can wipe it on my arms, chest and ears (very important and often forgotten area) before getting into my car. No weird smell, very smooth application, portable and practical in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I never heard about these packets sooner, but I am so glad I know about and am using them now. If you ride a bike, if you are in a hurry, or just want some back-up available, this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> My family is light-skinned, and we have had two incidences of skin cancer, so we are extremely careful about sun exposure!  My husband and son detest applying regular lotion sunscreens, but they love the ease of the towelettes.  We have ordered these particular towelettes twice and are greatly pleased.  They protect us against the hot Georgia sun; they are easy to carry in a purse or pocket, and they are super-easy to apply.  One can&#x27;t miss with that combination!  There are no negatives with this product.  It is easy to apply, convenient, and effective.</li>
            <li> Was advertised as towelettes . Was actually lotion in one side and a cleaning towel. Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are fantastic for the face. This is my second order of them. I think better than its competition. Easy on the skin, I am fair, but effective in protecting ones face while outside . Great Product.</li>
            <li> Wish it was in one package, but seems to work well</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR TRAVEL AND GAVE TO OTHER TRAVELERS AND THEY ORDERED ASO</li>
            <li> In my line of work, I find myself out in the sun quite often.  Couple this with the facts that I&#x27;m as white as a ghost and really, really hate applying sunscreen because of the grease factor, and I&#x27;m a prime candidate for a nasty sunburn.  Luckily for me, the company I work for found SunX Sunscreen towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These easy-to-use towelettes supply the user with an SPF of 30 that holds up easily for ninety minutes.  While that&#x27;s great, what really sold me on this product is the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and holds up very well against sweat and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply the sunscreen, simply pass the towelette over any exposed body parts and you&#x27;re covered for roughly two hours of hard work or play.  I also suggest passing the towelette over parts of the body that aren&#x27;t exposed as well.  The packaging states that the SPF holds up for eighty minutes, but I find that it works a bit longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protection from the sun is key.  Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and long sleeves (if you can stand them in the heat) will only add to the protection provided by SunX Sunscreen towelettes.  I highly recommend them to anyone in the telecommunications field, construction, farming or any other occupation that involves work outdoors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, out weather conditions have not contituted the full use and effect of this product yet.  I&#x27;m hopeful that it will live up to it&#x27;s previous reviews, on which I based my purchase.</li>
            <li> These work great.  I ride motorcycles a lot and just throw several in the tour pack of my bike.  Not greasy, just works.</li>
            <li> Perfect product!  Great convenience for outdoor sports, hunting, fishing, backpacking, or tailgating events! Never be without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. My son works for the power company and they supply this to their workers. Not greasy and easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t give you that \\&quot;coppertone feel or smell\\&quot; Use it mainly when I play golf or boating. A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> use these daily while fixing and flying aircraft in the hot sunny weather. they work great, and u can rub on your head too if you have shorter hair and back of neck. no sunburn!</li>
            <li> not as good as other brands</li>
            <li> This is not what is advertised in the title. It is not a towelette. It is a packet of sunscreen and a separate towelette. If you want to return it, you need to pay shipping and restocking fee 20%.</li>
            <li> So easy, super convenient, can go through the wash and still be used.  I fill my son&#x27;s pockets with these in case he ends up outside on a day he didn&#x27;t expect he&#x27;d be out.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using these wipes all Summer long. They kept me burn free, and protected, without the greasy mess that usually comes with sunblock.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED - TWO SEPARATE PACKETS, NOT A SINGLE PRE-MOISTENED CLOTH AS EXPECTED.  MONEY WASTED AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.  UNABLE TO USE BECAUSE OF INCONVENIENCE AND GREASY APPLICATION.  RIDE A MOTORCYCLE AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOMETHING EASY TO USE AND EASY TO PACK.  PRODUCT DID NOT FIT ANY OF MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> I used these on a trip to Italy last summer, and even am liking them over some lotions spouse bought lately for beach a couple miles away where i live. The towelettes are sort of a useless appendix although, pulled them out of my bag&lt;br /&gt;when nothing was around like Kleenexes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I can say are not greasy, but the bottles of other stuff i have been using are wicked greasy in comparison when putting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hint: If your spouse keeps taking things out of here care for whatever reason like sunscreen bottles, you can tuck these around the trunk or door pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to beach on cloudy day? keep in your pocket in case sun comes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely great to have in bicycle bag in case of need for an urgent bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good after an urgent haircut too when forehead exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still pale even after weeks in the sun at beach, which is what i want.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. No problems going through airport security.&lt;br /&gt;Each packet has a generous amount of sunscreen and the accompanying towelette is very handy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to take if you are traveling. Since it is not a liquid, you can put it in your suitcase or carry on without worrying about putting it in a quart bag for inspection.  It also is good to put in a purse and keep on hand.  I may also use it this summer when we have guests. No messy bottle to pass around!  I will definitely use this product again and again. .</li>
            <li> I just love these.  As someone with past total body irradiation treatment, I just have to avoid prolonged sun exposure.  Since I hated the mess of regular sunscreen, I often didn&#x27;t use it as I should have.  However, these are just so convenient, easy to use, and effective, that I use it much more frequently as I should.  Today, I attended a baseball game that had me right out in the sun, and I had no adverse effect from being there.</li>
            <li> Not sure what purpose the dry towelettes served. Kind of useless. The cream was ok. Last year, you sold moistened towellettes which was just a better approach.</li>
            <li> Bought these for our trip to Destin, FL, which I highly recommend for a vacation Destination. We went there for our daughters wedding. helped without the mess.</li>
            <li> the quality of these towelettes is low (disintegrate fast) and the lotion on them is a cream, not a clear gel.  Don&#x27;t like them!</li>
            <li> The towelettes worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> These have become a new favorite in our house.  Effective and super convenient.  The packets are small enough to stash in a wallet, and the pouch doesn&#x27;t break down or tear until you&#x27;re ready to open it.  A summer staple for the golfers in our house.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received this product.  I was expecting a towelette with sunscreen on it.  What I received was a twin-packet which included a creamy sunscreen in one and a dry towelette in the other.  At first I was disappointed; however, when I used this product I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked the ample supply of sunscreen and the dry towelette to clean my hands. The sunscreen had little if any fragrance and rubbed in quickly.  It was not greasy.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants access to sunscreen without the weight of carrying an entire bottle or tube in your purse or backpack.  These packets fit conveniently in your bag or pocket.  Great for traveling or the beach.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Easy way to pack sunscreen for a 72 Hour Kit</li>
            <li> Works very well with my three year old granddaughter that has tactile defensiveness. Makes going to the beach so much more pleasant for her!</li>
            <li> This product is effective as sun block.  I have used it when golfing in Myrtle Beach, SC and in North Carolina.  These sun block wipes are easier to use on the face and neck than sun block spray.  They are also helpful when travelling by air because a few can be put in the small-size toiletry bag required for carry-on luggage.  I always keep a supply at home.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These wipes are PERFECT for sporting events - from golf to baseball to tennis - just pack a couple in your bag for those days where the heat just creeps up on you (and this summer they were perfect) Bought them for my nephews and nieces just for those events.</li>
            <li> Our daughter wanted to include these in the gift bags she was making for out-of-town wedding guests. This was the only sunscreen towelettes we could find at a reasonable price. Everyone loved them. Those that used them during their trip gave them rave reviews. Nice way to have sunscreen without the mess especially when traveling.</li>
            <li> I checked out this brand due to the positive reviews I read. I was surprised by how difficult it was to find the list of ingredients. Once I did finally get the info, I found that several are unsafe ingredients, especially for women and kids. Check out the info on EWG&#x27;s website for sunscreen safety. It was recommended to me from a local online mom&#x27;s group and I&#x27;ve found it to be a great resource. [...]    Among the recommendations are...  No oxybenzone  Commonly used in sunscreens, the chemical oxybenzone penetrates the skin, gets into the bloodstream and acts like estrogen in the body. It can trigger allergic reactions. Data are preliminary, but studies have found a link between higher concentrations of oxybenzone and health harms. One study has linked oxybenzone to endometriosis in older women; another found that women with higher levels of oxybenzone during pregnancy had lower birth weight daughters.    I am very cautious about ingredients that mimic estrogen, especially in my daughter. It&#x27;s scary how young many kids are when entering puberty these days! I&#x27;m now trying to use sunscreens that don&#x27;t have any chemicals. Who knows which one will end up as unsafe next.    Another mentioned item is...\\&quot;No sunscreen towelettes or powders    FDA’s sunscreen rules bar sunscreen wipes and powders. But some small online retailers are still offering towelettes and powders. Don’t buy them. Why? Dubious sun protection\\&quot;.    After giving it some thought, I also felt uncomfortable with the disposable nature of the product and all the packaging. I read something a while back on the mountains of wipes (baby, household cleaning,...and now sunscreen) being thrown into landfills.    I&#x27;m checking EWG&#x27;s safety rating[...]first this time and will cross check with Amazon&#x27;s reviews. I&#x27;m going to pass on this one and find a safer choice for my family and the environment.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> The product label made it unclear that the towelettes are dry and packaged separately. I thought they were pre-moistened towelettes for easy application, but I can just as easily apply any suncreen to a rag and rub it on with the same effort. However, the SPF is great.</li>
            <li> The small packets of sunscreen are perfect to carry in the back of my car and in my golf bag.  I would like a higher SPF then 30, but it is perfect for those times when you are out and don&#x27;t have any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The original description was that these were just towelettes.These are not just &#x27;towelettes&#x27;, they include a wipey to clean off your skin then apply the suncreen in the other packet. The whole purpose of me buying this for my boyfriend who works out in the field and needed something quick and easy to apply for those sunny days! This is not as it seems and is actually a pain and messy.&lt;br /&gt;Plus this product (and any other towelette) is no longer approved for the sunscreen protection per the Cancer Society. So don&#x27;t throw your money away on this or any other towelette product.</li>
            <li> My husband is reluctant to use sprays and creams when outside.  This towelette is perfect for him.  He will use because he says it does not feel sticky and greasy.  It seems to protect his face from the sun without any redness.</li>
            <li> Guess I didn&#x27;t read carefully. I thought I was buying suncreen wipes. This is a packet of sunscreen and a separate dry wipe. Not what I was after :(</li>
