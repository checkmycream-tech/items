            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my tea tree oil, it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but if it works.. it&#x27;ll be worth it!</li>
            <li>Feels great to soak your feet after a long day of being on your feet.</li>

            <li>The most notable improvements have been the easing of my nerve pain and the virtual elimination of calluses, especially in the heel areas.</li>
            <li>I am treating for mild case of toe fungus along with an antifungal brush on treatment and it seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li>It only takes about 2 teaspoons per treatment, definetely satisfied with purchase and plan on buying more after this jar I&#x27;d finished.</li>
            <li>Dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>He loved the smell, the oils loosened up dirt and gunk, and with a gentle scrubbing with a washcloth his feet were soft and fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product to help get rid of some toenail fungus I seemed to have picked up while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I read about the product but didn&#x27;t see anything that mentioned that it should not be used by women to are pregnant or nursing.  </li>
            <li>My toenails are looking so much better, Even my shoes feel better, especially now in the summer when I&#x27;m not wearing socks.</li>
            <li>Works awesome in foot baths especially the deep foot baths that heat the water.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes feet feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>It also has made my Alligator feet soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.  </li>
            <li>Arrives quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, make my feet very soft!</li>
            <li>Would be highly upset if I got two more that weren&#x27;t sealed!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foot soak, it leaves my feet feeling rejuvenated, My podiatrist said my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>OK so I&#x27;ve been using this &#x27;magic sauce&#x27; powder for about a week now, and I notice a clear reduction in both how much feet sweat and consequently smell.</li>
            <li>Nothing like a good soak after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time!</li>
            <li>no jets, no massages, just holds a lot of hot water!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it again as I am running out of my first one!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>An absolute must have!!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like because I wanted something that had more of a tea tree oil fragrance but after multiple soaks I do indeed like the product!  </li>
            <li>I noticed the difference from the first use!  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for facilitating dead skin removal with an exfoliating cloth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was amazing.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much in order to enjoy the aromatic aspects of this product.</li>
            <li>Although I have used only 1 time, this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This soak is well worth the price</li>
            <li>My feet definitely look better and feel fantastic afterward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot at $17.00 for a bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Order this product, then order a nice _SIMPLE_ bucket.  </li>
            <li>Leaves feet feet feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>My feet are now fresh and don&#x27;t repel my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Also makes the room smell so fresh afterwards</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey for the tiny bag.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been soaking now for 2 weeks and thus far his toe nails look a lot more acceptable.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and my feet are soft, wish the bag was larger for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>but  was more than pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far I am really enjoying this mixture.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that I have to do my own pedicure...</li>
            <li>It gives really-really tired feet an excellent relief.</li>
            <li>So far my feet look a lot better</li>
            <li>Took 20 minutes to myself and it was so worth it.</li>

            <li>* like this stuff is helping--it&#x27;s dissolving the fungus right off my skin</li>
            <li>now I wanted to jump on this right away and prevent any fungus from growing.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your feet feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a foot soak bucket filled with warm water to cover my feet up to my ankles, and a tablespoon and a half of the mixture for twenty (20) minutes.</li>

            <li>My feet feel great after the salt bath and hopefully clears my nail fungus that I been treating for the past year.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s nice to treat not the fungus but yourself to a worm foot bath after a long day .</li>
            <li>After a long day of abusing my feet at work and the gym, nothing beats a nice foot soak with Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>I use it at home after a long day or sometimes my own pedicure pretreatment.</li>
            <li>and my feet feel relaxed and refreshed after a nice long soak.  </li>
            <li>after a busy day there is nothing better than to relax my feet in a tea tree oil foot soak from purely northwest</li>
            <li>The new nail is free of fungus.</li>

            <li>She plays soccer and her feet are often wet and in dark enclosed socks and shoes which (we learned) is a perfect breeding ground for fungus.  </li>
            <li>so we can really see my progress!</li>
            <li>It is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Epsom salts</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I also make sure to wear opened toed shoes as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Finally got a chance to use this and it was a soothing to my feet as told in many reviews, wish it came in bulk portions.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many scents, especially floral.  </li>
            <li>First product that I have used that&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are so glad to finally find a product that is helping him.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li>The combination of the products and the salt is exactly what I would like in a foot soak.  </li>

            <li>I got this for my Dad, who really needed it!  </li>
            <li>He says it is making a world of difference and has thanked me several times for getting it for him. :)</li>
            <li>Long term effectiveness on foot health and anti-fungal properties has yet to be tested, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak!!</li>
            <li>At first i thought since i should just give it some time</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, get rid of your sugar intake.</li>
            <li>Going to reorder as soon as possible, Love this product.</li>
            <li>He really likes the fresh feeling after a soak.</li>
            <li>and I must say, WOW my feet are now so smooth,</li>
            <li>I had to use a bucket and dissolve the salt first because the Spa model I have says \\&quot;water only\\&quot;, but once I did it, this stuff literally did exactly what it said it did.</li>
            <li>Actually felt better on the first try.  </li>
            <li>I will be trying it next :)</li>
            <li>It did however leave my feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as we needed it too.</li>
            <li>Our whole family LOVES THIS!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s looking better after only a couple of soaks.</li>
            <li>If only for this, I am pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell it helps any more than regular epsom salt.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the anti fungal wash &amp; topical treatment to treat a toenail fungus on one toe, I know it will take more time to see results from the regimen I am using</li>
            <li>As described, has a distinctive scent that you need to be aware of.</li>
            <li>This is absolute wonderfulness in a jar!</li>
            <li>(boy time passes fast when youre on your ipad!)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m diabetic and suffer from neuropathy and foot pain (swelling) and noticed a difference after the first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>very powerful for a natural product.</li>
            <li>I also very much appreciated the thoughtful follow up email from this very professional seller.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product to soak my feet for the last week and so far love it!  </li>
            <li>Makes my tired, sore feet feel so good!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s truly having an effect on the fungus, but we are very optimistic that this soak is playing a huge part.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stay closed properly, but the product itself it great.</li>
            <li>Leaves feet feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My feet feel so clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel really clean and soft after soaking.</li>
            <li>and it does what it says,  heals,  soft,  clean smell.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my feet, especially my heels, sooo soft and smelling so nice.  </li>
            <li>Can get similar for much cheaper and in greater quantity at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>already and ready to order some more just wish they came in bigger bags.</li>
            <li>My feet feel smooth and soft afterwards and  it is also very energizing.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for the past few weeks and am extremely satisfied with the way my feet feel after a good soak!  </li>
            <li>It appears to be having a positive effect on the nail.  </li>
            <li>and i look forward to seeing positive affects over time.</li>
            <li>I got this bc of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>If you are going to use this I recommend using it every day with hot water if you really want to get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li>I think that, so long as I keep this up, the nail will grow a healthy nail and the fungus</li>
            <li>Really makes your feet feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Using this to soak my feet, Then using Amazing herbs Black Seed oil to moisturize.</li>
            <li>But an added benefit I discovered is the super callus softening that the mixture offers.</li>
            <li>I had early signs of a mild nail fungus and this cleared it up immediately.</li>
            <li>I use this with a foot spa and can honestly say it&#x27;s transformed my previously Hobbit like feet.</li>
            <li>and my feet started to clear up from a mild fungal infection that I had.</li>
            <li>I filled a bucket w/ hot water, added this tea tree oil, added apple cider vinegar, and let my feet soak while I played games on steam for ~30 minutes daily.</li>
            <li>It does burn a teensie bit on little cracked or rough areas on the feet, but that passes, and your footsies feel great afterward---clean and cool.</li>
            <li>I follow up by rubbing 100% pure tea tree oil on my feet and nails.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have been living with this fungus under my large toenails forever</li>
            <li>so adding it to epsom salts is a pure bonus...</li>
            <li>I was worried that it might have been a bit of athletes foot developing, but this certainly helped to keep my feet feeling and smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purely Northwest is always there for you</li>
            <li>After the very first use my feet were totally soft.</li>
            <li>Is a bet miss leading when it says it will help with fungas when the fine print tells you that you need to purchase extra meds to help with that.</li>
            <li>If not - how in the hell did you make such a fine product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do?</li>
            <li>definitely was pleased with it and is helping so far!</li>
            <li>It will hold the water just fine and have enough room for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The container has a clever bottom, so it can&#x27;t tip over!</li>
            <li>Thanks Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li>Other than give a unique clean feeling after I used it, it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing combination of salts- takes out all callus and dead skin--</li>
            <li>I have been using this daily for a few weeks and it has made my feet feel great, softened the skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my feet pretty much all day at work, and it&#x27;s concrete</li>
            <li>It has a cleansing smell &amp; works very well.</li>

            <li>If I reorder I will still have to buy, yet another, product I don&#x27;t really need to amount to the $35 in order to prevent paying s/h again.</li>
            <li>Now my feet do not sweat as much and do not stink at the end of the day.</li>

            <li>It is still too early to tell the success of this project with curing my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Really like the Tea Tree Oil foot soak.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything it says it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>The epsom salts also really help to relieve aches and pain in my feet, as I have arthritis pain in my feet.  </li>
            <li>really has been helping me with my feet</li>
            <li>It seems that one works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and really is soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like this foot soak.  </li>
            <li>normally I really didn&#x27;t notice it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, but my heels looked much better after just one use.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if you offered discounts for regular purchasers because I will be buying this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth, as far as healing I truly haven&#x27;t seen anything as far as change..</li>
            <li>Make sure you file and cut your nails down as much as possble!</li>
            <li>Toenailsllol better but certainly not cured yet.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with the Purely Northwest Renew Nail treatment as well as the Purely Northwest Anti-fungal soap.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I was amazed that my funky feet were instantly rescued after using this foot soak just the first time!!  </li>
            <li>This stiff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Very nice and soothing for my tired feet.</li>
            <li>After trying many other products, this one is working and the callous is almost gone.</li>
            <li>Other than the smell i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My wife has had a problem with a fungal nail that other remedies just weren&#x27;t touching.</li>
            <li>I am using it mainly for toenail fungus, but it will be awhile before I know if it is beneficial for that purpose, but regardless the soak is very relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this product was so great based off of the reviews, but willing to try anything at this point.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and even better when you have a chest cold!</li>
            <li>I have no had it long enough to know if it works to treat nail fungus, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Not sure just yet how this will work long-term, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The primary reason for doing the foot soak is to treat my feet after a long day of standing and walking on them at book store where i work.</li>
            <li>The bags are kind of small...</li>
            <li>And Purely Northwest very professional.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s working better than any other remedy he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li>but it did smell good, however I wish they would fill up the bag or make the bag a little bigger.</li>
            <li>I have new pics...!</li>
            <li>Cant live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>(so super gross...</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because there was an area under my toenail which I think is fungus since it&#x27;s discolored.</li>
            <li>I also suffer from toe nail fungus and calluses which were the main reasons I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>My feet already look and feel a whole lot better after a few uses.</li>
            <li>We used this foot soak twice a week and it quickly minimized his foot odor and helped with the overall appearance of his feet....</li>
            <li>As soon as I open my last jar I will order more.  </li>
            <li>but i bought it mainly for toenail fungus</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when I run low!</li>
            <li>I am definitely seeing healthy skin tissue start back.</li>
            <li>wonderful, but too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li>As a former martial artist, a carpenter, powerlifter., and someone who&#x27;s also suffered amputations of most of mytoes, my feet are wrecked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only one use, my feet felt so much better and the next morning, all the swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my feet feel very soft and it&#x27;s very relaxing to use.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well to help clear up my son&#x27;s athletes foot!</li>
            <li>This really makes my feet feel soft and relaxed!</li>
            <li>When addressing a nail fungus, it is important to continue treating the nail until it has grown out with new, unaffected nail.  </li>
            <li>My high school senior plays basketball and his feet are taking a pounding.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from hard-to-get-rid-of toenail fungus, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying go to zero, but high blood sugar FEEDS fungus.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i feel that the cost is high for the amount of product received.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this company and their product.</li>
            <li>That being said, I may make this part of an alternating routine as it is helping to clear what looks to be a fungus on my large toenail.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;ll be a while until these toe nails truly resemble the rest of his healthy little partners.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leery purchasing it without knowing more about it</li>
            <li>My toenails look better, my feet are softer and smoother and they smell like little angels have washed them.</li>
            <li>Good product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I really like the foot soak so far.</li>
            <li>She really wants her toe nails to be clear before summer arrives so she can wear flip flops.</li>
            <li>When you finish soaking, your skin feels very refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, in just a few treatments it cleared up the rough skin on my feet, also as a side benefit every time I complete my soak</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has bacteria and fungus destroying properties.</li>
            <li>It removed most of the dead skin and dryness.</li>
            <li>will recommend this product as an effective foot soak, but, unfortunately, not as an effective treatment for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>has worked quite well for purposes designed , feels good on tired feet</li>
            <li>It really loosens dead skin and makes it so easy to slough off.  </li>
            <li>I had a fungus on my smallest toe nail on my right foot and only this foot soak did the trick!!!</li>
            <li>This is so much better than just plain Epsom salt.</li>
            <li>my right big toe</li>
            <li>Great soak, I&#x27;ve been using Epsom in the past but wanting to find a soak that would work on preventing fungus considering that I actively swim and run and therefore always at risk.</li>
            <li>Foot soaking is new me</li>
            <li>I purchased this Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak w/Epson Salt for my husband&#x27;s new foot spa by Kendal #MS0810M.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel like brand new.</li>
            <li>The new bag style doesn&#x27;t reseal so</li>
            <li>Strong smell and overall not a bad product but for the price its rather small.</li>
            <li>and my feet were very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>My feet feel very soft when done</li>
            <li>It have taken more baths this past two weeks than I have in quite a while...</li>
            <li>My 95 year old mother in law has commented (which she never does!)</li>
            <li>Soft feet now!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this about 8 times over the last couple weeks and really like it!</li>
            <li>As usual, I over-ordered too many products and had to decide to return some of them.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used has had the same degree of really obvious, visual evidence that it&#x27;s making things better.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>I have only used 4 times and the difference was seen since the first time.</li>
            <li>My son uses it for ingrown toenails and it helped heal them almost completely!</li>
            <li>The new toe nail is growing in clear.</li>
            <li>I have advanced tendonitis and another minor condition in my left foot and I wear orthotics.</li>
            <li>so treat them special and you won&#x27;t have any regrets!</li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t you smart enough to figure out what that means.</li>
            <li>I bout this from amazon and was a little skeptical, but after saoling my feet for 20 minutes every night my feet are soft and looking great!</li>
            <li>Works great in my foot bath, but stinks up my house when I use it.</li>
            <li>Even though it didn&#x27;t do much for the toenail fungus, would recommend for a relaxing post work routine, and left my feet feeling refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a prescribed medication that basically looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>clear instructions for use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAR up the fungus, but I feel like it IS taming it.</li>
            <li>I saw my nails change into a clear color, as if it was roving the fungal away..</li>
            <li>Helps clear up skin irritations, like athletes feet.</li>
            <li>It is all clear up after a 4 day soak.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and do a lot of bicycle riding.  </li>
            <li>I already have in ready for my next shipment in my Amazon &amp;#34;Save for Later&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li>I will post update and pics of progress once its gone so far 1 week of usage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve nearly depleted my jar.</li>
            <li>(essential oils don&#x27;t), so I hesitate to buy things like this for fear of perfume, but this one is real.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft after using this soak.</li>
            <li>and our feet felt soft and refreshed afterwards</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil directly applied after the soaking.  </li>
            <li>I really wish the bag was bigger, it&#x27;s already almost gone.</li>
            <li>Leaves your feet soft.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Maybe because it&#x27;s a natural, organic alternative it takes longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This foot soak in conjunction with another cream has so far seemed to solve my problem.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too early to tell if if will help with toenail fungus or not, but it won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if my toe nail fungus will improve.</li>
            <li>It leaves them soft and relaxed and raring to go.</li>
            <li>Listerine and vinegar do actually work, but this foot soak really hits the spot and does its job.</li>
            <li>Seems to have worked very well bu nails have not grown back yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using a fancy foot spa just an old tub where i can cover up to my ankles.  </li>
            <li>Although I ultimately returned this product, I really appreciated their customer service follow up.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every over the counter remedy, prescriptions, and old fashion concoctions and nothing has touched the smell.</li>
            <li>Not only does it soften and heal cracked skin, but it appears to also be healing one very stubborn toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>Leaves your feet feeling soft, refreshed and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is busy running around all the time</li>
            <li>I have used it two times so far and can already see a difference in my feet...</li>
            <li>havn,t used it but once so far</li>
            <li>My feet feel so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>My feet get so soft after I soak them in this.</li>
            <li>and wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li>20-30 minutes soaking in this stuff offers me quite a bit of relief.</li>
            <li>When I am done soaking my feet, they are ready for the next step--exfoliating with my Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing, and I&#x27;m hopeful it will lessen the discoloration of my big toes (fungus) over time.</li>
            <li>This soak made my feet soft and helped clear up my toe nail issues, both the ingrown nail and the fungus.</li>
            <li>I only really give it this review because it didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping and</li>
            <li>It worked as a disinfectant and my feet feel so soft after soaking for 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Between the two, the wound has completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I am 28 years old</li>
            <li>Makes your feet really soft</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of expensive for how much you get in the package.</li>
            <li>Nice therapy for tired feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything (except a doctor) off the shelf and several other creams and sprays available on Amazon but up to this point</li>
            <li>After the soak, I then scratch the surface of the nails with a file (I originally filed them down a lot!)</li>
            <li>After attempting other remedies without much success, I started using the Tea Tree Oil foot soak and also</li>
            <li>Add to my foot bath along with yellow Listerine, white vinegar, and hot water.</li>
            <li>Here I am on day 2 &amp; I have such high hopes with</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s feet stink to high heaven and when he soaks them in thus the cease to smell until his next work day.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re trying to fight fungus, I would recommend just using pure tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil and put directly on your feet 2 times daily.</li>
            <li>Much needed relief after long days on my feet, its helping with athletes foot, and seems to be helping with toe fungus</li>
            <li>since the foot massager is not working (hot bath) we are using this product in wet foot soaks without massage and bathing.. works well to help with exfoliation for skin conditions</li>
            <li>I am new to this product and have used several times since receiving.</li>
            <li>Well, after several soaks, he said that the itchyness is gone, and the fungused toe nail had fallen off and is being replaced with a new toenail.</li>
            <li>It smells good, makes my feet soft and makes my cat go crazy running around whenever I use it.  </li>
            <li>The tea-tree oil scented crystals do seem to be knocking back the fungus, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>it has done nothing to kill the toenail fungus, and that was my major concern.  </li>
            <li>Also, it makes your feet really soft, and my chronic mild athelete&#x27;s foot is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago, I&#x27;ve had so many surgeries on my leg that it is difficult to let anything touch it, with that said this foot soak felt wonderful it was cooling and soothed my aches and pain.</li>
            <li>I love this thing but no more than my mom, she uses it every single day.</li>
            <li>boyfriend wears heavy boots to work every day and let&#x27;s just say his feet don&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers!  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will do the trick for me with toenail fungus</li>
            <li>However, it clearly states just that on the back of the container.  </li>
            <li>In a short time, I noticed my feet were considerably smoother.</li>
            <li>Left my feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use twice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it to soak my 95 year old mon&#x27;s feet to help get rid of a thich callous on the side of one big toe aggravated by nail fungus.</li>
            <li>far I  have purchased three packs as I soak my feet twice daily.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say at this time if it will cure the toenail issue, but it certainly is no worse and may be minimally improved after using only a handful of times so far.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your feet so soft, only thing that i have which</li>
            <li>It left her feet soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>No regrets either.  </li>
            <li>It is actually beginning to clear up my toenail fungus and tired feet from working so many</li>
            <li>and now I can bare it all</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve noticed that the toenail is starting to look clearer.</li>
            <li>It so closely mimics my professional pedicure that it can only be described as Pedi Bliss.  </li>
            <li>but im self conscious about smelly body parts and this is a total confidence booster!</li>
            <li>It smells like mint and looks like sea salt, will continue to buy as it helps with tired feet as well :)</li>
            <li>This product will last a very long time and is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>first, it seems to be working on the fungus, and second, the foot I have been soaking is smoother and softer than the other</li>
            <li>No dry skin anymore!</li>
            <li>a little expensive, but works  great.</li>
            <li>This item was given as a gift, and the receiver really likes it, finds it comparable to other brands.  </li>
            <li>It makes my feet feel much better after being on them all day and is helping immensely with how tough my heels</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and my feet really have been softer and callouses less dry and hard -</li>
            <li>His feet come out tingling clean and soft (it is softening the hard cracked heels!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve notice that the the fungus I had one a few toes has really started to clear up</li>
            <li>have used it only once so far and hope it will help a nail fungus I have on my big toe.</li>
            <li>This product is working better for my husband than the expensive prescription foot cream that the podiatrist had him using, plus it makes the feet soft and even exfoliates the heels.  </li>
            <li>This soak does not dry out my skin and it is soothing.</li>
            <li>I walk around a lot while deployed and this product is the first thing I reach for when I get Down time!</li>
            <li>it helps my feet feel soft and relaxed after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>the first few minutes they soak.  </li>
            <li>I also sand them down very well.</li>
            <li>The small round container was much better.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry desert environment in the southwest of Texas, and my feet are constantly cracking (TMI) and</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily 15-20 mins mainly to help clear up a little fungus spot on my big toe along with a topical treatment.</li>
            <li>This spring I dug out the soak, the purple bar to scrub down the callouses, the tub and my sandals, only to realize...that toenail was normal again!  </li>
            <li>I love to soak my tired and dry feet in it!</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of pure tea tree oil and my toenail fungus is disappearing after years of different meds.</li>
            <li>Did help my feet a little to get smooth but dried skin came back after I stopped using.</li>

            <li> far, I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> The problem is that while the product seems to be effective, the suggested use of 2 tbsp per soak at 2 soaks per day means that in close to a week you are in need of more product.  </li>

            <li> It leaves my feet feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> And, it smells so clean!</li>

            <li> Even my husband who really doesn&#x27;t like tea tree oil liked the smell.</li>
            <li> a jar of Lavender for FREE, for my inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using fungus polish, just cheap over the counter.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice foot soak but did absolutely nothing for fungus problem.</li>
            <li> My feet feel fabulously softer.</li>
            <li> Great product that actually produces results.</li>

            <li> My feet look and feel smooth</li>
            <li> My feet are extremely smooth and almost fungus free.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to depend on this to keep smooth.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done soaking, I find it a great time to rub in some actual tea tree oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think everyone should try this item and enjoy the self pampering of taking care of your feet--remember they take you everywhere</li>
            <li> It really works and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product</li>

            <li> It does leave your feet nice and fresh- and the fresh sensation continues for a while.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>

            <li> But overall good product :)</li>
            <li> On the first use this bath salt made my feet feel better and took off an incredible amount of dry skin and brought the circulation to them.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to any one with any kind of foot need or just for normal foot care.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELLING, BABY SOFT FEET, VERY CLEAN FEET, AND NICER HEALTHIER</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this will ultimately do the trick, but the salts are very nice.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this purchase although I don&#x27;t think it would treat nail fungus properly but it does make my feet feel better</li>

            <li> Smells great, which helps you relax after a long day.</li>
            <li> This is worth your investment!</li>
            <li> My nails showed significant improvement after just one use.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, soft feet.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my tea tree oil, it arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but if it works.. it&#x27;ll be worth it!</li>
            <li> Feels great to soak your feet after a long day of being on your feet.</li>
            <li> but it is great after a long day to put your feet in and relax.</li>
            <li> Be sure to consistently use.</li>
            <li> and if I see a significant change I will update this post.</li>
            <li> it is a nice product if you want it as a normal foot soak and bc</li>
            <li> Can use to clean anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel fresh and it is so easy to pedicure my nails after the soak.</li>
            <li> I bought a special bucket and the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing &amp; my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li> my feet are still in pretty good shape as far as roughness.  </li>
            <li> Before this tea tree oil, I had tried everything under the sun, including sprays and creams -- both natural and otc with minor results at best.</li>
            <li> My feet love this stuff, it takes about 10 minutes to feel the effects and another 10 until you feet say thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would really reccomemd it.</li>
            <li> Very energizing n refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> But the thought of not being able to get rid of nail fungus entirely really scared me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves it so much I had to buy her 4 more</li>
            <li> I mix a spoon full in a glass and dilute it and then add to the water massager.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but it felt so good.</li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> But I gave this a shot because I love it so much, and it truly works.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in this tree oil.</li>
            <li> I use it after working out to cool and relieve my tootsies.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your fantastic service!</li>
            <li> I love it so much I told my mom and friends</li>
            <li> Combined with warm water, this leaves my aching feet feeling refreshed and soft, not to mention the medicinal affect the oil has.  </li>

            <li> This smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and my feet are fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even found a lotion that seems to work as well or as quickly as this foot soak.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to notice the color change on my toe nail yet, but I can definitely tell you that my feet feel better.</li>

            <li> Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> The most notable improvements have been the easing of my nerve pain and the virtual elimination of calluses, especially in the heel areas.</li>
            <li> I am treating for mild case of toe fungus along with an antifungal brush on treatment and it seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li> It only takes about 2 teaspoons per treatment, definetely satisfied with purchase and plan on buying more after this jar I&#x27;d finished.</li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> He loved the smell, the oils loosened up dirt and gunk, and with a gentle scrubbing with a washcloth his feet were soft and fresh-smelling.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to help get rid of some toenail fungus I seemed to have picked up while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I read about the product but didn&#x27;t see anything that mentioned that it should not be used by women to are pregnant or nursing.  </li>
            <li> My toenails are looking so much better, Even my shoes feel better, especially now in the summer when I&#x27;m not wearing socks.</li>
            <li> Works awesome in foot baths especially the deep foot baths that heat the water.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes feet feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> It also has made my Alligator feet soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.  </li>
            <li> Arrives quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, make my feet very soft!</li>
            <li> Would be highly upset if I got two more that weren&#x27;t sealed!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot soak, it leaves my feet feeling rejuvenated, My podiatrist said my feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;ve been using this &#x27;magic sauce&#x27; powder for about a week now, and I notice a clear reduction in both how much feet sweat and consequently smell.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a good soak after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time!</li>
            <li> no jets, no massages, just holds a lot of hot water!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it again as I am running out of my first one!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> An absolute must have!!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like because I wanted something that had more of a tea tree oil fragrance but after multiple soaks I do indeed like the product!  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference from the first use!  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great for facilitating dead skin removal with an exfoliating cloth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was amazing.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much in order to enjoy the aromatic aspects of this product.</li>
            <li> Although I have used only 1 time, this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This soak is well worth the price</li>
            <li> My feet definitely look better and feel fantastic afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot at $17.00 for a bag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Order this product, then order a nice _SIMPLE_ bucket.  </li>
            <li> Leaves feet feet feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My feet are now fresh and don&#x27;t repel my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Also makes the room smell so fresh afterwards</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey for the tiny bag.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been soaking now for 2 weeks and thus far his toe nails look a lot more acceptable.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and my feet are soft, wish the bag was larger for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but  was more than pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this mixture.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I have to do my own pedicure...</li>
            <li> It gives really-really tired feet an excellent relief.</li>
            <li> So far my feet look a lot better</li>
            <li> Took 20 minutes to myself and it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> love it so far.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected, and the company contacted me to make sure we were satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> Once my product was delivered to my house, I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> * like this stuff is helping--it&#x27;s dissolving the fungus right off my skin</li>
            <li> now I wanted to jump on this right away and prevent any fungus from growing.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your feet feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a foot soak bucket filled with warm water to cover my feet up to my ankles, and a tablespoon and a half of the mixture for twenty (20) minutes.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended and will definitely buy more!</li>

            <li> I love this product, it absolutely take great care of my tired feet.</li>

            <li> and she loves it in general (on top of the fungus treatment).</li>
            <li> My feet feel great after the salt bath and hopefully clears my nail fungus that I been treating for the past year.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s nice to treat not the fungus but yourself to a worm foot bath after a long day .</li>
            <li> After a long day of abusing my feet at work and the gym, nothing beats a nice foot soak with Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> I use it at home after a long day or sometimes my own pedicure pretreatment.</li>
            <li> and my feet feel relaxed and refreshed after a nice long soak.  </li>
            <li> after a busy day there is nothing better than to relax my feet in a tea tree oil foot soak from purely northwest</li>
            <li> The new nail is free of fungus.</li>
            <li> The end results are feet that look and feel super clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing, arrived quickly.</li>

            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> She plays soccer and her feet are often wet and in dark enclosed socks and shoes which (we learned) is a perfect breeding ground for fungus.  </li>
            <li> so we can really see my progress!</li>
            <li> It is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Epsom salts</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I also make sure to wear opened toed shoes as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Finally got a chance to use this and it was a soothing to my feet as told in many reviews, wish it came in bulk portions.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many scents, especially floral.  </li>
            <li> First product that I have used that&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are so glad to finally find a product that is helping him.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> The combination of the products and the salt is exactly what I would like in a foot soak.  </li>

            <li> I got this for my Dad, who really needed it!  </li>
            <li> He says it is making a world of difference and has thanked me several times for getting it for him. :)</li>
            <li> Long term effectiveness on foot health and anti-fungal properties has yet to be tested, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak!!</li>
            <li> At first i thought since i should just give it some time</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, get rid of your sugar intake.</li>
            <li> Going to reorder as soon as possible, Love this product.</li>
            <li> He really likes the fresh feeling after a soak.</li>
            <li> and I must say, WOW my feet are now so smooth,</li>
            <li> I had to use a bucket and dissolve the salt first because the Spa model I have says \\&quot;water only\\&quot;, but once I did it, this stuff literally did exactly what it said it did.</li>
            <li> Actually felt better on the first try.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying it next :)</li>
            <li> It did however leave my feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as we needed it too.</li>
            <li> Our whole family LOVES THIS!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s looking better after only a couple of soaks.</li>
            <li> If only for this, I am pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell it helps any more than regular epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the anti fungal wash &amp; topical treatment to treat a toenail fungus on one toe, I know it will take more time to see results from the regimen I am using</li>
            <li> As described, has a distinctive scent that you need to be aware of.</li>
            <li> This is absolute wonderfulness in a jar!</li>
            <li> (boy time passes fast when youre on your ipad!)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and suffer from neuropathy and foot pain (swelling) and noticed a difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> very powerful for a natural product.</li>
            <li> I also very much appreciated the thoughtful follow up email from this very professional seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to soak my feet for the last week and so far love it!  </li>
            <li> Makes my tired, sore feet feel so good!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s truly having an effect on the fungus, but we are very optimistic that this soak is playing a huge part.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay closed properly, but the product itself it great.</li>
            <li> Leaves feet feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My feet feel so clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel really clean and soft after soaking.</li>
            <li> and it does what it says,  heals,  soft,  clean smell.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my feet, especially my heels, sooo soft and smelling so nice.  </li>
            <li> Can get similar for much cheaper and in greater quantity at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> already and ready to order some more just wish they came in bigger bags.</li>
            <li> My feet feel smooth and soft afterwards and  it is also very energizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for the past few weeks and am extremely satisfied with the way my feet feel after a good soak!  </li>
            <li> It appears to be having a positive effect on the nail.  </li>
            <li> and i look forward to seeing positive affects over time.</li>
            <li> I got this bc of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this I recommend using it every day with hot water if you really want to get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> I think that, so long as I keep this up, the nail will grow a healthy nail and the fungus</li>
            <li> Really makes your feet feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Using this to soak my feet, Then using Amazing herbs Black Seed oil to moisturize.</li>
            <li> But an added benefit I discovered is the super callus softening that the mixture offers.</li>
            <li> I had early signs of a mild nail fungus and this cleared it up immediately.</li>
            <li> I use this with a foot spa and can honestly say it&#x27;s transformed my previously Hobbit like feet.</li>
            <li> and my feet started to clear up from a mild fungal infection that I had.</li>
            <li> I filled a bucket w/ hot water, added this tea tree oil, added apple cider vinegar, and let my feet soak while I played games on steam for ~30 minutes daily.</li>
            <li> It does burn a teensie bit on little cracked or rough areas on the feet, but that passes, and your footsies feel great afterward---clean and cool.</li>
            <li> I follow up by rubbing 100% pure tea tree oil on my feet and nails.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have been living with this fungus under my large toenails forever</li>
            <li> so adding it to epsom salts is a pure bonus...</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might have been a bit of athletes foot developing, but this certainly helped to keep my feet feeling and smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purely Northwest is always there for you</li>
            <li> After the very first use my feet were totally soft.</li>
            <li> Is a bet miss leading when it says it will help with fungas when the fine print tells you that you need to purchase extra meds to help with that.</li>
            <li> If not - how in the hell did you make such a fine product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do?</li>
            <li> definitely was pleased with it and is helping so far!</li>
            <li> It will hold the water just fine and have enough room for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The container has a clever bottom, so it can&#x27;t tip over!</li>
            <li> Thanks Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li> Other than give a unique clean feeling after I used it, it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing combination of salts- takes out all callus and dead skin--</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for a few weeks and it has made my feet feel great, softened the skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet pretty much all day at work, and it&#x27;s concrete</li>
            <li> It has a cleansing smell &amp; works very well.</li>

            <li> I am also treating toenail fungus with straight tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> If I reorder I will still have to buy, yet another, product I don&#x27;t really need to amount to the $35 in order to prevent paying s/h again.</li>
            <li> Now my feet do not sweat as much and do not stink at the end of the day.</li>

            <li> I do use moisturizers and a pumice scrub after each soak, which does speed up the healing process, but adding this soak to my regimen has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> he was using tea tree oil and the smell was too much for me</li>

            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that my funky feet were instantly rescued after using this foot soak just the first time!!  </li>
            <li> This stiff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soothing for my tired feet.</li>
            <li> After trying many other products, this one is working and the callous is almost gone.</li>

            <li> My wife has had a problem with a fungal nail that other remedies just weren&#x27;t touching.</li>
            <li> I am using it mainly for toenail fungus, but it will be awhile before I know if it is beneficial for that purpose, but regardless the soak is very relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product was so great based off of the reviews, but willing to try anything at this point.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and even better when you have a chest cold!</li>
            <li> I have no had it long enough to know if it works to treat nail fungus, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Not sure just yet how this will work long-term, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The primary reason for doing the foot soak is to treat my feet after a long day of standing and walking on them at book store where i work.</li>
            <li> The bags are kind of small...</li>
            <li> And Purely Northwest very professional.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s working better than any other remedy he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li> but it did smell good, however I wish they would fill up the bag or make the bag a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I have new pics...!</li>
            <li> Cant live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> (so super gross...</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because there was an area under my toenail which I think is fungus since it&#x27;s discolored.</li>
            <li> I also suffer from toe nail fungus and calluses which were the main reasons I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> My feet already look and feel a whole lot better after a few uses.</li>
            <li> We used this foot soak twice a week and it quickly minimized his foot odor and helped with the overall appearance of his feet....</li>
            <li> As soon as I open my last jar I will order more.  </li>
            <li> but i bought it mainly for toenail fungus</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more when I run low!</li>
            <li> I am definitely seeing healthy skin tissue start back.</li>
            <li> wonderful, but too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li> As a former martial artist, a carpenter, powerlifter., and someone who&#x27;s also suffered amputations of most of mytoes, my feet are wrecked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only one use, my feet felt so much better and the next morning, all the swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel very soft and it&#x27;s very relaxing to use.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well to help clear up my son&#x27;s athletes foot!</li>
            <li> This really makes my feet feel soft and relaxed!</li>
            <li> When addressing a nail fungus, it is important to continue treating the nail until it has grown out with new, unaffected nail.  </li>
            <li> My high school senior plays basketball and his feet are taking a pounding.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from hard-to-get-rid-of toenail fungus, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying go to zero, but high blood sugar FEEDS fungus.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i feel that the cost is high for the amount of product received.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this company and their product.</li>
            <li> That being said, I may make this part of an alternating routine as it is helping to clear what looks to be a fungus on my large toenail.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;ll be a while until these toe nails truly resemble the rest of his healthy little partners.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery purchasing it without knowing more about it</li>
            <li> My toenails look better, my feet are softer and smoother and they smell like little angels have washed them.</li>
            <li> Good product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like the foot soak so far.</li>
            <li> She really wants her toe nails to be clear before summer arrives so she can wear flip flops.</li>
            <li> When you finish soaking, your skin feels very refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, in just a few treatments it cleared up the rough skin on my feet, also as a side benefit every time I complete my soak</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has bacteria and fungus destroying properties.</li>
            <li> It removed most of the dead skin and dryness.</li>
            <li> will recommend this product as an effective foot soak, but, unfortunately, not as an effective treatment for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> has worked quite well for purposes designed , feels good on tired feet</li>
            <li> It really loosens dead skin and makes it so easy to slough off.  </li>
            <li> I had a fungus on my smallest toe nail on my right foot and only this foot soak did the trick!!!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than just plain Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> my right big toe</li>
            <li> Great soak, I&#x27;ve been using Epsom in the past but wanting to find a soak that would work on preventing fungus considering that I actively swim and run and therefore always at risk.</li>
            <li> Foot soaking is new me</li>
            <li> I purchased this Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak w/Epson Salt for my husband&#x27;s new foot spa by Kendal #MS0810M.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel like brand new.</li>
            <li> The new bag style doesn&#x27;t reseal so</li>
            <li> Strong smell and overall not a bad product but for the price its rather small.</li>
            <li> and my feet were very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> My feet feel very soft when done</li>
            <li> It have taken more baths this past two weeks than I have in quite a while...</li>
            <li> My 95 year old mother in law has commented (which she never does!)</li>
            <li> Soft feet now!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 8 times over the last couple weeks and really like it!</li>
            <li> As usual, I over-ordered too many products and had to decide to return some of them.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used has had the same degree of really obvious, visual evidence that it&#x27;s making things better.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> I have only used 4 times and the difference was seen since the first time.</li>
            <li> My son uses it for ingrown toenails and it helped heal them almost completely!</li>
            <li> The new toe nail is growing in clear.</li>
            <li> I have advanced tendonitis and another minor condition in my left foot and I wear orthotics.</li>
            <li> so treat them special and you won&#x27;t have any regrets!</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t you smart enough to figure out what that means.</li>
            <li> I bout this from amazon and was a little skeptical, but after saoling my feet for 20 minutes every night my feet are soft and looking great!</li>
            <li> Works great in my foot bath, but stinks up my house when I use it.</li>
            <li> Even though it didn&#x27;t do much for the toenail fungus, would recommend for a relaxing post work routine, and left my feet feeling refreshed and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a prescribed medication that basically looks like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> clear instructions for use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAR up the fungus, but I feel like it IS taming it.</li>
            <li> I saw my nails change into a clear color, as if it was roving the fungal away..</li>
            <li> Helps clear up skin irritations, like athletes feet.</li>
            <li> It is all clear up after a 4 day soak.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and do a lot of bicycle riding.  </li>
            <li> I already have in ready for my next shipment in my Amazon &amp;#34;Save for Later&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> I will post update and pics of progress once its gone so far 1 week of usage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nearly depleted my jar.</li>
            <li> (essential oils don&#x27;t), so I hesitate to buy things like this for fear of perfume, but this one is real.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft after using this soak.</li>
            <li> and our feet felt soft and refreshed afterwards</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil directly applied after the soaking.  </li>
            <li> I really wish the bag was bigger, it&#x27;s already almost gone.</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet soft.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s a natural, organic alternative it takes longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This foot soak in conjunction with another cream has so far seemed to solve my problem.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too early to tell if if will help with toenail fungus or not, but it won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if my toe nail fungus will improve.</li>
            <li> It leaves them soft and relaxed and raring to go.</li>
            <li> Listerine and vinegar do actually work, but this foot soak really hits the spot and does its job.</li>
            <li> Seems to have worked very well bu nails have not grown back yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using a fancy foot spa just an old tub where i can cover up to my ankles.  </li>
            <li> Although I ultimately returned this product, I really appreciated their customer service follow up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every over the counter remedy, prescriptions, and old fashion concoctions and nothing has touched the smell.</li>
            <li> Not only does it soften and heal cracked skin, but it appears to also be healing one very stubborn toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet feeling soft, refreshed and relaxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is busy running around all the time</li>
            <li> I have used it two times so far and can already see a difference in my feet...</li>
            <li> havn,t used it but once so far</li>
            <li> My feet feel so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> My feet get so soft after I soak them in this.</li>
            <li> and wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> 20-30 minutes soaking in this stuff offers me quite a bit of relief.</li>
            <li> When I am done soaking my feet, they are ready for the next step--exfoliating with my Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing, and I&#x27;m hopeful it will lessen the discoloration of my big toes (fungus) over time.</li>
            <li> This soak made my feet soft and helped clear up my toe nail issues, both the ingrown nail and the fungus.</li>
            <li> I only really give it this review because it didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping and</li>
            <li> It worked as a disinfectant and my feet feel so soft after soaking for 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Between the two, the wound has completely healed.  </li>
            <li> I am 28 years old</li>
            <li> Makes your feet really soft</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of expensive for how much you get in the package.</li>
            <li> Nice therapy for tired feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything (except a doctor) off the shelf and several other creams and sprays available on Amazon but up to this point</li>
            <li> After the soak, I then scratch the surface of the nails with a file (I originally filed them down a lot!)</li>
            <li> After attempting other remedies without much success, I started using the Tea Tree Oil foot soak and also</li>
            <li> Add to my foot bath along with yellow Listerine, white vinegar, and hot water.</li>
            <li> Here I am on day 2 &amp; I have such high hopes with</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feet stink to high heaven and when he soaks them in thus the cease to smell until his next work day.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re trying to fight fungus, I would recommend just using pure tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil and put directly on your feet 2 times daily.</li>
            <li> Much needed relief after long days on my feet, its helping with athletes foot, and seems to be helping with toe fungus</li>
            <li> since the foot massager is not working (hot bath) we are using this product in wet foot soaks without massage and bathing.. works well to help with exfoliation for skin conditions</li>
            <li> I am new to this product and have used several times since receiving.</li>
            <li> Well, after several soaks, he said that the itchyness is gone, and the fungused toe nail had fallen off and is being replaced with a new toenail.</li>
            <li> It smells good, makes my feet soft and makes my cat go crazy running around whenever I use it.  </li>
            <li> The tea-tree oil scented crystals do seem to be knocking back the fungus, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> it has done nothing to kill the toenail fungus, and that was my major concern.  </li>
            <li> Also, it makes your feet really soft, and my chronic mild athelete&#x27;s foot is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago, I&#x27;ve had so many surgeries on my leg that it is difficult to let anything touch it, with that said this foot soak felt wonderful it was cooling and soothed my aches and pain.</li>
            <li> I love this thing but no more than my mom, she uses it every single day.</li>
            <li> boyfriend wears heavy boots to work every day and let&#x27;s just say his feet don&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers!  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will do the trick for me with toenail fungus</li>
            <li> However, it clearly states just that on the back of the container.  </li>
            <li> In a short time, I noticed my feet were considerably smoother.</li>
            <li> Left my feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use twice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it to soak my 95 year old mon&#x27;s feet to help get rid of a thich callous on the side of one big toe aggravated by nail fungus.</li>
            <li> far I  have purchased three packs as I soak my feet twice daily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say at this time if it will cure the toenail issue, but it certainly is no worse and may be minimally improved after using only a handful of times so far.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your feet so soft, only thing that i have which</li>
            <li> It left her feet soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> No regrets either.  </li>
            <li> It is actually beginning to clear up my toenail fungus and tired feet from working so many</li>
            <li> and now I can bare it all</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve noticed that the toenail is starting to look clearer.</li>
            <li> It so closely mimics my professional pedicure that it can only be described as Pedi Bliss.  </li>
            <li> but im self conscious about smelly body parts and this is a total confidence booster!</li>
            <li> It smells like mint and looks like sea salt, will continue to buy as it helps with tired feet as well :)</li>
            <li> This product will last a very long time and is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> first, it seems to be working on the fungus, and second, the foot I have been soaking is smoother and softer than the other</li>
            <li> No dry skin anymore!</li>
            <li> a little expensive, but works  great.</li>
            <li> This item was given as a gift, and the receiver really likes it, finds it comparable to other brands.  </li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel much better after being on them all day and is helping immensely with how tough my heels</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and my feet really have been softer and callouses less dry and hard -</li>
            <li> His feet come out tingling clean and soft (it is softening the hard cracked heels!)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice that the the fungus I had one a few toes has really started to clear up</li>
            <li> have used it only once so far and hope it will help a nail fungus I have on my big toe.</li>
            <li> This product is working better for my husband than the expensive prescription foot cream that the podiatrist had him using, plus it makes the feet soft and even exfoliates the heels.  </li>
            <li> This soak does not dry out my skin and it is soothing.</li>
            <li> I walk around a lot while deployed and this product is the first thing I reach for when I get Down time!</li>
            <li> it helps my feet feel soft and relaxed after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> the first few minutes they soak.  </li>
            <li> I also sand them down very well.</li>
            <li> The small round container was much better.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry desert environment in the southwest of Texas, and my feet are constantly cracking (TMI) and</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily 15-20 mins mainly to help clear up a little fungus spot on my big toe along with a topical treatment.</li>
            <li> This spring I dug out the soak, the purple bar to scrub down the callouses, the tub and my sandals, only to realize...that toenail was normal again!  </li>
            <li> I love to soak my tired and dry feet in it!</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of pure tea tree oil and my toenail fungus is disappearing after years of different meds.</li>
            <li> Did help my feet a little to get smooth but dried skin came back after I stopped using.</li>
            <li> This product is basically the same as Renew Nail Treatment, if you want a product that just smells good then this would be it outside of that it is a useless waste of money.</li>
            <li> Of you&#x27;re looking to take care of any of your foot issues then look no further, Tea Tree Oil is not only affordable but it is quite potent on stubborn nail fungus and other such issues that are otherwise tough to treat.</li>
            <li> I particularly found helpful simple advice on bag: 1) eliminate socks; 2) stick with it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad feet and was really hoping this would help with calluses but after 3 weeks I don&#x27;t see much improvement.  </li>
            <li> My 11-year old daughter has toe fungus in on both feet - two toes on one foot and three toes on the other.</li>
            <li> My tired feet after a long day feel revived and free of impurities after a 20-30 minute soak</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to know what difference it will make overall but the product seems to work as described.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of it on one of my toenails, haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if it works.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if it is making a difference with getting rid of my toenail fungus.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know yet if it helps eliminate nail fungus .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using long enough.</li>
            <li> I see clear fluid moving around under nail where dark color WAS!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how well it works for that; but I did have exceptionally dry feet before regular use.</li>
            <li> VERY strong (somewhat unpleasant) smell though</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times and then took the advice of some of the other reviews and filed down the nails with fungus to a normal thickness.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the aroma, but, sadly nothing else.</li>
            <li> Soothing and helps my feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> I must admit...as long as you are in a well ventilated room...</li>
            <li> This makes my feet feel really soft for a few days</li>
            <li> and though I still have some callouses and rough spots on the heel I believe overall it is improving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male retired Navy Veteran that has had some nagging itching on the ends of a few of my toes that has lasted several month.</li>
            <li> After a soak, I can actually remove the offending callus with a rough towel.</li>
            <li> You have to be prepared to continue treating the nail for as long as it takes until the nail grows out.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used to too long yet</li>
            <li> This is my go to after a long day.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product, after using it for several weeks, I can not see any improvement on my feet, it is kind of bath salt product, but it is experience as it has no effect on fungal nail.</li>
            <li> This stuff in hot water is actually soothing for tired feet.  </li>
            <li> The first pack that I bought is down to less than half as I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil and other essential oils for years.</li>
            <li> It started on one toe, then moved to the same toe on the other foot.  </li>
            <li> Treat for a long day on your feet!</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s ok to wear flip flops in public, no more scary toes.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products for nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other things with no lasting progress.  </li>
            <li> I now see that the yellowness is concentrated in the middle of the nail where the solution probably has a hard time penetrating, so this will clear up when the nail grows.</li>
            <li> I have really dry feet</li>
            <li> My feet were dry and at night they felt like they were burning and itching.  </li>
            <li> My feet are no longer dry and itching.  </li>
            <li> Product is soothing and healing to my dry heals.  </li>
            <li> feet feeling tingling and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Helps if you suffer from cracked dry feet.</li>
            <li> Both my feet and my bf&#x27;s feet get dry and itchy after working all day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any troublesome foot conditions such as athlete&#x27;s foot, so I can&#x27;t comment on its effect there, but my feet are softer as a result of only a few soaks.</li>
            <li> As far as fungus treatment not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will completely get rid of it, but helps nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I add a tablespoon of the oil soak to each bath and use it nightly, and the cracking, dry skin, splitting heels, etc., are all gone!</li>
            <li> I soak my feet one daily and my pain is less.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars for now because I have only used it for a few days but my heels are already softer!</li>
            <li> for rough dry feet, this is an A+ product.</li>
            <li> Because I have some strangely placed calluses following foot surgeries for neuromas and bunions, I need someway to remove the part of the callus that is causing pain without leaving the area raw and unprotected.</li>
            <li> but you get a little over a week out of each bag if you only do one treatment per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with no real success.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and some times my feet really hurt, especially if I wear the wrong shoes.  </li>
            <li> it also helps shed rough calaused skin under my feet.</li>
            <li> I felt no difference, didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> This is very soothing to tired and abused feet.</li>
            <li> There is some clearing of the yellowness although not much.</li>
            <li> You have to stick with it everyday, but after YEARS, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> As a dude, I am not really into fru fru stuff, but this stuff rocks.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Also helps with rough skin on heels.</li>
            <li> Will followup after the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> The item was packed well and delivered on time as expected.</li>
            <li> All gave temporary relief for only few days.  </li>
            <li> I would certainty recommend this product for anyone with rough feet.  </li>
            <li> In a weeks time it cleared up my daughter&#x27;s feet that were cracked, itchy and showing signs of athletes foot from wearing wet boots.</li>
            <li> I use this when my feet are really tired and they/me need a pick me up, this soak really does the job.  </li>
            <li> I soak my feet every few days to combat my pesky barefoot habits and I&#x27;ve noticed that within a few weeks that the cracks and fissures in my calluses have begun to heal, some of them are completely gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if one or the other, or the combination is helping to clear it up</li>
            <li> I was concerned the tea tree smell might be strong or unpleasant, but found that it&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never really done anything other than apply lotion until now.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel I have used it long enough since the fungus is so hard to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Softening my feet equals less aches from dry skin etc.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this product so one jar will last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> And then it spread to other toes...</li>
            <li> I have tried other things and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with other things.  </li>
            <li> I use the soak every other day.</li>
            <li> This is a continuation of the other review.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly due to nail/foot fungus.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product also helped me relax due to</li>
            <li> I now use it every other night.  </li>
            <li> I now use it every other night</li>
            <li> all the time, my wife would tell me that I would even scratch in my sleep, and after the second day, no more itchy feet...</li>
            <li> am trying to use it every other day</li>
            <li> I soak until the waters cold and when I&#x27;m done my feet tingle, feel cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this to get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot, let me share with you some other tips.</li>
            <li> I have never used a foot soak until just the other day</li>
            <li> However, I have used Dr. Teal&#x27;s other products:  Soaking Solution/w/Rosemary &amp; Mint, Foot cream w/shea butter</li>
            <li> This stuff kick all the other products&#x27; butt.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again, and consider the company&#x27;s other items.</li>
            <li> Gives me an excuse to sit down and relax!!</li>
            <li> We clip the dark nail as it grows out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the quantity of product received.</li>
            <li> on average I walk 4 miles a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dry &amp; cracked feet with peeling skin for years and have used all types of lotions without any success, self-conscious about baring my feet or wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything to control toe nail fungus, but the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak seems to have it under slowed down.  </li>
            <li> Other than a little bit of discoloration at the end of my toenail, it is all but gone.  </li>
            <li> The smell is just like tea tree oil and if using in the tub, be careful as it will get slick due to the oils.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days together with other nail renew treatment.</li>
            <li> If you are kept up by the stench of Vick&#x27;s I recommend reading &amp;#34;Dirklus&amp;#34; -- the prologue is crap, but the book is fun!!</li>
            <li> and then I could not have cared less how my feet looked.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in how my feet look and feel in less than one week of use.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is also an local antiseptic that heals the common everyday ailments of the feet and epsom salt relieves the body of pain and addresses any stress in the body.</li>
            <li> and my toe fungus is already turning black and disappearing after I file the black part off.</li>
            <li> So much less money than tube or spray month after month from drugstores.</li>
            <li> I soak for about a half an hour, at night, while watching TV.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said i didn&#x27;t have fungus issue, but i know that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it might have a little catnip in the mix.  </li>
            <li> but it seems a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey</li>
            <li> My husband wear work boots all day and his feet tends to be a little smelly...</li>
            <li> I am noticing a little change on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now going to take a little time</li>
            <li> This product works, it helped me with my foot was hard and very dry.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and although it does tell you the size, it was a lot smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Dried cracked skin</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and use it two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> but I do have foot odor, using this a few nights a week instead of the foot powder keeps it at bay quite well.</li>
            <li> The toenail fungus I have harbored for two years has gone away and I have used the soak for just a few months, 4 nights a week or so.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s year round.</li>
            <li> You get used to it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It will probably take a few months to see if it helps in this area.</li>
            <li> Use everyday and I have the prettiest feet ever.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is one of the few homeopathic remedies that works every time.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t faithful about soaking his feet and toes but he has seen an improvement even with what few times he has used it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago</li>
            <li> Definitely a must if you have tired, achy feet.</li>
            <li> of our stiff feet come out of the bath without that stiffness.</li>
            <li> May as well just use plain water.  </li>
            <li> Have just started using a foot bath spa, and had used plain epsom salts in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth what I paid for!!</li>
            <li> I have had a little teo nail fungus and even after a week I see a difference!</li>
            <li> My nails feel stronger and my feet which could sometimes be a little stinky from being cooped up in boots all day haven&#x27;t be stinky at all!</li>
            <li> The other way, believe it or not, VICKS VAPOR rub every night on your stank feet!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if its even doing anything.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is helping the fungus yet</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I usually soak for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on fungus or anything like that</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about eliminating nail fungus or athletes foot</li>
            <li> the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak product and reminding me of their 45 day refund policy if not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I would have soaked my feet in epsom salt, then apply tea tree oil medicinally to heal my athlete&#x27;s foot problems.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works well although I used it for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> After using this soak for just a few days I was noticing it was disappearing!</li>
            <li> But I am really disappointed in the size of the bag for how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very stiff menthol smell.  </li>
            <li> It really is hard to put into words.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had hard, scaly feet</li>
            <li> I have toenail fungus on four toes and have had a really hard time getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> Hard  </li>
            <li> Some times I can hardly walk.  </li>
            <li> My husband is using it for his very dry and troubled feet.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that my elderly mother had developed a bad case of foot fungus.  </li>
            <li> She soaks 1-2 times per day for at least 20 mins.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use the product since the jar wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I soak my feet at least once a week</li>
            <li> At least for me it did.  </li>
            <li> I plan on doing a foot soak at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I feel it helps with toenail fungus--at least, I hope so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slow process for nails.</li>
            <li> Slow results</li>
            <li> thick skin calouses are going away and cracks in skin has healed.  </li>
            <li> it works for toenail fungus, but slowly.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for bad feet as well, as my husband has feet that not getting tired, they are all &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; etc.</li>
            <li> If you have funky feet you seriously need to try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious about getting rid of this.</li>
            <li> plus I add a couple of drops of the oil to the nail cuticles on both my ugly big toes...</li>
            <li> I had some foot fungus on the bottom of my toes that was pretty nasty (yellow stains on socks/feet smelling really bad).</li>
            <li> My grandson plays soccer and after a tough game his feet hurt.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband who works as a chef and struggles with tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li> and my nails have stayed thin.</li>
            <li> hate feet but am starting to turn that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>
            <li> My feet weren&#x27;t in bad shape, so I don&#x27;t know if it works on all the other foot problems.</li>
            <li> Thought it was expensive and was having buyers remorse until we used it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I fractured my shoulder at the job</li>
            <li> Just wish it was not so expensive...</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, no result.  </li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak with Epsom Salt is too time consuming and expensive.</li>
            <li> Softens and invigorates tired feet!</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help me with my foot fungus problem.</li>
            <li> But I found the packaging with the zip-lock useless.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive for the amount</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because the smell was so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> Use it once a day for about 15-20 minutes or until the water gets cold up to you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product to use in a foot spa!</li>
            <li> Good stuff here. My nails are getting cleared up nicely! The fungus had set in on every toe nail and two finger nails. This in conjunction with Fungus Stop has had great results in only 10 days of treatment.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot soak I have ever used.  Makes my feet feel tingly the first few minutes they soak.  The end results are feet that look and feel super clean and soft.  I use 1 1/2 tablespoon and that is sufficient for a nice foot bath.  I will continue to use this product and already purchased a second bag so I would not run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product, make my feet very soft! The smell is a little strong but overall a great product</li>
            <li> I love this good in my foot spa and has an aromatherapy effect</li>
            <li> It works great, my feet feel good after the soak and I  noticed a change with my toenail fungus after the first day. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love it! Thought it was expensive and was having buyers remorse until we used it. It&#x27;s amazing! Smells and feels great. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product, after using it for several weeks, I can not see any improvement on my feet, it is kind of bath salt product, but it is experience as it has no effect on fungal nail. Bad purchased. Will not purchase it any more.</li>
            <li> Just got it, but it appears to work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t treat fungus , but it helps to keep your feet nice and taken care of . Plus it&#x27;s nice to treat not the fungus but yourself to a worm foot bath after a long day . Smells nice and fresh also . Thinking about getting it as a gift to my girlfriend .</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful for my sisters feet and toe fungus issues that she has had!  I highly recommend this product along with the Purely Northwest Renew Nail treatment as well as the Purely Northwest Anti-fungal soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and do a lot of bicycle riding.  Dried cracked skin (foot fungus I think) over the winter left my feet in need of care. The soaks softened the skin and healed the cracks. I&#x27;m back on the bike doing 40 to 70 mile rides without foot discomfort. My feet love this stuff, it takes about 10 minutes to feel the effects and another 10 until you feet say thanks.</li>
            <li> Not only does the Tea Tree Oil soothe my aching feet after standing for the better part of the day, it smells great! My feet feel softer and refreshed after a nice, 30 minute soak!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and conpany</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  It smells wonderful and is very soothing.  My high school senior plays basketball and his feet are taking a pounding.  He is using this every day now that it is basketball season.  I am re-ordering this.</li>
            <li> On the first use this bath salt made my feet feel better and took off an incredible amount of dry skin and brought the circulation to them. I would strongly recommend this to any one with any kind of foot need or just for normal foot care.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and use it two or three times a week. In a short time, I noticed my feet were considerably smoother. I haven&#x27;t even found a lotion that seems to work as well or as quickly as this foot soak. I was concerned the tea tree smell might be strong or unpleasant, but found that it&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and my feet really have been softer and callouses less dry and hard - I do recommend this product even though it is a bit pricey. I already have in ready for my next shipment in my Amazon &amp;#34;Save for Later&amp;#34; .  I will also try the Lavendar.</li>
            <li> My wife had fallen in love on the first use. If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy. Wonderful product. Noticeable difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, love it. Soothing and helps my feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> Incredibly soothing and helpful to sore feet. Feet feel refreshed immensely over just the Epsom salt soak. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working to treat fungus.  Best for skin.  Slow process for nails.</li>
            <li> This, along with my Inomata Foot Detox Massage Spa bucket makes for VERY happy feet!</li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel clean and fresh.  It has not been effective against my toenail fungus.  It is expensive.  I would like to buy locally in much larger quantities at lower cost per pound.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil foot soak is truly amazing! After soaking my foot in it the first time I&#x27;ve noticed results. It not only feels like its working its way thru your skin it also helps shed rough calaused skin under my feet. My feet are soft and smooth. I love this product and would really reccomemd it. Although I&#x27;ll keep an update when the fungus has gone away, but be advised although this product fights fungal infection from the outside you&#x27;ve also got to fight it from the inside so eat antibacterial foods like garlic, anyways the product smells great and leaves under my feet feeling awsome</li>
            <li> This is a very nice foot soak.  It smells good, makes my feet soft and makes my cat go crazy running around whenever I use it.  I wonder if it might have a little catnip in the mix.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This soak is very relaxing for feet run for 12+ hour shifts and smells great as well. I have been using it daily 15-20 mins mainly to help clear up a little fungus spot on my big toe along with a topical treatment. It&#x27;s hard to say if one or the other, or the combination is helping to clear it up but it is getting much better and quickly. I have also seen an improvement in the smoothness and appearance of my feet.</li>
            <li> Soothing and the aroma is terrific.</li>
            <li> I love this. It smells great and makes my feet look so clean and flawless. No dry skin anymore!</li>
            <li> Love it... great way to end the day!</li>
            <li> Very soothing, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Really good product.  It has a cleansing smell &amp; works very well.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant for soaking tired feet.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel great.</li>
            <li> Really works. .. not kidding.  1 week. . Fungus cleared up.  and smells wonderful.  Great service and fast shipping.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It makes my feet smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Foot soak is a lovely product.  A terrific blend of mineral salts and epsom salts along with a great blend of essential oils.</li>
            <li> My feet feel  and look much better after using for  ten days. The nail fungus is clearing up also.</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree Oil Soak is great!  It leaves my feet feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Item Is awesome great natural ingredients, however it comes in a bag not in a bottle like it shows in the picture. Other then that it&#x27;s really good it helps my feet feel soft and relaxed after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s toe was infected and amputation was considered by Dr.  after soaking in tea tree oil and taking antibiotic he still has the toe.  Grateful for the tea tree oil. After 10 days of antibiotic we were referred to a surgeon amce home and soaked it 3 times before seeing the surgeon next morning. Guess what it looked so-o much better - no surgery and still has his toe.  Thanks for a great product tho it is rather pricey.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from burning on the bottoms of my toes.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 1 week, and the burning is gone.  The product has a strong medicinal odor, which doesn&#x27;t bother me but it might some. Oh, I almost forgot: The container has a clever bottom, so it can&#x27;t tip over!</li>
            <li> I love this foot soak.  It leaves my feet, especially my heels, sooo soft and smelling so nice.  I don&#x27;t even need to use a pumice stone anymore.</li>
            <li> still using this product for non massaging exfoliation. since the foot massager is not working (hot bath) we are using this product in wet foot soaks without massage and bathing.. works well to help with exfoliation for skin conditions</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  I&#x27;ve been using over-the-counter fungal medications which have not helped the infection beneath my nails.  This product softens and allows deep cleansing of the feet.  I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil and other essential oils for years. This soak is well worth the price and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Terrific.  Helped a lot on infection.</li>
            <li> I look forward to weekly my foot soaks. It cleans as well as soothes.</li>
            <li> Love the aroma, &amp; after soaking my feet they feel super clean. Not enough evidence to declare it is sufficient enough. Let you know later.</li>
            <li> Does not look like the product being shown. Mine came in a bag. Not sure if its even doing anything.</li>
            <li> Smells great, which helps you relax after a long day. Even though it didn&#x27;t do much for the toenail fungus, would recommend for a relaxing post work routine, and left my feet feeling refreshed and soft.  Would order again just for that.</li>
            <li> Strong smell and overall not a bad product but for the price its rather small. Probably cheaper at a grocery/drug store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bleach, apple cider vinegar, vicks vapor rub, etc. with no real success. I&#x27;ve used this for the last ten days(everyday soak 20 min.) and I&#x27;ve seen noticeable improvement. Make sure you file and cut your nails down as much as possble! This is worth your investment!</li>
            <li> Worked great! Was starting to get a fungal growth to both big toe nails and constant pain. All gone! Plus, I just relaxed and soaked my feet after work. Thanks! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great. Leaves feet feeling soft and clean. I add a few drops of pure tea tree oil and my toenail fungus is disappearing after years of different meds.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Smell good and dead skin literally rubs right off of your feet using a towel.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The product is super rad! I got my mom a foot spa n saw the tea tree salt soak n had to get that fo sho. Very energizing n refreshing feeling. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Made my feet feel so much better!</li>
            <li> Great foot soak. I recommend this to men and women.</li>
            <li> This product was impressive on my initial use. My feet felt smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I might be having advanced toe fungus, that this product did not even make a dent on it. Continuous application of product was not fruitful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product for feet softening and refreshing, but not for curing toe fungus</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this I recommend using it every day with hot water if you really want to get rid of the fungus. you can notice a bit of a difference when you first use it. Like some of the fungus was removed a bit. I also suggest clipping nails as much as possible. Use it once a day for about 15-20 minutes or until the water gets cold up to you. Don&#x27;t stop using it otherwise fungus will come back. I will post update and pics of progress once its gone so far 1 week of usage</li>
            <li> I am using it each night and i love it.</li>
            <li> Love this soak.  Fragrant.  Effective on clearing toe nails.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hope it would reduce swelling and help my severely sprained foot. It works and my feet feel so much better and softer. My nails look great after too and I don&#x27;t have fungus or odor. The smell is just like tea tree oil and if using in the tub, be careful as it will get slick due to the oils. I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it in one of those electrically heated foot baths. I don&#x27;t have fungus but I do have foot odor, using this a few nights a week instead of the foot powder keeps it at bay quite well. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This soak smells wonderful, and my feet are soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly effective. Soothing and refreshing!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; I&#x27;ve already ordered more. It conditions both toenails and the skin on your feet. My nails showed significant improvement after just one use.</li>
            <li> Relaxing and feels great</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use this in my foot spa. It smells amazing, it&#x27;s a very calming relaxing scent. Leaves my whole apartment smelling this way for hours. As far as fungus treatment not sure. I have a bit of it on one of my toenails, haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to know if it works. But I do highly recommend this product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this foot soak feels on my feet. They haven&#x27;t felt this good in a long time!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  It makes my feet feel great</li>
            <li> Love this Foot Soak it was very refreshing.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I really like the foot soak so far. I have only been using it a short time to help my toe nail fungus and it appears to be helping. I&#x27;m not sure if it will completely get rid of it, but helps nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Great product. Soothing, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great soaking salts for my feet. Smells great and also healthy for you as tea tree has great skin benefits, makes you feet relax and forget all the daily worries and takes you to the land of rest and comfort.</li>
            <li> Excellent foot soak.  Smells great.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I loe the foot soak. My feet do not smell and itch any more. This stuffvreally works.</li>
            <li> So refreshing and relaxing</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says in the description and it smell great. 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tea Tree; this foot soak feels and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is basically the same as Renew Nail Treatment, if you want a product that just smells good then this would be it outside of that it is a useless waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoyed my foot soaking experiencewith Tea Tree Oil.  Nice sublte fragrance.  Left my feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing but it didn&#x27;t heal my athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome. The foot baths with the Tea Tree oil are so addicting...</li>
            <li> Add to my foot bath along with yellow Listerine, white vinegar, and hot water. Best pedicure!! It gives you time in between and your feet will feel like baby&#x27;s bottoms. The tree tea oils soak added a nice smell and a menthol feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is the best. It smells wonderful and my feet feel like heaven. The toenail fungus I have harbored for two years has gone away and I have used the soak for just a few months, 4 nights a week or so. I will continue using it because it is so enjoyable. My feet are now softer, too.</li>
            <li> Very good product, cure my feet itch!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this foot soak and we have started to use it for my Mother-in-law who has had a toenail fungus that is causing pain.  We have bought this several times from this seller and will continue.  Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. I bought it for my foot scrubber but I&#x27;m also using it for an occasional bath soak. The aroma is wonderful! It have taken more baths this past two weeks than I have in quite a while...I&#x27;ve nearly depleted my jar. I need to order more!</li>
            <li> Like the product. Like the price. Like the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak every night  and still waiting to see improvement.</li>
            <li> It smells like real tea tree oil, not perfume. Anything with perfume gives me a headache (essential oils don&#x27;t), so I hesitate to buy things like this for fear of perfume, but this one is real. It has a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my head. I can use it and I like it. My feet weren&#x27;t in bad shape, so I don&#x27;t know if it works on all the other foot problems. I just add add it to the bath</li>
            <li> Good value, fast shipping, really nice product.</li>
            <li> Great! Love the feel and the smell!</li>
            <li> Wonderful foot soak!  I am amazed at the difference with my toenail fungus.  I&#x27;ve used it for only two weeks and the nails have already started to lighten dramatically. The shipping was super fast and I received outstanding customer service from the seller. I&#x27;m a very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I bought this last year to help soften callouses I had.  When I read it would treat nail fungus, I thought yeah right.  Well, I had one yellowed nail.  I only got to soak with this one time before I had back surgery and then I could not have cared less how my feet looked.  This spring I dug out the soak, the purple bar to scrub down the callouses, the tub and my sandals, only to realize...that toenail was normal again!  It had been that way for years!  If you have funky feet you seriously need to try this stuff.  Everything in it is good for your feet, no awful chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> Foot soaking is new me so admittedly I can&#x27;t compare this product to others of the same category. That being said, judging by the way this product makes my feet look and feel, I have to give it 5 stars. My feet definitely look better and feel fantastic afterward. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> helpful product. does just what it says</li>
            <li> Love this foot soak. My feet are so soft after using this soak. And it&#x27;s great for facilitating dead skin removal with an exfoliating cloth afterwards. The smell is also very relaxing. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> GREAT product!  I have noticed an improvement in how my feet look and feel in less than one week of use.  Will buy this product again and can recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Tree Oil has greatly improved my opinion of foot soaking. My wife talked me into taking better care of my feet, I am now a fan.</li>
            <li> This foot soak dissolves in warm water and does a great job of softening and scenting the skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I must admit...as long as you are in a well ventilated room...this stuff is amazing!  I had contracted nail fungus about 18 months ago.  It started on one toe, then moved to the same toe on the other foot.  And then it spread to other toes...it&#x27;s like a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor told me that once you have nail fungus, you can never truly ever get rid of it.  I&#x27;ve been using a prescribed medication that basically looks like clear nail polish.  Whatever it is, I know it was helping for a while.  But the thought of not being able to get rid of nail fungus entirely really scared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got online and did some research...as I always do.  And I found that using Epsom Salt with Tea Tree Oil is known to cure nail fungus.  I&#x27;m only about 1 week into using the product.  Even though it is recommended to have a treatment twice a day, I have only been doing one.  And there&#x27;s a HUGE difference in how the nail looks already!!!  I think that, so long as I keep this up, the nail will grow a healthy nail and the fungus gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely incredible what it&#x27;s done already and I continue to have high hopes!  It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot at $17.00 for a bag.  The bags are kind of small...but you get a little over a week out of each bag if you only do one treatment per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order this product, then order a nice _SIMPLE_ bucket.  The bucket I purchased is literally a bucket.  Nothing fancy...no jets, no massages, just holds a lot of hot water!  Add 3x tablespoons of the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak With Epsom Salts - then soak for 20 minutes. It&#x27;s magical!</li>
            <li> This foot soak has everything going for it1  We used it in our foot bath and it dissolves well, smells great and our feet felt soft and refreshed afterwards</li>
            <li> Thank you, Purely Northwest, for this wonderful product.  I have been using the product for the past few weeks and am extremely satisfied with the way my feet feel after a good soak!  I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, soft feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was amazing. It had the best smell ever. I haven&#x27;t been able to notice the color change on my toe nail yet, but I can definitely tell you that my feet feel better.</li>
            <li> I have MS and sore feet.  I soak my feet one daily and my pain is less.  Also, I have toe fungus and this is better.  My grandson plays soccer and after a tough game his feet hurt.  The foot soak has helped him.  I love the stuff and it works!</li>
            <li> Much needed relief after long days on my feet, its helping with athletes foot, and seems to be helping with toe fungus</li>
            <li> I really like this foot soak, and it helped my daughter&#x27;s ankle when she got an abrasion from a piece of charred wood. She soaked it a couple of times in the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak, and it healed quickly. I would recommend it and purchase it again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works! Bought this in conjuction with the Nonyx Nail Gel 4 fl oz Liquid.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Smells great and works even better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I have Lyme disease which causes unbearable pain in my feet without medication.  My doctor suggested Epsom salt foot baths twice a day to help with detoxing.  I add the tea tree soak.  It smells so good, feels soothing, and the odor helps me relax.  We&#x27;ll see how the fungus in my nails react.  That will take awhile.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use twice and I&#x27;m liking the feel. I bought for toe nail fungus and im hoping it helps.</li>
            <li> I love this foot soak.  I have had a fungus on one of my nails for quite a while that I have been treating with an anti fungus liquid.  However, this foot soak has improved the look of the nail after just two uses.  It is also quite nice for use after a stressful day at work.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it absolutely take great care of my tired feet. I would recommend this product, and of course buy it again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It has a great smell and you can tell that there is an immediate difference with your feet.  I will be purchasing more as I am 10000% satisfied and greatful for this product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase and I am very happy. My 11-year old daughter has toe fungus in on both feet - two toes on one foot and three toes on the other. She plays soccer and her feet are often wet and in dark enclosed socks and shoes which (we learned) is a perfect breeding ground for fungus.  Using this foot soak, I can see a big difference. The new toe nail is growing in clear. We clip the dark nail as it grows out. Its been about 3 weeks. She soaks 1-2 times per day for at least 20 mins.  It smells so good.  My daughter likes to soak after her shower at night because the smell lingers while she&#x27;s in bed.  She really wants her toe nails to be clear before summer arrives so she can wear flip flops. Lots of tips online but we have found that you will need to soak and we have tried vinegar and baking soda too. This just smells better. Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! I have really dry feet and it&#x27;s year round. I buy all the foot peels and scrubs and this is a nice option too. The tea tree oil scent is great and really relaxing. This makes my feet feel really soft for a few days and then I have to use it again and I don&#x27;t mind. Gives me an excuse to sit down and relax!!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from hard-to-get-rid-of toenail fungus, I highly recommend this product.  After attempting other remedies without much success, I started using the Tea Tree Oil foot soak and also Tea Tree oil directly applied after the soaking.  After three uses, there is a visible difference with my nails.  This was a good find.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my wife with her foot massager.  She absolutely loves this product.  She loves it so much I had to buy her 4 more so she wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I never did notice a change on my toe nails but it did smell good, however I wish they would fill up the bag or make the bag a little bigger.</li>
            <li> it really is amazing. I use two to three tablespoons in my foot bath and I can feel the soothing sensation. It really is hard to put into words. My husband also used it and said he liked the way the skin felt afterwards. I can see I will have to order more soon. I thank all those involved in making this product available</li>
            <li> clear instructions for use.  There was the Tea Tree Oil smell with this product, but it is not over bearing.</li>
            <li> The foot soak makes my skin feel amazing and it smells wonderful. It is keeping my athlete&#x27;s foot in check as well.</li>
            <li> Great foot soak when you have fungus toenails leaving your feet feeling refresh and helps with the healing process to gain healthy nail bed back. I used this along with Tineacide purchased at my doctor office.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak after purchasing the first bag I purchased four more because this product has wonderful healing properties and after a long day at work (mostly walking) I really needed to treat myself with a wonderful foot bath. Tea tree oil is also an local antiseptic that heals the common everyday ailments of the feet and epsom salt relieves the body of pain and addresses any stress in the body. This product is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Here I am on day 2 &amp; I have such high hopes with you all having great success with clearing up toenail fungus! The soak I do once daily plus I add a couple of drops of the oil to the nail cuticles on both my ugly big toes...it&#x27;s 3/23/2015 &amp; I am posting this &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pic so we can really see my progress! I&#x27;m praying it will! Ok here goes!...***UPDATE 4/2/2015 It appears that my toenail fungus is of a lighter color under both nails, more transparent...perhaps the soak is loosening up both nails to then fall off. I see clear fluid moving around under nail where dark color WAS! I have new pics...! Thanx!</li>
            <li> My feet feel so much smoother and relaxed after my foot soak in this tea tree Epsom salt.  Really nice</li>
            <li> I like this foot soak. I have been using it for a week and I feel like it is helping my toe nail fungus. But I am really disappointed in the size of the bag for how much I paid for it. I really wish the bag was bigger, it&#x27;s already almost gone.</li>
            <li> I felt no difference, didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it to soak my 95 year old mon&#x27;s feet to help get rid of a thich callous on the side of one big toe aggravated by nail fungus. After trying many other products, this one is working and the callous is almost gone. The smell of this soak is wonderful!</li>
            <li> really helped my feet, soaking in the tea tree oil feels very refreshing.  I have sore feet all the time and use this in my foot bath with heat, bubbles and message.  try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  My feet never felt better, and my athlete&#x27;s foot is gone as well (I did use a cream in tandem with this foot soak).  It smells very nice, and using the product feels like a luxurious spa treatment for your feet.  I use it every week night to de-stress after a hectic work schedule.  The first pack that I bought is down to less than half as I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again, and probably go for a bigger pack.</li>
            <li> Great product and awesome customer service!</li>
            <li> I have used this product three times and already I see a huge improvement in my toenail fungus. I have tried other things and so far this by far works the best.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is great.  I purchased it to help battle this nasty toe nail fungus I have been struggling  with for years (so super gross...TMI!).  I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with other things.  I am not sure if it is helping the fungus yet but it certainly feels wonderful.  My feet feel so clean and soft afterwards.  It is expensive and although it does tell you the size, it was a lot smaller than I expected.  I have already repurchased it once and will do so again once this runs out.  I am not usually a big fan of the tea tree oil smell but I like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and it was great I soaked for 10 minutes and and was amazed at how good my feet felt thanks.</li>
            <li> Great Foot soak. VERY strong (somewhat unpleasant) smell though, my eyes almost go watery from it. I know that tea tree smells this way, but never used it before, it was a surprise. Other than the smell i absolutely love it. Love the packaging too. I trust the ingredients in the product and believe after 1 soak my feet are much better, relaxed, cleaned and with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I love it, I love it, I love it.  Smells wonderful and my feet feet feel great after the soak.  I am using it mainly for toenail fungus, but it will be awhile before I know if it is beneficial for that purpose, but regardless the soak is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;so far I  have purchased three packs as I soak my feet twice daily.</li>
            <li> Strong product, smells amazing, great for getting rid of all the yuck on my feet.</li>
            <li> Very soothing. My feet have paid a price for cancer treatments but tea tree oils are recommended and for a good reason. Thank you for your product.</li>
            <li> Really like the product it is feeling great to soak my feet after travel and work</li>
            <li> This product feels so good. I drop it in nice hot water and I soak my food and it feels like heaven. Unfortunately I fractured my shoulder at the job and I have not been able to use it again, but I love it.</li>
            <li> This is very soothing to tired and abused feet. Just like a spa at home.</li>
            <li> This stuff Is great! My husband&#x27;s feet stink to high heaven and when he soaks them in thus the cease to smell until his next work day. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The foot soak is really wonderful. I feel like it has really helped soothe and heal my feet. I am on my feet all day at work, and my shoes have taken a toll on my nails. I use the soak every other day. I really like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Fantastically soothing to the feet.  Will buy again.  tyvm :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, and left my feet feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells great and really is working for my toe nail fungus. I use it in my Kendal foot heater massager thing and works well. I mix a spoon full in a glass and dilute it and then add to the water massager. Smells great and really works, you will see results after 3-4 times of regular uses</li>
            <li> Smells great, softens feet and makes them feel clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and though I still have some callouses and rough spots on the heel I believe overall it is improving.  I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve been able to go through the first bag and see what kind of results I get.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves your feet soft. Smells wonderful. Great improvement in the look and feel of my feet.</li>
            <li> My feet feel so much better after soaking them in this after a long day at work :D</li>
            <li> Very nice and soothing! Leaves feet feet feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This soak worked amazingly. It smells great and it was very relaxing to soak my feet at the end of the day. My feet are now fresh and don&#x27;t repel my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference for the price.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week and I have noticed my feet feeling softer.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Nice tingle and great scent. Very refreshing and invigorating. Even my husband who really doesn&#x27;t like tea tree oil liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Works great but does have a strong smell. You get used to it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells good and feels good. It is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Epsom salts so I&#x27;m not sure what to expect.  I use it in a foot spa.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Smells great and does wonders!</li>
            <li> horribly awful toe nail fungus and this is working to get it gone. Takes discipline but it works</li>
            <li> I am using this to tackle yellowish toenails that is causing me some pain (possibly fungus). I use it in conjunction with tree oil soap. Basically I soak my feet in warm water with soap and salt. There is some clearing of the yellowness although not much. I&#x27;ve done the soaking about 3 times now.  I now see that the yellowness is concentrated in the middle of the nail where the solution probably has a hard time penetrating, so this will clear up when the nail grows.</li>
            <li> My 95 year old mother in law has commented (which she never does!) that this product has been helpful in her weekly foot soaks. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a continuation of the other review. So far, it seems that it hasn&#x27;t worked as quickly as expected. I&#x27;ve already used up all of the salt but ordered some more. It doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAR up the fungus, but I feel like it IS taming it. I also make sure to wear opened toed shoes as much as possible. Maybe it&#x27;s working, but not up to the point where I can see obvious changes. Maybe because it&#x27;s a natural, organic alternative it takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping it up!</li>
            <li> Great so far... Only four stars for now because I have only used it for a few days but my heels are already softer!</li>
            <li> Fresh pleasant scent, very nice foot soak! Great service!</li>
            <li> I use this in my bubbling foot soak bath and it does leave my feet feeling fresh and clean. It&#x27;s very relaxing and the tea tree oil scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I follow up by rubbing 100% pure tea tree oil on my feet and nails.</li>
            <li> Finally got a chance to use this and it was a soothing to my feet as told in many reviews, wish it came in bulk portions.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is fantastic! I bought it for my husband who works as a chef and struggles with tired, achey feet. After seeing how much it helped him, I tried it out myself. My feet were so relaxed and also nice and smooth afterward. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Soothing and refreshing.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not only does it cure stubborn fungus, it leave your room filled with a nice aroma!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful treat for my feet!</li>
            <li> Have only used it once.  It is very relaxing</li>
            <li> We have been very impressed with the effects of the Purely Northwest Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak. Used in a foot bath, there is daily improvement of foot condition and chronic athletes foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male retired Navy Veteran that has had some nagging itching on the ends of a few of my toes that has lasted several month. I&#x27;ve tried everything (except a doctor) off the shelf and several other creams and sprays available on Amazon but up to this point nothing has helped. I lowered my pride and decided to try this foot soak. After the first soak my feet were feeling much better and noticeably softer and the soaking process itself felt very relaxing and good on my feet.  This foot soak in conjunction with another cream has so far seemed to solve my problem.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, simply amazing after 3 days my feet feels amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many scents, especially floral.  This has none of the scents that bother me.  It makes for a nice foot bath soak, contains Epsom salt and teat tree oil, both good for the skin.  It feels good, and results in no allergic reactions of any kind to skin or olfactory senses.  I would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> wonderful product I would recommend it to anybody who likes having their feet pampered</li>
            <li> It does leave your feet nice and fresh- and the fresh sensation continues for a while. Should be perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> i have used this several times and it leaves my feet feeling softer...it&#x27;s too early to tell if if will help with toenail fungus or not, but it won&#x27;t hurt. I am also treating toenail fungus with straight tea tree oil.The primary reason for doing the foot soak is to treat my feet after a long day of standing and walking on them at book store where i work. Dermatologist said i didn&#x27;t have fungus issue, but i know that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised. I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar and feet are healing nicely. First product that I have used that&lt;br /&gt;really works!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it I can definitely see the difference! I ordered it again as I am running out of my first one!</li>
            <li> Works great in my foot bath, but stinks up my house when I use it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  Have been using it daily and it does help skin and nails.</li>
            <li> Amazing combination of salts- takes out all callus and dead skin-- it leaves skin baby soft and clean!! Also makes the room smell so fresh afterwards</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but my heels looked much better after just one use. Hopefully it will make the toenail fungus go away...</li>
            <li> Treat for a long day on your feet!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advice of my dermatologist to control toenail fungus (not this brand specifically, but a foot soak containing tea tree oil, Epsom salts and such). The tea-tree oil scented crystals do seem to be knocking back the fungus, slowly but surely. But an added benefit I discovered is the super callus softening that the mixture offers. Because I have some strangely placed calluses following foot surgeries for neuromas and bunions, I need someway to remove the part of the callus that is causing pain without leaving the area raw and unprotected. Pedicure callus treatments are too aggressive for me. This foot soak does the trick. After a soak, I can actually remove the offending callus with a rough towel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for a few weeks and it has made my feet feel great, softened the skin, etc.  I have also enjoyed it as a bath salt.</li>
            <li> After a long day of abusing my feet at work and the gym, nothing beats a nice foot soak with Tea Tree Oil. It has a lovely smell which reminds me of camping in the forest amongst majestic evergreens. I would highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the foot soak for my husband. He loves the foot soak and  has used it every night this week. He said that since he has started soaking his feet in the tee tree oil that his toe nails and feet don&#x27;t hurt. He has to wear steel toed  work boots while at work.  We are so glad to finally find a product that is helping him.</li>
            <li> Nail fungus is nasty,  This product is working.  Try it!</li>
            <li> THE NICEST EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR FEETS</li>
            <li> Very nice aroma, it feels great in warm water and give you a very clean and soft feel. I surely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good product my feet improved a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, but i can tell it helps. It&#x27;s not supposed to work overnight, it will take a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> This came today and my wife is very very pleased with it and is going to used it tonight on her feet Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use the product since the jar wasn&#x27;t sealed properly. Therefore, I can&#x27;t report on the product itself. Have to return. Still debating about reorder. Ordered 2 of these plus another item to amount to the $35 needed to prevent paying shipping and handling. If I reorder I will still have to buy, yet another, product I don&#x27;t really need to amount to the $35 in order to prevent paying s/h again. Would be highly upset if I got two more that weren&#x27;t sealed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 22,2014&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately contacted by the company and they are sending me the 2 Tea Tree foot soaks as replacements, PLUS a jar of Lavender for FREE, for my inconvenience. He reassured me that he has checked to see that all jars in stock are wrap sealed with the comment that \\&quot;one probably just slipped by\\&quot;. I consider this GREAT customer service. I will comment again after using the product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised, product is in good condition. Once I got my new foot spa to use it in, it was wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love soaking my feet in Tea Tree Oil Epsom Salt.  It helped heal my ingrown toe nail and my athletes feet.  It&#x27;s kind of pricey for the tiny bag.  I&#x27;m thinking of using regular Epsom Salt and adding Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> This works! I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus for years. I&#x27;ve tried many, many treatments and found that nothing helped. I&#x27;ve tried every topical treatment and I&#x27;ve also tried the laser treatments...save your money! I used this foot soak for about a week and I&#x27;m already seeing the fungus fade away. You have to stick with it everyday, but after YEARS, I&#x27;ve finally found something that works. I figure another couple of weeks and I&#x27;ll be all cleared up.</li>
            <li> I used this foot soak about four times already and my toe fungus is already turning black and disappearing after I file the black part off. I&#x27;ve never been able to do this with just using Vicks or the prescription the podiatrist gave me.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and truly leaves a refresh feel. I would most definitely recommend this to any one. I saw a similar products at a local and I realized I saved 12$. I&#x27;ll restock once in out</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the foot soak daily for toenail fungus, and it has cleared it up after using the product as recommended.</li>
            <li> I liked this but it didn&#x27;t last long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this soak a lot. I plan on ordering more. It works, refreshes, and and my feet feel better. Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;  Ricketta</li>
            <li> The product in itself is very good.  The combination of the products and the salt is exactly what I would like in a foot soak.  I was using this product to address a nail fungus for a client for which I provide daily care as an aid.  The problem is that while the product seems to be effective, the suggested use of 2 tbsp per soak at 2 soaks per day means that in close to a week you are in need of more product.  When addressing a nail fungus, it is important to continue treating the nail until it has grown out with new, unaffected nail.  You have to be prepared to continue treating the nail for as long as it takes until the nail grows out.  It did not seem feasible or cost effective to continue purchasing the product every week until the nail grew out.  I am currently using the ReNew nail treatment which is 1 oz. of treatment with an applicator allowing me to spot treat the area morning and night.  This product will last a very long time and is very inexpensive.  It appears to be having a positive effect on the nail.  Time will tell if it eradicates the fungus entirely.</li>
            <li> Excellent soaking salt, very aromatic and effective for relieving work weary muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 3x a week for about two weeks now and I can already tell a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve always had hard, scaly feet and I&#x27;ve never really done anything other than apply lotion until now.  I can honestly recommend this 100% and I&#x27;ll be re-ordering it often.</li>
            <li> Wow. I love this product! Feels wonderful, smells great and leaves my feet so soft. I had early signs of a mild nail fungus and this cleared it up immediately. I may need to order a case!</li>
            <li> Great soak, I&#x27;ve been using Epsom in the past but wanting to find a soak that would work on preventing fungus considering that I actively swim and run and therefore always at risk. I soak my feet at least once a week and so far so good. I&#x27;m glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great; hope it helps with the tingly feet.</li>
            <li> Excellent, feel are soft after each use. Seems to helping the sore feeT</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet smooth</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it regularly due to nail/foot fungus. Granted, the fungus was not out of control, I used this soak twice a week with nail fungus prescribed treatment and within a month the nail fungus stopped progressing and my feet were also cured from fungus. Now my feet do not sweat as much and do not stink at the end of the day. I noticed this product also helped me relax due to it&#x27;s aromatherapy and it would also ease achy feet.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have used tt twice and it makes your feet so relaxed. I usually soak for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing on my feet and leaves them smelling fresh!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, It is very soothing and your feet notice a differance after the first time you use it. At least for me it did.  My feet were dry and at night they felt like they were burning and itching.  After I used it I had the best nights sleep in a long time because my feet weren&#x27;t bothering me. I now use it every other night.  This is different from regular epsom salts, I have used that before.  Will buy this product again.  I now use it every other night</li>
            <li> Oh my that was or the best soak ever,I&#x27;m soaking my whole body in it.It truly wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my tea tree oil, it arrived a day early. Very good product.</li>
            <li> My husband has been soaking his feet in this to ward off a chronic case of athletes foot.  He says it&#x27;s working better than any other remedy he&#x27;s tried!</li>
            <li> very powerful for a natural product. Surprised how well it works. Can use to clean anything.</li>
            <li> Really smells good &amp; softens feet.</li>
            <li> Aaah my feet are so happy with this bath; so soothing, relaxing, and softening too.&lt;br /&gt;All of our stiff feet come out of the bath without that stiffness.</li>
            <li> They could have named this &amp;#34;magic feet potion&amp;#34; and still get 5 stars! This stuff is great, feels good in the foot bath, smells good and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. Very highly recommended and will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m plan on getting some more</li>
            <li> I got this for my son fighting cancer and it&#x27;s great!  I will be using it soon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy soaking my tired feet with this salt in my foot bath.&lt;br /&gt; It is very strong and I love the scent. Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because there was an area under my toenail which I think is fungus since it&#x27;s discolored. I researched it and tea tree oil is a product that&#x27;s supposed to help. I haven&#x27;t used to too long yet so I don&#x27;t know if this will ultimately do the trick, but the salts are very nice. It&#x27;s a great soak for anytime. Invigorating smell ... feels great. Can&#x27;t say at this time if it will cure the toenail issue, but it certainly is no worse and may be minimally improved after using only a handful of times so far. Regardless ... I think this is a winner for any feet! It&#x27;s also in a nice convenient package.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, I hope it will help with my stubborn foot fungus.  Too soon to know.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use the product. Very pleased with the soak, really helps and is soothing. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  My feet feel fine after using it and I look forward to using it again.  I am happy with Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak</li>
            <li> This a very helpful for healing athletes foot. And it is soothing to soak in despite the strong smell. So much less money than tube or spray month after month from drugstores.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product but seems to make feet feel more relaxed. To give a more accurate review, let me update in about a week or two.</li>
            <li> This has lots of good ingredients to commend it to a user.  It does burn a teensie bit on little cracked or rough areas on the feet, but that passes, and your footsies feel great afterward---clean and cool.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product was so great based off of the reviews, but willing to try anything at this point. I have toenail fungus on four toes and have had a really hard time getting rid of it. I used it a couple of times and then took the advice of some of the other reviews and filed down the nails with fungus to a normal thickness. I&#x27;ve continued to used it and my nails have stayed thin. I&#x27;ve also been using fungus polish, just cheap over the counter. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to wear sandals. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My feet when from cracked and gross looking to smooth and beautiful!  Love this product! I would have given it 5 stars but it seems a little pricey.  Maybe I&#x27;m just cheap. ;-)</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipment. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery ! Slow results but I will purchase Again!</li>
            <li> This cleared a problem with a toenail.</li>
            <li> I love how my feet feel after using this product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything for my feet, had chronic fungus infections, couldn&#x27;t wear sandals, now after 2 uses, my feet look amazing.  Thank you for making a great product.  So glad I bought 2</li>
            <li> Once my product was delivered to my house, I had to try it right away. I left my feet in the water for 20mins, with it 10mins I saw my nails change into a clear color, as if it was roving the fungal away.. It also leaves your feet so soft, only thing that i have which its my fault is that I don&#x27;t use it daily. However, the days that I do use it it does work it&#x27;s wonders.. I would totally recommended only thing is use it daily..</li>
            <li> It seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> Nice foot soak but did absolutely nothing for fungus problem.</li>
            <li> After 4 uses my feet are so much softer.  Hard  thick skin calouses are going away and cracks in skin has healed.  As a dude, I am not really into fru fru stuff, but this stuff rocks.  Smells really good also.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product and have used several times since receiving. It has a wonderful fragrance/aroma from the ingredients. My feet feel fabulously softer. It feels like a treat for me since I am home bound recovering from cancer and dealing with lupus and haven&#x27;t had a pedi in a year.  Packaging was great and service was quick. Would definitely recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money! You don&#x27;t need much in order to enjoy the aromatic aspects of this product. I walk around a lot while deployed and this product is the first thing I reach for when I get Down time!</li>
            <li> This product smells fresh and clean when you soak your feet in it. The crystals dissolve quickly in warm water and leave your feet feeling refreshed. it also helps drive away athletes foot and keeps it away.</li>
            <li> feels Great !  so refreshing.  smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in the toenail fungus within 3 treatments.</li>
            <li> Great product... I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Good product and shipped very fast, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product that actually produces results. Couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic Type II. About 5 years ago, I began to suffer from foot neuropathy Since that time, I&#x27;ve been using a prescription drug to help with my nerve pain. I also suffer from toe nail fungus and calluses which were the main reasons I decided to try this product. I immediately began my foot soaks about 3 to 4 times a week. The most notable improvements have been the easing of my nerve pain and the virtual elimination of calluses, especially in the heel areas. The foot soak has made a huge improvement. My feet have felt the softness that I hadn&#x27;t seen for many years. It&#x27;s too early to tell if my toe nail fungus will improve. As this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product, I&#x27;m very pleased at its effectiveness. I&#x27;m hopeful that my toe nail fungus will also get better as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...it&#x27;s very relaxing. I&#x27;m going to order 2 more bags so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> OK nice smell but no different than regular epsom salt. Is a bet miss leading when it says it will help with fungas when the fine print tells you that you need to purchase extra meds to help with that.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and a treat for achy feet.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, but works</li>
            <li> I purchased the tea tree oil because my husband had an infection on his big toe.  Not only did he have an infection but he&#x27;d had a toe fungus for a number of years.  After soaking with the tea tree oil his infection cleared up and amazingly so did his toe fungus.</li>
            <li> As stated in another review for their Antifungal Soap with Tea Tree Oil, I love this stuff. It makes my feet feel much better after being on them all day and is helping immensely with how tough my heels are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate feet but am starting to turn that around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Into my second week along with using Karasalnail renewal nail care. Nails have cleared up. One toe nail has released from nail bed (I guess good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet feel great after soak.  So impressed with It, I ordered some for my sister as she is on her feet ALL day as a CNA.  She thanks me every time she uses it via a phone call. Will post back in a minth.</li>
            <li> This foot soak smells wonderful. Not only did my feet feel much softer after using, but the house smelled great too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days together with other nail renew treatment. It works great for me. The new nail is free of fungus.</li>
            <li> This formulae makes my feet feel as if they had wings on them!!!</li>
            <li> The foot soak works . Delivery was fast. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is great!  It feels so cool on my feet and makes them feel awesome.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels heavenly.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve only tried it once, but it felt so good.</li>
            <li> My feet absolutely love this product!  It leaves them soft and relaxed and raring to go. I don&#x27;t have a fungus so I don&#x27;t know how well it works for that; but I did have exceptionally dry feet before regular use. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Very soothing foot soak. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help with a toenail fungus that has been coming on for a couple years now. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and am hopeful with this, based on the others&#x27; reviews. It may be a little pricey but if it works.. it&#x27;ll be worth it! Fantastic customer service!!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  Helps clear up skin irritations, like athletes feet.</li>
            <li> Works great and the smell of product is soothing.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product...will be ordering more so I never run out!!!  It is all natural, pleasantly fragrant and so soothing.  I am very pleased with how my feet look and feel!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak w/Epson Salt for my husband&#x27;s new foot spa by Kendal #MS0810M.  I mentioned the foot spa as I want to point out that the product DOES NOT PLUG THE JETS!  My husband has 7 fungus toe nails and so Tea Tree Soak is one of a couple treatments we are applying to combat the toe nail fungus.  Nightly he soaks his feet for 20 min. in this aromatic, bubbling, warm solution (2 tablespoons of Tea Tree product is in the water) and it relaxes him to the point that he&#x27;s falling asleep.  The scent is pleasant.  His feet come out tingling clean and soft (it is softening the hard cracked heels!) and it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s truly having an effect on the fungus, but we are very optimistic that this soak is playing a huge part. The soaking penetrates! After the soak, I then scratch the surface of the nails with a file (I originally filed them down a lot!) and then apply an ointment of 2% Miconazole Nitrite Antifungal Cream (Repara).  He&#x27;s been soaking now for 2 weeks and thus far his toe nails look a lot more acceptable.  Before, I&#x27;d tell him &amp;#34;HIDE THOSE NAILS!&amp;#34;  Now, it&#x27;s ok to wear flip flops in public, no more scary toes. I know it&#x27;ll be a while until these toe nails truly resemble the rest of his healthy little partners.  We are off to a very good start!  This product is promising!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  My feet already look and feel a whole lot better after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is amazing!!  I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and heal spurs on both feat.  After a day on feet I want nothing more than to have relief from my feet pain, this product gives me that relief the bonus is that it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Although I have used only 1 time, this product is amazing.  It really loosens dead skin and makes it so easy to slough off.  I will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> I recently fought off a bit of toenail fungus on my left big toe (embarrassing stuff!).  Other than a little bit of discoloration at the end of my toenail, it is all but gone.  I bought this product hoping that it will keep it gone and give my toenails a fighting chance.  I cannot comment on whether or not it has worked in that capacity, but OH MY does this stuff feel good!  My feet feel so good soaking in the salts that I just can&#x27;t describe it.  Aroma is nice and relaxing, too.  Regardless of how my big toe turns out, think I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and some times my feet really hurt, especially if I wear the wrong shoes.  I like working in the garden and digging hurts them even more.  Some times I can hardly walk.  I use Epson salts for a soak for sore muscles and I thought why not try soaking my feet regularly.  I enjoyed using this products to relax my feet.  The aroma alone is relaxing.  I bought a special bucket and the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak.  I like the affect on my feet.  I would recommend this to any one, not just people with problems, after all, who doesn&#x27;t feel better when their feet feel good!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product so much, very refreshing. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every night and will buy it again.  My feet feel really clean and soft after soaking. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if it is making a difference with getting rid of my toenail fungus.  I enjoy soaking my feet in it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Heavenly scent, soothing and refreshing.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this foot soak.  My feet feel sooo relaxed after.  I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell but I got used to it. Feet feel very refreshed after a soak!</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.  I think I was expecting a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product that would leave my feet feeling spectacular based on the reviews.  There is not a lot in this package, so don&#x27;t expect to last any length of time.  I really expected more from this considering it&#x27;s not that inexpensive.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful...very relaxing &amp; my feet look great :-)</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost. Can get similar for much cheaper and in greater quantity at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love this thing but no more than my mom, she uses it every single day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I will certainly order again. I&#x27;ve tried several products, but this is by far the best. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It didnt not work on me</li>
            <li> My wife loves to soak her feet in it.</li>
            <li> better then i expected. it helped my sore feet feel better.</li>
            <li> I discovered that my elderly mother had developed a bad case of foot fungus.  A podiatrist suggested a weekly treatment with this product and Lamisol cream.  After just a couple of weeks, the fungus had disappeared, and her feet look great!  She really looks forward to her weekly treatment.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she loved it. It left her feet soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my feet are soft, wish the bag was larger for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Cheaper then in stores. Works very well.</li>
            <li> This foot soak feels wonderful after being on my feet all day.</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the feet and has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> I bought the foot spa from Amazon and along with it I ordered the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak and it is very pleasant, it smells good and the Epsom Salt in it it very beneficial.  I love using it.  CAD</li>
            <li> Heaven for your feet! Helped treat nail fungus and athletes foot. Cant live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Dad, who really needed it!  He says it is making a world of difference and has thanked me several times for getting it for him. :)</li>
            <li> The Tree Oil Foot Soak with Epsom Salt made for a wonderful foot bath.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know yet if it helps eliminate nail fungus .</li>
            <li> Smells great! Soothing with warm water in a foot bath.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Just wish it was not so expensive... I feel like I go through it so fast. I soak my feet in it every night... Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to continue to afford it.</li>
            <li> An awesome product that works great.  It left my feet feeling great afterwards.</li>
            <li> A nice foot soak leaves me feeling relaxed and pampered. Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My feet are no longer dry and itching.  My husband&#x27;s nail fungus is improving daily.  Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Delivery of this product was excellent timing.  The smell regardless if you soak, your feet  gives a sense of relaxation. Would recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Great soak. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I have neuropathy in my feet and obviously was not looking for a cure here but was stunned by the level of relief! Some have mentioned the medicinal smell but I happen to love the minty fragrance of tea tree oil so I thought it was great. Go ahead and try it...I was a little leery purchasing it without knowing more about it but  was more than pleasantly surprised. It comes in a zip-lock pouch which I couldn&#x27;t make zip...might just be me.</li>
            <li> Feels great to soak your feet after a long day of being on your feet. The product works well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foot soaks I have ever tried. My feet felt refreshed for hours after I used it. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect remedy for sore, achey feet. Dissolves quickly in water, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels good to soak your feet in.  I have only been using it for a week so I&#x27;m not sure how it works on fungus or anything like that but it is great after a long day to put your feet in and relax.</li>
            <li> worked great I was very happy with it and would recommend it to others.. will buy more when I run out</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this mixture.  Leaves the feet feeling good, has a wonderful tea tree aroma.  Long term effectiveness on foot health and anti-fungal properties has yet to be tested, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago, I&#x27;ve had so many surgeries on my leg that it is difficult to let anything touch it, with that said this foot soak felt wonderful it was cooling and soothed my aches and pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The only problem I have is that I have to do my own pedicure...Smh! I&#x27;d love for someone to do it for me. Thx</li>
            <li> Bought this as a foot soak to fight toe nail fungus. The container suggested using it for a bath soak. Wow!!! Like a wonderful trip to the spa!!!  Would recommend this to anyone in need of some relaxation</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has an infected toenail. She loves this soak....it smells so clean and fresh. We have repurchased it, and the the seller is very prompt. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this so much it smells and feels great! This really makes my feet feel soft and relaxed!</li>
            <li> Help? Not sure yet. I&#x27;ve used it twelve (12) times and have not seen any discernible change in the condition of my feet. Granted, my feet have been afflicted with athletes foot and fungus for many years. I tried various topical treatments to no avail. The Tea Oil foot soak sounded like it might be the answer. I&#x27;ve been using a foot soak bucket filled with warm water to cover my feet up to my ankles, and a tablespoon and a half of the mixture for twenty (20) minutes. Enjoy the aroma, but, sadly nothing else. I&#x27;m going to order another jar for another try.</li>
            <li> This worked ok but had a more medicinal smell than I had anticipated. I expected a more pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works well. I am submitting a reorder for this product, only I am ordering 2 bags this time.</li>
            <li> feels good on my foot and smells awesome</li>
            <li> Saw results after 4 days, it is great!  Be sure to consistently use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to soak my feet for the last week and so far love it!  It smells lovely and makes my feet nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about eliminating nail fungus or athletes foot but it sure makes my tired feet feel good.  I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It really working wonders, I was expecting from something &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; be good. But this salt kind of exceeded my expectations, we (my hubby and I) are both happy with it. It gives really-really tired feet an excellent relief. Highly recommend it for bad feet as well, as my husband has feet that not getting tired, they are all &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; etc. And this salt-bath gives it much needed relief.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Ordered it with a Japanese foot bath bucket, and the two make for a very perfect combination (i.e. a wonderful relaxing foot bath!). Product packaging and quality is excellent. Delivered on time. And Purely Northwest very professional.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! Used it once with warm water, doesn&#x27;t tingle or anything, but smelled and felt pretty good.</li>
            <li> I  love it it&#x27;s making my feet feeling good that fungus is almost gone I will tell everybody about it is good I try  a lot of different things this the only one that works for me</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! But I was expecting my feet to feel like im walking on clouds after reading some of the review&#x27;s. Im a fan of tea tree, and not a fan of toe fungas? And I&#x27;m yet to see a drastic change or the cloud walker feeling..will continue using but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> My husband wear work boots all day and his feet tends to be a little smelly... We used this foot soak twice a week and it quickly minimized his foot odor and helped with the overall appearance of his feet.... My only complaint would be the quantity of product received. We ran through the bag really fast... I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It works, and it smells absolutely heavenly.  I went through mine very quickly and will need to get some more soon, but it does help (not HEAL) with onychomycosis, and my nails were always nice and shiny after soaking them with this foot soak.  I will definitely buy it again.  Listerine and vinegar do actually work, but this foot soak really hits the spot and does its job.</li>
            <li> Great for soaking.  The fragrance is delightful.  Perhaps a bit expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell, and feels good on my feet.  I am treating for mild case of toe fungus along with an antifungal brush on treatment and it seems to be doing the job.  Just have to have patience and treat every day.  I will order more.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Soft feet now!  Product is soothing and healing to my dry heals.  I highly recommend Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak!!</li>
            <li> I use this with a foot spa and can honestly say it&#x27;s transformed my previously Hobbit like feet. My toenails look better, my feet are softer and smoother and they smell like little angels have washed them. I use this three times a week now and will never be without it again. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> At first i thought since i should just give it some time but than i realized that it just wasn&#x27;t working. I am a bit bummed of the outcome. unfortunately i would like a refund, maybe to invest in something else that would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product and am looking forward to ordering more when needed. I am in sales and on my feet for sometimes 12 hours. This product has made a huge difference in how my feet hold up each day since I started using this product! Its great would recomend to anyone who are on theit feet as much as I am</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil foot soak was very refreshing on my feet. I am very happy with this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products for nail fungus.  All of them required using creams for months applying 2-3 times a day, changing socks and shoes EVERY day.  This product is simply easy one time a day foot soak, I am seeing results in two weeks and have already reordered.  Product arrived from seller very quickly, also a plus.</li>
            <li> I just received an email from Purely Northwest asking how I liked the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak product and reminding me of their 45 day refund policy if not satisfied.  Great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the foot soak.  It feels wonderful and am hoping it makes the nails look nicer!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Seems to have worked very well bu nails have not grown back yet</li>
            <li> Did wonders on my skin in just a couple of days! I would recommend this to anyone dealing with embarrassing skin fungus.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.This foot soak is very relaxing .I have used it only once so far and hope it will help a nail fungus I have on my big toe. I will update as I have more information.Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is working better for my husband than the expensive prescription foot cream that the podiatrist had him using, plus it makes the feet soft and even exfoliates the heels.  This stuff is amazing!  We&#x27;ve already bought it twice and we&#x27;ll always keep it.</li>
            <li> Very nice treat for your feet. Love the fragrance and it soaks away soreness and leaves feet feeling invigorated and refreshed!</li>
            <li> This works great.  Love it. Highly recommend.  It&#x27;s clearing up the fungus on my toes.  YAY!</li>
            <li> Made my feet feel awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant, soothing treatment to soak my feet in.  It is too soon to tell whether it will help cure my toenail fungus.  It will probably take a few months to see if it helps in this area.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Smells very good  and makes my feet feel wonderful. Customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I read the reviews before purchasing and was so impressed that I bought three jars my first order.  No regrets either.  I was so impressed with this product that I purchased the Purely Northwest Antifungal Soap with Tea Tree Oil.  I have not received it but I expect to be just as pleased.  I will update on that product after using.  Also, someone from Purely Northwest emailed me to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.  Talk about wonderful customer service.  I have tried MANY things before using this and nothing has worked as effectively and so quickly.  As soon as I open my last jar I will order more.  I never want to be without this.  It takes very little of this product so one jar will last quite a while.  Thanks Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom, she loves it. lovely smell</li>
            <li> I am on my second container of this.  I am noticing a little change on my nails. Would have given 5 stars but I don&#x27;t feel I have used it long enough since the fungus is so hard to get rid of.  I will keep using it for a while and if I see a significant change I will update this post.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 8 times over the last couple weeks and really like it! My feet are smoother and are clearing up!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Of you&#x27;re looking to take care of any of your foot issues then look no further, Tea Tree Oil is not only affordable but it is quite potent on stubborn nail fungus and other such issues that are otherwise tough to treat. Give it a shot! Just make sure to follow the instructions,</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I had really itchy feet all the time, my wife would tell me that I would even scratch in my sleep, and after the second day, no more itchy feet... It smells like mint and looks like sea salt, will continue to buy as it helps with tired feet as well :)</li>
            <li> Use everyday and I have the prettiest feet ever.</li>
            <li> This tea has a very nice scent and is soooooooo soothing!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would love it...but haven&#x27;t received the package yet....</li>
            <li> Received timely with no issues or complaints. Your service is appreciated.</li>
            <li> Great product used it and I was very satisfied. Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> My toenails are already clear, skin smooth, and the aroma of the soak is amazing! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, use on hubbies feet bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help stop the fungus under my nail.  I have been soaking my foot twice daily.  first, it seems to be working on the fungus, and second, the foot I have been soaking is smoother and softer than the other so I started soaking both!  I am on my feet all day, and the soaking has been very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Started using this after I got an infection at a mall salon, and my nail is getting better! It also smells very nice and sort of minty.</li>
            <li> Great product , makes your feet feel wonderful and vendor service was fast and friendly</li>
            <li> It worked for my feet! Smell like too! Nice product!</li>
            <li> I have no had it long enough to know if it works to treat nail fungus, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and product is soothing. Smells pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> Made my feet feel really good, and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it will do the trick for me with toenail fungus but it is a very refreshing and clean feeling soak.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to use it every other day so I can get a feel for how well it works on the fungus. Great product, so far.</li>
            <li> works qell with the use of tea tree oil after soaking your feet.</li>
            <li> So far my feet look a lot better but i bought it mainly for toenail fungus and it hasn&#x27;t been all that great</li>
            <li> I have only used this 3 times (once a week) but already am seeing great improvements in the yellowing and toenail thickness.  I&#x27;m not using a fancy foot spa just an old tub where i can cover up to my ankles.  I soak until the waters cold and when I&#x27;m done my feet tingle, feel cool and refreshed.  A miracle in a jar.  Adding another to my next order.</li>
            <li> Nice and soothing- smells good too</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. If I soak in the morning my feet stay cool through much of the day. It is very good stuff for fungal issues. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Took 20 minutes to myself and it was so worth it. Nice scent to it and my feet were very soft afterwards. I plan on doing a foot soak at least once a week. I have very sore feet and they deserve this.</li>
            <li> The soak works great and I look forward to my daily foot soak.  The whole process is very soothing for me after spending 12 hours on my feet.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Very soothing.  Smells very nice, as well.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> It smells very good, my feet are soft and it remove the nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;it needs a measurement cup or  spoon.</li>
            <li> Good product with nice smell.</li>
            <li> Love it! Already reordered!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It is actually beginning to clear up my toenail fungus and tired feet from working so many hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for following up with my purchase ,&lt;br /&gt;Marianne W.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once, but it seemed to really help. I&#x27;m on my feet pretty much all day at work, and it&#x27;s concrete so you know how that can hurt you plus I&#x27;m over 200 lbs. If you&#x27;re using this to get rid of athlete&#x27;s foot, let me share with you some other tips. First, get rid of your sugar intake. I&#x27;m not saying go to zero, but high blood sugar FEEDS fungus. Also, find what medicine yours responds to and apply it as directed. This tea tree oil is just another bullet in the chamber against chronic athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter.  Very  soothing for her feet and relieves itch.</li>
            <li> I love this foot soak.  My feet feel like brand new.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on my toenail fungus.  I&#x27;ve tried everything including very expensive laser treatments with my foot doctor.  So far this seems to be more effective.  I just ordered more and will review again in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Love it! after a busy day there is nothing better than to relax my feet in a tea tree oil foot soak from purely northwest</li>
            <li> I love the light, clean aroma which lingers in the room even after my foot soak. My toenails and feet look super-clean and feel silky smooth. Will definitely order more when I run low!</li>
            <li> Although I ultimately returned this product, I really appreciated their customer service follow up.  As usual, I over-ordered too many products and had to decide to return some of them.  This was not a reflection on this product, which I read great things about, including on webmd.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is one way of battling stinky feet. The other way, believe it or not, VICKS VAPOR rub every night on your stank feet!!! On your toes. On the soles. Stank be gone!!! If you are kept up by the stench of Vick&#x27;s I recommend reading &amp;#34;Dirklus&amp;#34; -- the prologue is crap, but the book is fun!!</li>
            <li> it works for toenail fungus, but slowly. Am on my third jar.</li>
            <li> Love this soak, leaves me feeling refreshed, and relaxed. I also very much appreciated the thoughtful follow up email from this very professional seller. TY for a perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> This foot soak leaves your feet feeling amazing !! My husband uses it as well and he has horrible athletes foot. I have tried every over the counter remedy, prescriptions, and old fashion concoctions and nothing has touched the smell. But I gave this a shot because I love it so much, and it truly works. I am a true believer in this tree oil. I have purchased it a couple of times and am ordering it again.  Awesome buy !</li>
            <li> Love it. Tea tree oil is one of the few homeopathic remedies that works every time.</li>
            <li> great to use in a foot bath at the end of a busy day.  on average I walk 4 miles a day.  This is great</li>
            <li> Too expensive, no result.  Good service.</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel smooth</li>
            <li> Terrific foot soak. My clients love it.  When my clients are happy then so am I.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, and smells great!  The skin on the bottoms of my feet is much softer after just a few days of soaking with this product.  I use it after working out to cool and relieve my tootsies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results of this product. Not only does it soften and heal cracked skin, but it appears to also be healing one very stubborn toenail fungus. I am definitely seeing healthy skin tissue start back. I will continue to use this foot soak even after my feet are happy and healthy again. Terrific scent, as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and even better when you have a chest cold!</li>
            <li> It was a very good product it did what it was supposed too</li>
            <li> great soothing for your feet I think it is working on the nail fungus</li>
            <li> This is a great foot salt, with a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> This product works, it helped me with my foot was hard and very dry. Used it the day I got it and my feet started to clear up from a mild fungal infection that I had. I continued to use as directed and my feet are nice and smooth. Going to reorder as soon as possible, Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great foot soak👍&lt;br /&gt;I have been living with this fungus under my large toenails forever it seems like.  I have tried other things with no lasting progress.  This tea tree soak smells very nice and my nails look great!  Thank you for your product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has a calming smell to it and my feet feel refreshed and so soft after a good soaking.  Nothing like a good soak after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> After a long, tiring day at work, there is nothing like having a wonderful, relaxing soak in my Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak!  If feet could cheer, mine would be their own squad!!</li>
            <li> Read reviews of this product and decided to order it. Soaking feet in this made them feel refreshed and i look forward to seeing positive affects over time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help toe nail fungus</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly brother- in- law who had been complaining about itchy feet (athletes foot?) and also toe fungus. We had bought various things for him to try, but nothing worked. While researching the problem, I came across The Tea Tree Oil foot soak on Amazon.  The reports were so glowing that we decided to buy it. Well, after several soaks, he said that the itchyness is gone, and the fungused toe nail had fallen off and is being replaced with a new toenail. He is not given to unworthy praise, but for this product, he is very enthusiastic, and asked that I buy more. He really likes the fresh feeling after a soak.</li>
            <li> This is great for a relaxing night.  However, if you&#x27;re trying to fight fungus, I would recommend just using pure tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil and put directly on your feet 2 times daily. The Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak with Epsom Salt is too time consuming and expensive.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I soak my feet every few days to combat my pesky barefoot habits and I&#x27;ve noticed that within a few weeks that the cracks and fissures in my calluses have begun to heal, some of them are completely gone. I do use moisturizers and a pumice scrub after each soak, which does speed up the healing process, but adding this soak to my regimen has worked very well. And it smells amazing to boot!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I love to soak my tired and dry feet in it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Leaves your feet feeling soft, refreshed and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overpowering!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;My husband enjoyed a spa treatment with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Actually, I had used another &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; product that helped with athlete&#x27;s foot(which worsens nail fungus),&lt;br /&gt;and it helped. So, haven&#x27;t used your product yet...........S.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, packaged well and preforms as described.  Will continue to use and purchase more as needed.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to know what difference it will make overall but the product seems to work as described. Very soothing. Feet are softer. Glad I am trying this.</li>
            <li> Works perfect with foot spa machine. Really makes your feet feel so clean and soft. It only takes about 2 teaspoons per treatment, definetely satisfied with purchase and plan on buying more after this jar I&#x27;d finished.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  Softens and invigorates tired feet!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. ...feet come out feeling good and smelling good.</li>
            <li> This stiff is amazing. a little expensive, but works  great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dry &amp; cracked feet with peeling skin for years and have used all types of lotions without any success, self-conscious about baring my feet or wearing sandals. I have been using this product for about a month on a daily basis, following the instructions and I must say, WOW my feet are now so smooth, no dryness or cracks, they feel refreshed and now I can bare it all :o) I have ordered 3 of these already and ready to order some more just wish they came in bigger bags. Great product though and totally recommend this to anyone. KUDDOS to this company, very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> got  this for my partner...he was using tea tree oil and the smell was too much for me so I ordered this for him ...much better!</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest foot soaks I have tried.  It smells wonderful and my feet feel so refreshed and tingly.  An absolute must have!!</li>
            <li> Leaves ur feet feeling refreshed &amp; tingly....😍</li>
            <li> Excellent soothing product.</li>
            <li> smells great but too early to tell if it will help get rid of toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot soak! Generous amount. Have tried others but this tea tree oil foot soak is the best on amazon. Have and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fungus on the toes. My Mom used this and she loves it in general (on top of the fungus treatment). She is busy running around all the time so the 15 minutes also gave her a very relaxing break during the break</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil epsom salt bath for my feet feels and smells great.  My feet feel great after the salt bath and hopefully clears my nail fungus that I been treating for the past year.</li>
            <li> I have really bad toenail fungus, and I know it will be a looong process but it *seems* like this stuff is helping--it&#x27;s dissolving the fungus right off my skin and I scrape it off after soaking. Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used has had the same degree of really obvious, visual evidence that it&#x27;s making things better. Also, it makes your feet really soft, and my chronic mild athelete&#x27;s foot is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soothing for my tired feet. I use it a couple times a month. Also helps with rough skin on heels. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly. Feet feel silky in foot bath. Husband &amp; I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the Tea Tree Oil Foot soak.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves feet feeling tingling and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Helps if you suffer from cracked dry feet.</li>
            <li> a very effective relaxing footbath.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but hasn&#x27;t help that much with foot infection. Will followup after the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the difference one use made. I put the indicated amount in my foot spa and followed the directions and wow! Softer, smoother feet in minutes. The aroma of tea tree oil made me feel confident about what it contains and how good it would work since I&#x27;ve used straight tea tree oil in mixes. I am very happy with the results of this product from the first use to weeks later now. It is a wonderful way to spoil yourself with a foot spa along with good ingredients for health. Thank you for this product :)</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  My husband isn&#x27;t faithful about soaking his feet and toes but he has seen an improvement even with what few times he has used it.  we will get it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth what I paid for!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot soak, it leaves my feet feeling rejuvenated, My podiatrist said my feet have never looked better. The item was packed well and delivered on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Good product. Nice therapy for tired feet.</li>
            <li> I have only used 4 times and the difference was seen since the first time. My feet are extremely smooth and almost fungus free.</li>
            <li> Good product, spa quality.</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and clean. Soak my feet every day as I work in retail and on my feet all day, makes my tired feet happy and clean. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product was used with a foot spa and it worked like a charm! I had to use a bucket and dissolve the salt first because the Spa model I have says \\&quot;water only\\&quot;, but once I did it, this stuff literally did exactly what it said it did. I have been having foot problems for a while now, and I wish I would have did this year&#x27;s ago. It hasn&#x27;t even been 24 hours and this stuff is still whoopin feet and not taken names! VERY effective and worth every penny! Would be nice if you offered discounts for regular purchasers because I will be buying this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> Actually felt better on the first try.  Not sure just yet how this will work long-term, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance comforting to use s bath as well s foot soak&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly  Good product</li>
            <li> Salt are goods when placed on the foot bath. it felt amazing</li>
            <li> I find the foot soak very relaxing. I use it at home after a long day or sometimes my own pedicure pretreatment.</li>
            <li> Very soothing in feel and scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my dad&#x27;s feet - he&#x27;s in assisted living and doesn&#x27;t always get a thorough foot wash. He loved the smell, the oils loosened up dirt and gunk, and with a gentle scrubbing with a washcloth his feet were soft and fresh-smelling. Good product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the matter with you? This is the 4th Tea Tree Oil, I&#x27;ve Ordered. Aren&#x27;t you smart enough to figure out what that means. If not - how in the hell did you make such a fine product that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do? I&#x27;ll help you out. I and my feet are very satisfied with Purely Northwest Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this tea tree foot soak product! It is amazing &amp; my feet are baby soft. It smells so wonderful, I feel like I&#x27;m at a spa when I use it. This is the second time I have ordered it &amp; I will order it again. Thanks for your fantastic service!</li>
            <li> This foot soak is great.  I spend a fair amount of time wearing athletic shoes and live in a warm climate. Stripping off socks and shoes and immersing my feet in a basin of this feels downright wonderful. Afterward, it feels even better; my feet feel so clean!  I don&#x27;t have any troublesome foot conditions such as athlete&#x27;s foot, so I can&#x27;t comment on its effect there, but my feet are softer as a result of only a few soaks. It has the distinctive &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; scent, but it is pleasant, not overpowering. This truly is a spa for your feet!</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  My son uses it for ingrown toenails and it helped heal them almost completely! We will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Great, nice, and effective foot soak. Best used with the soap. I had a fungus on my smallest toe nail on my right foot and only this foot soak did the trick!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very stiff menthol smell.  Too expensive and I don&#x27;t notice the benefit.  I will keep trying it, but I still prefer using Johnson&#x27;s foot soap.</li>
            <li> Amazing, the bomb... I have used it two times so far and can already see a difference in my feet...</li>
            <li> Left my feet feeling wonderfully refreshed.  I will be looking forward to my weekly pedicure!</li>
            <li> Had athelets foot for years and this seems to have cured it in 2 weeks. Unbelievable!  Toenailsllol better but certainly not cured yet.  I particularly found helpful simple advice on bag: 1) eliminate socks; 2) stick with it everyday.</li>
            <li> Smells so good &amp; makes me feel relaxed and soothing as I&#x27;m soaking. Did help my feet a little to get smooth but dried skin came back after I stopped using. Don&#x27;t want to depend on this to keep smooth. But overall good product :)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this, works like a charm, make sure to use it every day to expect results!</li>
            <li> Gift for my mom - her feet felt great, and were nice and soft after the soak. I will be trying it next :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used creams, lotions, emery boards and buffers on my heels.  All gave temporary relief for only few days.  Then I found this foot soak and it is THE best product.  I&#x27;ve only used this one time since it arrived and my feet are still in pretty good shape as far as roughness.  I would certainty recommend this product for anyone with rough feet.  I can&#x27;t speak about the Fungus or Athletes feet but for rough dry feet, this is an A+ product. And when you twist off the top, the fragrance reminds me of walking through a peppermint field.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!  My feet have never felt better.</li>
            <li> wonderful, but too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago so I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use it a number of times.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like because I wanted something that had more of a tea tree oil fragrance but after multiple soaks I do indeed like the product!  It feels great when soaking my feet.  Using a pedi egg, a good soak and then cream and my feet are in much better shape.</li>
            <li> I really really really loved this product.  It worked perfectly on a foot nail problem I had.  It is all clear up after a 4 day soak.  Tea Tree Oil Food Soak is also very relaxing and made both my feet feel wonderful.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this so aromatic and nice for a foot soak. It is also nice in a tub bath. It makes the whole area close to bath smell nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write as to the effectiveness of the antifungal properties of this product, but I can comment on how great it is as a soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, &amp;#34;pepperminty&amp;#34; smell from the tea tree oil. It gives off an aroma some will like and some may not. I find it therapeutic. I soak for about a half an hour, at night, while watching TV. When you finish soaking, your skin feels very refreshed and soft. I actually have been looking forward to it at night. When I&#x27;m done soaking, I find it a great time to rub in some actual tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would say that I&#x27;d keep buying it when it&#x27;s gone, but I am very much happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how soft it makes my skin feel. It seems to be helping with my ingrown toe nail as well. I tried Epsom salts alone and that was drying out my skin. This soak does not dry out my skin and it is soothing.</li>
            <li> My feet are in heaven!!!</li>
            <li> Got it for my son&#x27;s smelly feet and seems to work well.  Very fragrant.</li>
            <li> Product is great working is good for me thank you</li>
            <li> havn,t used it but once so far</li>
            <li> Awesome foot soak; would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful foot soak, combine the Epsom Salts with the Tea Tree Oil and it makes my feet feel great. The aroma is very pleasant also. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Really makes your feet feel soothed. I&#x27;m using for nail fungus and it appears to be helping some. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using long enough. Only 4 soaks. Will revisit an update later in time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My tired feet after a long day feel revived and free of impurities after a 20-30 minute soak</li>
            <li> This is a great foot soak. My feet feel smooth and soft afterwards and  it is also very energizing.</li>
            <li> Great soak with added bonus of aromatherapy.  My feet feel so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had been soaking my feet with epsom salt alone and then adding tea tree oil separately.  I love that this has it combined.  It saves a step and appears to do the trick.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. It smells great and leaves your feet feeling refreshed and renewed. Will defiantly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product  that I use and have given as a gift</li>
            <li> The foot soak is very refreshing. I feel it helps with toenail fungus--at least, I hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the follow up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by how well this worked on my nail fungus!  I followed directions about soaking for 20 minutes in warm water nightly and it did the trick!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have only been using it for a week and my feet feel smooth and amazing! The smell of the tea tree oil is soothing and relaxing! I would highly recommend! I have had a little teo nail fungus and even after a week I see a difference!</li>
            <li> This  product, exceeded my expectations. Suffering from itchy feet for years, this calmed all of that !&lt;br /&gt;The tingly sensation felt like it was increasing circulation, which I could use. Love this soak. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have only used it it once!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great foot soak. Helps clean the skin and my toenails are looking better. Great for when you need to relax</li>
            <li> I love this foot soak!!  It is relaxing and soothing!!  I have already purchased 2 more pouches!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product but it&#x27;s kind of expensive for how much you get in the package.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this soak! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i feel that the cost is high for the amount of product received.  That being said, I may make this part of an alternating routine as it is helping to clear what looks to be a fungus on my large toenail.  I hope that by rotating this product with epsom salt/tea tree oil soaks will cure the fungus for good!</li>
            <li> My feet get so soft after I soak them in this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice for soaking your feet and it does help get rid of toe nail fungus.</li>
            <li> has worked quite well for purposes designed , feels good on tired feet</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders, is very easy to use and I am very happy with it.  My feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I have never used a foot soak until just the other day and wow what a difference.  This stuff in hot water is actually soothing for tired feet.  I have stocked up and purchased more so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I use the foot  soak once a week, my feet never felt better since using this product. I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to help get rid of some toenail fungus I seemed to have picked up while pregnant.  I read about the product but didn&#x27;t see anything that mentioned that it should not be used by women to are pregnant or nursing.  However, it clearly states just that on the back of the container.  I returned the product but would be open to trying it once finished nursing.</li>
            <li> The product  exceeded  my expectations and improved the appearance/health of my feet.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is amazing! I had scaly feet and could not get it to go away. I bout this from amazon and was a little skeptical, but after saoling my feet for 20 minutes every night my feet are soft and looking great! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I got this bc of all the positive reviews but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help me with my foot fungus problem. It did however leave my feet feeling soft and smooth. I gave it 4 bc it is a nice product if you want it as a normal foot soak and bc I was able to get a refund which was very nice of them to do :)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot so far. It seems to be working! I like how refreshing it is for my feet too. Very enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> It is still too early to tell the success of this project with curing my nail fungus. It appears to be working at this time but only time will tell</li>
            <li> No refund needed here, it&#x27;s already gone.  Worked exactly as we needed it too. In a weeks time it cleared up my daughter&#x27;s feet that were cracked, itchy and showing signs of athletes foot from wearing wet boots. Thank you for having an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil soak!!  It really leaves your feet feeling refreshed and clean.  I use this when my feet are really tired and they/me need a pick me up, this soak really does the job.  I love the smell of tea tree oil so adding it to epsom salts is a pure bonus...</li>
            <li> Really like the Tea Tree Oil foot soak. My husband&#x27;s feet are looking better already,&lt;br /&gt;and he LOVES to soak his feet on these cold evenings.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because the smell was so bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I tried using it in my garage, but the fact that I was having to place my feet in the solution, did not matter.  The smell was just as great and unbearable.  Only tried the 2 times</li>
            <li> This is so much better than just plain Epsom salt. The tea tree oil provides a nice fragrance while you are soaking your feet. My wife has had a problem with a fungal nail that other remedies just weren&#x27;t touching. This has cleared up her problem, and makes her feet feel better.</li>
            <li> Great stuff--definitely was pleased with it and is helping so far! Thanks for a great product, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! As a former martial artist, a carpenter, powerlifter., and someone who&#x27;s also suffered amputations of most of mytoes, my feet are wrecked. 20-30 minutes soaking in this stuff offers me quite a bit of relief. It not only relieves some of the pain, but my skin seems to benefit from it, too.</li>
            <li> It was unavailable.  However, I have used Dr. Teal&#x27;s other products:  Soaking Solution/w/Rosemary &amp; Mint, Foot cream w/shea butter&lt;br /&gt;and Dr. Teal&#x27;s Soothe &amp; Sleep w/Lavender.  I love all of these..&lt;br /&gt;Teresa Cavanaugh&lt;br /&gt;tgc110633@gmail.com</li>
            <li> great smell, love the anti-fungal effects with foot soaks.</li>
            <li> This salt along with the soap is very very very helpful my right big toe it&#x27;s clearing up and the nail is looking healthier I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now going to take a little time this stuff does not happen overnight you must be very committed and use everyday</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes my feet feel so good and very relaxing to sit and just enjoy a foot bath.  When I am done soaking my feet, they are ready for the next step--exfoliating with my Emjoi.  I think everyone should try this item and enjoy the self pampering of taking care of your feet--remember they take you everywhere you want to go--so treat them special and you won&#x27;t have any regrets!</li>
            <li> This has worked very well to help clear up my son&#x27;s athletes foot!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that my funky feet were instantly rescued after using this foot soak just the first time!!  My girlfriend especially is happier now and I would wager to say that this foot soak is the best solution for foot funk!!</li>
            <li> I had fungus between mt toes and tried everything. This product helps I no longer itch. My mom uses it for her hands, she has a type of cirrhosis adn this product helps her hands. She uses it twice a week for releif. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything it says it is supposed to do.  May as well just use plain water.  Smells Nice!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Smells good, feels good, works great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Got some for my friend&#x27;s birthday.  Can&#x27;t wait for her to try it</li>
            <li> Our whole family LOVES THIS! Great scent! Works great on the feet in a foot soak/massager. Our feet look and feel awesome! It really works and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My husband is using it for his very dry and troubled feet.  After two soaks, he said it was very impressive and his feet are so much better.  He was amazed.  Thank you for such a great product</li>
            <li> Leaves a great finish while I prep my foot while soaking</li>
            <li> This soak is very soothing and leaves feet with a lovely, soft feeling. Would buy again. Thanks for the especially nice service.</li>
            <li> This is my go to after a long day. The smell is strong, but I LOVE it.  I bought this for a nail that has fungus and I have seen a drastic improvement. I love it so much I told my mom and friends and they all bought it.</li>
            <li> Have just started using a foot bath spa, and had used plain epsom salts in it. Then I saw this on Amazon. Makes my tired, sore feet feel so good! I am averaging a 15-minute soak about 4 nights a week. My toenails are looking so much better, Even my shoes feel better, especially now in the summer when I&#x27;m not wearing socks. The smell is great, and the addition of tea tree oil is so healing. I am loving this new treat for my feet!</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this foot soak, it is wonderful and help clear up a white fungus on my big toe nails. But I found the packaging with the zip-lock useless. It won&#x27;t stay closed properly, but the product itself it great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my feet. Softens up my feet and helps with my athletes foot. Would have had five stars if they hadn&#x27;t changed the packaging. The new bag style doesn&#x27;t reseal so I had to put it into a different bag that did. The small round container was much better. But thankfully the product still works great!</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad feet and was really hoping this would help with calluses but after 3 weeks I don&#x27;t see much improvement.  If you&#x27;re treating fungus I recommend it pairing it with a topical solution as well.</li>
            <li> Works great. Even for a guy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This foot soak is the BEST!  I can&#x27;t believe how good my feet feel after using.  I have a problem with one of my big toenails and it&#x27;s looking better after only a couple of soaks. This stuff is amazing, I highly recommend it.  Oh, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, does what it says, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Love this foot soak.  Combined with warm water, this leaves my aching feet feeling refreshed and soft, not to mention the medicinal affect the oil has.  The epsom salts also really help to relieve aches and pain in my feet, as I have arthritis pain in my feet.  I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very STRONG smell....but it works fantastic so far!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works awesome in foot baths especially the deep foot baths that heat the water.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my feet feel wonderful. Hope it will help toenail fungus, it seems a bit better alrady.</li>
            <li> yet to be seen if this helps.</li>
            <li> love it so far. really has been helping me with my feet</li>
            <li> This worked wonders for my husbands athlete&#x27;s foot. He&#x27;s suffered for years but after only three treatments with this soak it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> nice scent!  soften toe nail to ease trimming.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet feel nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth, as far as healing I truly haven&#x27;t seen anything as far as change..</li>
            <li> Gift for mom, she loves it and has asked me to get more. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Overall good product that smells great.  I like the tea tree oil component and that&#x27;s why I chose this product.  Use in a nice warm/hot soak and you&#x27;ll enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I noticed the difference from the first use!  My feet are smoother and cleaner and I am on my way to get rid of the fungus!</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;ve been using this &#x27;magic sauce&#x27; powder for about a week now, and I notice a clear reduction in both how much feet sweat and consequently smell. Before this tea tree oil, I had tried everything under the sun, including sprays and creams -- both natural and otc with minor results at best. This stuff kick all the other products&#x27; butt. Tip: instead of buying a foot tub which costs $50, just go to target and buy a stackable crate. It will hold the water just fine and have enough room for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in toenail coloring yet, but I&#x27;m sure that will happen with continued use.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, can tell a difference yet.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have soaked my feet in epsom salt, then apply tea tree oil medicinally to heal my athlete&#x27;s foot problems.  With this combination, I soak, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see the benefits already as my &amp;#34;moccasin&amp;#34; type athlete&#x27;s foot is on the decline.  If only for this, I am pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this purchase although I don&#x27;t think it would treat nail fungus properly but it does make my feet feel better</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works well although I used it for about two weeks. I use another cream at the same time. It seems that one works very well.</li>
            <li> Makes feet feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> Love this tea tree salt.  Soak my feet in this almost every night after work.  My feet are soft and my toenails look great!  Use this in my Dr. Scholls Pedicure Foot Spa! Ahhhhhhh!</li>
            <li> fast shipment and great product, loved it!!!</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil is soothing and conditioning.  It has helped reduced the swelling and inflammation in my feet.  Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak is an excellent home remedy that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am using it. smelling great. Hope it works</li>
            <li> This is the best foot soak I have ever used and it does what it says,  heals,  soft,  clean smell.  I am sooooo glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well and really is soothing. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I simply love it! It makes my feet feel fresh and it is so easy to pedicure my nails after the soak. I love the fact that it has bacteria and fungus destroying properties. I feel such a change in the feel of my skin on my feet after I use the soak. Great Product!</li>
            <li> So soothing and smells so good!  Very relaxing, and I&#x27;m hopeful it will lessen the discoloration of my big toes (fungus) over time.</li>
            <li> The best way to put this it....BUY IT!  It does work and you will immediately notice the benefits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fragrance and I can&#x27;t tell it helps any more than regular epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two weeks and I must say it has done a great job on soothing my feet, they have become so soft. I purchased this along with the anti fungal wash &amp; topical treatment to treat a toenail fungus on one toe, I know it will take more time to see results from the regimen I am using but so far I&#x27;ve noticed that the toenail is starting to look clearer. Hope it continues to help! So far, I am very pleased with this soak and would recommend it to my friends!  Fast delivery and excellent customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> Ooh, such delightful pleasure!  It so closely mimics my professional pedicure that it can only be described as Pedi Bliss.  I have advanced tendonitis and another minor condition in my left foot and I wear orthotics. I prefer orthotic open shoes or sandals for health&#x27;s sake and I want my feet to be attractive.  Your product give me happy and healthy feet at the same time.  I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to buy a larger quantity at a discount because this will be a periodic regimen for me, probably every 5-7 days.  Thank you for listening.</li>
            <li> I been using it twice a week. In two weeks, I cannot say it works, However, it does leave my feet feeling better. I also use another foot soak. Both in warm water for 20 minutes. I like how it feels. Will come back and post again. Tommorow I have another laser on toe nails. I also use formula 3 and tea tree oil along with biotin. Yes! I&#x27;m serious about getting rid of this. Once or twice weekly I use a magnifying glass on my toe nails. I also sand them down very well. If anyone knows of anthing else let me know.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my feet! This soak made my feet soft and helped clear up my toe nail issues, both the ingrown nail and the fungus. It was especially great to use during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  I was having some issues, at the time, with swelling in my feet, so I bought one of the foot bath tubs and then added this Tea Tree Oil salts to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it one afternoon and it was really great.  The smell is very pleasant and the granuals melting in the hot water fast, so no clogging on the foot tub unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only one use, my feet felt so much better and the next morning, all the swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this, to anyone.  It is very good quality and gave very good results on the very first try.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff for your feet.  It has a very strong smell but very relaxing it is.  When mine is gone I will reorder this.  My feet feel very soft when done and then I follow up with a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Love the product!</li>
            <li> Very nice foot and body soak. Feet felt great after first soak. Contains all the good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely  awesome👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very happy with this product! After the very first use my feet were totally soft. It removed most of the dead skin and dryness. I received the package in a timely fashion. I will continue to use and I will reorder when I run out. I plan on ordering a bag for my mom to pamper her sore feet. She has diabetes &amp; I know this product will impress her. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on her feet.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, in just a few treatments it cleared up the rough skin on my feet, also as a side benefit every time I complete my soak it feels like I have a brand new pair of feet!!!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bag. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great on your achy  feet. My husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> As described, has a distinctive scent that you need to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I only really give it this review because it didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping and that is help me with my toe fungus. Other than give a unique clean feeling after I used it, it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I was noticing some whiteness on my toenails and knowing what my dad&#x27;s look like now I wanted to jump on this right away and prevent any fungus from growing. After using this soak for just a few days I was noticing it was disappearing! My nails feel stronger and my feet which could sometimes be a little stinky from being cooped up in boots all day haven&#x27;t be stinky at all! I was worried that it might have been a bit of athletes foot developing, but this certainly helped to keep my feet feeling and smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend wears heavy boots to work every day and let&#x27;s just say his feet don&#x27;t exactly smell like flowers!  I convinced him to try soaking his feet with this last night and he loved it! He said he feet feel so nice and that I have something nice going on with this soak...</li>
            <li> This foot soak work good thanks guys</li>
            <li> Great stuff for ssoaking your feet.  It worked as a disinfectant and my feet feel so soft after soaking for 20-30 minutes.  I ued this in conjunction with the Manuka oil on a wound on the side of my foot.  Between the two, the wound has completely healed.  I really like this foot soak.  And, it smells so clean!</li>
            <li> My feet are noticeably softer after a week and I will continue to use it an update everyone.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Used it as a foot soak and my feet are fresh and clean.  While I don&#x27;t care for tea tree smell normally I really didn&#x27;t notice it.  All I could smell was peppermint and lavender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times.  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Nice foot soak...smells like a spa in my house! :)</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful smell when dissolved in water and really helps with tired feet after a great soak in warm water and the Tea oil/epsom salt. I really like the product. Also seems to help if you have a bit of nail fungus starting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Tea Tree Oil foot soak for about a month now and am very happy with the results.  It&#x27;s so soothing to soak my feet after being on them all day.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Seems to be working as we watch the toe nail grow out. Smells wonderful and I dump the water on my outdoor plants when done.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes feet feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Great item.  This item was given as a gift, and the receiver really likes it, finds it comparable to other brands.  Will purchase again, and consider the company&#x27;s other items.</li>
            <li> This is a great soak! Makes my feet feel very soft and it&#x27;s very relaxing to use.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering.  Definitely a must if you have tired, achy feet.</li>
            <li> this foot soak seems to help a lot with the toenail funus</li>
            <li> I have used this foot soak every day since I received it and my feet feel relaxed and refreshed after a nice long soak.  It has a pleasant odor and leaves your feet feeling soft and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;But it has done nothing to kill the toenail fungus, and that was my major concern.  I do use a topical treatment in addition to the foot soak, but there does not seem to be any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product as an effective foot soak, but, unfortunately, not as an effective treatment for toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Love it! The best soak I ever tried! Athletes foot is gone, feet look awesome after first use.</li>
            <li> Love your guarantee have not tried it yet</li>
            <li> Nice for the foot bath.</li>
            <li> oh my lordy lord! WHERE was this ALL MY LIFE??!! I am 28 years old and i wish i wouldve known about this sooner!! This is absolute wonderfulness in a jar! I used it last night for the first time and the results were impressive. NICE SMELLING, BABY SOFT FEET, VERY CLEAN FEET, AND NICER HEALTHIER TOE NAILS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont know about u but im self conscious about smelly body parts and this is a total confidence booster! I want to order 5 more to give as gifts to family! :D by the way i ordered this with a dish tray that was $6 and my feet fit just fine (im a womens size 8) i soaked my feet for 30 minutes (boy time passes fast when youre on your ipad!) this will deff be part of my night routine from now on.</li>
            <li> Omg!! I have been fight nail fungus for 15 years and this has been the only thing I have ever used that is working!!! It also has made my Alligator feet soft and smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt :) I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Both my feet and my bf&#x27;s feet get dry and itchy after working all day.  Soaked in warm water for about 30 min with about 2 Tbs of this and the itchiness went away. Will take repeated treatments over time but so far this is the best foot soak we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Using this to soak my feet, Then using Amazing herbs Black Seed oil to moisturize. Seems to be doing the trick. Softening my feet equals less aches from dry skin etc.  I&#x27;m diabetic and suffer from neuropathy and foot pain (swelling) and noticed a difference after the first week. I&#x27;ll be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything to control toe nail fungus, but the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak seems to have it under slowed down.  Hopefully, continued use will eventually get rid of it.  Plus it&#x27;s a nice quite 15 minutes in my day.</li>
            <li> Makes your feet really soft</li>
            <li> I had some foot fungus on the bottom of my toes that was pretty nasty (yellow stains on socks/feet smelling really bad). I used this tea tree foot oil &amp; some apple cider vinegar. I filled a bucket w/ hot water, added this tea tree oil, added apple cider vinegar, and let my feet soak while I played games on steam for ~30 minutes daily. Problem went away in a week. I had been battling this foot fungus for ~1 year before I found this product. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I live in a very dry desert environment in the southwest of Texas, and my feet are constantly cracking (TMI) and nothing I have found helps. Well, recently I bought a foot bath product and also ordered the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak. After about three weeks of use, I am amazed at the results. I add a tablespoon of the oil soak to each bath and use it nightly, and the cracking, dry skin, splitting heels, etc., are all gone! It is a wonderful product, and I must say that the customer service and level of communication with customers is simply the best. Purely Northwest is always there for you should you have any problem with their product.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this company and their product.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected, and the company contacted me to make sure we were satisfied with the product. My husband loves the smell and it seems to work great. We are very satisfied and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great Product , Loved it !!!</li>
            <li> only used once seams to work smells good</li>
            <li> Love this foot soak!  This was my second order and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.  Arrives quickly and well packaged.  It is rather expensive for the amount but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, Soothing, great foot soak.</li>
            <li> So far I used it once, but seems to help very good.  I will order more as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using using the Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve notice that the the fungus I had one a few toes has really started to clear up, I would recommend using it for more that 2 weeks to make sure it clears.  I have the fungus for over a year now and its nice to see it go away.</li>
            <li> Seems to help soften the skin and nails, leaves my feet feeling great.</li>
            <li> This product was as advertised. Very fast shipping.</li>
