            <li>Wonderful and So Soft!!</li>
            <li>Best soft bristled brush I can find.</li>
            <li>Love that these are made from recycled materials, but I wish the company still made it easy to return them for re-recycling!</li>
            <li>These are very good Ultra Soft toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love Preserve tootbrushes, ultra-soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>I have been buying these for many years.  </li>
            <li>I just love the concept of buying something that we all need and being about to recycle them.  </li>
            <li>and if I can get him to switch to these I won&#x27;t have as many used ones in the trash or under the sink for cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about this design - I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but now I love these.  </li>
            <li>I also love that these are recycled and come with return postage packaging.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the angle on the head, but I&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to it after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Well I found them on Amazon and am thoroughly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have been using preserve toothbrushes ever since I discovered them 5 or more years ago.</li>
            <li>Really do love these</li>
            <li>I love this concept.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can recycle the brush when I&#x27;m through using it.</li>
            <li>I love that these are so easily recycled, too.</li>
            <li>The angle is perfect, the size is just right to be effective on each tooth, and they are truly soft, right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m more interested in &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; products and a fan of recycling, this find thrilled me.</li>
            <li>I will order again when I need more and thank you for being available.</li>
            <li>in addition to that, I also feel better about helping to keep our earth clean by recycling the used toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>so their easy recycling is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Usually</li>
            <li>They are so very soothing to use and kind for the environment to boot :)</li>
            <li>Of course I went on-line and one of my favorite sites (Amazon) popped up with their special</li>
            <li>.which is fine.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fine.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>A great price for an American made product.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are so kind and gentle to my gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easily my favorite one ever, and I didn&#x27;t really think I could even have a favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy brushing my teeth with Preserve toothbrushes, the bristles are soft and feel very good not stiff and abrasive like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see the concept and went ahead and ordered</li>
            <li>I love that I can mail them back in their own postage free mailer so they can be recycled.  </li>
            <li>but now I have to special order in bulk.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to get used to, but this is very gentle brush, good for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Nice soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>and I tried other brands, after not being happy with any of them I&#x27;ve returned to the Preserve family</li>
            <li>Super soft and great for sensitive gums, but you can get these for about $1 each at a drugstore.</li>
            <li>These are soft and great for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>They were the right softness so they clean without making my gums sore or damaged.</li>
            <li>Great for those with less enamel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very soft, environment friendly and you can easily buy them</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I had been able to pick these up at a local store, and I absolutely loved them, the design is simple and I cannot explain why</li>
            <li>The design is very simple and effective.</li>
            <li>I love these soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The angle makes it easy to get to the back of your mouth and the ultrasoft ones are easy on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The handle is ergonomically designed so that the head is at the right angle for brushing.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>Other popular brand name toothbrushes labeled as soft really are not as good if you need gentle cleaning that doesn&#x27;t hurt gums.</li>
            <li>Make it easy to recycle again &amp; I&#x27;ll recycle them again, until then I will just use them given the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I love the softness of these brushes but the bristles are so narrow; I prefer wider bristles for a better coverage.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes have nice soft bristles for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>able to order several at a time is convenient as well</li>
            <li>These work pretty well</li>
            <li>you are buiyng for the first time, I recommend you to take the travel case one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>replace our toothbrushes at the first of every month</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Preserve toothbrush about 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li>but they get pretty beat up after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Preserve toothbrush for more than 10 years and all of a sudden my city stopped carrying them in all stores.</li>
            <li>I have purchased these toothbrushes before and am back for more.</li>
            <li>use the soft instead of the super soft, but both are easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t been able to adjust to the flat design of the handle.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes are not very soft, but these truly are.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i personally quit using them because although gentle on the gums, they were too soft to clean in between my teeth &amp; gum good enough</li>
            <li>Received item in fast time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li>I wish the handles were straight instead of curved backward</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite ironic, the brush head</li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t really care for these</li>
            <li>I have mouth problems and the extra soft toothbrush help me to control most of the problems that take place.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t know how well these will actually clean our teeth overall</li>
            <li>I am using Preserve ultra Soft toothbrushes since 2010 when I first tried them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they really need one more row of bristles to make the brushing surface just a little bit wider.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second order &amp; I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Handles are made of recycled plastic and can be sent back to company for further recycling so leaves a very small ecological footprint and is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I buy the brushes in multiples, so that I always have them around and can have a new brush every month, as my dentist advises.</li>
            <li>I use a new one every month</li>
            <li>The design handle works much better than the regular straight handles and the ultra soft is softer than any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>so excellent soft and durable, and the handle so bad and unimaginative.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very very soft (unlike those of the store brands).</li>
            <li>The price could be better, as the tech is pretty low &amp; it&#x27;s not a flashy brush or anything, no cushy grip, no varying length bristles, no tongue cleaner . .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and ecofriendly, and they get the job done.</li>
            <li>the brush&#x27;s angle truly offers nothing in the way of efficiency.  </li>
            <li>they are soft and dont damage gums</li>
            <li>These are truly soft brushes that my dentist recommended i use.</li>
            <li>The 1st toothbrush I bought was ULTRA SOFT, but these newer ones are not as soft.  </li>
            <li>I like the availability of ultra soft.  </li>
            <li>Try to locate realy, really soft toothbrushes for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>These are ultra soft allowing me to brush my teeth without any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several years now and really like them.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I could get extra soft which are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It DOES look cool but does not easily fit into any sort of toothbrush holder either.</li>
            <li>However, they are still softer than any soft or ultra soft (if you can find them) purchased at any local stores.  </li>
            <li>The fun part is that you can put 6 tothbrushes into an empty water bottle &amp; mail them back to Preserve.</li>
            <li>They have the extra soft bristles I need for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these extra soft toothbrushes for years!</li>
            <li>The brushes are quite soft but have a square head and cover my teeth better than all those new angled, weirdly shaped ones do.</li>
            <li>I buy the ultrasoft, and they actually are soft.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s soft enough for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old toohbrushes can be mailed back to be turned into disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Only brush (ultrasoft) that is soft enough not to damage gums and firm enough to scrub clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find very soft bristle brushes for adults, so I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>our third order, husband loves them and will only used these ultra soft toothbrushes now..</li>
            <li>Been use electronic brush for many years and last year my gum recession started to getting a lot worse.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful you don&#x27;t brush too hard around the gums or it will tear them up unlike the colgate extra soft which is easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>but, I am not one to brush after every meal so i do plan on maybe using a tougher bristle brush once a week on back teeth because i kinda have it my brain that these are way too soft to properly scrape away stuck on foods back there ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to finally be brushing our teeth with it not resulting in our gums getting scratched up from the tough bristles of other brushes that would leave our gums bleeding afterwards..</li>

            <li> but they get pretty beat up after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Preserve toothbrush for more than 10 years and all of a sudden my city stopped carrying them in all stores.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these toothbrushes before and am back for more.</li>
            <li> use the soft instead of the super soft, but both are easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t been able to adjust to the flat design of the handle.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes are not very soft, but these truly are.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i personally quit using them because although gentle on the gums, they were too soft to clean in between my teeth &amp; gum good enough</li>
            <li> Received item in fast time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li> I wish the handles were straight instead of curved backward</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite ironic, the brush head</li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t really care for these</li>
            <li> I have mouth problems and the extra soft toothbrush help me to control most of the problems that take place.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t know how well these will actually clean our teeth overall</li>
            <li> I am using Preserve ultra Soft toothbrushes since 2010 when I first tried them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they really need one more row of bristles to make the brushing surface just a little bit wider.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second order &amp; I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Handles are made of recycled plastic and can be sent back to company for further recycling so leaves a very small ecological footprint and is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I buy the brushes in multiples, so that I always have them around and can have a new brush every month, as my dentist advises.</li>
            <li> I use a new one every month</li>
            <li> The design handle works much better than the regular straight handles and the ultra soft is softer than any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> so excellent soft and durable, and the handle so bad and unimaginative.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very very soft (unlike those of the store brands).</li>
            <li> The price could be better, as the tech is pretty low &amp; it&#x27;s not a flashy brush or anything, no cushy grip, no varying length bristles, no tongue cleaner . .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and ecofriendly, and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> the brush&#x27;s angle truly offers nothing in the way of efficiency.  </li>
            <li> they are soft and dont damage gums</li>
            <li> These are truly soft brushes that my dentist recommended i use.</li>
            <li> The 1st toothbrush I bought was ULTRA SOFT, but these newer ones are not as soft.  </li>
            <li> I like the availability of ultra soft.  </li>
            <li> Try to locate realy, really soft toothbrushes for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> These are ultra soft allowing me to brush my teeth without any irritation afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several years now and really like them.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I could get extra soft which are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It DOES look cool but does not easily fit into any sort of toothbrush holder either.</li>
            <li> However, they are still softer than any soft or ultra soft (if you can find them) purchased at any local stores.  </li>
            <li> The fun part is that you can put 6 tothbrushes into an empty water bottle &amp; mail them back to Preserve.</li>
            <li> They have the extra soft bristles I need for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these extra soft toothbrushes for years!</li>
            <li> The brushes are quite soft but have a square head and cover my teeth better than all those new angled, weirdly shaped ones do.</li>
            <li> I buy the ultrasoft, and they actually are soft.</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s soft enough for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The old toohbrushes can be mailed back to be turned into disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Only brush (ultrasoft) that is soft enough not to damage gums and firm enough to scrub clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find very soft bristle brushes for adults, so I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> our third order, husband loves them and will only used these ultra soft toothbrushes now..</li>
            <li> Been use electronic brush for many years and last year my gum recession started to getting a lot worse.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful you don&#x27;t brush too hard around the gums or it will tear them up unlike the colgate extra soft which is easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> but, I am not one to brush after every meal so i do plan on maybe using a tougher bristle brush once a week on back teeth because i kinda have it my brain that these are way too soft to properly scrape away stuck on foods back there ..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to finally be brushing our teeth with it not resulting in our gums getting scratched up from the tough bristles of other brushes that would leave our gums bleeding afterwards..</li>
            <li> The brush is a nice, no frills toothbrush, no gum massagers or other weird things they put on toothbrushes these days.  </li>
            <li> I really like the curved handle and the small brush head that allow me to get around to the back of my molars.</li>
            <li> After years of brushing too hard with medium and soft bristles, I was instructed by my dentist to use only EXTRA soft.</li>
            <li> I usually get them at Whole Foods but</li>
            <li> These are not SOFT toothbrushes regardless of label...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long these will hold up</li>
            <li> The odd angle of the handle makes it a bit difficult to get used to, but the very oft bristles were exactly what I was looking for after gum repair.</li>
            <li> I have issues with my gums so even the soft toothbrushes were too stiff.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Handle shape was awkward at first but, felt natural by second use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Nimbus Microfine but it hurt my gums [see other review], so it&#x27;s back to Preserve.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t the handle be round rather than flat?</li>
            <li> Regret the purchase and just not worth returning so they will just become grout cleaners for the bathroom shower.  </li>
            <li> The handle design, however, is just two, making an average of 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I like the minimalist design, but then take down the price too.</li>
            <li> which is why I&#x27;m taking a star down).</li>
            <li> I usually use the colgate extra soft toothbrushes, but they have gotten so expensive ($5 each)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lame how they made the recycling aspect more difficult (</li>
            <li> unlike all the other dozen plus brands we tried that claimed to be!!</li>
            <li> It is too flexible and the angle is completely not comfortable or practical for brushing your teeth well.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find ultra soft toothbrushes in a retail store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing preserve toothbrushes for the past couple of years-they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, which I wanted but the curve of the handle is just awkward.  </li>
            <li> but the head is overly small and</li>
            <li> I was sorry when my local Target stopped carrying them</li>
            <li> Also hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have an issue when I get stressed out of brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the issue with the electronic toothbrush, but just want to have a change to stop my gum recession from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Just NOT a great design or product.  </li>
            <li> It turns around uncomfortably in my hand and every brushing time has become a chore!</li>
            <li> The angle of the handle on these brushes makes this impossible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use these all the time, great!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves em, but not as durable as she runs though a 3 pack of them in 3 to 4 months</li>
            <li> Love that these are made from recycled materials, but I wish the company still made it easy to return them for re-recycling!</li>
            <li> Received item in fast time.  The item is exactly what I was looking for.  Whenever I run out of this type of toothbrush, I&#x27;ll make the purchase through Amazon again.  Great experience!</li>
            <li> Made in USA and they recycle - not to mention they work.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrushes. They&#x27;re soft and ecofriendly, and they get the job done. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had been able to pick these up at a local store, and I absolutely loved them, the design is simple and I cannot explain why but I really enjoy brushing my teeth with Preserve toothbrushes, the bristles are soft and feel very good not stiff and abrasive like others I&#x27;ve used. When my local store stopped carrying these I was a bit lost and I tried other brands, after not being happy with any of them I&#x27;ve returned to the Preserve family and I now order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to order several at a time is convenient as well so it kind of works out.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used. The design handle works much better than the regular straight handles and the ultra soft is softer than any other brands I have tried. I also like that they are made from recycled plastic. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I love Preserve tootbrushes, ultra-soft bristles. Most &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes are not very soft, but these truly are. I love them!</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to get used to, but this is very gentle brush, good for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Best soft bristled brush I can find. I&#x27;ve tried the Nimbus Microfine but it hurt my gums [see other review], so it&#x27;s back to Preserve. The price could be better, as the tech is pretty low &amp; it&#x27;s not a flashy brush or anything, no cushy grip, no varying length bristles, no tongue cleaner . . .which is fine. I like the minimalist design, but then take down the price too. It&#x27;s lame how they made the recycling aspect more difficult (which is why I&#x27;m taking a star down). I used to send them back when the postage was on the wrapper but now that they have you go to a site &amp; print yourself I just throw them in the trash. Make it easy to recycle again &amp; I&#x27;ll recycle them again, until then I will just use them given the soft bristles. Also hard to find. I use to buy them at Target but now I have to special order in bulk.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes worked fine for me. They were the right softness so they clean without making my gums sore or damaged. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Only brush (ultrasoft) that is soft enough not to damage gums and firm enough to scrub clean.</li>
            <li> I love the softness of these brushes but the bristles are so narrow; I prefer wider bristles for a better coverage.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles.  Nothing fancy.  Handles are made of recycled plastic and can be sent back to company for further recycling so leaves a very small ecological footprint and is a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find very soft bristle brushes for adults, so I&#x27;m glad I found this product. I buy the brushes in multiples, so that I always have them around and can have a new brush every month, as my dentist advises.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth brushes. A great price for an American made product.</li>
            <li> Great for those with less enamel. Helps promote softer brushing.</li>
            <li> After years of brushing too hard with medium and soft bristles, I was instructed by my dentist to use only EXTRA soft. Because I&#x27;m more interested in &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; products and a fan of recycling, this find thrilled me. Absolutely love! Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these extra soft toothbrushes for years! I&#x27;ve never found a better toothbrush. I love the colors and the feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these brushes exclusively for years now. I have an issue when I get stressed out of brushing too hard. The angle of the handle on these brushes makes this impossible. I haven&#x27;t had gum issues since I&#x27;ve started using these.</li>
            <li> The odd angle of the handle makes it a bit difficult to get used to, but the very oft bristles were exactly what I was looking for after gum repair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing preserve toothbrushes for the past couple of years-they&#x27;re my favourite brushes.  I highly recommend giving them a try!</li>
            <li> I usually use the colgate extra soft toothbrushes, but they have gotten so expensive ($5 each) I thought I would try something different. These work pretty well but you have to be careful you don&#x27;t brush too hard around the gums or it will tear them up unlike the colgate extra soft which is easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful toothbrushes. I buy the ultrasoft, and they actually are soft. I usually get them at Whole Foods but the deal here on Amazon for a six-pack is too good to pass up. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, which I wanted but the curve of the handle is just awkward.  If they were just a bit straighter, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just amazing. The price is just as competitive as any toothbrush you can pick up in the supermarket. The design is very simple and effective. The bristles are very very soft (unlike those of the store brands). And it&#x27;s eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> Just NOT a great design or product.  It is too flexible and the angle is completely not comfortable or practical for brushing your teeth well.  I was excited to see the concept and went ahead and ordered but the head is overly small and the brush&#x27;s angle truly offers nothing in the way of efficiency.  Regret the purchase and just not worth returning so they will just become grout cleaners for the bathroom shower.  It DOES look cool but does not easily fit into any sort of toothbrush holder either.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for many years.  I really like the curved handle and the small brush head that allow me to get around to the back of my molars. And they are made from recycled yogurt cups.</li>
            <li> These are very good Ultra Soft toothbrushes.  I am happy with my purchase.  They clean my teeth very well.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I just love the concept of buying something that we all need and being about to recycle them.  My husband goes through alot of toothbrushes and if I can get him to switch to these I won&#x27;t have as many used ones in the trash or under the sink for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Super soft and great for sensitive gums, but you can get these for about $1 each at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> have always loved these toothbrushes.  they are soft and dont damage gums</li>
            <li> I am using Preserve ultra Soft toothbrushes since 2010 when I first tried them.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft, environment friendly and you can easily buy them online.&lt;br /&gt;If you are buiyng for the first time, I recommend you to take the travel case one.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have nice soft bristles for my sensitive teeth. I like the fact that they are recyclable and are made from recycled plastic. I was sorry when my local Target stopped carrying them and I&#x27;m glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are soft and great for sensitive teeth and gums. We love that they are recyclable, too!</li>
            <li> Been use electronic brush for many years and last year my gum recession started to getting a lot worse. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the issue with the electronic toothbrush, but just want to have a change to stop my gum recession from getting worse. After a lot of searching and reading, I decided to give this one a try. And I&#x27;m happy I did. I love it. It brushes my teeth cleaner than the electronic one and my gum condition has improved. in addition to that, I also feel better about helping to keep our earth clean by recycling the used toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Our dentist gives us revealing tablets that we use to see how well our brushing is getting all the plaque off, and these brushes work well for our entire family.&lt;br /&gt;We replace our toothbrushes at the first of every month so their easy recycling is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Usually use the soft instead of the super soft, but both are easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> I wish the handles were straight instead of curved backward and they really need one more row of bristles to make the brushing surface just a little bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;The degree of softness is perfect however.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  Never thought I would write a review of toothbrushes but here I am.  There&#x27;s something about this design - I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the angle or not but it only took me a day or so and I realized I really liked it.  I also love that I could get extra soft which are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  I love that I can mail them back in their own postage free mailer so they can be recycled.  I will continue to purchase these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but now I love these.  The angle is perfect, the size is just right to be effective on each tooth, and they are truly soft, right out of the box.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> These are truly soft brushes that my dentist recommended i use. Other popular brand name toothbrushes labeled as soft really are not as good if you need gentle cleaning that doesn&#x27;t hurt gums.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine. Not the best I have ever used, not the worst by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I was buying those toothbrushes was the recycling program. I felt good being able to recycle effectively. The program HAS EFFECTIVELY ENDED. Despite claims on the packaging, Preserve will no longer dispatch the postage paid envelopes for the toothbrushes. Talk about a letdown.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Preserve toothbrush about 3 years ago.  Local stores stopped carrying them about 2 years ago, so I&#x27;ve been ordering from Amazon.  The 1st toothbrush I bought was ULTRA SOFT, but these newer ones are not as soft.  However, they are still softer than any soft or ultra soft (if you can find them) purchased at any local stores.  I also love that these are recycled and come with return postage packaging.</li>
            <li> Softer than the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; level toothbrush you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, but I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;ultra soft&amp;#34; is a bit of hyperbole. In any case, it&#x27;s soft enough for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the angle on the head, but I&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to it after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush with an ultrasoft bristle. I love that these are so easily recycled, too.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easily my favorite one ever, and I didn&#x27;t really think I could even have a favorite toothbrush. The angle makes it easy to get to the back of your mouth and the ultrasoft ones are easy on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and So Soft!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted...no surprises.</li>
            <li> I like the availability of ultra soft.  I use a new one every month but they get pretty beat up after just two weeks.  The best toothbrush I have found.</li>
            <li> These are not SOFT toothbrushes regardless of label...they are medium for my mouth. Try to locate realy, really soft toothbrushes for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I love these soft toothbrushes. I have tried others and always come back to these.</li>
            <li> The brush head itself is a five stars. The handle design, however, is just two, making an average of 3 stars. Months now and I still haven&#x27;t been able to adjust to the flat design of the handle. It turns around uncomfortably in my hand and every brushing time has become a chore! Why can&#x27;t the handle be round rather than flat? It&#x27;s quite ironic, the brush head so excellent soft and durable, and the handle so bad and unimaginative.</li>
            <li> I keep buying them for a reason.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find ultra soft toothbrushes in a retail store.  Well I found them on Amazon and am thoroughly satisfied.  I have issues with my gums so even the soft toothbrushes were too stiff.  These are ultra soft allowing me to brush my teeth without any irritation afterwards.  This is my second order &amp; I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for several years now and really like them.  I use a diamond sonic in the morning and a preserve at night.  I make my own toothpaste and have been getting excellent reviews from my hygienist so all is good.  The brushes are quite soft but have a square head and cover my teeth better than all those new angled, weirdly shaped ones do.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are so kind and gentle to my gums. They are so very soothing to use and kind for the environment to boot :)</li>
            <li> I have used the Preserve toothbrush for more than 10 years and all of a sudden my city stopped carrying them in all stores. Of course I went on-line and one of my favorite sites (Amazon) popped up with their special and I ordered them. I have mouth problems and the extra soft toothbrush help me to control most of the problems that take place. I will order again when I need more and thank you for being available. I would never have thought that Amazon would carry my best toothbrush. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I have been using preserve toothbrushes ever since I discovered them 5 or more years ago. The handle is ergonomically designed so that the head is at the right angle for brushing. These toothbrushes ar emade from recycled plastic (Stoney Field Farm yogut containers). The old toohbrushes can be mailed back to be turned into disposable razors. The fun part is that you can put 6 tothbrushes into an empty water bottle &amp; mail them back to Preserve.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long these will hold up and i don&#x27;t know how well these will actually clean our teeth overall but, I don&#x27;t really care for these are really actually soft/ultrasoft unlike all the other dozen plus brands we tried that claimed to be!! it&#x27;s nice to finally be brushing our teeth with it not resulting in our gums getting scratched up from the tough bristles of other brushes that would leave our gums bleeding afterwards..&lt;br /&gt;Handle shape was awkward at first but, felt natural by second use. Really do love these but, I am not one to brush after every meal so i do plan on maybe using a tougher bristle brush once a week on back teeth because i kinda have it my brain that these are way too soft to properly scrape away stuck on foods back there ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: our third order, husband loves them and will only used these ultra soft toothbrushes now..&lt;br /&gt;i personally quit using them because although gentle on the gums, they were too soft to clean in between my teeth &amp; gum good enough and i could see plaque starting to build up in some areas..</li>
            <li> I love this concept.  The brush is a nice, no frills toothbrush, no gum massagers or other weird things they put on toothbrushes these days.  I love that I can recycle the brush when I&#x27;m through using it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these toothbrushes before and am back for more. They have the extra soft bristles I need for my sensitive gums.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
