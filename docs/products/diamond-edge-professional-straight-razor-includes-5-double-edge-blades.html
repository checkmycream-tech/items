            <li>Good grip.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
            <li>This knife still cuts good.....</li>
            <li>It was a good purchase</li>
            <li>The razor is relatively good quality for the price that it is.</li>
            <li>and I Loved the price.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>the razor&#x27;s everything else was good.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>the brush is amazing</li>
            <li>Although it feels quite flimsy, this is actually an excellent starter for straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle was all scratched up and some kind of a residue was all over it</li>
            <li>Nice item, kind of flimsy but for this price you shouldn&#x27;t be expecting S.T. Dupont.</li>
            <li>He always liked them</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;light&lt;br /&gt;it fits my hands( which are the size of bears paws ) but its not big nor small&lt;br /&gt;it was a good price and the shipping was excellent</li>
            <li>It seems to be pretty good quality!</li>
            <li>Really easy to replace the blade and excellent for a first time user.</li>
            <li>Very good straight razor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute and handy</li>
            <li>vary nice once i learn to use it better  </li>
            <li>However, for the price point, the convenience, and all practical points, this feels like a great first step towards purchasing one.  </li>
            <li>Product was great shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>very cheaply made and all this is is a plastic handle with a razor blade attached to it.  </li>
            <li>Its very light and flimsy</li>
            <li>I do better with my Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>There are eight more words required, so im fulfilling the requirement</li>
            <li>It got 4 stars because I cut myself (though that&#x27;s more on me than anything</li>
            <li>the best balance in the word but for only $6 I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Works okay except that the razor blade doesn&#x27;t always sit evenly after replacement until fiddled with.</li>
            <li>There are better options out there</li>
            <li>I love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li>Great for entry level straight razor.</li>
            <li>Could it be better,</li>
            <li>sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perhaps not the most elegant, but for $6 it is damn sturdy and has done the job</li>
            <li>I just wanted to see if shaving this way would be way better.</li>
            <li>Love that it has replaceable blades</li>
            <li>so I thought he would enjoy having one of his own.</li>
            <li>Okay product is better then what i expected&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;its more than u can ask for in the price</li>
            <li>love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li>I love the soap</li>
            <li>I love the bowl</li>
            <li>Will spend another $10 to get a better one.</li>
            <li>I love using it to shave</li>
            <li>-- it bugs me more that the handle would still look crappy</li>
            <li>Mostly practical, but lacking nostalgia, it cuts whiskers.  </li>
            <li>This was a Gift to my other Son,He Loves It,and got a very Nice Smooth Shave.!!!</li>
            <li>It gives a close consistent shave (I use Feather blades) and feels good.  </li>
            <li>it works pretty good</li>
            <li>I plan to get a better one since this one feels cheap.</li>
            <li>It will take the hair off your face, but doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the Parker disposable straight razor does.</li>
            <li>but it shaves very well and is good for a shaving novice.</li>
            <li>and it really does the job good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it comes with 5 blade replacements, which is good, but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much.</li>
            <li>The plastic handle feels cheap and bends more easily than the cap for a gallon of milk.</li>
            <li>Sure it is made of plastic and not high end but was surprising how effective it was and the price could not be much better.</li>
            <li>provides a close shave and is easy to use for beginners.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to angle and reach every spot...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right and works great thanks a lot</li>
            <li>This is my first time to own one and to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Been using this holster for my razor blades and works perfect , had to buy another because I lost my previous one .</li>
            <li>then this is fine to try out</li>
            <li>Plastic keeps it light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Pretty good nothing to right home about but gets the job done...</li>
            <li>its easy to use even tho you have to put more pressure than with a real straight razor...</li>
            <li>cheap af.</li>
            <li>but the price is really cheap too.</li>
            <li>I feel like this thing is going to break like a cheap carnival comb when I pick it up.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives a great shave, I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to the disposable razors ever again!</li>
            <li>I would not feel comfortable with this thing around my neck.  </li>
            <li>Great that it comes with extra blades too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades didn&#x27;t even fit in the holder well.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this just to see if I wanted to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Seems cheap and unwieldy.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price worked very well for me</li>
            <li>Smooth cut everytime.</li>
            <li>Dont know how to do it plus the razor feels so cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li>Cheap product for a cheap price, do not buy this product you&#x27;ll just be throwing your money away on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Light, flimsy, but a great way to get a straight razor shave if you don&#x27;t have the funds to invest in the real deal and all its care implements.</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>smooth shaving,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered a pack of 100 Shark blades along with it, and those fit fine.</li>
            <li>This straight razor is pretty good, well in my opinion.</li>
            <li>the razor was not on its original box when it arrived...</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>But when it arrived, I came to realize it has a unique style blade.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had more heft to it, but that isn&#x27;t as big a deal to me.</li>
            <li>is cuz it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades for this are super cheap compared to any disposable razor you can find...</li>
            <li>All of the reviews I read about this style of razor (the replaceable blade straight style) suggest that the style gives a good shave, but should not be considered anything like a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>solid and good quality</li>
            <li>Good razor only reason why it lost a star</li>
            <li>Good overall though.</li>
            <li>; Congrats you saved money and help the environment at the same time by switching; P.S it comes with a pack of blades, which i didn&#x27;t realize but the blades are good also.</li>
            <li>Not what I was wanting at the time, but it is still cool to have.</li>
            <li>Nice soft cut.</li>
            <li>I got 100 blades for this thing for like 5 bucks and even though they are only good for about 2 shaves on my beard</li>
            <li>you want to use a straight razor but arent sure and dont wanna go all in BUY THIS PROUDUCT</li>
            <li>An its really easy to switch the razors and pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super flimsy, feels like something you&#x27;d get from the 99c store.</li>
            <li>Replacing the blade is quick and easy, and the blades do work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just make sure you have someone there to spot you if its your first time shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten how quick, smooth and painless a straight razor can be.  </li>
            <li>As far as quality goes, yes its very cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li>feels way to cheap and it sticks to your skin too much because of the metal blade holder.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting a real straight razor.</li>
            <li>It acts like a straight razor, but doesn&#x27;t require the maintenance that owning a genuine one does.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a cheap DE razor and I am much happier with that.</li>
            <li>For the price well worth it</li>
            <li>Even dollar store razors, and it just feels so much more natural shaving with this, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now</li>
            <li>This uses simple cheap blades that break in half, so I&#x27;ll have no problem changing them out more often for a good clean cut.</li>
            <li>Probably worth the purchase price alone, hence the two-star rating.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll either be using my double-edged safety razor, or buying an actual nice blade that does not have replaceable razors.</li>
            <li>Great razor, I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with any other system than disposable straight blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Applying a hot towel to your face at first might help, but the blade is too cheap to really cut anything thing.</li>
            <li>It comes with new blades and is relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>that shouldn&#x27;t cost you more than a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>device was an add on so price could change at any time on this simple but effective straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Came in about a week or less, and its a pretty good value with the 10 razors it come with.</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking.</li>
            <li>If you want to learn to use a straight razor get this and experiment!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s my first one, so</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over again I would buy a higher quality razor.  </li>
            <li>First time using an item like this</li>
            <li>It cost about the same as this but had considerably better build quality.</li>
            <li>good a bit stiff</li>
            <li>This little razor is thin, light, flimsy, but best of all, cheap.</li>
            <li>It felt normal; Make sure to clean and dry the blade so it wont rust after every usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a straight razor and this thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Blades are nice and sharp, and it is overall easy to use.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more bucks and go buy the Parker, It&#x27;s well worth the money and will actually leave your face baby smooth for a full day or two.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try out a straight razor and this one works pretty well</li>
            <li>/&gt;good first straight edge</li>
            <li>This is my first straight razor</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m just a newbie in the straight razor shave, but this was my first buy to try out if i like to shave this way...</li>
            <li>First time trying out the real way of shaving.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first replacement blade straight razor</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>It removed the hairs fine on both sides of my face but totally different when I got to my neck area.</li>
            <li>Great for cutting smoothly</li>
            <li>Shipping was also really fast,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave.</li>
            <li>I wanted a straight razor to try it out without having to may a lot of money for.</li>
            <li>I let it glide gently across my face without putting pressure on the razor.</li>
            <li>I would buy a real one that you cannot change out the razor blades in.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a straight razor</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>Good cheap starter straight razor, this is the type you should buy before spending a lot of money on a expensive straight razor</li>
            <li>so i dont know much</li>
            <li>i even bought a strop (for sale now if anyone wants it) and I wish i had just gotten this instead.</li>
            <li>My son has wanted a straight razor for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I have never used a straight razor before, so my opinion may not be educated.</li>
            <li>They tug on my facial hair and do not make a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>This one fits well and the blade is level and straight.</li>
            <li>I have the real cut throughout razors so it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really anything to concern oneself with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Got it as a starter straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>I really can shave with this thing.  </li>
            <li>However, it bugs me that the handle looks very used (scratched and worn)</li>
            <li>After taking to some friends, the consensus was that the changeable blades  were far more convenient than the time and financial demand of maintaining a blade</li>
            <li>Well for me, at least I didnt buy into a really good one spending $20-30.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased that this old dog still knows it&#x27;s one trick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times already, and the first time I was very cautious, taking roughly half an hour to shave.</li>
            <li>and I have gotten pretty good with it after only a few shaves.</li>
            <li>Because it uses a disposable razor blade, it&#x27;s fine as long as it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>it was a true razor, however its only a stylized holder for disposable razor blades which slide in to the head.</li>
            <li>The device was cheap compared to other straight edges, but does get the job done for me in all applications I need for a straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im new to straight razors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less of a shave and more like scraping some of the hair off.</li>
            <li>It does however do a decent job with straightening the beard line</li>
            <li>1st time trying a str8 razor like this; Been using for 3 months; gotta say i like it; glad i dont have to use those plastic disposable razors anymore; just make sure to cut at a 45 degrees angle; It does feel weird at 1st, but after about 3 or 4 usage</li>
            <li>This razor is fairly decent for starters like myself.</li>
            <li>When I used it I kept a finger on either side of the blade to hold it steady.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this as a starter if you don&#x27;t mind all the plastic.</li>
            <li>Didnt even get close to the throat, i wont tell im a little better with it</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>great for those trying to get in the game!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking at this as an introduction the world of straight razors, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li>If I had to make one recommendation to you, it would be to skip this stage of experimentation, and spend these few bucks on a better grade of razor.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t have to be sharpened, and it works great (though he got quite a few nicks learning how to use it - it does arrive sharp!).</li>
            <li>Average product, I have a few other straight edge blades and this one was nothing special but for the price its a great deal.</li>
            <li>Blades are simple and easy to replace, so definitely recommend this for using at home.</li>
            <li>since you&#x27;re using square blades, you have a very sharp corner that&#x27;s not visible when covered in shaving cream, which makes it easy to knick yourself if you&#x27;re not watching your angle.</li>
            <li>I have other straight edge razors and they tend to rust or break easily, or the blade holder doesn&#x27;t slide in properly and leaves the blade on an angle</li>
            <li>This last sentence is just here because amazon keeps telling me a short and simple response is in need of more words.</li>
            <li>Better than using any other electric razor or facial razor.</li>
            <li>the handle is a little light...</li>
            <li>Works ok, blade is dull.</li>
            <li>The last time I bought an exchangeable-blade straight razor was on the world&#x27;s biggest online auction site from a seller in Germany.</li>
            <li>The metal has a considerable amount of flex to it and doesn&#x27;t seem to have built to any sort of standards.</li>
            <li>I tried it just for fun, but it&#x27;s really not the great, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m terrible at it,</li>
            <li>I bought this disposable razor istinstead of the fixed blade</li>
            <li>so I could try it and see if I wanted to invest the money into a fixed blade.</li>
            <li>I thought I wanted a straight razor that was just a giant blade that I could hone...</li>
            <li>All in all, it works, but I will eventually replace it with a proper straight razor.</li>
            <li>This will be my go-to razor (I trim my beard weekly) until I find some &#x27;old iron&#x27; at a garage sale.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and leaves you feeling soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>My only complain is the razor&#x27;s rust wicked fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only useful for line-ups of sideburns and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely not up to par with an actual straight razor, but what do you expect for around 7 bucks.</li>
            <li>It comes with double-edge replacement blades that need to be snapped in half which make them more difficult to fit into the bracket.  </li>
            <li>I generally use it to line up my cuts.</li>
            <li>beginners that is curious about shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for decades, still using my old 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s Gillette double edge razors, and I never in my life had a straight razor shave, until today.</li>
            <li>(I had meant to go to a professional, but nobody who did straights was open that morning, save one who had a 3-month waitlist)</li>
            <li>However, the blades that come with the Diamond Edge are not very sharp at all.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the handle is made of a cheap plastic that seems very flimsy--be careful where you set this, as bending it inadvertently will probably break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use just about any razors you could buy at any store in it.</li>
            <li>the price is low and it works, but i am pretty sure that it is pulling the hair out rather than cutting them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While getting the blade in can be a pain, I prefer it to my last straight edge that had a single long razor insert that were more expensive to replace and started to come wiggle out over time as the clamping mechanism started to get rust.</li>
            <li>it looked new (made of sad, cheap plastic).  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to get a good shave with this razor like everyone else has said you get for what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Good grip.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
            <li> This knife still cuts good.....</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase</li>
            <li> The razor is relatively good quality for the price that it is.</li>
            <li> and I Loved the price.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> the razor&#x27;s everything else was good.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> the brush is amazing</li>
            <li> Although it feels quite flimsy, this is actually an excellent starter for straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle was all scratched up and some kind of a residue was all over it</li>
            <li> Nice item, kind of flimsy but for this price you shouldn&#x27;t be expecting S.T. Dupont.</li>
            <li> He always liked them</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;light&lt;br /&gt;it fits my hands( which are the size of bears paws ) but its not big nor small&lt;br /&gt;it was a good price and the shipping was excellent</li>
            <li> It seems to be pretty good quality!</li>
            <li> Really easy to replace the blade and excellent for a first time user.</li>
            <li> Very good straight razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cute and handy</li>
            <li> vary nice once i learn to use it better  </li>
            <li> However, for the price point, the convenience, and all practical points, this feels like a great first step towards purchasing one.  </li>
            <li> Product was great shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> very cheaply made and all this is is a plastic handle with a razor blade attached to it.  </li>
            <li> Its very light and flimsy</li>
            <li> I do better with my Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> There are eight more words required, so im fulfilling the requirement</li>
            <li> It got 4 stars because I cut myself (though that&#x27;s more on me than anything</li>
            <li> the best balance in the word but for only $6 I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works okay except that the razor blade doesn&#x27;t always sit evenly after replacement until fiddled with.</li>
            <li> There are better options out there</li>
            <li> I love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li> Great for entry level straight razor.</li>
            <li> Could it be better,</li>
            <li> sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perhaps not the most elegant, but for $6 it is damn sturdy and has done the job</li>
            <li> I just wanted to see if shaving this way would be way better.</li>
            <li> Love that it has replaceable blades</li>
            <li> so I thought he would enjoy having one of his own.</li>
            <li> Okay product is better then what i expected&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;its more than u can ask for in the price</li>
            <li> love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li> I love the soap</li>
            <li> I love the bowl</li>
            <li> Will spend another $10 to get a better one.</li>
            <li> I love using it to shave</li>
            <li> -- it bugs me more that the handle would still look crappy</li>
            <li> Mostly practical, but lacking nostalgia, it cuts whiskers.  </li>
            <li> This was a Gift to my other Son,He Loves It,and got a very Nice Smooth Shave.!!!</li>
            <li> It gives a close consistent shave (I use Feather blades) and feels good.  </li>
            <li> it works pretty good</li>
            <li> I plan to get a better one since this one feels cheap.</li>
            <li> It will take the hair off your face, but doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the Parker disposable straight razor does.</li>
            <li> but it shaves very well and is good for a shaving novice.</li>
            <li> and it really does the job good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it comes with 5 blade replacements, which is good, but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle feels cheap and bends more easily than the cap for a gallon of milk.</li>
            <li> Sure it is made of plastic and not high end but was surprising how effective it was and the price could not be much better.</li>
            <li> provides a close shave and is easy to use for beginners.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to angle and reach every spot...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right and works great thanks a lot</li>
            <li> This is my first time to own one and to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using this holster for my razor blades and works perfect , had to buy another because I lost my previous one .</li>
            <li> then this is fine to try out</li>
            <li> Plastic keeps it light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Pretty good nothing to right home about but gets the job done...</li>
            <li> its easy to use even tho you have to put more pressure than with a real straight razor...</li>
            <li> cheap af.</li>
            <li> but the price is really cheap too.</li>
            <li> I feel like this thing is going to break like a cheap carnival comb when I pick it up.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave, I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to the disposable razors ever again!</li>
            <li> I would not feel comfortable with this thing around my neck.  </li>
            <li> Great that it comes with extra blades too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades didn&#x27;t even fit in the holder well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this just to see if I wanted to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Seems cheap and unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price worked very well for me</li>
            <li> Smooth cut everytime.</li>
            <li> Dont know how to do it plus the razor feels so cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li> Cheap product for a cheap price, do not buy this product you&#x27;ll just be throwing your money away on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Light, flimsy, but a great way to get a straight razor shave if you don&#x27;t have the funds to invest in the real deal and all its care implements.</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> smooth shaving,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered a pack of 100 Shark blades along with it, and those fit fine.</li>
            <li> This straight razor is pretty good, well in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the razor was not on its original box when it arrived...</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> But when it arrived, I came to realize it has a unique style blade.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had more heft to it, but that isn&#x27;t as big a deal to me.</li>
            <li> is cuz it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades for this are super cheap compared to any disposable razor you can find...</li>
            <li> All of the reviews I read about this style of razor (the replaceable blade straight style) suggest that the style gives a good shave, but should not be considered anything like a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li> solid and good quality</li>
            <li> Good razor only reason why it lost a star</li>
            <li> Good overall though.</li>
            <li> ; Congrats you saved money and help the environment at the same time by switching; P.S it comes with a pack of blades, which i didn&#x27;t realize but the blades are good also.</li>
            <li> Not what I was wanting at the time, but it is still cool to have.</li>
            <li> Nice soft cut.</li>
            <li> I got 100 blades for this thing for like 5 bucks and even though they are only good for about 2 shaves on my beard</li>
            <li> you want to use a straight razor but arent sure and dont wanna go all in BUY THIS PROUDUCT</li>
            <li> An its really easy to switch the razors and pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super flimsy, feels like something you&#x27;d get from the 99c store.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blade is quick and easy, and the blades do work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just make sure you have someone there to spot you if its your first time shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how quick, smooth and painless a straight razor can be.  </li>
            <li> As far as quality goes, yes its very cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li> feels way to cheap and it sticks to your skin too much because of the metal blade holder.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting a real straight razor.</li>
            <li> It acts like a straight razor, but doesn&#x27;t require the maintenance that owning a genuine one does.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a cheap DE razor and I am much happier with that.</li>
            <li> For the price well worth it</li>
            <li> Even dollar store razors, and it just feels so much more natural shaving with this, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now</li>
            <li> This uses simple cheap blades that break in half, so I&#x27;ll have no problem changing them out more often for a good clean cut.</li>
            <li> Probably worth the purchase price alone, hence the two-star rating.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll either be using my double-edged safety razor, or buying an actual nice blade that does not have replaceable razors.</li>
            <li> Great razor, I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with any other system than disposable straight blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Applying a hot towel to your face at first might help, but the blade is too cheap to really cut anything thing.</li>
            <li> It comes with new blades and is relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> that shouldn&#x27;t cost you more than a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> device was an add on so price could change at any time on this simple but effective straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Came in about a week or less, and its a pretty good value with the 10 razors it come with.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking.</li>
            <li> If you want to learn to use a straight razor get this and experiment!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s my first one, so</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over again I would buy a higher quality razor.  </li>
            <li> First time using an item like this</li>
            <li> It cost about the same as this but had considerably better build quality.</li>
            <li> good a bit stiff</li>
            <li> This little razor is thin, light, flimsy, but best of all, cheap.</li>
            <li> It felt normal; Make sure to clean and dry the blade so it wont rust after every usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a straight razor and this thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Blades are nice and sharp, and it is overall easy to use.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more bucks and go buy the Parker, It&#x27;s well worth the money and will actually leave your face baby smooth for a full day or two.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try out a straight razor and this one works pretty well</li>
            <li> /&gt;good first straight edge</li>
            <li> This is my first straight razor</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just a newbie in the straight razor shave, but this was my first buy to try out if i like to shave this way...</li>
            <li> First time trying out the real way of shaving.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first replacement blade straight razor</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> It removed the hairs fine on both sides of my face but totally different when I got to my neck area.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting smoothly</li>
            <li> Shipping was also really fast,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted a straight razor to try it out without having to may a lot of money for.</li>
            <li> I let it glide gently across my face without putting pressure on the razor.</li>
            <li> I would buy a real one that you cannot change out the razor blades in.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a straight razor</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> Good cheap starter straight razor, this is the type you should buy before spending a lot of money on a expensive straight razor</li>
            <li> so i dont know much</li>
            <li> i even bought a strop (for sale now if anyone wants it) and I wish i had just gotten this instead.</li>
            <li> My son has wanted a straight razor for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I have never used a straight razor before, so my opinion may not be educated.</li>
            <li> They tug on my facial hair and do not make a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> This one fits well and the blade is level and straight.</li>
            <li> I have the real cut throughout razors so it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything to concern oneself with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Got it as a starter straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> I really can shave with this thing.  </li>
            <li> However, it bugs me that the handle looks very used (scratched and worn)</li>
            <li> After taking to some friends, the consensus was that the changeable blades  were far more convenient than the time and financial demand of maintaining a blade</li>
            <li> Well for me, at least I didnt buy into a really good one spending $20-30.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased that this old dog still knows it&#x27;s one trick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times already, and the first time I was very cautious, taking roughly half an hour to shave.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten pretty good with it after only a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Because it uses a disposable razor blade, it&#x27;s fine as long as it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> it was a true razor, however its only a stylized holder for disposable razor blades which slide in to the head.</li>
            <li> The device was cheap compared to other straight edges, but does get the job done for me in all applications I need for a straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im new to straight razors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less of a shave and more like scraping some of the hair off.</li>
            <li> It does however do a decent job with straightening the beard line</li>
            <li> 1st time trying a str8 razor like this; Been using for 3 months; gotta say i like it; glad i dont have to use those plastic disposable razors anymore; just make sure to cut at a 45 degrees angle; It does feel weird at 1st, but after about 3 or 4 usage</li>
            <li> This razor is fairly decent for starters like myself.</li>
            <li> When I used it I kept a finger on either side of the blade to hold it steady.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this as a starter if you don&#x27;t mind all the plastic.</li>
            <li> Didnt even get close to the throat, i wont tell im a little better with it</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> great for those trying to get in the game!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this as an introduction the world of straight razors, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> If I had to make one recommendation to you, it would be to skip this stage of experimentation, and spend these few bucks on a better grade of razor.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t have to be sharpened, and it works great (though he got quite a few nicks learning how to use it - it does arrive sharp!).</li>
            <li> Average product, I have a few other straight edge blades and this one was nothing special but for the price its a great deal.</li>
            <li> Blades are simple and easy to replace, so definitely recommend this for using at home.</li>
            <li> since you&#x27;re using square blades, you have a very sharp corner that&#x27;s not visible when covered in shaving cream, which makes it easy to knick yourself if you&#x27;re not watching your angle.</li>
            <li> I have other straight edge razors and they tend to rust or break easily, or the blade holder doesn&#x27;t slide in properly and leaves the blade on an angle</li>
            <li> This last sentence is just here because amazon keeps telling me a short and simple response is in need of more words.</li>
            <li> Better than using any other electric razor or facial razor.</li>
            <li> the handle is a little light...</li>
            <li> Works ok, blade is dull.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought an exchangeable-blade straight razor was on the world&#x27;s biggest online auction site from a seller in Germany.</li>
            <li> The metal has a considerable amount of flex to it and doesn&#x27;t seem to have built to any sort of standards.</li>
            <li> I tried it just for fun, but it&#x27;s really not the great, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m terrible at it,</li>
            <li> I bought this disposable razor istinstead of the fixed blade</li>
            <li> so I could try it and see if I wanted to invest the money into a fixed blade.</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted a straight razor that was just a giant blade that I could hone...</li>
            <li> All in all, it works, but I will eventually replace it with a proper straight razor.</li>
            <li> This will be my go-to razor (I trim my beard weekly) until I find some &#x27;old iron&#x27; at a garage sale.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and leaves you feeling soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> My only complain is the razor&#x27;s rust wicked fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only useful for line-ups of sideburns and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not up to par with an actual straight razor, but what do you expect for around 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> It comes with double-edge replacement blades that need to be snapped in half which make them more difficult to fit into the bracket.  </li>
            <li> I generally use it to line up my cuts.</li>
            <li> beginners that is curious about shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for decades, still using my old 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s Gillette double edge razors, and I never in my life had a straight razor shave, until today.</li>
            <li> (I had meant to go to a professional, but nobody who did straights was open that morning, save one who had a 3-month waitlist)</li>
            <li> However, the blades that come with the Diamond Edge are not very sharp at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle is made of a cheap plastic that seems very flimsy--be careful where you set this, as bending it inadvertently will probably break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use just about any razors you could buy at any store in it.</li>
            <li> the price is low and it works, but i am pretty sure that it is pulling the hair out rather than cutting them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While getting the blade in can be a pain, I prefer it to my last straight edge that had a single long razor insert that were more expensive to replace and started to come wiggle out over time as the clamping mechanism started to get rust.</li>
            <li> it looked new (made of sad, cheap plastic).  </li>
            <li> its not a flashy expensive straight razor but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe worth a little less, maybe a dollar over priced x)</li>
            <li> it was a single, solid blade.</li>
            <li> I always feel like I&#x27;m about to slash my face wide open, and I NEVER get that feeling when using my Parker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I got done shaving, I found that I didn&#x27;t like how it cut because it still left my face rough all over.</li>
            <li> It is not professional grade.</li>
            <li> He uses it to shave his rather thick beard, and he really seems to like it.  </li>
            <li> One can&#x27;t argue too much about the price, that being said, it still can mean that quality is an issue.  </li>
            <li> cheap piece of crap you attach a Gillette razor after bending it in half and its not secure or accurate to insert.</li>
            <li> I think it got loose during the travel and got scratched....</li>
            <li> but It makes it a lot less susceptible to rust and such.</li>
            <li> However, take it slow the first few times (giggity) and you&#x27;ll eventually get the hang of</li>
            <li> Only problem is replacing blades, it is a little hard to get the new blade in position, and, stay in position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a not a straight razor at all.</li>
            <li> to use the blade holder slide with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I immediately switched back to my DE razor after a few minutes of wrestling with this on my face.</li>
            <li> It is not a straight razor at all, don&#x27;t let the look fool you because the blade isn&#x27;t a blade at all.  </li>
            <li> its junk not a straight razor</li>
            <li> Nicked myself like 3 times on the chin, but thats to be expected from what i&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few blades in this and it keeps getting to be harder to go back</li>
            <li> Not a straight razor!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to shave with, but the changable blades shift very slightly from time to time, and make for a narrow cutting surface.</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp though, sharper than I expected</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the asking price.</li>
            <li> Not for individuals with thick, corse facial hair.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and handles well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor seemed to be previously used ...</li>
            <li> (10 once you snap them in half) blades came with nicks on them and looked like they&#x27;d been stored for a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t yet, after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Single-edge half blades will probably be easier to replace.  </li>
            <li> the little tang for your ring finger is a little wobbly, and has always been, though.</li>
            <li> The blade carrier sometimes requires a little fiddling to get the blade locked in but nothing onerous.</li>
            <li> but I would not use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money..</li>
            <li> Cheap crap, threw it out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s uneven.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and I&#x27;ve used it a few times for my legs.</li>
            <li> By the third shave I had my time down to a mere five minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a dull, cheaply made piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I never used a blade like this before when looking to line up my beard line.  </li>
            <li> tips though: Never shave against the grain and never hurry up while shaving with it (I accidentally dragged the blade across giving myself a small cut).</li>
            <li> It has a little space in it to slide in these flimsy small blades that are so dull and weak</li>
            <li> Lesson learned, the hard way, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I have never used this product, not once, without having at least 4 cuts.</li>
            <li> The metal and plastic used is very thin and not very sturdy or durable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how difficult and painful shaving with a straight razor could be for a newbie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these and none has ever broken, I&#x27;ve just lost them while traveling or given them away.</li>
            <li> they couldn&#x27;t even shave the thin hairs on my lower neckline.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad but not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Just too uncomfortable to shave with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hard (and ill-advised!!!)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item if you plan on cutting a rope or a piece of paper.</li>
            <li> It works but not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that he was going to cut himself with it and that we would end up spending the evening in an emergency room, but he seems to know what he&#x27;s doing with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, all I&#x27;m doing is cutting myself.</li>
            <li> After a couple times cutting my face something awful, I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Crap quality for crap price.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All of the reviews I read about this style of razor (the replaceable blade straight style) suggest that the style gives a good shave, but should not be considered anything like a straight razor shave.  However, for the price point, the convenience, and all practical points, this feels like a great first step towards purchasing one.  It gives a close consistent shave (I use Feather blades) and feels good.  It would be nice if it had more heft to it, but that isn&#x27;t as big a deal to me.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a just a razor blade that you stick in a thing. It&#x27;s a not a straight razor at all. I would recommend this item if you plan on cutting a rope or a piece of paper. It just pulls the hair. It doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to get a good shave with this razor like everyone else has said you get for what you pay for.  It does however do a decent job with straightening the beard line but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting smoothly</li>
            <li> feels way to cheap and it sticks to your skin too much because of the metal blade holder.  Just too uncomfortable to shave with.</li>
            <li> Not a straight razor!</li>
            <li> Product was great shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> For the price well worth it</li>
            <li> It will take the hair off your face, but doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the Parker disposable straight razor does. I&#x27;ve tried a few blades in this and it keeps getting to be harder to go back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the thing makes me nervous just to hold. I always feel like I&#x27;m about to slash my face wide open, and I NEVER get that feeling when using my Parker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ever I use this razor I always have to shave the stubble off again the next day, no matter if I do 1 or 2 passes. It&#x27;s less of a shave and more like scraping some of the hair off. Spend a few more bucks and go buy the Parker, It&#x27;s well worth the money and will actually leave your face baby smooth for a full day or two.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking. solid and good quality</li>
            <li> cheap af. low quality, don&#x27;t wait your money.</li>
            <li> If you want to learn to use a straight razor get this and experiment! it works pretty good and I have gotten pretty good with it after only a few shaves. I plan to get a better one since this one feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Been using this holster for my razor blades and works perfect , had to buy another because I lost my previous one . Shipping was also really fast,</li>
            <li> Very good straight razor. provides a close shave and is easy to use for beginners. Would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This last sentence is just here because amazon keeps telling me a short and simple response is in need of more words.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I never used a blade like this before when looking to line up my beard line.  This is great.  Came with 10 replacement blades.  Blades are made by Gillette.  Good grip.  No problems.  Better than using any other electric razor or facial razor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave. I do better with my Gillette Fusion Proglide. It&#x27;s only useful for line-ups of sideburns and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Very good buy it and use it!!!!!! I&#x27;ll recommend This product is great. It&#x27;s priced right and works great thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a true razor, however its only a stylized holder for disposable razor blades which slide in to the head.</li>
            <li> Works well for shaving and finishing touches like my barber does it.  There are eight more words required, so im fulfilling the requirement</li>
            <li> For the price you cant beat it. Im new to straight razors and I will possibly outgrow this one. But it works. Comes with a 5 pack of refills</li>
            <li> So I decided to try out a straight razor and this one works pretty well (it&#x27;s my first one, so I guess I have nothing to compare it to). I shave three times a week and change the blade once a week. It got 4 stars because I cut myself (though that&#x27;s more on me than anything else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. However, take it slow the first few times (giggity) and you&#x27;ll eventually get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips though: Never shave against the grain and never hurry up while shaving with it (I accidentally dragged the blade across giving myself a small cut).</li>
            <li> I wanted a straight razor to try it out without having to may a lot of money for. This is my first time to own one and to use.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a YouTube video to see how to hold this correctly while I shaved. I let it glide gently across my face without putting pressure on the razor. It removed the hairs fine on both sides of my face but totally different when I got to my neck area. It felt like I was shaving with a sunburn. After I got done shaving, I found that I didn&#x27;t like how it cut because it still left my face rough all over. I&#x27;m used to shaving in all directions but only shaved in one direction with this razor. I don&#x27;t know if it was my shaving style or the razor itself that didn&#x27;t give me the shave close-cut that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beginners that is curious about shaving with a straight razor then this is fine to try out but I would not use this everyday. I would buy a real one that you cannot change out the razor blades in. As far as quality goes, yes its very cheap and flimsy but the price is really cheap too.</li>
            <li> Good razor only reason why it lost a star is cuz it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to clean. Good overall though.</li>
            <li> awesome razor&lt;br /&gt;just make sure you have someone there to spot you if its your first time shaving with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This razor works and comes as advertised: It opens and closes; It holds a blade; It is sturdy enough that it won&#x27;t fall apart; The scales never slipped in my hands. So, it&#x27;s good for what it is. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I feel like this thing is going to break like a cheap carnival comb when I pick it up.  If I had it to do over again I would buy a higher quality razor.  I feel like this thing is going to rust in the inaccessible areas where the blade is installed.  Lesson learned, the hard way, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This knife still cuts good.....I generally use it to line up my cuts. Its easy to use. All you gotta do is replace the knives. I cant compare it to anything I&#x27;ve had because its the only one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a straight razor but I did not want to spend $100 on one if I did not like the experience.  This razor made me a believer.</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase but I have never used this product, not once, without having at least 4 cuts. The blades don&#x27;t sit event in the holder either.</li>
            <li> Used it once. It works but not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Average product, I have a few other straight edge blades and this one was nothing special but for the price its a great deal.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave, I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to the disposable razors ever again! The replacement blades for this are super cheap compared to any disposable razor you can find... Even dollar store razors, and it just feels so much more natural shaving with this, I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now and I love it!</li>
            <li> very cheaply made and all this is is a plastic handle with a razor blade attached to it.  I would not feel comfortable with this thing around my neck.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Its very light and flimsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not the best balance in the word but for only $6 I can&#x27;t complain&lt;br /&gt;considering it includes extra razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good first straight edge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s working great. Really easy to replace the blade and excellent for a first time user.</li>
            <li> great for those trying to get in the game! and excellent price</li>
            <li> Item was shipped on time.That&#x27;s for the two stars&lt;br /&gt;The razor seemed to be previously used ... it has scratches on it (plastic holder). the razor was not on its original box when it arrived...I think it got loose during the travel and got scratched....</li>
            <li> 1st time trying a str8 razor like this; Been using for 3 months; gotta say i like it; glad i dont have to use those plastic disposable razors anymore; just make sure to cut at a 45 degrees angle; It does feel weird at 1st, but after about 3 or 4 usage It felt normal; Make sure to clean and dry the blade so it wont rust after every usage. Watch some youtube videos like i did if you need some examples &#x3D;) ; Congrats you saved money and help the environment at the same time by switching; P.S it comes with a pack of blades, which i didn&#x27;t realize but the blades are good also.</li>
            <li> The razor is relatively good quality for the price that it is. The blade is very sharp though, sharper than I expected but it shaves very well and is good for a shaving novice.</li>
            <li> This razor is fairly decent for starters like myself. The handle is plastic but It makes it a lot less susceptible to rust and such. Excellent for beginners.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a real straight razor. This is just like a box cutter and it cut his head when he used it..had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Works as i wanted it to .  Great that it comes with extra blades too. First time using an item like this</li>
            <li> Does the job and inexpensive. Blades are simple and easy to replace, so definitely recommend this for using at home. While getting the blade in can be a pain, I prefer it to my last straight edge that had a single long razor insert that were more expensive to replace and started to come wiggle out over time as the clamping mechanism started to get rust. This uses simple cheap blades that break in half, so I&#x27;ll have no problem changing them out more often for a good clean cut. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage. This is a dull, cheaply made piece of crap. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money. This seller is unreliable. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> It came with no instructions regarding how to insert the blades.&lt;br /&gt;The five (10 once you snap them in half) blades came with nicks on them and looked like they&#x27;d been stored for a while.&lt;br /&gt;The blades didn&#x27;t even fit in the holder well. Luckily I ordered a pack of 100 Shark blades along with it, and those fit fine.</li>
            <li> The handle is plastic, with a metal tang and insert to hold the disposable blade in place. The insert doesn&#x27;t lock into the tang, appears to rely on friction to keep things in place. Works okay except that the razor blade doesn&#x27;t always sit evenly after replacement until fiddled with.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The last time I bought an exchangeable-blade straight razor was on the world&#x27;s biggest online auction site from a seller in Germany. It cost about the same as this but had considerably better build quality. The plastic handle feels cheap and bends more easily than the cap for a gallon of milk. The metal has a considerable amount of flex to it and doesn&#x27;t seem to have built to any sort of standards. It&#x27;s extremely hard (and ill-advised!!!) to use the blade holder slide with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it work otherwise? It kinda works. I immediately switched back to my DE razor after a few minutes of wrestling with this on my face. That being said, the five included (Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock) blades are great! Probably worth the purchase price alone, hence the two-star rating. If you&#x27;re looking at this as an introduction the world of straight razors, I&#x27;d steer clear. There are better options out there that shouldn&#x27;t cost you more than a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> I love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li> This was a Gift to my other Son,He Loves It,and got a very Nice Smooth Shave.!!!</li>
            <li> It is flimsy but still a great razor for thee price and if you are a beginner.</li>
            <li> Although it feels quite flimsy, this is actually an excellent starter for straight razor shaving. As far as the people saying that the blade doesn&#x27;t feel secure, what are you doing wrong? I&#x27;ve used it many times already, and the first time I was very cautious, taking roughly half an hour to shave. By the third shave I had my time down to a mere five minutes. I have yet to have the blade slip out of the handle, and have not cut myself once using this. Highly recommend this as a starter if you don&#x27;t mind all the plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic with a metal blade holder. Great for entry level straight razor. Low cost and replacible. Used it for about a year before replacing with same model. Plastic keeps it light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Was flimsy and did not shave well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how difficult and painful shaving with a straight razor could be for a newbie. I tried it just for fun, but it&#x27;s really not the great, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m terrible at it, but yeah it&#x27;s overrated and glamorized in Hollywood.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the asking price. I would not recommend this product to anyone. When mine arrived in the mail, it looked like it was used and abused before it got to me. The plastic handle was all scratched up and some kind of a residue was all over it (I am not joking).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.. this product looked used.. it came with a lot of scratches..</li>
            <li> Good cheap starter straight razor, this is the type you should buy before spending a lot of money on a expensive straight razor</li>
            <li> Nice item, kind of flimsy but for this price you shouldn&#x27;t be expecting S.T. Dupont. Does it get the job done, Yes. Could it be better, sure.  I wanted an inexpensive unit to practice with and it does the job, and does it well.</li>
            <li> Great razor, I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with any other system than disposable straight blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perhaps not the most elegant, but for $6 it is damn sturdy and has done the job right. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these and none has ever broken, I&#x27;ve just lost them while traveling or given them away.</li>
            <li> I bought this disposable razor istinstead of the fixed blade so I could try it and see if I wanted to invest the money into a fixed blade. After taking to some friends, the consensus was that the changeable blades  were far more convenient than the time and financial demand of maintaining a blade</li>
            <li> top notch products, always great prices  to compare and will always recommend!! comes in handy when cutting and styling hair</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this just to see if I wanted to use a straight razor. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for decades, still using my old 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s Gillette double edge razors, and I never in my life had a straight razor shave, until today. This little razor is thin, light, flimsy, but best of all, cheap. If I had to make one recommendation to you, it would be to skip this stage of experimentation, and spend these few bucks on a better grade of razor. I don&#x27;t regret that I didn&#x27;t, but I would do it different if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li> I can start off by saying that this razor is extremely awesome for the price. It acts like a straight razor, but doesn&#x27;t require the maintenance that owning a genuine one does. Replacing the blade is quick and easy, and the blades do work very well. My only complaint is that the handle is made of a cheap plastic that seems very flimsy--be careful where you set this, as bending it inadvertently will probably break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can use just about any razors you could buy at any store in it.</li>
            <li> One can&#x27;t argue too much about the price, that being said, it still can mean that quality is an issue.  I would not recommend this to be used as a daily shaver.  Rather maybe use it for trimming sideburns or for travel.  The metal and plastic used is very thin and not very sturdy or durable.</li>
            <li> Not too bad but not too sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was a single, solid blade. But when it arrived, I came to realize it has a unique style blade. Instead of the blade that must be sharpened, it has the exchangable blade style. Not what I was wanting at the time, but it is still cool to have. It comes with new blades and is relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> Seems cheap and unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, great price, excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> Not for individuals with thick, corse facial hair. Applying a hot towel to your face at first might help, but the blade is too cheap to really cut anything thing. It&#x27;s $7 for a reason I guess...</li>
            <li> This straight razor is pretty good, well in my opinion. This is my first straight razor so i dont know much but i shaved with it about 4 times now and it really does the job good. Nice soft cut. Came in about a week or less, and its a pretty good value with the 10 razors it come with. An its really easy to switch the razors and pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice&lt;br /&gt;Average sized, fits perfectly in my hand&lt;br /&gt;10 razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Made of plastic which makes it feel light&lt;br /&gt;Maybe worth a little less, maybe a dollar over priced x)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just a newbie in the straight razor shave, but this was my first buy to try out if i like to shave this way... i shaved 3 or 4 times already with the same blade and i did not cut myself once... its easy to use even tho you have to put more pressure than with a real straight razor... it&#x27;s a short blade so it&#x27;s easy to angle and reach every spot... the handle is a little light... but you just have to adjust...</li>
            <li> Nice for the price worked very well for me I use it for razor edging and eyebrow arching comes with 10 blades and I Loved the price.</li>
            <li> Sure it is made of plastic and not high end but was surprising how effective it was and the price could not be much better.</li>
            <li> good a bit stiff but wd40 can fix it</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut everytime.</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted a straight razor that was just a giant blade that I could hone...i even bought a strop (for sale now if anyone wants it) and I wish i had just gotten this instead. I got 100 blades for this thing for like 5 bucks and even though they are only good for about 2 shaves on my beard, that&#x27;s still 7 months of blades for 5 bucks. This thing is great.</li>
            <li> My son has wanted a straight razor for quite a while.  He uses it to shave his rather thick beard, and he really seems to like it.  I was afraid that he was going to cut himself with it and that we would end up spending the evening in an emergency room, but he seems to know what he&#x27;s doing with it.</li>
            <li> Its is well priced and serves the function. I would recommend it for home use only. It is not professional grade.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Great value. Blades are nice and sharp, and it is overall easy to use. Handle could be more heavy duty is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to use a straight razor. And now I (kinda) can. You switch the blades out and it comes with enough for around 30ish shaves. (Ten double sided). After a couple times cutting my face something awful, I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it. It&#x27;s all about the angle.</li>
            <li> Cheap crap, threw it out.</li>
            <li> For professionals only.  No way could I use this flimsy thing on my face. I didn&#x27;t even bother to send it back.  Matter of fact if I saw a barber walk towards me with this thing I would jump and leave.</li>
            <li> The blades are replacable (uses double edged razor blades). It&#x27;s ok to shave with, but the changable blades shift very slightly from time to time, and make for a narrow cutting surface. since you&#x27;re using square blades, you have a very sharp corner that&#x27;s not visible when covered in shaving cream, which makes it easy to knick yourself if you&#x27;re not watching your angle. All in all, it works, but I will eventually replace it with a proper straight razor.</li>
            <li> First time trying out the real way of shaving. Didnt like it. Dont know how to do it plus the razor feels so cheap in the hand. Well for me, at least I didnt buy into a really good one spending $20-30. I just wanted to see if shaving this way would be way better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! Love that it has replaceable blades so it doesn&#x27;t have to be sharpened, and it works great (though he got quite a few nicks learning how to use it - it does arrive sharp!). Overall I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase</li>
            <li> the price is low and it works, but i am pretty sure that it is pulling the hair out rather than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with 5 blade replacements, which is good, but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this much. i&#x27;ll either be using my double-edged safety razor, or buying an actual nice blade that does not have replaceable razors.</li>
            <li> I have never used a straight razor before, so my opinion may not be educated. However, the blades that come with the Diamond Edge are not very sharp at all. They tug on my facial hair and do not make a smooth cut. In addition, the locking mechanism for the blade is quite flimsy and I don&#x27;t trust it. You get what you pay for in this case</li>
            <li> I have other straight edge razors and they tend to rust or break easily, or the blade holder doesn&#x27;t slide in properly and leaves the blade on an angle so it&#x27;s uneven.  This one fits well and the blade is level and straight.</li>
            <li> This razor if it can even be called that is a total piece of trash.  It is not a straight razor at all, don&#x27;t let the look fool you because the blade isn&#x27;t a blade at all.  It has a little space in it to slide in these flimsy small blades that are so dull and weak they couldn&#x27;t even shave the thin hairs on my lower neckline.  Cheap product for a cheap price, do not buy this product you&#x27;ll just be throwing your money away on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Stay away. Crap quality for crap price. What do you expect.</li>
            <li> Light, flimsy, but a great way to get a straight razor shave if you don&#x27;t have the funds to invest in the real deal and all its care implements. I actually shaved with this razor the morning of my wedding! (I had meant to go to a professional, but nobody who did straights was open that morning, save one who had a 3-month waitlist)</li>
            <li> Works ok, blade is dull.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance as a gift. He always liked them so I thought he would enjoy having one of his own. It seems to be pretty good quality! He says he likes it!</li>
            <li> cheap piece of crap you attach a Gillette razor after bending it in half and its not secure or accurate to insert. its junk not a straight razor</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Definitely not up to par with an actual straight razor, but what do you expect for around 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> Great item. inexpensive, works great, comes with 10 blades. sturdy. its not a flashy expensive straight razor but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor it&#x27;s my first replacement blade straight razor I have the real cut throughout razors so it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> A bit unnerving that the blade does not lock. When I used it I kept a finger on either side of the blade to hold it steady. Cut myself a couple times but I was a newbie. I ended up buying a cheap DE razor and I am much happier with that.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything to concern oneself with the quality of this product. Because it uses a disposable razor blade, it&#x27;s fine as long as it doesn&#x27;t fall apart. Which it hasn&#x27;t yet, after a year and a half. the little tang for your ring finger is a little wobbly, and has always been, though.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with it. It has a replaceable blade</li>
            <li> Okay product is better then what i expected&lt;br /&gt;easy to change blade&lt;br /&gt;easy to manuever&lt;br /&gt;light&lt;br /&gt;it fits my hands( which are the size of bears paws ) but its not big nor small&lt;br /&gt;it was a good price and the shipping was excellent&lt;br /&gt;its more than u can ask for in the price&lt;br /&gt;if you want to use a straight razor but arent sure and dont wanna go all in BUY THIS PROUDUCT</li>
            <li> this razor is great i use it with personna blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how quick, smooth and painless a straight razor can be.  This will be my go-to razor (I trim my beard weekly) until I find some &#x27;old iron&#x27; at a garage sale.  The blade carrier sometimes requires a little fiddling to get the blade locked in but nothing onerous.</li>
            <li> love this razor for traveling</li>
            <li> I got this for my bf and it works great. He loves it and I&#x27;ve used it a few times for my legs. I love the soap it&#x27;s soft and leaves you feeling soft afterwards. I love the bowl it&#x27;s so cute and handy the brush is amazing it&#x27;s super soft. My only complain is the razor&#x27;s rust wicked fast. Even when dried off the next day the whole thing was rusted. Beside&#x27;s the razor&#x27;s everything else was good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good nothing to right home about but gets the job done...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a straight razor and this thing works pretty well. Close shave too. Nicked myself like 3 times on the chin, but thats to be expected from what i&#x27;ve read. Didnt even get close to the throat, i wont tell im a little better with it or i have an emt nearby</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, all I&#x27;m doing is cutting myself. The razor work will, ouch!!!!  LOL</li>
            <li> cheap. Looks , feels and works cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again. Will spend another $10 to get a better one.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and handles well. I love using it to shave</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device was an add on so price could change at any time on this simple but effective straight edge razor. The device was cheap compared to other straight edges, but does get the job done for me in all applications I need for a straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  smooth shaving,&lt;br /&gt;  a fan of Amazon  ಠﭛಠ</li>
            <li> vary nice once i learn to use it better  it will be awesome but for now its OK thank you</li>
            <li> Super flimsy, feels like something you&#x27;d get from the 99c store.</li>
            <li> Got it as a starter straight edge razor. Only problem is replacing blades, it is a little hard to get the new blade in position, and, stay in position.</li>
            <li> ....it actually works well.  I really can shave with this thing.  However, it bugs me that the handle looks very used (scratched and worn) -- it bugs me more that the handle would still look crappy even it it looked new (made of sad, cheap plastic).  It comes with double-edge replacement blades that need to be snapped in half which make them more difficult to fit into the bracket.  Single-edge half blades will probably be easier to replace.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased that this old dog still knows it&#x27;s one trick.  Mostly practical, but lacking nostalgia, it cuts whiskers.  Shave on, men!</li>
