            <li> Very good quality face soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and leaves your skin smooth and soft but DO NOT get this stuff near your eyes.  It&#x27;s stings horribly.  I just use it as a body soap instead but it gets used up very quickly.  Too pricey for what it does.  Use Ivory.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It is simply the best of all worlds.  I&#x27;ve gone cheaper routes, but I always come back to TimeWise mary Kay soap</li>
