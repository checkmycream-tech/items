            <li>I LOVE this iron!!!</li>
            <li>I love it can straighten and curl either one or both!!!</li>
            <li>Very good straightener.</li>
            <li>It was okay...not very good quality</li>
            <li>help my type of hair, however it is not the ideal straightener for that.  </li>
            <li>i should have trusted my gut feeling, ive NEVER had good luck with con air, ALL their products SUCK!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve slept on my curls and they still look gorgeous!</li>
            <li>They turned out beautifully.    </li>
            <li>Win some.  </li>
            <li>The straightener works great on my bangs but still must use a seperate tool to curl the rest of my hair. ...</li>
            <li>this porduct is great</li>
            <li>Great iron curler.</li>
            <li>It is great if you have layers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair falling out of it if you grab a chunk that has parts of both layers.</li>
            <li>I will say though that for straightening your hair, it is great.  </li>
            <li>Infiniti by Conair has some great pros:    </li>
            <li>I got a great deal at Amazon for just $22 bucks before christmas.</li>
            <li>Try this, i think you will be just as happy as me.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re really happy with this purchasem</li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Works great to straighten and to flip the ends</li>
            <li>Trust me, it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for two years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>I feel it is a great value.</li>
            <li>but I think if someone uses it as just a straightener, they would probably be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works great for that.</li>
            <li>I bought this while on vacation thinking it would be great to have one tool to carry around instead of two.  </li>
            <li>This one was great.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, great idea, but some improvements could be made.</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>..works great</li>
            <li>It straightens great, and leaves the hair shiny, smooth, and frizz-free, but despite my efforts, I could NOT curl my hair, I followed the directions and everything!!!  </li>
            <li>it does what I love to my hair!!</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I put it on medium because it said that level is good for permed hair, but it smokes...</li>
            <li>Good product, lots of options.  </li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t keep a good curl.</li>
            <li>but i heard some good reviews on this, so i took a chance thinking</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the chi for a good price...</li>
            <li>this Conair one was good for straightening</li>
            <li>Affordable and good quality.</li>
            <li>good thing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to do another rotation.</li>
            <li>good to have</li>
            <li>I used this straightener at my mom&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good straightener, but that wasn&#x27;t what I had purchased it for.</li>
            <li>It works well as a straightener, but not too good as a curler.</li>
            <li>This was a good item that i purchased.</li>
            <li>It made me feel good.</li>
            <li>But it is good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>i appreciate amazon&#x27;s delivery system...really good...</li>
            <li>I loved this iron the 3 times I used it, then the 4th time I dropped it and</li>
            <li>its a cool concept, but if youre looking for pinstraight hair, or perfect curls, id buy your tools seperately.</li>
            <li>This is just what my wife wanted, we know it&#x27;s very good and hairstyle can be easily achieved.because</li>
            <li>first time out of the box with the chi and straightened my bangs perfectly and curled a section as a test soooo easily and perfectly with all my hair still intact!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed how quickly it did heat up.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This does a great job straightening my hair, better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>But it enhances the shine of either very healthy hair or hair that&#x27;s been doused with a shine spray.)    </li>
            <li>We bought 2 and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>nice product and also good price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but once you watch the dvd you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I love this Hair Straightener!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>You are better off using a 3/4 inch curling iron and hair spray!</li>
            <li>I am a cosmotolagest and love this product!</li>
            <li>You can get so many styles out of this!</li>
            <li>, i bought one or me and one for my mom, we love them!</li>
            <li>Getting a great curl is so easy.</li>
            <li>but this is great easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and out come amazing curls . .</li>
            <li>The straightener part is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still great, but just not as smooth.</li>
            <li>Its so unbelievably amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought this iron was going to be amazing.</li>
            <li>tucks ends nicely  </li>
            <li>So this is a nice product for me.</li>
            <li>but I could never get the ends of the curl to look nice with this product.  </li>
            <li>really nice...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned another curling iron from Infiniti by Conair and really liked it.</li>
            <li>kind of look once you brush through them.</li>
            <li>Of course, you can get something like a curl or wave, just not the kind you want and where you want it.</li>
            <li>I think if the plates did go all the way around, there wouldn&#x27;t be any crimps in everyone&#x27;s hair including my own.</li>
            <li>The plates burnt my hair and the curls didn&#x27;t come out as nice.</li>
            <li>But this is an excellent straightening iron, great for flipping the ends under, heats up almost instantly, and curls almost as well as a curling iron, with fewer tangles.</li>
            <li>... it looks better but doesnt do as good of a job.  </li>
            <li>I would still have a nice straightener.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even want it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li>after taking over my cousin&#x27;s and having to return it, i ended up buying my own conair infinity flat/curling iron.</li>
            <li>honestly i was still a sceptic</li>
            <li>And who knows, maybe after more practice I will be able to get the model&#x27;s curls!</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair perfectly, but as far as the curling feature...HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li>his office was super fast, stay delighted when I was told that I was in the mail, Wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy when I need to straighten my hair for an event :3</li>
            <li>this is a very nice straightener, and does exactly what it sais it does!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo easy to use and works perfectly for straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This product makes curls easy!</li>
            <li>I bought it specifically to easily curl my hair, and it does just that!</li>
            <li>I just used this appliance for the very first time and I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and your hair will have a silky and healthy finish.</li>
            <li>everyone seems pretty happy with their straightener, but ive had it for about a year now</li>
            <li>This is a very cheaply made straightener.</li>
            <li>Very light  2.</li>
            <li>For the first month or so of using this, it was great - got really cute curls (though I did have to use a hotter temperature than what they recommend in the instructions).</li>
            <li>I have hair that is fairly easy to straighten or curl, and I thought it would be nice if one tool could do both.  </li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>I love using diff kinds of product .. also Love to write a review...</li>
            <li>The more I curl my hair the easier and faster</li>
            <li>Maybe it can help you too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I get my hair done faster and love the results.  </li>
            <li>I was able to work the iron better around my face than around my head tho.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE that look,  </li>
            <li>So if she likes it, I love it.</li>
            <li>A friend of her&amp;#34;s had one and paid a lot more money than I did for Mikalas .</li>
            <li>I will say that I think it is better for curling than than straightening.  </li>
            <li>I got this produce because I used a curler and thought that it would eliminate the frizz if I was able to use a straightener.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>,LOVE LOVE it.    </li>
            <li>totally convinced i needed one i went to the store and saw this conair one thinking it&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li>I had this for a more than a year</li>
            <li>But for the price, and how much I love it..</li>
            <li>REGRET IT :)</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and it isnt my favorite...  </li>
            <li>Mostly it&#x27;s neat though...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to detailed straightening, and it doesn&#x27;t make me frizz.</li>
            <li>This is my most trusted hair styler.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know if this was all a consequence of temperature and moisture fluctuations or more a result of the iron.  </li>
            <li>I can curl my hair better with my straightner than this thing.</li>
            <li>but it burnt me many many times.</li>
            <li>it marks the hair even more.   </li>
            <li>Might be better if it was thicker (1 1/2 inches</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to keep ONE curl in my hair.</li>
            <li>your hands and hair will be safe and with some practice you can have curls too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to straighten hair</li>
            <li>I love the curls it makes</li>
            <li>I also had a problem with my hair frizzing more while using too.</li>
            <li>I will definetely be sticking with my curling iron and curlers and wait till something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Not any more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the item.</li>
            <li>More ppl should buy it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>will post a video when i receive it,hope it will turn out okey :)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t accept my comment :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>As a straightener it worked okay, though the curling part of the tool gets in the way when you use it close to your scalp.  </li>
            <li>It did straighten ok though will give it to my daughter  </li>
            <li>she seems to do ok with it.</li>
            <li>She says it is great on hair, she really loves it.</li>
            <li>maybe with more practice</li>
            <li>Also, the two cooling plates leave dents on your hair and the curl doesn&#x27;t come out nice and smooth at all.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I love the waves I can make with the you styler.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the idea of this iron.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair on the top and curls the bottoms.</li>
            <li>I would try something else and get a better quality iron.</li>
            <li>It works ok but not as well as the product I had to replace.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t works so well on me as it does with wavy hair or it worked better on my mum&#x27;s hair than in mine</li>
            <li>read many reviews in diff.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It may be perfect for certain types of hair, but unfortunately, not mine.</li>
            <li>Very useful!</li>
            <li>I was very excited by the claims Conair made for this ceramic curler/straightener.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is generally easy to curl or straighten</li>
            <li>smoothens hair and gives it beautiful body if i use it to create soft waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for straightening my hair (hence the 2 stars versus 1)</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>Easy to control buttons too but did not like how the plates don&#x27;t go all the way around the top and bottom of the iron.</li>
            <li>mostly because its kind of akward to use at first, it takes some practice, but it definatly creates the waves and looks curls</li>
            <li>It curls and flattens the hair perfectly and the price is nice, but your hair tends to get stuck between the small gaps on each side of the iron plates, and pull out hair.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s true for any straightener!</li>
            <li>Do bangs (also easy correct</li>
            <li>The directions are illustrated, and easily understood.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around  4.</li>
            <li>Price was great as I saw the same product at Target for more money.</li>
            <li>the way the chi handles are set up you can do this one handed easily...</li>
            <li>and it was so easy.</li>
            <li>The curling action is clunky at best and is much easier to do with an iron with curved plates and plastic body.</li>
            <li>I thought this item would be easy to use, but it is not.  </li>
            <li>Before I had an strong healty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair curls pretty easily, but not with this tool, so all it is really good for is a straightener, but it leaves my hair fairly damaged and the straightener I currently have works much much better.  </li>
            <li>Did an okay job, nothing special</li>
            <li>Good that it gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product, high quality, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>You have to twist the iron around as you pull down the hair, and it will work perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s got many cool features and most of all, it was sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>To be honest with you, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high because I know that high-performance hair styling tools cost a lot more money.</li>
            <li>Its so light weight and easy to use for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li>But you will be fine if you are holding that bunch of hair until it slides almost to the end.</li>
            <li>It straightens fine, but when I go to curl my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful and safe for my ten year old!!</li>
            <li>The flat iron works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this curler/straightener for 6 months now and it works great on my fine Asian hair.  </li>
            <li>and you get fabulous curls</li>
            <li>Hold the end shut so that the plates smooth your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy my hair being torn out of my head and after using it five or six times became fed up and ordered a solia.</li>
            <li>The result was shiny, smooth and sleek hair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to smooth and curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday although it may not be the greatest on my hair.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do anything but smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>I find it works great on short to medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a straightener like this to smooth and add a bit of curl to the ends.</li>
            <li>It leaves silky curls or smooth strait hair.</li>
            <li>The straightener part does a pretty good job, as it does get really hot, HOWEVER the curling part did NOTHING for me</li>
            <li>i will NEVER use this brand again, i do have a blow dryer from them, and that works fine, but its nothing unique, it was cheap, that y i got it</li>
            <li>other than that, it really was a great iron! :)</li>
            <li>Really its worth every penny !!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I tried it on my bangs and it actually created great curls like the ads.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to add fullness to my hair, straighten, do curls, etc.</li>
            <li>Super easy to work.</li>
            <li>its not the best iron out there and the curling part doesn&#x27;t even really work, but if your just looking for a flat iron that heats up really quick and is cheap, go with this one.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because i had been going to extremes to get my hair to curl.  </li>
            <li>i was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pretty curl &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>My original combo curling/flat iron broke</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Conair customer and many of there products</li>
            <li>like i had originally planned on doing...</li>
            <li>I have tried out the curling function a couple times and it works okay, but didn&#x27;t give me exactly the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Originally I thought I&#x27;d need two tools, but this one does both.</li>
            <li>I deffinetly recommend it to everyone, the curlers on the sides help me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited about it.</li>
            <li>The instructions say the curling may take some practice, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that isn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Pros:  heats up quick  cheap  </li>
            <li>My hair was very far from nice when i was done with this.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have a great deal of very fine, curly hair, down to the middle of my back, so its a challenge to style it in the best of circumstances.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was just looking for a hair straightener, but when I found this I thought it would be cool to have a two in one tool.  </li>
            <li>I can get cute curled ends or full curly hair with this tool so fast.</li>
            <li>As far as curling, it does a nice curl</li>
            <li>Love it straight or curly</li>
            <li>But with this I can put more amount of hair and it still comes out pin straight.</li>
            <li>This was is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works about half way (kind of curls, kind of straightens).</li>
            <li>Straightens well, curls ok, heats up super fast, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>first time I used it it was easy to handle, and seemed to do just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly and retains heat well.  </li>
            <li>While it straightens it almost adequately and does leave the hair shiny, it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick    </li>
            <li>I watchED the quick dvd supplied and within minutes i had it plugged and heated up.    </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really compare it to a straighter that costs 10x as much, but for $25, I honestly can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and maintains the temperature.  </li>
            <li>and it was so quick to straigten.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>I borrowed my friends a few times and liked it so had to order my own.  </li>
            <li>This gets very hot and does a super job at straightening.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Price is right, shipping fast (and free w/ prime)...good purchase!</li>
            <li>It can get out the stubborn waves near the top on the hair and leave a nice curl near the bottom.</li>
            <li>The curls it makes are very pretty, girl</li>
            <li>The transaction was excellent but this product is not good.</li>
            <li>so if you have very curly hair better get something more professional like the CHI irons or ask your hair styler what he/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>This straightner is really great for the price, it heats up super fast and cools down just as easily.</li>
            <li>I love it, and am always finding new ways to use it.</li>
            <li>And really, that seems likes something that would be so easy for them to fix.  </li>
            <li>My hair is somewhere between curly and straight, which you would think would make it easy to go either way.</li>
            <li>Straightening hair is ok, but sometimes the cooling plates (which btw get hot, so they aren&#x27;t very cooling) get in the way and trap your hair.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the curls that I was able to maintain were very natural looking beachy waves</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product you will love it!    </li>
            <li>And you&#x27;ll get sleek hair with pretty curls!    </li>
            <li>I returned this product the next day and will continue searching for something better!</li>
            <li>She has fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li>However, I could not make it curl my hair in any way that looked good or remotely like the ads.</li>
            <li>It may possibly be the best $30 I have ever spent on my hair.      </li>
            <li>I needed a hair straightner that wasn&#x27;t over 100 bucks, and this thing was worth the money that was under 30 bucks.</li>
            <li>Okay, first of all my hair is medium length and NOT thick.  </li>
            <li>The instructions for very simple ,it heats up pretty quickly and the result was really amazing</li>
            <li>sometimes it curls my hair great, other times, it&#x27;s only okay</li>
            <li>Tame fly aways  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because I had never been able to properly curl/</li>
            <li>Reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work probably didn&#x27;t use the right products.  </li>
            <li>I think if you want lots of curls close to the scalp, this may not be the right product for you.  </li>
            <li>I absolute love my new conair</li>
            <li>Finally when I saw the QVC.com videos I was half way impressed.</li>
            <li>Can handle large amounts of hair at a time for quick finish time.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very warm even on the high setting.</li>
            <li>It does have some great features: it is very lightweight, and it does a good job straightening hair, as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too thick or too curly.</li>
            <li>When I first got this from Walmart, I was really excited to test it out, at first I was really dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>They are now sending me a new one for free.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer to use my curling iron if I wanna make perfect curls starting fron the roots, but this iron is extremelly practical because your hair doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dead straight\\&quot; at the ends</li>
            <li>so you can take it with you on any trip, it super fast and so efficient.</li>
            <li>It could only curl about 2-3 inches of hair at a time, so my medium-long hair required me going up each section of hair multiple times - time consuming, and it didn&#x27;t give an attractive result.  </li>
            <li>and after the first couple curls the cooling plate gets to hot for it to work right</li>
            <li>This item also really pulls on my hair and it tore a fair amount of hair out, a problem I haven&#x27;t had with any other curlers or straighteners.  </li>
            <li>I loved the soft curls and body it gave my usually flat hair.</li>
            <li>This little device here does a really good job in curling hair</li>
            <li>and I love the convenience of having both options - to straighten or curl with the same product.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2M78AFYXN12J9]]This Is my First review for a product...</li>
            <li>Medium is plenty hot.</li>
            <li>instant heat, It has the tourmaline ceramic technology - most seem to have this, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>i could never acheive with a curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li>A regular straightner curl better than this one.</li>
            <li>its warms up fast!</li>
            <li>At first when I purchased this item I wanted to use this as a curler.  </li>
            <li>the curls were okay, not the same as in the video i saw... since the plates do not extend over the length of the handles my hair got ripped out between the plastic and the plates...</li>
            <li>but once you get use to it, it turns out pretty.</li>
            <li>It gives you soft, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>You really wont regret it!</li>
            <li>I found a better video on you tube and learned how to properly do the curling technique and viola!!</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try this one as the outer part doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job on my hair !</li>
            <li>First i wanted this because i though it would curl</li>
            <li>get hot....  </li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t get that hot).</li>
            <li>The metal piece that is suppose tot curl your hair does not go all the way around and the curl turns out funny.</li>
            <li>When I put in velcro rollers when my hair is wet, I get beautiful big curls.</li>
            <li>Not what the commercial shows for sure.  </li>
            <li>Works magic on her hair; had a problem keeping my daughter from opening and using it prior to Christmas!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>I wore out my first one...</li>
            <li>First use it did not curl my hair as it claimed.  </li>
            <li>I ruined my first one by spilling liquid on it - had to get it again.</li>
            <li>I was replacing it because I was always using one similar, better quality that my roommate always let me use.</li>
            <li>it just bends it and makes my hair look funny.  </li>
            <li>At first it did nothing but straighten.</li>
            <li>,it doesnt get that hot for starters and it takes me a loooooong time to get my hair atraight with this</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It really helped!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to carry a straight iron and a curling iron when I travel!</li>
            <li>I have really think curly hair so of course straightening it takes forever, so I rarely do it.</li>
            <li>Its ok only two heats</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up AT ALL, not even hot to touch</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair shine like when I use Gold&#x27;N Hot product.</li>
            <li>I placed a ceramic hot plate holder at my dresser for it, just in case..  have not burned myself yet...</li>
            <li>I bought it just couple days ago, feeling very excited about making different hair styles the first day.</li>
            <li>I was trying to  get that slight curl, which I got, but then decided really didn&#x27;t look good on me, but that&#x27;s not the straighteners fault.</li>
            <li>I just love this straightener, it light and little</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just learning how to use a flat iron, so - as I become more accustomed to using it, I will add to my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this curling flat iron combo.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Overall it was good for the low price.</li>
            <li>I have very long, layered hair that is bountiful but very fine and pretty much stick-straight.  </li>
            <li>The straight sides and curved sides allow me to make my hair very straight or with a bit of curve, depending on what style I want that day.  </li>
            <li>it gets it straight and with this one i have to go through it like 5 6 times to get it straight !</li>
            <li>Medium is far too hot for my fine hair, and low is too cool.  </li>
            <li>After a a very long time I fell in love with my hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m terrified of handling curling irons), and this looked easy enough.</li>
            <li>If your hair curls easily, you might get different results than I did, but, if not choose another product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair you probably only need \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat.  </li>
            <li>As it is, we will put this away until she&#x27;s older!</li>
            <li>good flat iron  lasts long    </li>
            <li>The people who did not have any luck with this possibley didnt watch the instuctional dvd (wich is very clear and makes the process even easier) or probably tried to curl lockes of hair that were too thick (does much better with thinner lockes and be sure to twirl hair with finger).</li>
            <li>This styler is my first, and so far, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It is a great straightener, but not a great curler.</li>
            <li>Works really well as a curling iron, and straightens too.  </li>
            <li>Turn it on and before I&#x27;m done putting on deodorant, a bra and shirt, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight but is very puffy and frizzy looking.</li>
            <li>This Conair CS54 iron lets me flatten my puffy hair and gently tuck the ends under</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today and after playing with it was ready it, was ready to return it.</li>
            <li>like i said it takes pratice timing the rolling of the tool and how much hair to do at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck curling my hair before.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my hair goes straight when I meant it to be curly.</li>
            <li>youtube video was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>The plates leave a straight line in your hair when you try to make a curl.</li>
            <li>This one heats up much faster and is a lot easier to use since it&#x27;s lighter with narrower plates.  </li>
            <li>The curl feature is an added bonus; it&#x27;s worked well for curling hair under and creating gentle waves.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to really have to use it.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>She really likes it, but when I borrowed it to try it out, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremly fast also.    </li>
            <li>also the way the handles are set up you really need to hold the iron on both sides of the plates for the iron to get a grasp on your hair and not slip out...</li>
            <li>but if I grab too much hair, it gets snagged and ripped out on the sides.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>What really helped me was watching the QVC video on it</li>
            <li>affordable, the iron heats up very</li>
            <li>The curls fell out, and my hair looked stick straight...</li>
            <li>Besides this there is too much friction between the hair and the plates</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves hers also.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even really straighten that well.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Havnt really used to curling part.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as a curler but a fantastic straightener, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>- this item just pulls too much on the hair and doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>What I do use the curved edge for is to curl the ends of my hair under so that it&#x27;s not stick straight like a broom.</li>
            <li>didnt really like the curls it produced.  </li>
            <li>and I have straight hair to start with I</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>and it seems to be gentle with my hair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be fine as a flat iron, but for curls/waves it doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the plates get hot enough to create a super straight look.  </li>
            <li>But this just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations, the cooling plate gets hot, fast.</li>
            <li>It seems rollers left in overnight are the only way to get curls to stay for me; otherwise it looks great for about five minutes, then falls flat.</li>
            <li>and i mean it&#x27;s a good iron</li>
            <li>I have been using a flat iron for years to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to achieve this with any other straightener i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair, but it does a great job on creating a little curve so that my long bangs have a certain lively swish to them.  </li>
            <li>Better than the conventional cylinder iron curler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made my super thick hair look so silky and sexy with it.</li>
            <li>It was not soft to the touch or smooth looking.   </li>
            <li>Whether I want soft curls or straight hair, I can do it all with this ONE tool!  </li>
            <li>But this product pretty much does the same exact thing the walmart straightneres do for 15 dollars for working sakes..</li>
            <li>Your hair responds a lot better to the curl if it&#x27;s not freshly washed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own one as of yet, but in the past my cousin would let me borrow hers.</li>
            <li>More for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>This handy little tool creates shiney, soft and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>I like it a whole lot better than regular straighteners that leave my hair looking flat and lifeless!</li>
            <li>And less hair at one time the better.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for straightening half length and some curls for ends.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not a super straightener, it&#x27;s better than you might think for $20.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted it for the curling feature</li>
            <li>Recently both my favorite curling iron and my straightening iron broke, so i bought  this instead of two different tools.</li>
            <li>I used this mainly as a straightener, and it works</li>
            <li>Needless to say i absolutely love it, whenever i use it, I look like I just acme from the salon. :)</li>
            <li>I just happened to drop it from a high spot (10 feet....)</li>
            <li>All of my hair tools (straightener, curling iron, hair dryer) are made by Conair and all the cheep tools ($10-$20) work great but all the \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; products that are more expensive ($40-$50) seem to do about half the work including this product and the rotating brush hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/do over if you&#x27;ve curled too much; you can play with it until it looks natural)  </li>
            <li>The straightener part of it is great, but trying to manuever it to curl your hair, was too difficult for me.</li>
            <li>I usually do a ratio of how many bad verses how many good before I decide.     </li>
            <li>For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was surprised at how well this item worked.  </li>
            <li>As far as the curling capability, I don&#x27;t really use it to \\&quot;curl\\</li>
            <li>It was a waste of my money because now I need to find a curling iron that works better.</li>
            <li>For people that use a flat iron, as I do, everyday and want a \\&quot;flippy\\&quot; look at the end that cannot be done with a regular flat iron this product is WONDERFUL, and that is what I will use mine for now.</li>
            <li>I watched the video a few times and made sure I do as instructed.</li>
            <li>Keep your hair pretty much in the middle.  </li>
            <li>The hot and med. work very well for coarse textures.</li>
            <li>Very good product overall, would definitley recommend to anyone who has trouble curling their hair with conventional curlers and curling irons.</li>
            <li>You can actually get a nice curl with a regular flat iron that has spring-adjusted plates and smooth outer surface, like Chi or other brands.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help tame my wavy hair and to give it more defined curls.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this iron wanting a new and easier way to curl and style my hair.</li>
            <li>Should have found another as I bought the NEW Conair replacement for this</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find a flat iron with a lower heat setting that can be used on fine hair,most lower settings are still to hot and damaging for fine hair.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron I would take much longer to get my hair perfectly straight as I have very wavy/curly hair.     </li>
            <li>I will warn you that it takes time to master the correct movement to create a curl, but it is worth it when you consider how long it takes to curl your hair normally.</li>
            <li>It seems like the new one doesnt get as hot even though it says the same temp on the specs.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be dry hair, high heat, and with the right products.  </li>
            <li>straightens pretty good, hard to get the curls down, though...</li>
            <li>Regardless, I saw this product (or one similar) in a TV commercial and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>This product does not get hot enough...</li>
            <li>I have noticed it doesnt always get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, although I&#x27;m sure this has the potential to both straighten and curl hair, it seems quite tricky to get it to curl.</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s my hottest burning tool, my hair was too hot to touch and feels crispy after only one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ideal, but Infiniti by Conair CS54 is a good introduction to curler/straighteners.</li>
            <li>is long, fine, with strands of different length - I lost a lot of hair via it getting caught on the corner of the heating plate.</li>
            <li>basically if you want tight curls using hot rollers or a tradional curling iron is better, but if you want soft waves and loose curls to add movement and volume to your hair</li>
            <li>As such, I wasn&#x27;t too surprised that this didn&#x27;t curl my hair any better than any of the other tools I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It does take a few practices to get the curl you want, it works and it&#x27;s easy to learn.</li>
            <li>Broken and damaged hair just causes more frizz!</li>
            <li>Also, the curls aren&#x27;t as full as the other one I used.</li>
            <li>I got this iron a few years ago for Christmas and had the same issue many other people did with having trouble getting a curl because of the misleading commercial, I kept it and used it to straighten my hair which works great by itself.</li>
            <li>Had a little trouble curling in the beginning but with smaller sections it worked great</li>
            <li>If you have freazy hair, this curler should style it professionally.</li>
            <li>In addition, the tool has these metal plates that frequently snagged my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this iron because you straighten your hair making a soft curl at the ends so that it looks natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one for two weeks now and so far it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair (my hair is naturally curly).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that wasn&#x27;t found in quality control but it should definitely be fixed.</li>
            <li>Hair frequently snags in the gap between the end of the heating plate and the plastic.  </li>
            <li>I used this to try and put soft waves in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Im in my 50&#x27;s and this young stuff</li>
            <li>Worth the 20 bucks I spent on it.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I do really love that it only took less than 15 seconds to heat up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive similar products, and this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I watched the brief dvd and tried again and was amazed at the curls...and that they last in my super fine, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Does well for wave and big soft curls, mainly in the ends.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it to make tight, full head of curls.</li>
            <li>However, it does not get hot enough for the curl to last.</li>
            <li>Twist as soon as possible so that the curl starts as high up as it can.</li>
            <li>Low, medium or high heat acdording to your hair type.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally need a flat iron because I have straight fine hair naturally, but sometimes I want a little extra lift that I can get with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>cause it really takes me long with it to straighten it (about 2 hours)  </li>
            <li>And this product do stuck hair in the gaps between different materials, and I guess it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, I try to make it like a pixzie cut, and it is so precise it makes it a little too pixie.</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more and got a quality product.</li>
            <li>The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have really thick hair and would like to be able to curl bigger chunks of hair at a time (it kinda takes awhile!)</li>
            <li>I found that I still had major waves throughout my hair even after using this tool for 40 minutes after a straightening balm and blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I found the same styler in other stores but it was always $45 or higher!</li>
            <li>The grasp the styler has on hair is too loose and doesn&#x27;t straighten or curl very well at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally, my hair isn&#x27;t hard to smooth or curl, but this device achieved neither.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple times to get the angle right for my hair length and how tight I want the curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same flat iron for years and needed to get a new one because my old one died.</li>
            <li>I had completely given up on curling my hair until I saw the commercial for the Infiniti.</li>
            <li>Her hair is quite thick and long so maybe that&#x27;s an issue - I&#x27;m regretting not buying a simple curler as that&#x27;s all she wanted...and at 12 yrs old, I think would have been better.</li>
            <li>Works ok to curl or straighten hair if not naturally curly or thick.</li>
            <li>I guess I will stick with my hot rollers to curl my hair until the aliens come down and show somebody how to Jane Jetson their hair into spiral curls...</li>
            <li>It does heat up really fast, and unlike my other conair straightener it doesn&#x27;t have to keep re-heating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to glide the iron through your hair in order to curl it, as the commercial suggests--actually NOT easy at all, hair gets caught in the metal, pulled and it breaks(!!)</li>
            <li>For people who want to curl their hair, it takes just as long to use a curling iron or rollers to achieve the same look so really its just a flat iron to me.</li>
            <li>I only deducted one star because previous reviewers were right in that it DOES occasionally pull out hairs if you&#x27;re not careful - there&#x27;s some gap in between the plates somewhere that occasionally catches strands of hair.</li>
            <li>i am very let down,</li>
            <li>you just pull straight down</li>
            <li>depending on the size chunk of hair and how fast you move the tool down will control the amount of curl.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference or not, but my hair is down past the middle of my back, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is just touching her</li>
            <li>I would say I have had better luck with the Conair straightener that I had, except it would pull my hair pretty bad which this one does not.  </li>
            <li>She has very thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Was back on Amazon today to look for my previous Conair model that I had, and thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Very unhappy win results.</li>
            <li>and i mean STICK straight -- not at all natural!</li>
            <li>It is poorly designed, with huge gaps between the body of the device and heating plates.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE this iron!!!</li>
            <li> I love it can straighten and curl either one or both!!!</li>
            <li> Very good straightener.</li>
            <li> It was okay...not very good quality</li>
            <li> help my type of hair, however it is not the ideal straightener for that.  </li>
            <li> i should have trusted my gut feeling, ive NEVER had good luck with con air, ALL their products SUCK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept on my curls and they still look gorgeous!</li>
            <li> They turned out beautifully.    </li>
            <li> Win some.  </li>
            <li> The straightener works great on my bangs but still must use a seperate tool to curl the rest of my hair. ...</li>
            <li> this porduct is great</li>
            <li> Great iron curler.</li>
            <li> It is great if you have layers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair falling out of it if you grab a chunk that has parts of both layers.</li>
            <li> I will say though that for straightening your hair, it is great.  </li>
            <li> Infiniti by Conair has some great pros:    </li>
            <li> I got a great deal at Amazon for just $22 bucks before christmas.</li>
            <li> Try this, i think you will be just as happy as me.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re really happy with this purchasem</li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Works great to straighten and to flip the ends</li>
            <li> Trust me, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for two years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I feel it is a great value.</li>
            <li> but I think if someone uses it as just a straightener, they would probably be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It works great for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this while on vacation thinking it would be great to have one tool to carry around instead of two.  </li>
            <li> This one was great.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, great idea, but some improvements could be made.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> ..works great</li>
            <li> It straightens great, and leaves the hair shiny, smooth, and frizz-free, but despite my efforts, I could NOT curl my hair, I followed the directions and everything!!!  </li>
            <li> it does what I love to my hair!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I put it on medium because it said that level is good for permed hair, but it smokes...</li>
            <li> Good product, lots of options.  </li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t keep a good curl.</li>
            <li> but i heard some good reviews on this, so i took a chance thinking</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the chi for a good price...</li>
            <li> this Conair one was good for straightening</li>
            <li> Affordable and good quality.</li>
            <li> good thing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to do another rotation.</li>
            <li> good to have</li>
            <li> I used this straightener at my mom&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener, but that wasn&#x27;t what I had purchased it for.</li>
            <li> It works well as a straightener, but not too good as a curler.</li>
            <li> This was a good item that i purchased.</li>
            <li> It made me feel good.</li>
            <li> But it is good.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> i appreciate amazon&#x27;s delivery system...really good...</li>
            <li> I loved this iron the 3 times I used it, then the 4th time I dropped it and</li>
            <li> its a cool concept, but if youre looking for pinstraight hair, or perfect curls, id buy your tools seperately.</li>
            <li> This is just what my wife wanted, we know it&#x27;s very good and hairstyle can be easily achieved.because</li>
            <li> first time out of the box with the chi and straightened my bangs perfectly and curled a section as a test soooo easily and perfectly with all my hair still intact!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed how quickly it did heat up.</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This does a great job straightening my hair, better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> But it enhances the shine of either very healthy hair or hair that&#x27;s been doused with a shine spray.)    </li>
            <li> We bought 2 and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> nice product and also good price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but once you watch the dvd you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Hair Straightener!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> You are better off using a 3/4 inch curling iron and hair spray!</li>
            <li> I am a cosmotolagest and love this product!</li>
            <li> You can get so many styles out of this!</li>
            <li> , i bought one or me and one for my mom, we love them!</li>
            <li> Getting a great curl is so easy.</li>
            <li> but this is great easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> It works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and out come amazing curls . .</li>
            <li> The straightener part is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still great, but just not as smooth.</li>
            <li> Its so unbelievably amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought this iron was going to be amazing.</li>
            <li> tucks ends nicely  </li>
            <li> So this is a nice product for me.</li>
            <li> but I could never get the ends of the curl to look nice with this product.  </li>
            <li> really nice...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned another curling iron from Infiniti by Conair and really liked it.</li>
            <li> kind of look once you brush through them.</li>
            <li> Of course, you can get something like a curl or wave, just not the kind you want and where you want it.</li>
            <li> I think if the plates did go all the way around, there wouldn&#x27;t be any crimps in everyone&#x27;s hair including my own.</li>
            <li> The plates burnt my hair and the curls didn&#x27;t come out as nice.</li>
            <li> But this is an excellent straightening iron, great for flipping the ends under, heats up almost instantly, and curls almost as well as a curling iron, with fewer tangles.</li>
            <li> ... it looks better but doesnt do as good of a job.  </li>
            <li> I would still have a nice straightener.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t even want it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li> after taking over my cousin&#x27;s and having to return it, i ended up buying my own conair infinity flat/curling iron.</li>
            <li> honestly i was still a sceptic</li>
            <li> And who knows, maybe after more practice I will be able to get the model&#x27;s curls!</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair perfectly, but as far as the curling feature...HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> his office was super fast, stay delighted when I was told that I was in the mail, Wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy when I need to straighten my hair for an event :3</li>
            <li> this is a very nice straightener, and does exactly what it sais it does!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo easy to use and works perfectly for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> This product makes curls easy!</li>
            <li> I bought it specifically to easily curl my hair, and it does just that!</li>
            <li> I just used this appliance for the very first time and I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and your hair will have a silky and healthy finish.</li>
            <li> everyone seems pretty happy with their straightener, but ive had it for about a year now</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made straightener.</li>
            <li> Very light  2.</li>
            <li> For the first month or so of using this, it was great - got really cute curls (though I did have to use a hotter temperature than what they recommend in the instructions).</li>
            <li> I have hair that is fairly easy to straighten or curl, and I thought it would be nice if one tool could do both.  </li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> I love using diff kinds of product .. also Love to write a review...</li>
            <li> The more I curl my hair the easier and faster</li>
            <li> Maybe it can help you too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I get my hair done faster and love the results.  </li>
            <li> I was able to work the iron better around my face than around my head tho.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE that look,  </li>
            <li> So if she likes it, I love it.</li>
            <li> A friend of her&amp;#34;s had one and paid a lot more money than I did for Mikalas .</li>
            <li> I will say that I think it is better for curling than than straightening.  </li>
            <li> I got this produce because I used a curler and thought that it would eliminate the frizz if I was able to use a straightener.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> ,LOVE LOVE it.    </li>
            <li> totally convinced i needed one i went to the store and saw this conair one thinking it&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li> I had this for a more than a year</li>
            <li> But for the price, and how much I love it..</li>
            <li> REGRET IT :)</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> and it isnt my favorite...  </li>
            <li> Mostly it&#x27;s neat though...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice to detailed straightening, and it doesn&#x27;t make me frizz.</li>
            <li> This is my most trusted hair styler.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know if this was all a consequence of temperature and moisture fluctuations or more a result of the iron.  </li>
            <li> I can curl my hair better with my straightner than this thing.</li>
            <li> but it burnt me many many times.</li>
            <li> it marks the hair even more.   </li>
            <li> Might be better if it was thicker (1 1/2 inches</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to keep ONE curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> your hands and hair will be safe and with some practice you can have curls too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to straighten hair</li>
            <li> I love the curls it makes</li>
            <li> I also had a problem with my hair frizzing more while using too.</li>
            <li> I will definetely be sticking with my curling iron and curlers and wait till something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Not any more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the item.</li>
            <li> More ppl should buy it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> will post a video when i receive it,hope it will turn out okey :)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t accept my comment :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> As a straightener it worked okay, though the curling part of the tool gets in the way when you use it close to your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It did straighten ok though will give it to my daughter  </li>
            <li> she seems to do ok with it.</li>
            <li> She says it is great on hair, she really loves it.</li>
            <li> maybe with more practice</li>
            <li> Also, the two cooling plates leave dents on your hair and the curl doesn&#x27;t come out nice and smooth at all.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I love the waves I can make with the you styler.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the idea of this iron.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair on the top and curls the bottoms.</li>
            <li> I would try something else and get a better quality iron.</li>
            <li> It works ok but not as well as the product I had to replace.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t works so well on me as it does with wavy hair or it worked better on my mum&#x27;s hair than in mine</li>
            <li> read many reviews in diff.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It may be perfect for certain types of hair, but unfortunately, not mine.</li>
            <li> Very useful!</li>
            <li> I was very excited by the claims Conair made for this ceramic curler/straightener.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is generally easy to curl or straighten</li>
            <li> smoothens hair and gives it beautiful body if i use it to create soft waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for straightening my hair (hence the 2 stars versus 1)</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> Easy to control buttons too but did not like how the plates don&#x27;t go all the way around the top and bottom of the iron.</li>
            <li> mostly because its kind of akward to use at first, it takes some practice, but it definatly creates the waves and looks curls</li>
            <li> It curls and flattens the hair perfectly and the price is nice, but your hair tends to get stuck between the small gaps on each side of the iron plates, and pull out hair.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s true for any straightener!</li>
            <li> Do bangs (also easy correct</li>
            <li> The directions are illustrated, and easily understood.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around  4.</li>
            <li> Price was great as I saw the same product at Target for more money.</li>
            <li> the way the chi handles are set up you can do this one handed easily...</li>
            <li> and it was so easy.</li>
            <li> The curling action is clunky at best and is much easier to do with an iron with curved plates and plastic body.</li>
            <li> I thought this item would be easy to use, but it is not.  </li>
            <li> Before I had an strong healty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair curls pretty easily, but not with this tool, so all it is really good for is a straightener, but it leaves my hair fairly damaged and the straightener I currently have works much much better.  </li>
            <li> Did an okay job, nothing special</li>
            <li> Good that it gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> You have to twist the iron around as you pull down the hair, and it will work perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s got many cool features and most of all, it was sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> To be honest with you, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high because I know that high-performance hair styling tools cost a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Its so light weight and easy to use for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> But you will be fine if you are holding that bunch of hair until it slides almost to the end.</li>
            <li> It straightens fine, but when I go to curl my hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful and safe for my ten year old!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this curler/straightener for 6 months now and it works great on my fine Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> and you get fabulous curls</li>
            <li> Hold the end shut so that the plates smooth your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy my hair being torn out of my head and after using it five or six times became fed up and ordered a solia.</li>
            <li> The result was shiny, smooth and sleek hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to smooth and curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday although it may not be the greatest on my hair.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything but smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> I find it works great on short to medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a straightener like this to smooth and add a bit of curl to the ends.</li>
            <li> It leaves silky curls or smooth strait hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener part does a pretty good job, as it does get really hot, HOWEVER the curling part did NOTHING for me</li>
            <li> i will NEVER use this brand again, i do have a blow dryer from them, and that works fine, but its nothing unique, it was cheap, that y i got it</li>
            <li> other than that, it really was a great iron! :)</li>
            <li> Really its worth every penny !!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I tried it on my bangs and it actually created great curls like the ads.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to add fullness to my hair, straighten, do curls, etc.</li>
            <li> Super easy to work.</li>
            <li> its not the best iron out there and the curling part doesn&#x27;t even really work, but if your just looking for a flat iron that heats up really quick and is cheap, go with this one.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because i had been going to extremes to get my hair to curl.  </li>
            <li> i was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty curl &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> My original combo curling/flat iron broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid Conair customer and many of there products</li>
            <li> like i had originally planned on doing...</li>
            <li> I have tried out the curling function a couple times and it works okay, but didn&#x27;t give me exactly the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Originally I thought I&#x27;d need two tools, but this one does both.</li>
            <li> I deffinetly recommend it to everyone, the curlers on the sides help me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited about it.</li>
            <li> The instructions say the curling may take some practice, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that isn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  heats up quick  cheap  </li>
            <li> My hair was very far from nice when i was done with this.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have a great deal of very fine, curly hair, down to the middle of my back, so its a challenge to style it in the best of circumstances.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was just looking for a hair straightener, but when I found this I thought it would be cool to have a two in one tool.  </li>
            <li> I can get cute curled ends or full curly hair with this tool so fast.</li>
            <li> As far as curling, it does a nice curl</li>
            <li> Love it straight or curly</li>
            <li> But with this I can put more amount of hair and it still comes out pin straight.</li>
            <li> This was is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it works about half way (kind of curls, kind of straightens).</li>
            <li> Straightens well, curls ok, heats up super fast, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> first time I used it it was easy to handle, and seemed to do just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly and retains heat well.  </li>
            <li> While it straightens it almost adequately and does leave the hair shiny, it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick    </li>
            <li> I watchED the quick dvd supplied and within minutes i had it plugged and heated up.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really compare it to a straighter that costs 10x as much, but for $25, I honestly can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and maintains the temperature.  </li>
            <li> and it was so quick to straigten.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> I borrowed my friends a few times and liked it so had to order my own.  </li>
            <li> This gets very hot and does a super job at straightening.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> Price is right, shipping fast (and free w/ prime)...good purchase!</li>
            <li> It can get out the stubborn waves near the top on the hair and leave a nice curl near the bottom.</li>
            <li> The curls it makes are very pretty, girl</li>
            <li> The transaction was excellent but this product is not good.</li>
            <li> so if you have very curly hair better get something more professional like the CHI irons or ask your hair styler what he/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> This straightner is really great for the price, it heats up super fast and cools down just as easily.</li>
            <li> I love it, and am always finding new ways to use it.</li>
            <li> And really, that seems likes something that would be so easy for them to fix.  </li>
            <li> My hair is somewhere between curly and straight, which you would think would make it easy to go either way.</li>
            <li> Straightening hair is ok, but sometimes the cooling plates (which btw get hot, so they aren&#x27;t very cooling) get in the way and trap your hair.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the curls that I was able to maintain were very natural looking beachy waves</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product you will love it!    </li>
            <li> And you&#x27;ll get sleek hair with pretty curls!    </li>
            <li> I returned this product the next day and will continue searching for something better!</li>
            <li> She has fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li> However, I could not make it curl my hair in any way that looked good or remotely like the ads.</li>
            <li> It may possibly be the best $30 I have ever spent on my hair.      </li>
            <li> I needed a hair straightner that wasn&#x27;t over 100 bucks, and this thing was worth the money that was under 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all my hair is medium length and NOT thick.  </li>
            <li> The instructions for very simple ,it heats up pretty quickly and the result was really amazing</li>
            <li> sometimes it curls my hair great, other times, it&#x27;s only okay</li>
            <li> Tame fly aways  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because I had never been able to properly curl/</li>
            <li> Reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work probably didn&#x27;t use the right products.  </li>
            <li> I think if you want lots of curls close to the scalp, this may not be the right product for you.  </li>
            <li> I absolute love my new conair</li>
            <li> Finally when I saw the QVC.com videos I was half way impressed.</li>
            <li> Can handle large amounts of hair at a time for quick finish time.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very warm even on the high setting.</li>
            <li> It does have some great features: it is very lightweight, and it does a good job straightening hair, as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too thick or too curly.</li>
            <li> When I first got this from Walmart, I was really excited to test it out, at first I was really dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> They are now sending me a new one for free.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer to use my curling iron if I wanna make perfect curls starting fron the roots, but this iron is extremelly practical because your hair doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dead straight\\&quot; at the ends</li>
            <li> so you can take it with you on any trip, it super fast and so efficient.</li>
            <li> It could only curl about 2-3 inches of hair at a time, so my medium-long hair required me going up each section of hair multiple times - time consuming, and it didn&#x27;t give an attractive result.  </li>
            <li> and after the first couple curls the cooling plate gets to hot for it to work right</li>
            <li> This item also really pulls on my hair and it tore a fair amount of hair out, a problem I haven&#x27;t had with any other curlers or straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I loved the soft curls and body it gave my usually flat hair.</li>
            <li> This little device here does a really good job in curling hair</li>
            <li> and I love the convenience of having both options - to straighten or curl with the same product.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2M78AFYXN12J9]]This Is my First review for a product...</li>
            <li> Medium is plenty hot.</li>
            <li> instant heat, It has the tourmaline ceramic technology - most seem to have this, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i could never acheive with a curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li> A regular straightner curl better than this one.</li>
            <li> its warms up fast!</li>
            <li> At first when I purchased this item I wanted to use this as a curler.  </li>
            <li> the curls were okay, not the same as in the video i saw... since the plates do not extend over the length of the handles my hair got ripped out between the plastic and the plates...</li>
            <li> but once you get use to it, it turns out pretty.</li>
            <li> It gives you soft, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> You really wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I found a better video on you tube and learned how to properly do the curling technique and viola!!</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try this one as the outer part doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job on my hair !</li>
            <li> First i wanted this because i though it would curl</li>
            <li> get hot....  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t get that hot).</li>
            <li> The metal piece that is suppose tot curl your hair does not go all the way around and the curl turns out funny.</li>
            <li> When I put in velcro rollers when my hair is wet, I get beautiful big curls.</li>
            <li> Not what the commercial shows for sure.  </li>
            <li> Works magic on her hair; had a problem keeping my daughter from opening and using it prior to Christmas!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I wore out my first one...</li>
            <li> First use it did not curl my hair as it claimed.  </li>
            <li> I ruined my first one by spilling liquid on it - had to get it again.</li>
            <li> I was replacing it because I was always using one similar, better quality that my roommate always let me use.</li>
            <li> it just bends it and makes my hair look funny.  </li>
            <li> At first it did nothing but straighten.</li>
            <li> ,it doesnt get that hot for starters and it takes me a loooooong time to get my hair atraight with this</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It really helped!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to carry a straight iron and a curling iron when I travel!</li>
            <li> I have really think curly hair so of course straightening it takes forever, so I rarely do it.</li>
            <li> Its ok only two heats</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up AT ALL, not even hot to touch</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair shine like when I use Gold&#x27;N Hot product.</li>
            <li> I placed a ceramic hot plate holder at my dresser for it, just in case..  have not burned myself yet...</li>
            <li> I bought it just couple days ago, feeling very excited about making different hair styles the first day.</li>
            <li> I was trying to  get that slight curl, which I got, but then decided really didn&#x27;t look good on me, but that&#x27;s not the straighteners fault.</li>
            <li> I just love this straightener, it light and little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to use a flat iron, so - as I become more accustomed to using it, I will add to my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this curling flat iron combo.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Overall it was good for the low price.</li>
            <li> I have very long, layered hair that is bountiful but very fine and pretty much stick-straight.  </li>
            <li> The straight sides and curved sides allow me to make my hair very straight or with a bit of curve, depending on what style I want that day.  </li>
            <li> it gets it straight and with this one i have to go through it like 5 6 times to get it straight !</li>
            <li> Medium is far too hot for my fine hair, and low is too cool.  </li>
            <li> After a a very long time I fell in love with my hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m terrified of handling curling irons), and this looked easy enough.</li>
            <li> If your hair curls easily, you might get different results than I did, but, if not choose another product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair you probably only need \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat.  </li>
            <li> As it is, we will put this away until she&#x27;s older!</li>
            <li> good flat iron  lasts long    </li>
            <li> The people who did not have any luck with this possibley didnt watch the instuctional dvd (wich is very clear and makes the process even easier) or probably tried to curl lockes of hair that were too thick (does much better with thinner lockes and be sure to twirl hair with finger).</li>
            <li> This styler is my first, and so far, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It is a great straightener, but not a great curler.</li>
            <li> Works really well as a curling iron, and straightens too.  </li>
            <li> Turn it on and before I&#x27;m done putting on deodorant, a bra and shirt, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight but is very puffy and frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> This Conair CS54 iron lets me flatten my puffy hair and gently tuck the ends under</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and after playing with it was ready it, was ready to return it.</li>
            <li> like i said it takes pratice timing the rolling of the tool and how much hair to do at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck curling my hair before.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair goes straight when I meant it to be curly.</li>
            <li> youtube video was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> The plates leave a straight line in your hair when you try to make a curl.</li>
            <li> This one heats up much faster and is a lot easier to use since it&#x27;s lighter with narrower plates.  </li>
            <li> The curl feature is an added bonus; it&#x27;s worked well for curling hair under and creating gentle waves.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to really have to use it.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> She really likes it, but when I borrowed it to try it out, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremly fast also.    </li>
            <li> also the way the handles are set up you really need to hold the iron on both sides of the plates for the iron to get a grasp on your hair and not slip out...</li>
            <li> but if I grab too much hair, it gets snagged and ripped out on the sides.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> What really helped me was watching the QVC video on it</li>
            <li> affordable, the iron heats up very</li>
            <li> The curls fell out, and my hair looked stick straight...</li>
            <li> Besides this there is too much friction between the hair and the plates</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves hers also.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even really straighten that well.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Havnt really used to curling part.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as a curler but a fantastic straightener, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> - this item just pulls too much on the hair and doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> What I do use the curved edge for is to curl the ends of my hair under so that it&#x27;s not stick straight like a broom.</li>
            <li> didnt really like the curls it produced.  </li>
            <li> and I have straight hair to start with I</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> and it seems to be gentle with my hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might be fine as a flat iron, but for curls/waves it doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the plates get hot enough to create a super straight look.  </li>
            <li> But this just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations, the cooling plate gets hot, fast.</li>
            <li> It seems rollers left in overnight are the only way to get curls to stay for me; otherwise it looks great for about five minutes, then falls flat.</li>
            <li> and i mean it&#x27;s a good iron</li>
            <li> I have been using a flat iron for years to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to achieve this with any other straightener i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair, but it does a great job on creating a little curve so that my long bangs have a certain lively swish to them.  </li>
            <li> Better than the conventional cylinder iron curler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made my super thick hair look so silky and sexy with it.</li>
            <li> It was not soft to the touch or smooth looking.   </li>
            <li> Whether I want soft curls or straight hair, I can do it all with this ONE tool!  </li>
            <li> But this product pretty much does the same exact thing the walmart straightneres do for 15 dollars for working sakes..</li>
            <li> Your hair responds a lot better to the curl if it&#x27;s not freshly washed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own one as of yet, but in the past my cousin would let me borrow hers.</li>
            <li> More for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> This handy little tool creates shiney, soft and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> I like it a whole lot better than regular straighteners that leave my hair looking flat and lifeless!</li>
            <li> And less hair at one time the better.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for straightening half length and some curls for ends.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not a super straightener, it&#x27;s better than you might think for $20.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted it for the curling feature</li>
            <li> Recently both my favorite curling iron and my straightening iron broke, so i bought  this instead of two different tools.</li>
            <li> I used this mainly as a straightener, and it works</li>
            <li> Needless to say i absolutely love it, whenever i use it, I look like I just acme from the salon. :)</li>
            <li> I just happened to drop it from a high spot (10 feet....)</li>
            <li> All of my hair tools (straightener, curling iron, hair dryer) are made by Conair and all the cheep tools ($10-$20) work great but all the \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; products that are more expensive ($40-$50) seem to do about half the work including this product and the rotating brush hair dryer.</li>
            <li> /do over if you&#x27;ve curled too much; you can play with it until it looks natural)  </li>
            <li> The straightener part of it is great, but trying to manuever it to curl your hair, was too difficult for me.</li>
            <li> I usually do a ratio of how many bad verses how many good before I decide.     </li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was surprised at how well this item worked.  </li>
            <li> As far as the curling capability, I don&#x27;t really use it to \\&quot;curl\\</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money because now I need to find a curling iron that works better.</li>
            <li> For people that use a flat iron, as I do, everyday and want a \\&quot;flippy\\&quot; look at the end that cannot be done with a regular flat iron this product is WONDERFUL, and that is what I will use mine for now.</li>
            <li> I watched the video a few times and made sure I do as instructed.</li>
            <li> Keep your hair pretty much in the middle.  </li>
            <li> The hot and med. work very well for coarse textures.</li>
            <li> Very good product overall, would definitley recommend to anyone who has trouble curling their hair with conventional curlers and curling irons.</li>
            <li> You can actually get a nice curl with a regular flat iron that has spring-adjusted plates and smooth outer surface, like Chi or other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help tame my wavy hair and to give it more defined curls.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this iron wanting a new and easier way to curl and style my hair.</li>
            <li> Should have found another as I bought the NEW Conair replacement for this</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a flat iron with a lower heat setting that can be used on fine hair,most lower settings are still to hot and damaging for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My old flat iron I would take much longer to get my hair perfectly straight as I have very wavy/curly hair.     </li>
            <li> I will warn you that it takes time to master the correct movement to create a curl, but it is worth it when you consider how long it takes to curl your hair normally.</li>
            <li> It seems like the new one doesnt get as hot even though it says the same temp on the specs.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be dry hair, high heat, and with the right products.  </li>
            <li> straightens pretty good, hard to get the curls down, though...</li>
            <li> Regardless, I saw this product (or one similar) in a TV commercial and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> This product does not get hot enough...</li>
            <li> I have noticed it doesnt always get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, although I&#x27;m sure this has the potential to both straighten and curl hair, it seems quite tricky to get it to curl.</li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s my hottest burning tool, my hair was too hot to touch and feels crispy after only one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ideal, but Infiniti by Conair CS54 is a good introduction to curler/straighteners.</li>
            <li> is long, fine, with strands of different length - I lost a lot of hair via it getting caught on the corner of the heating plate.</li>
            <li> basically if you want tight curls using hot rollers or a tradional curling iron is better, but if you want soft waves and loose curls to add movement and volume to your hair</li>
            <li> As such, I wasn&#x27;t too surprised that this didn&#x27;t curl my hair any better than any of the other tools I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It does take a few practices to get the curl you want, it works and it&#x27;s easy to learn.</li>
            <li> Broken and damaged hair just causes more frizz!</li>
            <li> Also, the curls aren&#x27;t as full as the other one I used.</li>
            <li> I got this iron a few years ago for Christmas and had the same issue many other people did with having trouble getting a curl because of the misleading commercial, I kept it and used it to straighten my hair which works great by itself.</li>
            <li> Had a little trouble curling in the beginning but with smaller sections it worked great</li>
            <li> If you have freazy hair, this curler should style it professionally.</li>
            <li> In addition, the tool has these metal plates that frequently snagged my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this iron because you straighten your hair making a soft curl at the ends so that it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for two weeks now and so far it&#x27;s working out well.</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair (my hair is naturally curly).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that wasn&#x27;t found in quality control but it should definitely be fixed.</li>
            <li> Hair frequently snags in the gap between the end of the heating plate and the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I used this to try and put soft waves in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Im in my 50&#x27;s and this young stuff</li>
            <li> Worth the 20 bucks I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I do really love that it only took less than 15 seconds to heat up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive similar products, and this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I watched the brief dvd and tried again and was amazed at the curls...and that they last in my super fine, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Does well for wave and big soft curls, mainly in the ends.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it to make tight, full head of curls.</li>
            <li> However, it does not get hot enough for the curl to last.</li>
            <li> Twist as soon as possible so that the curl starts as high up as it can.</li>
            <li> Low, medium or high heat acdording to your hair type.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally need a flat iron because I have straight fine hair naturally, but sometimes I want a little extra lift that I can get with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> cause it really takes me long with it to straighten it (about 2 hours)  </li>
            <li> And this product do stuck hair in the gaps between different materials, and I guess it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, I try to make it like a pixzie cut, and it is so precise it makes it a little too pixie.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more and got a quality product.</li>
            <li> The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have really thick hair and would like to be able to curl bigger chunks of hair at a time (it kinda takes awhile!)</li>
            <li> I found that I still had major waves throughout my hair even after using this tool for 40 minutes after a straightening balm and blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I found the same styler in other stores but it was always $45 or higher!</li>
            <li> The grasp the styler has on hair is too loose and doesn&#x27;t straighten or curl very well at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, my hair isn&#x27;t hard to smooth or curl, but this device achieved neither.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple times to get the angle right for my hair length and how tight I want the curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same flat iron for years and needed to get a new one because my old one died.</li>
            <li> I had completely given up on curling my hair until I saw the commercial for the Infiniti.</li>
            <li> Her hair is quite thick and long so maybe that&#x27;s an issue - I&#x27;m regretting not buying a simple curler as that&#x27;s all she wanted...and at 12 yrs old, I think would have been better.</li>
            <li> Works ok to curl or straighten hair if not naturally curly or thick.</li>
            <li> I guess I will stick with my hot rollers to curl my hair until the aliens come down and show somebody how to Jane Jetson their hair into spiral curls...</li>
            <li> It does heat up really fast, and unlike my other conair straightener it doesn&#x27;t have to keep re-heating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to glide the iron through your hair in order to curl it, as the commercial suggests--actually NOT easy at all, hair gets caught in the metal, pulled and it breaks(!!)</li>
            <li> For people who want to curl their hair, it takes just as long to use a curling iron or rollers to achieve the same look so really its just a flat iron to me.</li>
            <li> I only deducted one star because previous reviewers were right in that it DOES occasionally pull out hairs if you&#x27;re not careful - there&#x27;s some gap in between the plates somewhere that occasionally catches strands of hair.</li>
            <li> i am very let down,</li>
            <li> you just pull straight down</li>
            <li> depending on the size chunk of hair and how fast you move the tool down will control the amount of curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference or not, but my hair is down past the middle of my back, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is just touching her</li>
            <li> I would say I have had better luck with the Conair straightener that I had, except it would pull my hair pretty bad which this one does not.  </li>
            <li> She has very thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Was back on Amazon today to look for my previous Conair model that I had, and thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> Very unhappy win results.</li>
            <li> and i mean STICK straight -- not at all natural!</li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, with huge gaps between the body of the device and heating plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, by the time I get to the other side of the head, the first side becomes completely uncurled.</li>
            <li> I saw similar flat irons that cost double or triple what this one cost.  </li>
            <li> It is very complicated and it barely even curled my hair and my hair is very easy to curl but not with this.</li>
            <li> This straightener completely defrizzes my hair without over-heating my hair as other straighteners have.  </li>
            <li> so my layered cut actually moves around and doesn&#x27;t just hang flat.</li>
            <li> When I use my regular flat straightener, I can just place the hair and and go</li>
            <li> I never could properly use a curling iron and another issue I&#x27;ve always had is my curls falling flat after a hour or two.</li>
            <li> I watched you tube, and tried on my daughter (she wanted to try looking &#x27;glamorous&#x27; with wavy hair as has dead straight long hair), but out of three attempts we only got one part of her to curl...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a few months, having \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; from an older model with wider plates.  </li>
            <li> I have longish asian hair (i.e. thick, coarse, everyone thinks it&#x27;s straight enough, etc.)  </li>
            <li> The video that comes with this shows hair being pulled thru the iron and curled up like your hair was placed in hot rollers, I could not achieve this look no matter how hard I tried...</li>
            <li> and if i don&#x27;t do it right the first time, it can fry it a bit, or just make awkward curls, because it is a mix of straightener/curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY hard to curl and the only thing I could manage out of it was a VERY slight wave for sure not even close to a CURL.  </li>
            <li> : for Flat iron: 8 out of 10;&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> The flat iron does the job, but the ends look a bit brittle and don&#x27;t have any movement.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about using your curling iron after the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I watched a video on youtube about curling hair with a chi flat iron...</li>
            <li> i would suggest the Chi flat iron[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]</li>
            <li> My curling iron and flat irons are all wrapped up and stuffed in a dray.</li>
            <li> whatever you do, you CANNOT glide this thing through your long hair like the commercial says.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> They fall FLAT after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up to where it&#x27;ll actually curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> Curls don&#x27;t last long as it&#x27;s indicated in the manual.</li>
            <li> they all look different and just strange.</li>
            <li> I have this flat iron and every time my daughter visited, she had to use it.</li>
            <li> infinity was good for straightening but was really disappointed with the curling part of it...</li>
            <li> Little tip for any new users-wait</li>
            <li> The photo gave me the impression that the curved half of this straightner/curling iron, really wrapped around the entire upper half of the barrel.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat fine, and I had a difficult time using this model.</li>
            <li> With a little practise you can make a soft curl or straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for curling, only for straightening without a straight bottom.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra expense of sending this product back.</li>
            <li> and this just takes too long</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know what I expected after using a Chi for several years.</li>
            <li> but for the material and over all balance and life long i would go for this one.</li>
            <li> I have a long  freezy hair and I never used a straightner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a long time</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, you need this.</li>
            <li> It does straighten my hair but the curls don&#x27;t come out as well as I had hoped and it takes a really long time to iron all of my hair</li>
            <li> so i decided to wait till my cousins broke to see how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and works well on my hair type ( wavy, kinda thick, medium length).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like any other straightener, no better, no worse.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough.</li>
            <li> layers make it a little more difficult</li>
            <li> Still got the same tiny little wave at the bottom</li>
            <li> And, I HATE to use too much hair styling products because they weight my hair even more down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive straightener.</li>
            <li> If your hair doesn&#x27;t curl the first time around slow down until it does.</li>
            <li> If you have it one way for one section and then hold it basically upside down for the next section, you will end up with different results on each section due to the rounded side.</li>
            <li> I was clumsy with it at first but mastered in within less than 30 or 40 minutes.    </li>
            <li> Had I known the whole 2 in 1 thing was a waste, I would&#x27;ve spent less money and just purchased a simple, small straightener and stuck with my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, but it was only a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Starting close to roots I would glide down and straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I would glide down enough</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to tell WHO is actually rating a product, but the first review sounded like a competitor, with a one star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last con air hair straightener lasted less than six months and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> ...so don&#x27;t be fooled by that, the curling wand only goes half way around the iron.</li>
            <li> Fist of all it made my hair very dry even though I used protective spray for it.</li>
            <li> i dont think its any faster than a traditional curling iron when it comes to doing tight curls though.</li>
            <li> My hair gets stuck in the corners of the flat irons and then when i slide it down it breaks it.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t quick with turning it to curl when you get to the ends, it puts a big kink in the end of your hair that looks silly and hard to straighten back out.</li>
            <li> I think I was a little \\&quot;confused\\&quot; as to what this iron actually does...</li>
            <li> and it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> like the the 30 sec.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t curl like I expected.</li>
            <li> The video that comes with the Infiniti was really not that helpful.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with this product tonight and have just spent an hour trying to figure it out.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> hello last year made this purchase, however I have used this product a few times and no longer working, that I can do?</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this product and didn&#x27;t use it the second time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that is thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> but otherwise expected, this meets the expectations and what you require.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to curl super long hair, frustrating at times)</li>
            <li> Curling the ends works especially well when I put my head down and have my hair upside down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other straigteners, and thought I had to pay $80 or more to get one that would work well, and was shocked when a friend had one of these</li>
            <li> I have been using this product several times and is so hard to get any waves and even if I get any it doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li> I have a massive amount of thick, slightly wavy hair, so using a regular curling iron takes me ages.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to curl thick hair, and it only creates waves, not spirals.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair always comes out smoother and shinier than it ever did with my other</li>
            <li> Curling on the other hand looks \\&quot;boxy\\&quot; rather than rounded.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that this straightener made the hair any smoother or sleek than other straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have other straighteners that curl my hair</li>
            <li> but once i tried to curl, the hair fell out of place due to lack of contact and then got caught on the ends of the plates causing pain and breaking...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s complicated to use</li>
            <li> All this may be due to user error on my part though, and not the iron itself.  </li>
            <li> Btw, I saw the other comments about using it.</li>
            <li> So overall I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have just dumped mine off at Goodwill along with other junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful!  </li>
            <li> It leaves crimp lines from the sharp plastic corners.</li>
            <li> - I got a tiny wave at the bottom of my small section of hair.</li>
            <li> The waves it created (when it worked) were sharp and clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much here folks!  </li>
            <li> It does tight curls, loose waves, and straightens hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you only get a little wave here and there, and it is always a surprise what that one looks like and sometimes it looks pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I found it would leave marks on your hair only if you squeeze it too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This device is not designed for thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Get frizzy down to sleek, without frying  Correct cowlicks  </li>
            <li> They put her hair in, rotate, slide down . . .</li>
            <li> Start with the cooling plates toward your head, then twist it up or down until the plates are facing away from your head.</li>
            <li> Pull the Infinity down the length of your hair like you&#x27;re straightening it.</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem is that I have treated hair and it never glided down the hair like they show on the video.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t matter if I have it upside down or not.</li>
            <li> and this was after I even practiced and got the movement down.</li>
            <li> The item arrived with a US plug and the quality of the whole item is quite bad, it doesn&#x27;t seem solid at all.  </li>
            <li> The ends of your hair in the iron are scorched, the half on the mezza-luna gets some heat styling and the rest gets nothing.</li>
            <li> it leave dent in hair, make it look bad, no shine and the cool plate?</li>
            <li> As You can see I was nervous as well as I am not a good communicator in English..</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read said it didn&#x27;t curl with long thick hair, so I bought it, thinking it work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say i was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> I have really little experience using them</li>
            <li> Also when i try to give it a twist so that it curls a little bit</li>
            <li> ] hands down over this one!</li>
            <li> I got the Infiniti the other day!!</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair shiny and straight and can withhold the humidity of the club and muggy air.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I used everyday.</li>
            <li> and I still have trouble.</li>
            <li> I got this item a few days ago</li>
            <li> so it leaves marks in the hair, so is not a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> paddles narrow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Creates bumps/lines when turning for curls, not a smooth curl.&lt;br /&gt;Throwing away as return shipping would be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was dusty and it looked like it had been opened before and left out to accumulate dust.</li>
            <li> I no longer use my round curling iron</li>
            <li> this is not a easy as it looks on the video.</li>
            <li> The curling part is awkward especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I hate thin and very manageable hair, so I was very surprised that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However, after a little practice I can get small curls and waves to give texture to the ends of my hair, which is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> I have to give this product a thumbs down for hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> 2 times,  then slowly bring iron down to end of hair and release.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and has a slight wave to it.</li>
            <li> The tips looked very dry and tough.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to use this when i got it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Been using it three or four times a week for the past month.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It is small and straightens from the root without burning your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this Amazon version comes with a video or not, but</li>
            <li> After use, and letting my hair set for a few minutes, my hair came out softer &amp; shinier than ever!</li>
            <li> Conair has never satisfied me.</li>
            <li> , sometimes not sure how to use....</li>
            <li> i mean it doesn&#x27;t leaves it fried up but also not smooth</li>
            <li> not get this if you have long hair or if it is a bit difficult to style....</li>
            <li> it is too hard to make the curls.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hard to curl/straighten hair.</li>
            <li> so even when I supposedly had the correct technique it was still really hard and inconsistent.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use.</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t have a hard edge instead of a curl if you&#x27;ll turn the straightener slowly as you do it.</li>
            <li> at least a day after you wash your hair to use the product.</li>
            <li> Buying hair products online was never a good thing for me in the past, why would it be now.</li>
            <li> The trick is to go SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> GO SLOW</li>
            <li> You need to go slow when curling (slower than when straightening)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to well on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The heat up is quite slow as well.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is not a high-end appliance, a $200 iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair would look darling in the bathroom, but something strange would happen when I got into the cold hair.</li>
            <li> As a curling iron, it was very difficult to use and left kinks in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a serious straightener.</li>
            <li> I like subtle.</li>
            <li> In addition too much hair spray gives me that horrible stiff</li>
            <li> sometimes sleeping in it in tight uncomfortable buns over night.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> needless to say i wasted my money on this one and should have purchased the chi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good curler, either - because,</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair in very small pieces because I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> im stuck w this JUNK,one use (and not a very impressive use)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product waste of money !!!</li>
            <li> People that have given this item a bad review must really not know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of my hair being ripped out.</li>
            <li> I was so confused what to buy then</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> : its not a great straightener, and its not a great curler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting so frustrating</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Also, at the ends where the hair gets really thin</li>
            <li> It was by far the worst thing I have ever used on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The electric cord swivels so you don&#x27;t end up with a twisted cord.  </li>
            <li> and I found it difficult int hat aspect alone.  </li>
            <li> I found that to be difficult to twirl around with my finger and have the curl stay curly.  </li>
            <li> but when I follow the curling instructions, the closest thing I get to a curl is a weird crimp.</li>
            <li> Well, within a month of having it it started to make weird popping noises, as if it where going to explode, and smelled like it was burning.  </li>
            <li> I sent in an angry review to the makers of this product.  </li>
            <li> herself thinking maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> and i have thin hair!</li>
            <li> It is poorly built and stops working!</li>
            <li> It is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> This does not curl well at the ends and loses hold of the hair :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people have commented that it&#x27;s physically awkward to use; it&#x27;s just a straightener.</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, when I try to get the crimp out by straightening it, it&#x27;s nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too bad</li>
            <li> Bad article.</li>
            <li> when i tried it, no luck, the curl looked SO BAD.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t ask him to buy it for because I had read a lot of bad reviews from this product but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you dare listen to the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> But the price isnt bad for the quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad it couldn&#x27;t survive one fall.</li>
            <li> I get so sick of switching out my straightener for my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this thing just pulled my hair and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Get this iron - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work........ :(</li>
            <li> I was so psyched to try this curling iron out, but once I got the package, and tried it, I was SO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of the product when I received it.</li>
            <li> very disappointing</li>
            <li> In any case, it was very disappointing</li>
            <li> , i couldn&#x27;t even get it working, and stupid me lost the papers/warrenty it came with, so</li>
            <li> but i hate it</li>
            <li> and I ended up with very weird hair that looked like I had ironed it with a clothes iron!</li>
            <li> very disappointed with thhis buy.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Iron i have ever used!</li>
            <li> It leaves this awful crimp in your hair that looks like you have bed head.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Before I had an strong healty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I used everyday. It have to use just someday...</li>
            <li> Heats quickly...until the device or hair begins to smoke.  This device is not designed for thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  While it straightens it almost adequately and does leave the hair shiny, it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Had a little trouble curling in the beginning but with smaller sections it worked great and I love the convenience of having both options - to straighten or curl with the same product.</li>
            <li> Hair locks into slots between the plastic and the plates, then breaks. Not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron a couple of months ago and i have to say i was a little nervous. But i ended up liking it. Im sure its not the best iron out there and the curling part doesn&#x27;t even really work, but if your just looking for a flat iron that heats up really quick and is cheap, go with this one. If your looking for a curling iron, its not the best choice.    Pros:  heats up quick  cheap  good flat iron  lasts long    Cons:  doesn&#x27;t curl hair well  only has three heat settings  even on low, burns hands</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for any type of hair! It works for my needs. When I need to straighten my hair, I straighten it, if I need to curl it, I curl it. This item works perfectly. The curls are perfect and it warms up within 10 seconds. I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this curler/straightener for 6 months now and it works great on my fine Asian hair.  Reviews that said it didn&#x27;t work probably didn&#x27;t use the right products.  I could never style my hair until I watched how the pros did it at my wedding last year.  It needs to be dry hair, high heat, and with the right products.  It takes a couple times to get the angle right for my hair length and how tight I want the curls.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this on Amazon. It is a great straightener, but not a great curler. It takes a long time to curl thick hair, and it only creates waves, not spirals.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter last Christmas.  It is yet to come out of the package.  Win some.  Lose some.</li>

            <li> This is a good product.  It works well, but can be kindof tricky to use properly.  If you don&#x27;t know how to style hair, I recommend watching the cd that comes with the product, before attempting to use it.  Works really well as a curling iron, and straightens too.  Very useful!</li>
            <li> This is a serious straightener. Heats up quick. Turn it on and before I&#x27;m done putting on deodorant, a bra and shirt, it&#x27;s ready. Has 3 settings but I never use the \\&quot;high\\&quot;. Medium is plenty hot. If you have fine hair you probably only need \\&quot;low\\&quot; heat.  I have longish asian hair (i.e. thick, coarse, everyone thinks it&#x27;s straight enough, etc.)  This tool will:  Tame fly aways  Get frizzy down to sleek, without frying  Correct cowlicks  Do bangs (also easy correct/do over if you&#x27;ve curled too much; you can play with it until it looks natural)  tucks ends nicely  Does well for wave and big soft curls, mainly in the ends. Haven&#x27;t used it to make tight, full head of curls. I think if you want lots of curls close to the scalp, this may not be the right product for you.  Can handle large amounts of hair at a time for quick finish time.  The electric cord swivels so you don&#x27;t end up with a twisted cord.  If you can have one hair tool, this is it.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this genius tool.  Whether I want soft curls or straight hair, I can do it all with this ONE tool!  Unlike a traditional hair curler, you can adjust the size of your curls with the angle in which you pull the curler away from your head.  I have had mine for about 18 months and I just bought a second one to keep at work!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because i had been going to extremes to get my hair to curl.  sometimes sleeping in it in tight uncomfortable buns over night. But this just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations, the cooling plate gets hot, fast. and after the first couple curls the cooling plate gets to hot for it to work right and it just comes out crimpy. maybe i just got a defective one but either way i am very let down,</li>
            <li> My hair is straight but is very puffy and frizzy looking. I have been using a flat iron for years to smooth it out. The flat iron does the job, but the ends look a bit brittle and don&#x27;t have any movement. This Conair CS54 iron lets me flatten my puffy hair and gently tuck the ends under so my layered cut actually moves around and doesn&#x27;t just hang flat. Overall it totally serves my purpose.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and after playing with it was ready it, was ready to return it. I mainly wanted it for the curling feature and I couldn&#x27;t get it to curl at all. I watched the brief dvd and tried again and was amazed at the curls...and that they last in my super fine, thin, straight hair. The commercial I saw on tv and on the internet make it look lie you just pull straight down and you get fabulous curls, that doesn&#x27;t work. You have to twist the iron around as you pull down the hair, and it will work perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to use a flat iron, so - as I become more accustomed to using it, I will add to my comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to tell WHO is actually rating a product, but the first review sounded like a competitor, with a one star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the the 30 sec. instant heat, It has the tourmaline ceramic technology - most seem to have this, too.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it it was easy to handle, and seemed to do just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are in a place (and embedded) where you can&#x27;t accidently change your settings.  It does automatically turn off in 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron can also be used to create curls.  The directions are illustrated, and easily understood.</li>
            <li> I was very excited by the claims Conair made for this ceramic curler/straightener. It does have some great features: it is very lightweight, and it does a good job straightening hair, as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too thick or too curly. However, I could not make it curl my hair in any way that looked good or remotely like the ads. For the record, I have a great deal of very fine, curly hair, down to the middle of my back, so its a challenge to style it in the best of circumstances. I gave up trying to use it for curling and now only use it to flatten and straighten my hair. The quest continues for the perfect curling iron!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item, hoping to have an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; styling tool. I have short hair and the curling feature doesn&#x27;t curl like I expected. The straightener works great on my bangs but still must use a seperate tool to curl the rest of my hair. ...otherwise have found no flaws with it.</li>
            <li> i was really excited to get this product. Recently both my favorite curling iron and my straightening iron broke, so i bought  this instead of two different tools. this is not a easy as it looks on the video. mostly because its kind of akward to use at first, it takes some practice, but it definatly creates the waves and looks curls i could never acheive with a curling iron or hot rollers. i dont think its any faster than a traditional curling iron when it comes to doing tight curls though. like i said it takes pratice timing the rolling of the tool and how much hair to do at a time. I have very fine hair so i havent used it to straighten yet. I do really love that it only took less than 15 seconds to heat up! basically if you want tight curls using hot rollers or a tradional curling iron is better, but if you want soft waves and loose curls to add movement and volume to your hair this porduct is great</li>
            <li> Great iron curler. Better than the conventional cylinder iron curler. If you have freazy hair, this curler should style it professionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck curling my hair before. This handy little tool creates shiney, soft and bouncy curls. The people who did not have any luck with this possibley didnt watch the instuctional dvd (wich is very clear and makes the process even easier) or probably tried to curl lockes of hair that were too thick (does much better with thinner lockes and be sure to twirl hair with finger). The more I curl my hair the easier and faster the process has gotten. Havent tried to straighten with it, but I dont see why it wouldnt work. Very good product overall, would definitley recommend to anyone who has trouble curling their hair with conventional curlers and curling irons.</li>
            <li> To be honest with you, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high because I know that high-performance hair styling tools cost a lot more money. Regardless, I saw this product (or one similar) in a TV commercial and was excited to try it out. It takes a while to get used to using it and would be a lot easier if I had an extra pair of hands, but my hair comes out well after all is said and done. I recommend using it on unwashed hair with lots of hairspray. Sometimes my hair catches in the plates, but again, you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s not ideal, but Infiniti by Conair CS54 is a good introduction to curler/straighteners. I like it a whole lot better than regular straighteners that leave my hair looking flat and lifeless!</li>
            <li> This product definitely takes some time to get used to. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and I still have trouble. Sometimes my hair goes straight when I meant it to be curly. Straightening hair is never a problem. The video that comes with the Infiniti was really not that helpful. They basically say what&#x27;s on the box &#x27;rotate cooling plates 180 degrees&#x27; while showing this model getting her hair done. They put her hair in, rotate, slide down . . . and out come amazing curls . . . except I can&#x27;t get it to work like that.    However, after a little practice I can get small curls and waves to give texture to the ends of my hair, which is what I wanted it for. So this is a nice product for me. It all depends on what the desired outcome is. And who knows, maybe after more practice I will be able to get the model&#x27;s curls!</li>
            <li> I have a massive amount of thick, slightly wavy hair, so using a regular curling iron takes me ages. I had completely given up on curling my hair until I saw the commercial for the Infiniti. I absolutely love it! It is great if you have layers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair falling out of it if you grab a chunk that has parts of both layers. I will warn you that it takes time to master the correct movement to create a curl, but it is worth it when you consider how long it takes to curl your hair normally. The trick is to go SLOWLY. If your hair doesn&#x27;t curl the first time around slow down until it does. The slower you go, the tighter the curl. Start with the cooling plates toward your head, then twist it up or down until the plates are facing away from your head. Twist as soon as possible so that the curl starts as high up as it can. Hold the end shut so that the plates smooth your hair. Pull the Infinity down the length of your hair like you&#x27;re straightening it. GO SLOW and *poof!* There&#x27;s a pretty curl &#x3D;] The straightener part is amazing as well. My hair always comes out smoother and shinier than it ever did with my other straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This youtube video was very helpful to me. Maybe it can help you too &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I bought this and regret it. It may work out well for shorter hair, but not below shoulder length hair. The plates leave a straight line in your hair when you try to make a curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a few months, having \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; from an older model with wider plates.  This one heats up much faster and is a lot easier to use since it&#x27;s lighter with narrower plates.  I get my hair done faster and love the results.  The curl feature is an added bonus; it&#x27;s worked well for curling hair under and creating gentle waves.  I saw similar flat irons that cost double or triple what this one cost.  Get this iron - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My original combo curling/flat iron broke so I purchased this item.  I don&#x27;t normally need a flat iron because I have straight fine hair naturally, but sometimes I want a little extra lift that I can get with the flat iron. As far as curling, it does a nice curl but I could never get the ends of the curl to look nice with this product.  It was a waste of my money because now I need to find a curling iron that works better.</li>
            <li> Dude, this thing is freakin awesome! I can&#x27;t wait to really have to use it. I ran it through my bang and it curled it tighter than my curling iron does. I am fairly impressed. I put it on medium because it said that level is good for permed hair, but it smokes...sooooo....prob gonna put it on a lower setting but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This gets very hot and does a super job at straightening. Curling on the other hand looks \\&quot;boxy\\&quot; rather than rounded.</li>
            <li> Good product, lots of options.  Low, medium or high heat acdording to your hair type.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this item a few days ago and I really wanted to like it but the bottom line is that I just don&#x27;t.  I think part of the problem is that I have treated hair and it never glided down the hair like they show on the video.  It kept snagging and getting caught and I found it difficult int hat aspect alone.  Next was getting the hair to curl...I found that to be difficult to twirl around with my finger and have the curl stay curly.  I was able to work the iron better around my face than around my head tho.  On the plus side, the curls that I was able to maintain were very natural looking beachy waves and I LOVE that look,  It&#x27;s just too bad it&#x27;s easier said than done!  I returned it and think I&#x27;m going to stick to a curling iron.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and this just takes too long and it still doesn&#x27;t keep a good curl.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece she likes it. So if she likes it, I love it. A friend of her&amp;#34;s had one and paid a lot more money than I did for Mikalas .</li>
            <li> it is too hard to make the curls. A regular straightner curl better than this one. Also the curls don&#x27;t last. Bad article.</li>
            <li> I am not fascinated by this curler and straightener but I don&#x27;t know what I expected after using a Chi for several years. I will say that I think it is better for curling than than straightening.  I found that I still had major waves throughout my hair even after using this tool for 40 minutes after a straightening balm and blow drying.  I don&#x27;t think the plates get hot enough to create a super straight look.  In addition, the tool has these metal plates that frequently snagged my hair.  I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy my hair being torn out of my head and after using it five or six times became fed up and ordered a solia.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made straightener. My hair is thick and has a slight wave to it. I got this produce because I used a curler and thought that it would eliminate the frizz if I was able to use a straightener. Unfortunately this thing just pulled my hair and I was very disappointed. I am returning it today!</li>
            <li> I think I was a little \\&quot;confused\\&quot; as to what this iron actually does...The video that comes with this shows hair being pulled thru the iron and curled up like your hair was placed in hot rollers, I could not achieve this look no matter how hard I tried...For people that use a flat iron, as I do, everyday and want a \\&quot;flippy\\&quot; look at the end that cannot be done with a regular flat iron this product is WONDERFUL, and that is what I will use mine for now. For people who want to curl their hair, it takes just as long to use a curling iron or rollers to achieve the same look so really its just a flat iron to me. I guess I will stick with my hot rollers to curl my hair until the aliens come down and show somebody how to Jane Jetson their hair into spiral curls...</li>
            <li> this is a very nice straightener, and does exactly what it sais it does! from curling to swooping to straightening. its warms up fast! But this product pretty much does the same exact thing the walmart straightneres do for 15 dollars for working sakes.. but for the material and over all balance and life long i would go for this one.</li>
            <li> After my Conair curling iron/straightener that I had broke, I seen the this model in the store and thought it was the perfect replacement. My hair is somewhat fine, and I had a difficult time using this model. I tried using it for about a week, and just gave up and returned it to the store. The straightener part of it is great, but trying to manuever it to curl your hair, was too difficult for me. If you aren&#x27;t quick with turning it to curl when you get to the ends, it puts a big kink in the end of your hair that looks silly and hard to straighten back out. It may be perfect for certain types of hair, but unfortunately, not mine. Was back on Amazon today to look for my previous Conair model that I had, and thanks to Amazon I found it!! :-D</li>
            <li> I like this iron because you straighten your hair making a soft curl at the ends so that it looks natural. I still prefer to use my curling iron if I wanna make perfect curls starting fron the roots, but this iron is extremelly practical because your hair doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dead straight\\&quot; at the ends and you don&#x27;t have to worry about using your curling iron after the flat iron. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it rips some hair when the hair is caught at its edge. Still I like it because it&#x27;s the only one around.</li>
            <li> This little device here does a really good job in curling hair (I do not know about straitening because I have strait hair myself). However, it does not get hot enough for the curl to last. Usually, by the time I get to the other side of the head, the first side becomes completely uncurled. It is very frustrating. And, I HATE to use too much hair styling products because they weight my hair even more down. In addition too much hair spray gives me that horrible stiff look.&lt;br /&gt;Do not get this if you have long hair or if it is a bit difficult to style....</li>
            <li> smoothens hair and gives it beautiful body if i use it to create soft waves. i am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> first of all, i got it this past christmas (from a store), i picked it out hoping it would be my soulution for curling my hair, i cant seem to get the hang of a curling iron. but i heard some good reviews on this, so i took a chance thinking if it didn&#x27;t work as a curling iron, i could still use it as a strietener. when i tried it, no luck, the curl looked SO BAD. i figured i just need practice. So just recently i pulled it out to try it again, not only could i not get a curl this time, i couldn&#x27;t even get it working, and stupid me lost the papers/warrenty it came with, so im stuck w this JUNK,one use (and not a very impressive use) and thats it. i should have trusted my gut feeling, ive NEVER had good luck with con air, ALL their products SUCK! i will NEVER use this brand again, i do have a blow dryer from them, and that works fine, but its nothing unique, it was cheap, that y i got it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is 14 and she asked for it by name. She really likes it, but when I borrowed it to try it out, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems a bit bulky and my hair got caught repeatedly in the crack where the plates meet the plastic housing. I got so tired of my hair being ripped out. I don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference or not, but my hair is down past the middle of my back, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is just touching her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find that this straightener made the hair any smoother or sleek than other straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this, you also have to keep watch as to how you&#x27;re holding it as you go over each section. If you have it one way for one section and then hold it basically upside down for the next section, you will end up with different results on each section due to the rounded side. When I use my regular flat straightener, I can just place the hair and and go and it doesn&#x27;t matter if I have it upside down or not. Sometimes you just grab the pieces of hair and get them however you can, but with this straightener you can&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> At first when I purchased this item I wanted to use this as a curler.  I&#x27;m an avid Conair customer and many of there products help my type of hair, however it is not the ideal straightener for that.  I have other straighteners that curl my hair really nice...this one does not.  I will say though that for straightening your hair, it is great.  It keeps your hair shiny and straight and can withhold the humidity of the club and muggy air.  Always recommended to use a heat tamer spray before using any hair styling tool.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Works equally well as straightener and curler that too just over 20 bucks,Fast shipping. What else you can ask for.</li>
            <li> Infiniti by Conair has some great pros:    1. Very light  2. Compact  3. Easy to carry around  4. Heats up quick    Only con i felt was that I couldn&#x27;t use it for curling....its not as intuitive.</li>
            <li> I have a long  freezy hair and I never used a straightner.I was so confused what to buy then one of my friend suggested me to try this \\&quot;Conair CS54\\&quot; model.I started reading the product reviews its pros and cons.Finally when I saw the QVC.com videos I was half way impressed.I got a great deal at Amazon for just $22 bucks before christmas.Its so light weight and easy to use for a beginner like me.The instructions for very simple ,it heats up pretty quickly and the result was really amazing I could n&#x27;t believe its  my hair.I am totally satisfied.  After a a very long time I fell in love with my hair.Really its worth every penny !!!</li>
            <li> This product makes curls easy! It&#x27;s sooo easy to use and works perfectly for straight hair. Little tip for any new users-wait at least a day after you wash your hair to use the product. Your hair responds a lot better to the curl if it&#x27;s not freshly washed.</li>
            <li> I just recieved the Infiniti by Conair (Curler &amp; Straightener.) I LOVE,LOVE LOVE it.    It may possibly be the best $30 I have ever spent on my hair.      I was so anxious to use this when i got it in the mail.  I watchED the quick dvd supplied and within minutes i had it plugged and heated up.    The result was shiny, smooth and sleek hair.  I have never been able to achieve this with any other straightener i&#x27;ve tried.  I even tried a couple curls.  They turned out beautifully.    Thank you Amazon for carrying this item and making it affordable.  Shipping was extremly fast also.    Try this, i think you will be just as happy as me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this curling iron/straightener for about a month. It heats up really fast and works well on my hair type ( wavy, kinda thick, medium length). It can get out the stubborn waves near the top on the hair and leave a nice curl near the bottom. Price was great as I saw the same product at Target for more money.</li>
            <li> I watched a video on youtube about curling hair with a chi flat iron... totally convinced i needed one i went to the store and saw this conair one thinking it&#x27;d be perfect! i got home and it wasn&#x27;t the same, not at all... the curls were okay, not the same as in the video i saw... since the plates do not extend over the length of the handles my hair got ripped out between the plastic and the plates... also the way the handles are set up you really need to hold the iron on both sides of the plates for the iron to get a grasp on your hair and not slip out... the way the chi handles are set up you can do this one handed easily... needless to say i wasted my money on this one and should have purchased the chi like i had originally planned on doing... first time out of the box with the chi and straightened my bangs perfectly and curled a section as a test soooo easily and perfectly with all my hair still intact! Amazon has the chi for a good price... this Conair one was good for straightening i will give it that, but once i tried to curl, the hair fell out of place due to lack of contact and then got caught on the ends of the plates causing pain and breaking... I have thin hair so maybe that was an issue but all in all i would suggest the Chi flat iron[[ASIN:B0009V1YR8 Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron]] hands down over this one!</li>
            <li> Works ok to curl or straighten hair if not naturally curly or thick. More for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! Affordable and good quality.I would recommend this product to other people. At first it&#x27;s complicated to use but once you watch the dvd you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I watched the video a few times and made sure I do as instructed. The curling part is awkward especially if you have long hair. I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you want both.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  I bought it specifically to easily curl my hair, and it does just that! It&#x27;s super easy to use and I really like it a lot.  The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have really thick hair and would like to be able to curl bigger chunks of hair at a time (it kinda takes awhile!) but if I grab too much hair, it gets snagged and ripped out on the sides. And really, that seems likes something that would be so easy for them to fix.  Oh well! other than that, it really was a great iron! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched the DVD that came with this, I read the instructions, I&#x27;ve even been to the website but I can NOT curl my hair with this thing. It&#x27;s pretty good for straightening my hair (hence the 2 stars versus 1) but when I follow the curling instructions, the closest thing I get to a curl is a weird crimp. To add insult to injury, when I try to get the crimp out by straightening it, it&#x27;s nearly impossible. Had I known the whole 2 in 1 thing was a waste, I would&#x27;ve spent less money and just purchased a simple, small straightener and stuck with my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product. My last con air hair straightener lasted less than six months and then stopped working. I replaced it with this product tonight and have just spent an hour trying to figure it out. I watched the DVD three times and tried different methods. It leaves lines across the hair strand, does not curl your hair properly, and it RIPS OUT YOUR HAIR. That is not what woman want! Broken and damaged hair just causes more frizz! No thanks. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I had this for a more than a year &amp; it&#x27;s just starting to be a butthead. haha it&#x27;s still great, but just not as smooth. I&#x27;ve made my super thick hair look so silky and sexy with it. LOL The curl part only worked on my (booty length) Egyptian/Hispanic hair after I had already straightened it. (it&#x27;s hard to curl super long hair, frustrating at times) But for the price, and how much I love it.. I would say GET IT! YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT :)</li>
            <li> I used this mainly as a straightener, and it works okay.  I would say I have had better luck with the Conair straightener that I had, except it would pull my hair pretty bad which this one does not.  I have tried out the curling function a couple times and it works okay, but didn&#x27;t give me exactly the results I was looking for.  All this may be due to user error on my part though, and not the iron itself.  It does heat up really fast, and unlike my other conair straightener it doesn&#x27;t have to keep re-heating.</li>
            <li> everyone seems pretty happy with their straightener, but ive had it for about a year now and it isnt my favorite...  if you want to curl the ends of your hair in, then yeah it works great. but i was looking for pinstraight hair, and this straightener doesnt do that.): its not a great straightener, and its not a great curler. its a cool concept, but if youre looking for pinstraight hair, or perfect curls, id buy your tools seperately.</li>
            <li> This styler is great! I read reviews of a lot of the styling tools on the market. I was looking for something to smooth and curl my hair. Originally I thought I&#x27;d need two tools, but this one does both. It&#x27;s super easy to add fullness to my hair, straighten, do curls, etc.</li>
            <li> I just love this straightener, it light and little so you can take it with you on any trip, it super fast and so efficient. I deffinetly recommend it to everyone, the curlers on the sides help me style my hair in so many different ways, I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> I absolute love my new conair 2-in-1! I got this as a christmas gift from my boyfriend. I almost didn&#x27;t ask him to buy it for because I had read a lot of bad reviews from this product but good thing I didn&#x27;t believe them. I usually do a ratio of how many bad verses how many good before I decide.     The flat iron works beautifully. My old flat iron I would take much longer to get my hair perfectly straight as I have very wavy/curly hair.     I like to straighten my hair and curl the ends of my hair and curl the front parts towards my face. People that have given this item a bad review must really not know what they are doing. Getting a great curl is so easy. These curls last WAY WAY WAY WAY longer than my conair 1-inch curler (which used to fall about 3 hours afterwards). I&#x27;ve slept on my curls and they still look gorgeous! I simply comb and put them back into shape with my fingers. I don&#x27;t even use a lot of hairspray. I definitely recommend this product you will love it!    You need to go slow when curling (slower than when straightening) also once you get to the tips it&#x27;s good to do another rotation. What really helped me was watching the QVC video on it (it&#x27;s on youtube).</li>
            <li> sometimes it curls my hair great, other times, it&#x27;s only okay and if i don&#x27;t do it right the first time, it can fry it a bit, or just make awkward curls, because it is a mix of straightener/curling iron. Mostly it&#x27;s neat though... good to have I suppose. But it&#x27;s nice to detailed straightening, and it doesn&#x27;t make me frizz. Only thing is, I try to make it like a pixzie cut, and it is so precise it makes it a little too pixie. I like subtle.</li>
            <li> This product does not get hot enough...very disappointing and I paid $15 extra when I purchased this from a drug store. Conair conned me...</li>
            <li> This is my most trusted hair styler. I use it everyday although it may not be the greatest on my hair. I walk out of my house like a million bucks in the morning with my pincurls. My curling iron and flat irons are all wrapped up and stuffed in a dray. This styler does both and does it well. I have been using it for a while now. Worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. If you dont have one, get one! With a flick of the wrist...fab curls.</li>
            <li> I bought it just couple days ago, feeling very excited about making different hair styles the first day. But then I am worrying about how often can I use it. Once a day, or once a week? Anyone knows?    Btw, I saw the other comments about using it. I found it would leave marks on your hair only if you squeeze it too hard. And this product do stuck hair in the gaps between different materials, and I guess it&#x27;s normal. But you will be fine if you are holding that bunch of hair until it slides almost to the end. And less hair at one time the better.</li>
            <li> I like it! It takes some getting use too because not all hair styles are the same. layers make it a little more difficult but once you get use to it, it turns out pretty.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product several times and is so hard to get any waves and even if I get any it doesn&#x27;t stay for long. Fist of all it made my hair very dry even though I used protective spray for it. So overall I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have just dumped mine off at Goodwill along with other junk.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a good-enough streightner, because plates are not positioned close enough together. It&#x27;s not a good curler, either - because, whatever you do, you CANNOT glide this thing through your long hair like the commercial says.&lt;br /&gt;Mine is long, fine, with strands of different length - I lost a lot of hair via it getting caught on the corner of the heating plate. It is poorly designed, with huge gaps between the body of the device and heating plates.&lt;br /&gt;Normally, my hair isn&#x27;t hard to smooth or curl, but this device achieved neither.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. You can actually get a nice curl with a regular flat iron that has spring-adjusted plates and smooth outer surface, like Chi or other brands.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re really happy with this purchasem&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable, the iron heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Works great to straighten and to flip the ends</li>
            <li> I love this Hair Straightener! Don&#x27;t you dare listen to the bad reviews. I was scared by them. But I bought it, and I immediately tried it and its perfect. Just as good as the expensive ones. It gives you soft, smooth hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like its damaging your hair at all. Try it! You really wont regret it! Its so unbelievably amazing. It makes your hair look amazing. I have really little experience using them and it was so easy. Trust me, it works great.</li>
            <li> i got this for my gf for chritmas after we saw it in a commercial. nice product and also good price.</li>
            <li> I used this straightener at my mom&#x27;s and loved it.  Gets very hot quickly.  Works well on my hard to curl/straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help tame my wavy hair and to give it more defined curls. For the first month or so of using this, it was great - got really cute curls (though I did have to use a hotter temperature than what they recommend in the instructions). Once winter hit, though, things went awry. My hair would look darling in the bathroom, but something strange would happen when I got into the cold hair. The curls fell out, and my hair looked stick straight... and i mean STICK straight -- not at all natural! It was not flattering at all! I tried various styling products and what not to try to compensate, but no matter what, the curls fell out and I ended up with very weird hair that looked like I had ironed it with a clothes iron! I still don&#x27;t know if this was all a consequence of temperature and moisture fluctuations or more a result of the iron.  In any case, it was very disappointing and I keep wondering if I should have bought a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s got many cool features and most of all, it was sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This item does not work like they show on TV. It is very complicated and it barely even curled my hair and my hair is very easy to curl but not with this. I can curl my hair better with my straightner than this thing. I sent mine back.</li>
            <li> Did an okay job, nothing special but it burnt me many many times. I threw it away after use 3.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $39.99 + tax.   My hair gets stuck in the corners of the flat irons and then when i slide it down it breaks it. Besides this there is too much friction between the hair and the plates so it leaves marks in the hair, so is not a smooth finish. Also when i try to give it a twist so that it curls a little bit it marks the hair even more.   My hair was very far from nice when i was done with this. The tips looked very dry and tough. It was not soft to the touch or smooth looking.   This is the worst Iron i have ever used!</li>
            <li> This straightener works quite well for my chin length hair.  It won&#x27;t \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair, but it does a great job on creating a little curve so that my long bangs have a certain lively swish to them.  It gets hot very quickly and retains heat well.  Can&#x27;t really compare it to a straighter that costs 10x as much, but for $25, I honestly can&#x27;t complain.  Been using it three or four times a week for the past month.</li>
            <li> The grasp the styler has on hair is too loose and doesn&#x27;t straighten or curl very well at all. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I have ever made!! I purchased one for my niece and she absolutely loves hers also.</li>
            <li> I got this iron a few years ago for Christmas and had the same issue many other people did with having trouble getting a curl because of the misleading commercial, I kept it and used it to straighten my hair which works great by itself. I found a better video on you tube and learned how to properly do the curling technique and viola!! Perfect curls! I never could properly use a curling iron and another issue I&#x27;ve always had is my curls falling flat after a hour or two. With this toolbThey last all day, sometimes 2 depending what condition my hair is in \ what the weather was like. I LOVE this iron!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair.  This just doesn&#x27;t cut it!  I was so excited when I tried it on my bangs and it actually created great curls like the ads.  But then when I tried it on the rest of my hair, no go.  Doesn&#x27;t even really straighten that well.  I think I am going to return it.  Might be better if it was thicker (1 1/2 inches +).</li>
            <li> I purchased this curler/straightener from Target and I was so excited about it. It straightens my hair perfectly, but as far as the curling feature...HORRIBLE! I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;trying\\&quot; every day for about a month now and I have not been able to keep ONE curl in my hair. They fall FLAT after about 30 minutes. That&#x27;s with using product and ample amounts of hair spray. It&#x27;s getting so frustrating I&#x27;ve considered taking it back and getting just a straightener. I paid $40 for this product (for a 2-1) where only ONE feature works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned another curling iron from Infiniti by Conair and really liked it. I kept burning my neck with the curling iron so I wanted to try this one as the outer part doesn&#x27;t get hot.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for two weeks now and so far it&#x27;s working out well. It heats up quickly and maintains the temperature.  I picked this one for it&#x27;s curling feature as well as straightning. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I needed a hair straightner that wasn&#x27;t over 100 bucks, and this thing was worth the money that was under 30 bucks. It&#x27;s handy when I need to straighten my hair for an event :3</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping that I would have an all-in-one tool for my hair. I get so sick of switching out my straightener for my curling iron. Anyway, it works about half way (kind of curls, kind of straightens). I think it&#x27;s due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get very warm even on the high setting. Also when I got it I spent $45 on it and my old straightener and curling iron together costs about that. All of my hair tools (straightener, curling iron, hair dryer) are made by Conair and all the cheep tools ($10-$20) work great but all the \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; products that are more expensive ($40-$50) seem to do about half the work including this product and the rotating brush hair dryer. I have very fine hair that is generally easy to curl or straighten but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to hold either. Bottom line I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This styler is my first, and so far, I like it very much. It is very easy to use and your hair will have a silky and healthy finish. your hands and hair will be safe and with some practice you can have curls too. I mostly use it for straightening half length and some curls for ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for two years and it still works great. I recommend it to everyone but especially girls who have short hair. It is small and straightens from the root without burning your scalp.</li>
            <li> ...so don&#x27;t be fooled by that, the curling wand only goes half way around the iron. It&#x27;s not good for curling, only for straightening without a straight bottom.</li>
            <li> love it! works like a charm! It really does the job on my hair ! My hair could not be happier .</li>
            <li> First i wanted this because i though it would curl but it doesn&#x27;t...  it leave dent in hair, make it look bad, no shine and the cool plate? get hot....  but hey buy it if you want  but don&#x27;t say i didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to straighten hair (it doesn&#x27;t get that hot). The metal piece that is suppose tot curl your hair does not go all the way around and the curl turns out funny. It&#x27;s not worth the money. Do Not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up to where it&#x27;ll actually curl your hair.  Curls don&#x27;t last long as it&#x27;s indicated in the manual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener, but that wasn&#x27;t what I had purchased it for. I wanted to see if I could get some curls, but I should have gone with my gut and just bought a curling iron, because this didn&#x27;t curl my hair. I&#x27;m Asian and my hair already has a bend to it. When I put in velcro rollers when my hair is wet, I get beautiful big curls. This didn&#x27;t do anything but smooth out my hair. I already have a straightener that does that. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> It works well as a straightener, but not too good as a curler. I like it for curling my ends though.</li>
            <li> This straightner is really great for the price, it heats up super fast and cools down just as easily. The curls it makes are very pretty, girl next door kind of look once you brush through them. I would recommend it. Only 4 stars because I wish the barrel was a wider.</li>
            <li> It curls and flattens the hair perfectly and the price is nice, but your hair tends to get stuck between the small gaps on each side of the iron plates, and pull out hair. Not cool!</li>
            <li> This does a great job straightening my hair, better than anything else I have tried. I love the curls it makes (had to watch the instructional video on how to do it!).</li>
            <li> The straightener works. The curler is inferior. Of course, you can get something like a curl or wave, just not the kind you want and where you want it. If you have long hair you only get a little wave here and there, and it is always a surprise what that one looks like and sometimes it looks pretty bad. In summary, the curling function doesn&#x27;t give you any control over the look/curl you want to accomplish. Not worth the extra expense of sending this product back. We&#x27;re keeping it for the straightener and will buy a curler at a local store, where it is easier to return a product. Live and learn! This product should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a long time and I use it often. I feel it is a great value.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product, but it was only a disappointment.  It leaves this awful crimp in your hair that looks like you have bed head.  Not what the commercial shows for sure.  You are better off using a 3/4 inch curling iron and hair spray!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter this Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  Works magic on her hair; had a problem keeping my daughter from opening and using it prior to Christmas!  May have to get one for her too.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this iron wanting a new and easier way to curl and style my hair. I have no need to straighten my hair. I was very impressed how quickly it did heat up. Easy to control buttons too but did not like how the plates don&#x27;t go all the way around the top and bottom of the iron. I think if the plates did go all the way around, there wouldn&#x27;t be any crimps in everyone&#x27;s hair including my own. I also had a problem with my hair frizzing more while using too. Somewhat dissapointed but I think if someone uses it as just a straightener, they would probably be happy with the results. I will definetely be sticking with my curling iron and curlers and wait till something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, 2 in 1. It does take a few practices to get the curl you want, it works and it&#x27;s easy to learn. Good that it gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> When I first got this from Walmart, I was really excited to test it out, at first I was really dissapointed.  It straightens great, and leaves the hair shiny, smooth, and frizz-free, but despite my efforts, I could NOT curl my hair, I followed the directions and everything!!!  But now, two months later, after finding the video on how to curl your hair with this straightener tucked away in one of my desk drawers, and watching it, I am suddenly amazed by the results I am getting!!  I&#x27;m not sure if this Amazon version comes with a video or not, but if it does...I would definitely suggest watching it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I wore out my first one...several YEARS of daily use by 2 people! I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive similar products, and this is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Super easy to work. Havnt really used to curling part. I have noticed it doesnt always get hot enough. But the price isnt bad for the quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li> hello last year made this purchase, however I have used this product a few times and no longer working, that I can do?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as a curler but a fantastic straightener, especially for the price! Excellent value! Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive straightener. After use, and letting my hair set for a few minutes, my hair came out softer &amp; shinier than ever! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> First use it did not curl my hair as it claimed.  Second use when plugged in it wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite tool! depending on the size chunk of hair and how fast you move the tool down will control the amount of curl. I can get cute curled ends or full curly hair with this tool so fast. I am done with curling irons/curlers etc!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  I was so excited to get this because I had never been able to properly curl/wave my hair (I&#x27;m terrified of handling curling irons), and this looked easy enough. As soon as I got it, I opened it up and tried it out . . . and it was a huge disappointment. It didn&#x27;t work, even on the highest heat setting. I hate thin and very manageable hair, so I was very surprised that this didn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t curl or wave my hair at all even and I knew I was following the directions correctly because I read the instructions and watched the included instructional DVD numerous times. It didn&#x27;t even straighten my hair. Instead my hair just ended up getting caught in plates.  &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I have very long, layered hair that is bountiful but very fine and pretty much stick-straight.  I just used this appliance for the very first time and I am thrilled!  Yes, it straightens; yes it curls.  (It does not add shine.  But it enhances the shine of either very healthy hair or hair that&#x27;s been doused with a shine spray.)    I was clumsy with it at first but mastered in within less than 30 or 40 minutes.    Be careful!  It WILL pull out your hair if you let your hair get too close to either end of the iron.  Keep your hair pretty much in the middle.  And you&#x27;ll get sleek hair with pretty curls!    I confess that I felt a case of buyer&#x27;s remorse after I bought this.  Not any more.  I love it.  I mean, this is not a high-end appliance, a $200 iron.  For the price, it delivers.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one I&#x27;ve gotten just to have a backup.  I find it works great on short to medium length hair.  With a little practise you can make a soft curl or straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is fairly easy to straighten or curl, and I thought it would be nice if one tool could do both.  My hair curls pretty easily, but not with this tool, so all it is really good for is a straightener, but it leaves my hair fairly damaged and the straightener I currently have works much much better.  This item also really pulls on my hair and it tore a fair amount of hair out, a problem I haven&#x27;t had with any other curlers or straighteners.  It was by far the worst thing I have ever used on my hair.  The instructions say the curling may take some practice, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that isn&#x27;t the case - this item just pulls too much on the hair and doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this product and didn&#x27;t use it the second time. The plates burnt my hair and the curls didn&#x27;t come out as nice.</li>
            <li> This was a good item that i purchased. value for money. It made me feel good. I love the item. More ppl should buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! It is very hard to find a flat iron with a lower heat setting that can be used on fine hair,most lower settings are still to hot and damaging for fine hair.The hot and med. work very well for coarse textures.I am a cosmotolagest and love this product!</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was surprised at how well this item worked.  I&#x27;ve tried other straigteners, and thought I had to pay $80 or more to get one that would work well, and was shocked when a friend had one of these and it was so quick to straigten.  We bought 2 and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> You can get so many styles out of this! It does tight curls, loose waves, and straightens hair. I love it, and am always finding new ways to use it. If you have long hair, you need this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over a year and I love it. I straighten my hair in very small pieces because I have very thick hair. But that&#x27;s true for any straightener! I have never had a problem with it not straightening my hair. As far as the curling capability, I don&#x27;t really use it to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; my hair (my hair is naturally curly). What I do use the curved edge for is to curl the ends of my hair under so that it&#x27;s not stick straight like a broom. It works great for that. And you won&#x27;t have a hard edge instead of a curl if you&#x27;ll turn the straightener slowly as you do it. I don&#x27;t know why some people have commented that it&#x27;s physically awkward to use; it&#x27;s just a straightener. It&#x27;s pretty simple. I only deducted one star because previous reviewers were right in that it DOES occasionally pull out hairs if you&#x27;re not careful - there&#x27;s some gap in between the plates somewhere that occasionally catches strands of hair. I can&#x27;t believe that wasn&#x27;t found in quality control but it should definitely be fixed.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, although I&#x27;m sure this has the potential to both straighten and curl hair, it seems quite tricky to get it to curl. I watched you tube, and tried on my daughter (she wanted to try looking &#x27;glamorous&#x27; with wavy hair as has dead straight long hair), but out of three attempts we only got one part of her to curl...so even when I supposedly had the correct technique it was still really hard and inconsistent. Her hair is quite thick and long so maybe that&#x27;s an issue - I&#x27;m regretting not buying a simple curler as that&#x27;s all she wanted...and at 12 yrs old, I think would have been better. As it is, we will put this away until she&#x27;s older!</li>
            <li> i just ordered this product yesterday gift for my self on my 24th birthday,and exited to try it out on my asian hair! will post a video when i receive it,hope it will turn out okey :) i do not expect a lot in this product but will see.&lt;br /&gt;i rate 1 for now coz it doesn&#x27;t accept my comment :)</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhere between curly and straight, which you would think would make it easy to go either way. In fact, my hair is like a petulant teenager, stubbornly refusing to do whatever it is I&#x27;m trying to get it to do. As such, I wasn&#x27;t too surprised that this didn&#x27;t curl my hair any better than any of the other tools I&#x27;ve used. It seems rollers left in overnight are the only way to get curls to stay for me; otherwise it looks great for about five minutes, then falls flat. But this is an excellent straightening iron, great for flipping the ends under, heats up almost instantly, and curls almost as well as a curling iron, with fewer tangles.</li>
            <li> This does not heat enough to straighten my hair. hair gets got in it also...paddles narrow...very disappointed with thhis buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I ruined my first one by spilling liquid on it - had to get it again. Best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I bought this while on vacation thinking it would be great to have one tool to carry around instead of two.  As a straightener it worked okay, though the curling part of the tool gets in the way when you use it close to your scalp.  As a curling iron, it was very difficult to use and left kinks in my hair.  I returned this product the next day and will continue searching for something better!</li>
            <li> It is hard to use. But it is good. I do not know is it harmful for hair or no? Please tell me about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot,</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter.  She uses it on a daily basis and loves it.  Good product</li>
            <li> I was replacing it because I was always using one similar, better quality that my roommate always let me use. Now that she moved out, i don&#x27;t have access to it. This was is not bad for the price. Only problem, my hair tends to get caught on the ends, so it breaks it.  Also, the curls aren&#x27;t as full as the other one I used. It just gives you waves at the tips of the hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a straightener like this to smooth and add a bit of curl to the ends. Very unhappy win results. I have naturally straight hair that is thin. This does not curl well at the ends and loses hold of the hair :( It did straighten ok though will give it to my daughter  she has thicker hair</li>
            <li> Ownded 2 of these over the years.  Should have found another as I bought the NEW Conair replacement for this... it looks better but doesnt do as good of a job.  It seems like the new one doesnt get as hot even though it says the same temp on the specs.  This one was great.  It lasted  YEARS.  I just happened to drop it from a high spot (10 feet....) and it quit heating.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to well on my thick hair.  I gave it to a friend with thinner hair she seems to do ok with it.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all my hair is medium length and NOT thick.  All the reviews I read said it didn&#x27;t curl with long thick hair, so I bought it, thinking it work on my hair.  Guess what??  It didn&#x27;t.  It straightens fine, but when I go to curl my hair it just bends it and makes my hair look funny.  Originally, I was just looking for a hair straightener, but when I found this I thought it would be cool to have a two in one tool.  When I bought it, I reminded myself if it didn&#x27;t curl I would still have a nice straightener.  Well, within a month of having it it started to make weird popping noises, as if it where going to explode, and smelled like it was burning.  I sent in an angry review to the makers of this product.  They are now sending me a new one for free.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t even want it anymore.  Do yourself a favor, and spend your money on a product you KNOW you can TRUST.</li>
            <li> Got this at a garage sale. Had to figure out how to use. I have fine hair. At first it did nothing but straighten. Did a friends hair. She has very thick, fine hair. Starting close to roots I would glide down and straighten hair. Then about and inch from roots same piece of hair I would glide down enough so I could turn the hair in the iron wrapped around. 2 times,  then slowly bring iron down to end of hair and release. Nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it that it is dual purpose in one tool!  With a small bathroom that really matters!</li>
            <li> Gave the infiniti by conair you style as a gift too.She says it is great on hair, she really loves it.</li>
            <li> Pros: Straightens well, curls ok, heats up super fast, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hair frequently snags in the gap between the end of the heating plate and the plastic.  Medium is far too hot for my fine hair, and low is too cool.  The curling action is clunky at best and is much easier to do with an iron with curved plates and plastic body. It leaves crimp lines from the sharp plastic corners.</li>
            <li> Love it straight or curly</li>
            <li> Very good straightener. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now. Heats up quick. I have thin hair so it works well on me.</li>
            <li> didnt really like the curls it produced.  iron needs to close tighter at the ends of hair.  maybe with more practice</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hair straightener, buy a hair straightener. If you&#x27;re looking for a curling iron, buy a curling iron. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that does both? This isn&#x27;t it. I tried curling my hair w/ it like the directions show you - I got a tiny wave at the bottom of my small section of hair. I even had my sister use it on my hair herself thinking maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong and it&#x27;s easier for someone else to use it on you, nope. Still got the same tiny little wave at the bottom, same result w/ my sisters hair who has a completely different hair type then me. Just doesn&#x27;t work........ :(</li>
            <li> i bought conair infinity in nov 2012..i appreciate amazon&#x27;s delivery system...really good...&lt;br /&gt;conair infinity was good for straightening but was really disappointed with the curling part of it...it didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li> I thought this item would be easy to use, but it is not.  I have tried over and over again and I have not got a singlee curl out of it.</li>
            <li> The item arrived with a US plug and the quality of the whole item is quite bad, it doesn&#x27;t seem solid at all.  The heat up is quite slow as well.</li>
            <li> I used this to try and put soft waves in my hair.  Even on \\&quot;low\\&quot; it&#x27;s my hottest burning tool, my hair was too hot to touch and feels crispy after only one use. As others have mentioned, the barrel has a mezza-luna type design that doesn&#x27;t work well.  The ends of your hair in the iron are scorched, the half on the mezza-luna gets some heat styling and the rest gets nothing. It could only curl about 2-3 inches of hair at a time, so my medium-long hair required me going up each section of hair multiple times - time consuming, and it didn&#x27;t give an attractive result.  The waves it created (when it worked) were sharp and clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be fine as a flat iron, but for curls/waves it doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> This is just what my wife wanted, we know it&#x27;s very good and hairstyle can be easily achieved.because her sister has one. durable material and resistant to accidental drops.</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck in seams and pulls/breaks.&lt;br /&gt;Creates bumps/lines when turning for curls, not a smooth curl.&lt;br /&gt;Throwing away as return shipping would be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Mys sister bought this for me as a christmas gift and i didnt want to tell her this but i hate it ,it doesnt get that hot for starters and it takes me a loooooong time to get my hair atraight with this and i have thin hair! With my mothers hair straighter i got thru my hair with one stroke and it gets it straight and with this one i have to go through it like 5 6 times to get it straight !</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> straightens pretty good, hard to get the curls down, though...they all look different and just strange.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as pictured. Ordered it because a friend recommended it. It works well, just takes practice to get used to. Great multi-purpose tool!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!! I watched some youtube videos showing how to use this item. It really helped! I don&#x27;t have to carry a straight iron and a curling iron when I travel!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews.  While it&#x27;s not a super straightener, it&#x27;s better than you might think for $20.</li>
            <li> I have this flat iron and every time my daughter visited, she had to use it. I got this one for her for Christmas. She has fine, straight hair and she loves the way it curls and and volume to her look.</li>
            <li> I thought this iron was going to be amazing. It does straighten my hair but the curls don&#x27;t come out as well as I had hoped and it takes a really long time to iron all of my hair and I have straight hair to start with I just use it to style it. Overall it was good for the low price.</li>
            <li> after taking over my cousin&#x27;s and having to return it, i ended up buying my own conair infinity flat/curling iron. Needless to say i absolutely love it, whenever i use it, I look like I just acme from the salon. :)</li>
            <li> I was so psyched to try this curling iron out, but once I got the package, and tried it, I was SO DISAPPOINTED. It&#x27;s not as easy to glide the iron through your hair in order to curl it, as the commercial suggests--actually NOT easy at all, hair gets caught in the metal, pulled and it breaks(!!) Also, the two cooling plates leave dents on your hair and the curl doesn&#x27;t come out nice and smooth at all. Straightening hair is ok, but sometimes the cooling plates (which btw get hot, so they aren&#x27;t very cooling) get in the way and trap your hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own one as of yet, but in the past my cousin would let me borrow hers. I loved it so much! I have really think curly hair so of course straightening it takes forever, so I rarely do it. But with this I can put more amount of hair and it still comes out pin straight. Not to mention I love the waves I can make with the you styler. I begged my cousin over and over to tell me were she got it from she said, \\&quot;I got it from Amazon\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t believe. Buying hair products online was never a good thing for me in the past, why would it be now. I found the same styler in other stores but it was always $45 or higher! honestly i was still a sceptic so i decided to wait till my cousins broke to see how long it lasted. 5 years latter...and its still great! now I&#x27;m just waiting for it to be delivered ^_^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like any other straightener, no better, no worse. I was trying to  get that slight curl, which I got, but then decided really didn&#x27;t look good on me, but that&#x27;s not the straighteners fault. If you&#x27;re looking for a basic straightener, I have no complaints, but no raving either. If it&#x27;s on sale, go for it</li>
            <li> Not much here folks!  The straightener part does a pretty good job, as it does get really hot, HOWEVER the curling part did NOTHING for me and this was after I even practiced and got the movement down. My hair is VERY hard to curl and the only thing I could manage out of it was a VERY slight wave for sure not even close to a CURL.  I have to give this product a thumbs down for hard to curl hair.  If your hair curls easily, you might get different results than I did, but, if not choose another product!</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more and got a quality product. I loved this iron the 3 times I used it, then the 4th time I dropped it and that was it. It no longer heats up. I loved the soft curls and body it gave my usually flat hair. Too bad it couldn&#x27;t survive one fall.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the idea of this iron. It straightens my hair on the top and curls the bottoms. Curling the ends works especially well when I put my head down and have my hair upside down. However, I tend to get my hair caught in the edges, which ends up pulling out my hair. Also, at the ends where the hair gets really thin the hair tends to just slip out of the iron instead of curl. Like I said, great idea, but some improvements could be made.</li>
            <li> Its ok only two heats</li>
            <li> great hair straightener!, i bought one or me and one for my mom, we love them!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up AT ALL, not even hot to touch</li>
            <li> I borrowed my friends a few times and liked it so had to order my own.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I&#x27;m not disappointed.  Price is right, shipping fast (and free w/ prime)...good purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting it to do its job. It is poorly built and stops working! I would try something else and get a better quality iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same flat iron for years and needed to get a new one because my old one died. I was disappointed with the quality of the product when I received it. It was dusty and it looked like it had been opened before and left out to accumulate dust.</li>
            <li> I got the Infiniti the other day!! I love it can straighten and curl either one or both!!! I have had several curling irons before but it wouldn&#x27;t do what I like and now that I have the infiniti it does what I love to my hair!! Its wonderful and safe for my ten year old!!</li>
            <li> but otherwise expected, this meets the expectations and what you require. his office was super fast, stay delighted when I was told that I was in the mail, Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This straightener completely defrizzes my hair without over-heating my hair as other straighteners have.  The straight sides and curved sides allow me to make my hair very straight or with a bit of curve, depending on what style I want that day.  Extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The photo gave me the impression that the curved half of this straightner/curling iron, really wrapped around the entire upper half of the barrel. However, the curved curling iron part only wraps 1/4 of the way around the upper barrel. It works ok but not as well as the product I had to replace.</li>
            <li> The transaction was excellent but this product is not good. It does not make my hair shine like when I use Gold&#x27;N Hot product. Conair has never satisfied me.</li>
            <li> It was okay...not very good quality</li>
            <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and i mean it&#x27;s a good iron but it doesn&#x27;t works so well on me as it does with wavy hair or it worked better on my mum&#x27;s hair than in mine cause it really takes me long with it to straighten it (about 2 hours)  i feel like it damages my hair i mean it doesn&#x27;t leaves it fried up but also not smooth so if you have very curly hair better get something more professional like the CHI irons or ask your hair styler what he/she recommends</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order...read many reviews in diff. ones, and decided for this one.. love it..works great Im in my 50&#x27;s and this young stuff, sometimes not sure how to use....but this is great easy to use and does the job. I placed a ceramic hot plate holder at my dresser for it, just in case..  have not burned myself yet...and it seems to be gentle with my hair... keep it at med. heat.. Im planning to order another one for my traveling case.  I no longer use my round curling iron this does it all. price is perfect</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product waste of money !!! Daughter and me both tried using it with the video still want work!!!</li>
            <li> Love this curling flat iron combo. It works great and is easy to use. It leaves silky curls or smooth strait hair. I defiantly recommend it.</li>
