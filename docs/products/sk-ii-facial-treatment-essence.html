    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>really great ..worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I am always in search of the best &amp;#34;under makeup&amp;#34; skincare.  </li>
            <li>AND I had acne scarring (I&#x27;m very fair)</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s incredibly pricey.</li>
            <li>The SK-II soaks in beautifully.  </li>
            <li>not that I spend a great deal of time reading marketing copy for cosmetics).</li>
            <li>My tip is to use it after a shower, when your skin is damp, as I think that seems to be a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger?  </li>
            <li>have experienced.  </li>
            <li>and this does a great job at filling them</li>
            <li>this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>The best I can say is that the product doesn’t seem to have hurt me; there haven’t been any more breakouts, no blotchiness, no allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>It kind of drips out, but you have to shake it and can’t control the flow.&lt;br /&gt;- price!  </li>
            <li>Subjectively it feels good</li>
            <li>Applying it feels good, sort of like applying salt water to my face.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin (makes skin feel tauter).</li>
            <li>pH, etc.?- and why is that change a good thing?)  </li>
            <li>pH, etc.?- and why is that change a good thing?)  </li>
            <li>This makes me think it is doing a good job in the exfoliating arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news is that I didn&#x27;t break out from using it (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it the one star hate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!  </li>
            <li>The story of the sake brewers with youthful hands and the research to isolate a yeast strain responsible for youth is some of the best marketing copy I&#x27;ve read for a cosmetic product (</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says it&#x27;s nice to put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been good while it lasted, but I will not buy more.</li>
            <li>Since it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I can&#x27;t be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.</li>
            <li>I already have nice skin, so I do not see any difference as yet.</li>
            <li>yr faithfully I can honestly say it made no difference.</li>
            <li>SK-II isn&#x27;t snake oil but is an effective toner.</li>
            <li>and it is effective at giving the skin a glow.</li>
            <li>SK-II isn&#x27;t snake oil but is an effective toner.</li>
            <li>and it is effective at giving the skin a glow.</li>
            <li>the price I would like see some kind of results.  </li>
            <li>oz bottle that I received came with no instructions or literature of any kind.</li>
            <li>Pleasant and easy to use;</li>
            <li>Feels very smooth on the skin and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great part of a toner-essence-lotion regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Inadequate on its own for folks with dry-ish skin like me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She reports that it is a very light liquid, almost watery.</li>
            <li>I was able to find more information online.&lt;br</li>
            <li>found needing more like 5 drops to get</li>
            <li>and I feel like my skin looks better after using it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I spray my face three times a day or more, in the morning, after I put on my make-up, etc</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s given me the most supple skin</li>
            <li>I wanted so much to love this.</li>
            <li>you are one of those people buying this product, and wish to know its ingredients and how to apply it, here is some information I found (mostly on the SKII web site) that may be of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Use twice daily for best results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am definitely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t know or havent tried anything that felt or worked better.</li>
            <li>oz. was my favorite product.</li>
            <li>It is enriched with more than 90% Pitera.</li>
            <li>sure I notice a difference</li>
            <li>Why are so many people buying SK-II products?&lt;br</li>
            <li>it costs more it must be better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would like to see a bit of peer-reviewed science indicating that this is a healthy and safe product for all people.  </li>

            <li>I am 41, have oily skin, and love spending time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>This cream is probably 10% as potent as Retin-A.  </li>
            <li>As most users have likewise mentioned, it gives the skin a noticeable glow.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more chemical like smell</li>
            <li>It seems infinitely more sensible and cost effective, no matter what your disposable income situation is, to try a glycolic acid cream or a mild rice based exfoliant product.</li>

            <li>Living a healthy lifestyle is a better bet than this SK-II product-- real science has demonstrated over and over again that good nutrition, good sleep, no smoking, and exercise positively impact the health and appearance of your skin, as well as the rest of you. :)</li>

            <li>There has been no reduction in my fine lines, no change in firmness or texture, and I’m not any more radiant than I was.  </li>
            <li>The product is clear, feels cool and nice to use, not oily, and so is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>This lightweight skin treatment is easy to apply with a cotton square.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild, almost non-existent, and it fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li>(And if that person is you, maybe start today being more gentle and loving with that person in the mirror.)  </li>
            <li>(And if that person is you, maybe start today being more gentle and loving with that person in the mirror.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and evening for 2 weeks now and have not noticed any visible effect to my skin tone or fine wrinkles at all.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines didn&#x27;t decrease.  </li>
            <li>but the scent was fine.  </li>
            <li>Free of Sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and GMO.</li>
            <li>For the cost and reputation, I was very hopeful that it would prove effective, but in before and after photos during the month we see no discernible difference.</li>
            <li>Purchasers seem to ignore the fact that in cosmetic form the user&#x27;s contact with this product is brief and miniscule/does not begin to approach the level of all-day hands-on contact with fermented yeast the sake workers would have experienced.</li>
            <li>The balance of microbes in and on our bodies is important.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my two cents worth.  :)</li>
            <li>The balance of microbes in and on our bodies is important.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my two cents worth.  :)</li>
            <li>I sprinkle drops onto my hand and smooth it in.  </li>
            <li>There is no smell to it all which is good for those that might be sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>For this price, you can get a professional facial at a good spa/salon that would probably do you much more good.</li>
            <li>It is really light and goes on easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>An economic alternative, costing just pennies, if you&#x27;re adventurous and hands on, is grinding some brown rice or coffee beans to a very fine powder in a good blender like a Vitamix, which takes only seconds to produce a substantial supply.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Amazon page says that it “Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and significantly improves skin texture, firmness and radiance.”</li>
            <li>Goes on comfortably... feels cool on the skin.  </li>
            <li>will probably continue to purchase this because how friendly it is to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I had some breakouts which seem to be consistent with many users .</li>
            <li>I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li>You apply this product to clean skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is moist which is great because I always struggle with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could be more positive.</li>
            <li>I may have to use it a bit longer (about 7 days) to get the full benefit of the reduction in the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Press into the skin gently, making sure the essence is being soaked all over the face and neck.</li>

            <li>I used SK II morning and evening for 1 full</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad</li>
            <li>Your best chance of finding it is playing with a child without looking at your watch, being kind to others, learning something new, taking a hike in the woods or walking along an ocean or stream, living a peaceful life without sweating the small stuff, listening to your cat purr or letting your dog sleep on the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Clearly, the charm of the pitera story has led many, many people to \\&quot;drink the Koolaid\\&quot;, or more kindly put to have hope and place their faith in a very clever marketing campaign and the idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; fountain of youth (although many SK-II products are loaded down with chemical additives of all sorts).</li>
            <li>It dissipates off the skin relatively quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or tingling.  </li>
            <li>(It should quickly be added that using these acid products requires acclimating the skin by using weaker concentrations, 5% then 10% then if needed and preferred 20%.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this facial treatment for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>product was offered to me as a free sample for review, and it seemed kind of fun to try something which was far out of the range I am willing to spend on my appearance.</li>

            <li>With the high price tag and time it takes to see some result, make sure you have some patience with this product.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that what I&#x27;m using is effective</li>
            <li>Use twice daily for best results.&amp;#34;instructions or information, or doesn&#x27;t care enough about customers&#x27; satisfaction or their correct use of the product to desire to be helpful to them and therefore receive positive reviews in return, astounds me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine she&#x27;d ever spend $100... probably not even $20 unless some amazing results begin to take effect after further use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a couple of days of this stuff applied with a cotton ball, I looked 10 years younger, and my skin felt AMAZING</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 yrs old w pre-mature aging skin I eat healthy</li>
            <li>It seems fair to say that this Japanese product line (Now owned by Proctor and Gamble) relies on a quaint and endearing sake worker, miracle discovery persona, to justify a grossly overpriced toner.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after my shower, while my hair is still wrapped in a towel.  </li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it right away.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel and scent (pretty fragrance free) too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I like it, but like many other reviewers, I expected more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In regard to my own experience with SKII facial treatment essence, I was quite disbelieving – almost to the point of being stunned – that no instructions for use comes with the bottle – and no list of ingredients or information of any kind.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it in between Retin-A applications because it is oily-skin friendly.  </li>
            <li>The liquid contained within the lovely frosted glass bottle has the consistency of water, and, as far as my face is concerned, about as much effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a list of preservatives, with the first ingredient being yeast.  </li>
            <li>facial treatment, however, will lighten your pocket by more than $100.00</li>
            <li>I will continue to daily apply and see if it just takes more than 30 days to demonstrate a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been softly slapping it on my face every morning after cleansing, and my skin has felt softer and looks smooth, but no drastic changes or improvements.</li>
            <li>I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth as soon as it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The company website has a lovely children&#x27;s fairytale style commercial with this story at http://www.sk-ii.com/about-us-miracle.html#a-journey-back .</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting results promoted as exotic and almost mystical that are attainable at a tiny fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting results promoted as exotic and almost mystical that are attainable at a tiny fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine and can be used daily as a gentle exfoliant with the benefits the rice imparts.</li>
            <li>With the price difference you can buy, among other things, a nice bottle of sake to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the price difference you can buy, among other things, a nice bottle of sake to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also appears to be doing a good job at light exfoliation without irritating or causing redness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there&#x27;s no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  </li>
            <li>The company website includes some research links and reviews, but after reading it and many other online resources related to the pitera ingredients and SK-II products, I am not convinced that these products are good for all skin types or that they work as claimed in the tiny doses these products deliver</li>
            <li>It certainly contains moisture and a bunch of nutrients that are a byproduct of the yeast fermentation that the product is derived from.  </li>
            <li>I have used it (I admit) and it does help with those odd age marks, and is great for the skin, especially during the chill winter winds.  </li>
            <li>really dry skin and SK-II Facial Treatment Essence has been a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Lightly massaging VERY mild abrasives against the skin, loosens and sluffs off dead cells.  </li>
            <li>An alternative to this mechanical removal, is loosening the grip of dead skin cells chemically, most notably by mild acid products containing glycolic or salicylic acid.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Anyone in your life who might love you or value you less because of wrinkles is someone you need to get rid of, right now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone in your life who might love you or value you less because of wrinkles is someone you need to get rid of, right now.</li>
            <li>you are willing to pay the high price and want to try and see if it works for you, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out of the bottle very well.  </li>
            <li>But she hasn&#x27;t really seen any results from it yet.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of usage my face feels so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Using this product has reduced the discoloration much faster than if I had just used moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, given the fact that using even 3-4 SK-II products could cost as much as a home mortgage, experimenting makes no sense except for those for whom money is no object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Is that too much to ask?  </li>
            <li>Is that too much to ask?  </li>
            <li>It goes on very light-feeling.  </li>
            <li>I’m going to sound like a commercial here</li>
            <li>It has not aggravated the redness that she has, but it has not decreased it either.</li>
            <li>But then there is no improvement, and the red spots on my face, artifacts of adult acne, soon start looking a bit redder and more</li>
            <li>I am surprised that the only instruction for this treatment is the video that you see on top of the Amazon page.  </li>
            <li>, it would still be expensive for what it is, but would easily be a 4 or 5 star recommendation as many of its loyal adherents now laud it.</li>
            <li>The question is, does it work, and is it any better than other cosmetics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>was very concerning for me, particularly because SKII advertises as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The most economical option is then, of course, to buy the smallest bottle or tube available, but enough to use for at least a two-week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wear powder on my face and find that many lotions/creams/serums sit on top of my skin, never soaking in, and cause my powder to be thick and greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  </li>
            <li>We are learning more and more about the human \\&quot;microbiome\\&quot;, and ways that fungi, viruses, and bacteria support our health and negatively impact it.  </li>
            <li>We are learning more and more about the human \\&quot;microbiome\\&quot;, and ways that fungi, viruses, and bacteria support our health and negatively impact it.  </li>
            <li>I had been thinking that it was the combination of this product and the other products I&#x27;m using - but could be just this!  :  )</li>
            <li>I’ve used more than half the bottle now, and I can’t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It isn’t as dry, It looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>my skin does look smoother, more even, and my lines look less defined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While you should see some results within a week such as tightening of the pores, the question is whether or not it is cost-effective to keep buying more bottles after the initial one?  </li>
            <li>The application of the water-like, clear, unscented fluid is pleasant, and for a few seconds my skin feels smoother (like with a water glow).  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the bottle is clear.  </li>
            <li>At least I can continue to use my own moisturizer with this product, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>and I’m not sure the product does much exfoliating, but I’ve been really pleased with how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Logic would imply it should be applied to a freshly cleaned face so facial oils will not impede it&#x27;s absorption.</li>
            <li>I used the product for 3 weeks, just adding it to my normal routine before writing a review, to ascertain if there were any noticeable differences.</li>
            <li>, I kept expecting marvelous results –softer skin, fewer lines (I&#x27;m in my 60s), hopefully fewer signs of the aging that only began to show the past few years.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I really like it, but do I like it enough to purchase my next bottle at full price?</li>
            <li>Tolerated by my very sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>downside is the price, wow!</li>

            <li>if everyone who has been buying this stuff decided to save their money for something that matters- the kid&#x27;s college fund, a safer car for the family, your retirement fund, a visit to see your mom, helping a neighbor who is out of work, making a donation to the local homeless shelter or food pantry, paying school tuition for a year for girls in Afghanistan or Cambodia or Kenya, supporting an animal shelter or wildlife sanctuary or your local symphony, paying off student loans or mortgage faster--- anything that actually matters to you, instead of something that you are buying because society tells you growing older makes you less attractive or less worthwhile?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>While my skin felt a little softer and smoother after using this for a month, I question if it is really worth as much as they charge for</li>
            <li>Applying it to the face produces a minor tingling and feels refreshing, not unlike a conventional toner as, say witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It also helped clear up my skin and improve the tone of my skin around my mouth and cheek area.</li>
            <li>(Yeast products are common in cosmetics, but most are developed from beer.)</li>
            <li>You can see how much product is left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to give the marketing team credit for the story they&#x27;ve developed for this product.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is not scented as that tends to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>By the time I am dressed and ready for makeup, there is no residue left on my face.</li>
            <li>This facial treatment really works.  </li>
            <li>Is it absorbing into the skin or simply drying on the surface?  </li>
            <li>Is it absorbing into the skin or simply drying on the surface?  </li>
            <li>but my skin is slightly sensitive when I use my clarisonic brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not huge on knowing about ingredients and such, because hey, if it helps me look prettier and it&#x27;s safe to use, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li>I like Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, which is a rice based powder but includes other excellent ingredients, though it&#x27;s an expensive product as well.</li>
            <li>This has a compelling and scientific ring to it since active agents like enzymes and yeasts do promote profound changes to things they&#x27;re exposed to.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t seem to need a large amount to have coverage of your entire face which is nice as these products are expensive.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say about this item is that it had no negative effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used this on my face, particularly for crows feet for 30 day with no apparent difference.</li>
            <li>This is surely due to the extraordinary prices of SK-II products in addition to sales volume (with even the basic 11 oz \\&quot;essence\\&quot; waters selling for $290 on the SK-II website, and this 2.5 fl.</li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SK-II has now been purchased by American giant Proctor and Gamble, and is one of a small group of P &amp; G products that has achieved more than a billion dollars in annual sales.</li>
            <li>More modestly priced products like glycolic acid lotions, or minimally expensive DIY products like powdered brown rice used as a gentle exfoliant, should all provide a similarly glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>Two stars may seem a harsh rating, but it is strictly based on it&#x27;s value compared to other products priced much more affordably that promote exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  </li>
            <li>In the past few years I have started to notice fine lines around the corners of my eyes and above my smile lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having researched SKI-II products, I learned that they were developed in Asia for Asian skin types.</li>
            <li>/&gt;INGREDIENTS – 90% pitera (a blend of vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, although the specific ones don&#x27;t appear to be indicated anywhere, and some sites claim that these ingredients are produced during the fermentation of rice), galoctomyces ferment filtrate, butylene and pentylene glycol (both which some claim can irritate sensitive and blemished skin),  water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, and sorbic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It is a thicker cream and as crazy as it sounds, is good for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Significantly, this is the largest selling \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; cosmetic in Asia (even inspiring a huge problem with counterfeit products sold in China which happened to be contaminated with dangerous levels of heavy metals).</li>
            <li>It is such a liquid thin serum that the cotton will soak up your precious money and nothing will be left for your face.  </li>
            <li>After three weeks I did notice that the area seemed to be a little smother and the fine lines slightly less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it is clear whether or not this product is working or might work over the very long term.  </li>
            <li>It should quickly be noted, that exfoliation is achieved through other less mystifying ways.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t expect my skin to look a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one&#x27;s face is a good thing, or a bad thing, or if it has a neutral impact.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> really great ..worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the best &amp;#34;under makeup&amp;#34; skincare.  </li>
            <li> AND I had acne scarring (I&#x27;m very fair)</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s incredibly pricey.</li>
            <li> The SK-II soaks in beautifully.  </li>
            <li> not that I spend a great deal of time reading marketing copy for cosmetics).</li>
            <li> My tip is to use it after a shower, when your skin is damp, as I think that seems to be a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger?  </li>
            <li> have experienced.  </li>
            <li> and this does a great job at filling them</li>
            <li> this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> The best I can say is that the product doesn’t seem to have hurt me; there haven’t been any more breakouts, no blotchiness, no allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li> It kind of drips out, but you have to shake it and can’t control the flow.&lt;br /&gt;- price!  </li>
            <li> Subjectively it feels good</li>
            <li> Applying it feels good, sort of like applying salt water to my face.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin (makes skin feel tauter).</li>
            <li> pH, etc.?- and why is that change a good thing?)  </li>
            <li> pH, etc.?- and why is that change a good thing?)  </li>
            <li> This makes me think it is doing a good job in the exfoliating arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news is that I didn&#x27;t break out from using it (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it the one star hate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!  </li>
            <li> The story of the sake brewers with youthful hands and the research to isolate a yeast strain responsible for youth is some of the best marketing copy I&#x27;ve read for a cosmetic product (</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says it&#x27;s nice to put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been good while it lasted, but I will not buy more.</li>
            <li> Since it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I can&#x27;t be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.</li>
            <li> I already have nice skin, so I do not see any difference as yet.</li>
            <li> yr faithfully I can honestly say it made no difference.</li>
            <li> SK-II isn&#x27;t snake oil but is an effective toner.</li>
            <li> and it is effective at giving the skin a glow.</li>
            <li> SK-II isn&#x27;t snake oil but is an effective toner.</li>
            <li> and it is effective at giving the skin a glow.</li>
            <li> the price I would like see some kind of results.  </li>
            <li> oz bottle that I received came with no instructions or literature of any kind.</li>
            <li> Pleasant and easy to use;</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth on the skin and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great part of a toner-essence-lotion regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Inadequate on its own for folks with dry-ish skin like me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She reports that it is a very light liquid, almost watery.</li>
            <li> I was able to find more information online.&lt;br</li>
            <li> found needing more like 5 drops to get</li>
            <li> and I feel like my skin looks better after using it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I spray my face three times a day or more, in the morning, after I put on my make-up, etc</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s given me the most supple skin</li>
            <li> I wanted so much to love this.</li>
            <li> you are one of those people buying this product, and wish to know its ingredients and how to apply it, here is some information I found (mostly on the SKII web site) that may be of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Use twice daily for best results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am definitely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t know or havent tried anything that felt or worked better.</li>
            <li> oz. was my favorite product.</li>
            <li> It is enriched with more than 90% Pitera.</li>
            <li> sure I notice a difference</li>
            <li> Why are so many people buying SK-II products?&lt;br</li>
            <li> it costs more it must be better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would like to see a bit of peer-reviewed science indicating that this is a healthy and safe product for all people.  </li>

            <li> I am 41, have oily skin, and love spending time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> This cream is probably 10% as potent as Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> As most users have likewise mentioned, it gives the skin a noticeable glow.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more chemical like smell</li>
            <li> It seems infinitely more sensible and cost effective, no matter what your disposable income situation is, to try a glycolic acid cream or a mild rice based exfoliant product.</li>

            <li> Living a healthy lifestyle is a better bet than this SK-II product-- real science has demonstrated over and over again that good nutrition, good sleep, no smoking, and exercise positively impact the health and appearance of your skin, as well as the rest of you. :)</li>

            <li> There has been no reduction in my fine lines, no change in firmness or texture, and I’m not any more radiant than I was.  </li>
            <li> The product is clear, feels cool and nice to use, not oily, and so is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> This lightweight skin treatment is easy to apply with a cotton square.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild, almost non-existent, and it fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li> (And if that person is you, maybe start today being more gentle and loving with that person in the mirror.)  </li>
            <li> (And if that person is you, maybe start today being more gentle and loving with that person in the mirror.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and evening for 2 weeks now and have not noticed any visible effect to my skin tone or fine wrinkles at all.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines didn&#x27;t decrease.  </li>
            <li> but the scent was fine.  </li>
            <li> Free of Sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and GMO.</li>
            <li> For the cost and reputation, I was very hopeful that it would prove effective, but in before and after photos during the month we see no discernible difference.</li>
            <li> Purchasers seem to ignore the fact that in cosmetic form the user&#x27;s contact with this product is brief and miniscule/does not begin to approach the level of all-day hands-on contact with fermented yeast the sake workers would have experienced.</li>
            <li> The balance of microbes in and on our bodies is important.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my two cents worth.  :)</li>
            <li> The balance of microbes in and on our bodies is important.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my two cents worth.  :)</li>
            <li> I sprinkle drops onto my hand and smooth it in.  </li>
            <li> There is no smell to it all which is good for those that might be sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> For this price, you can get a professional facial at a good spa/salon that would probably do you much more good.</li>
            <li> It is really light and goes on easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> An economic alternative, costing just pennies, if you&#x27;re adventurous and hands on, is grinding some brown rice or coffee beans to a very fine powder in a good blender like a Vitamix, which takes only seconds to produce a substantial supply.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Amazon page says that it “Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and significantly improves skin texture, firmness and radiance.”</li>
            <li> Goes on comfortably... feels cool on the skin.  </li>
            <li> will probably continue to purchase this because how friendly it is to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I had some breakouts which seem to be consistent with many users .</li>
            <li> I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li> You apply this product to clean skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is moist which is great because I always struggle with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could be more positive.</li>
            <li> I may have to use it a bit longer (about 7 days) to get the full benefit of the reduction in the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Press into the skin gently, making sure the essence is being soaked all over the face and neck.</li>

            <li> I used SK II morning and evening for 1 full</li>
            <li> The smell was not bad</li>
            <li> Your best chance of finding it is playing with a child without looking at your watch, being kind to others, learning something new, taking a hike in the woods or walking along an ocean or stream, living a peaceful life without sweating the small stuff, listening to your cat purr or letting your dog sleep on the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Clearly, the charm of the pitera story has led many, many people to \\&quot;drink the Koolaid\\&quot;, or more kindly put to have hope and place their faith in a very clever marketing campaign and the idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; fountain of youth (although many SK-II products are loaded down with chemical additives of all sorts).</li>
            <li> It dissipates off the skin relatively quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or tingling.  </li>
            <li> (It should quickly be added that using these acid products requires acclimating the skin by using weaker concentrations, 5% then 10% then if needed and preferred 20%.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this facial treatment for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> product was offered to me as a free sample for review, and it seemed kind of fun to try something which was far out of the range I am willing to spend on my appearance.</li>

            <li> With the high price tag and time it takes to see some result, make sure you have some patience with this product.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that what I&#x27;m using is effective</li>
            <li> Use twice daily for best results.&amp;#34;instructions or information, or doesn&#x27;t care enough about customers&#x27; satisfaction or their correct use of the product to desire to be helpful to them and therefore receive positive reviews in return, astounds me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine she&#x27;d ever spend $100... probably not even $20 unless some amazing results begin to take effect after further use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of this stuff applied with a cotton ball, I looked 10 years younger, and my skin felt AMAZING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 yrs old w pre-mature aging skin I eat healthy</li>
            <li> It seems fair to say that this Japanese product line (Now owned by Proctor and Gamble) relies on a quaint and endearing sake worker, miracle discovery persona, to justify a grossly overpriced toner.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after my shower, while my hair is still wrapped in a towel.  </li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it right away.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and scent (pretty fragrance free) too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like it, but like many other reviewers, I expected more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In regard to my own experience with SKII facial treatment essence, I was quite disbelieving – almost to the point of being stunned – that no instructions for use comes with the bottle – and no list of ingredients or information of any kind.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it in between Retin-A applications because it is oily-skin friendly.  </li>
            <li> The liquid contained within the lovely frosted glass bottle has the consistency of water, and, as far as my face is concerned, about as much effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a list of preservatives, with the first ingredient being yeast.  </li>
            <li> facial treatment, however, will lighten your pocket by more than $100.00</li>
            <li> I will continue to daily apply and see if it just takes more than 30 days to demonstrate a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been softly slapping it on my face every morning after cleansing, and my skin has felt softer and looks smooth, but no drastic changes or improvements.</li>
            <li> I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth as soon as it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The company website has a lovely children&#x27;s fairytale style commercial with this story at http://www.sk-ii.com/about-us-miracle.html#a-journey-back .</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting results promoted as exotic and almost mystical that are attainable at a tiny fraction of the cost.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very fine and can be used daily as a gentle exfoliant with the benefits the rice imparts.</li>
            <li> With the price difference you can buy, among other things, a nice bottle of sake to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the price difference you can buy, among other things, a nice bottle of sake to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also appears to be doing a good job at light exfoliation without irritating or causing redness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there&#x27;s no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  </li>
            <li> The company website includes some research links and reviews, but after reading it and many other online resources related to the pitera ingredients and SK-II products, I am not convinced that these products are good for all skin types or that they work as claimed in the tiny doses these products deliver</li>
            <li> It certainly contains moisture and a bunch of nutrients that are a byproduct of the yeast fermentation that the product is derived from.  </li>
            <li> I have used it (I admit) and it does help with those odd age marks, and is great for the skin, especially during the chill winter winds.  </li>
            <li> really dry skin and SK-II Facial Treatment Essence has been a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Lightly massaging VERY mild abrasives against the skin, loosens and sluffs off dead cells.  </li>
            <li> An alternative to this mechanical removal, is loosening the grip of dead skin cells chemically, most notably by mild acid products containing glycolic or salicylic acid.  </li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out of the bottle very well.  </li>
            <li> But she hasn&#x27;t really seen any results from it yet.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of usage my face feels so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Using this product has reduced the discoloration much faster than if I had just used moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, given the fact that using even 3-4 SK-II products could cost as much as a home mortgage, experimenting makes no sense except for those for whom money is no object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Is that too much to ask?  </li>
            <li> Is that too much to ask?  </li>
            <li> It goes on very light-feeling.  </li>
            <li> I’m going to sound like a commercial here</li>
            <li> It has not aggravated the redness that she has, but it has not decreased it either.</li>
            <li> But then there is no improvement, and the red spots on my face, artifacts of adult acne, soon start looking a bit redder and more</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the only instruction for this treatment is the video that you see on top of the Amazon page.  </li>
            <li> , it would still be expensive for what it is, but would easily be a 4 or 5 star recommendation as many of its loyal adherents now laud it.</li>
            <li> The question is, does it work, and is it any better than other cosmetics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> was very concerning for me, particularly because SKII advertises as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The most economical option is then, of course, to buy the smallest bottle or tube available, but enough to use for at least a two-week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wear powder on my face and find that many lotions/creams/serums sit on top of my skin, never soaking in, and cause my powder to be thick and greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  </li>
            <li> We are learning more and more about the human \\&quot;microbiome\\&quot;, and ways that fungi, viruses, and bacteria support our health and negatively impact it.  </li>

            <li> I had been thinking that it was the combination of this product and the other products I&#x27;m using - but could be just this!  :  )</li>
            <li> I’ve used more than half the bottle now, and I can’t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It isn’t as dry, It looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> my skin does look smoother, more even, and my lines look less defined.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While you should see some results within a week such as tightening of the pores, the question is whether or not it is cost-effective to keep buying more bottles after the initial one?  </li>
            <li> The application of the water-like, clear, unscented fluid is pleasant, and for a few seconds my skin feels smoother (like with a water glow).  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the bottle is clear.  </li>
            <li> At least I can continue to use my own moisturizer with this product, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> and I’m not sure the product does much exfoliating, but I’ve been really pleased with how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Logic would imply it should be applied to a freshly cleaned face so facial oils will not impede it&#x27;s absorption.</li>
            <li> I used the product for 3 weeks, just adding it to my normal routine before writing a review, to ascertain if there were any noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> , I kept expecting marvelous results –softer skin, fewer lines (I&#x27;m in my 60s), hopefully fewer signs of the aging that only began to show the past few years.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really like it, but do I like it enough to purchase my next bottle at full price?</li>
            <li> Tolerated by my very sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> downside is the price, wow!</li>
            <li> serum is very light, only slightly thicker than water.  </li>
            <li> if everyone who has been buying this stuff decided to save their money for something that matters- the kid&#x27;s college fund, a safer car for the family, your retirement fund, a visit to see your mom, helping a neighbor who is out of work, making a donation to the local homeless shelter or food pantry, paying school tuition for a year for girls in Afghanistan or Cambodia or Kenya, supporting an animal shelter or wildlife sanctuary or your local symphony, paying off student loans or mortgage faster--- anything that actually matters to you, instead of something that you are buying because society tells you growing older makes you less attractive or less worthwhile?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> While my skin felt a little softer and smoother after using this for a month, I question if it is really worth as much as they charge for</li>
            <li> Applying it to the face produces a minor tingling and feels refreshing, not unlike a conventional toner as, say witch hazel.</li>
            <li> It also helped clear up my skin and improve the tone of my skin around my mouth and cheek area.</li>
            <li> (Yeast products are common in cosmetics, but most are developed from beer.)</li>
            <li> You can see how much product is left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to give the marketing team credit for the story they&#x27;ve developed for this product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not scented as that tends to bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> By the time I am dressed and ready for makeup, there is no residue left on my face.</li>
            <li> This facial treatment really works.  </li>
            <li> Is it absorbing into the skin or simply drying on the surface?  </li>
            <li> Is it absorbing into the skin or simply drying on the surface?  </li>
            <li> but my skin is slightly sensitive when I use my clarisonic brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on knowing about ingredients and such, because hey, if it helps me look prettier and it&#x27;s safe to use, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> I like Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, which is a rice based powder but includes other excellent ingredients, though it&#x27;s an expensive product as well.</li>
            <li> This has a compelling and scientific ring to it since active agents like enzymes and yeasts do promote profound changes to things they&#x27;re exposed to.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t seem to need a large amount to have coverage of your entire face which is nice as these products are expensive.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about this item is that it had no negative effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this on my face, particularly for crows feet for 30 day with no apparent difference.</li>
            <li> This is surely due to the extraordinary prices of SK-II products in addition to sales volume (with even the basic 11 oz \\&quot;essence\\&quot; waters selling for $290 on the SK-II website, and this 2.5 fl.</li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SK-II has now been purchased by American giant Proctor and Gamble, and is one of a small group of P &amp; G products that has achieved more than a billion dollars in annual sales.</li>
            <li> More modestly priced products like glycolic acid lotions, or minimally expensive DIY products like powdered brown rice used as a gentle exfoliant, should all provide a similarly glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> Two stars may seem a harsh rating, but it is strictly based on it&#x27;s value compared to other products priced much more affordably that promote exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  </li>
            <li> In the past few years I have started to notice fine lines around the corners of my eyes and above my smile lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having researched SKI-II products, I learned that they were developed in Asia for Asian skin types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;INGREDIENTS – 90% pitera (a blend of vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, although the specific ones don&#x27;t appear to be indicated anywhere, and some sites claim that these ingredients are produced during the fermentation of rice), galoctomyces ferment filtrate, butylene and pentylene glycol (both which some claim can irritate sensitive and blemished skin),  water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, and sorbic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is a thicker cream and as crazy as it sounds, is good for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Significantly, this is the largest selling \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; cosmetic in Asia (even inspiring a huge problem with counterfeit products sold in China which happened to be contaminated with dangerous levels of heavy metals).</li>
            <li> It is such a liquid thin serum that the cotton will soak up your precious money and nothing will be left for your face.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks I did notice that the area seemed to be a little smother and the fine lines slightly less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it is clear whether or not this product is working or might work over the very long term.  </li>
            <li> It should quickly be noted, that exfoliation is achieved through other less mystifying ways.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t expect my skin to look a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one&#x27;s face is a good thing, or a bad thing, or if it has a neutral impact.  </li>

            <li> But it might be considered in the same class as home entertainment, HDMI cables that some companies sold for hundreds of dollars for a mere 18 inches that now sell for a few dollars and arguably are equally effective.</li>

            <li> It may also be because of the sweet and hopeful story behind the product.</li>
            <li> But the reality is that those workers had continuous contact for hours each day to vast quantities of any active ingredients and weren&#x27;t dabbing on a tiny amount once or twice each day, which immediately raises an eyebrow if not a red flag as well.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought the Amazon or the distributor omitted this information by mistake, until I read Amazon reviews that indicated that other recipients had the same experience.</li>
            <li> the manufacturer or distributor can&#x27;t afford to provide instructions or information, or doesn&#x27;t care enough about customers&#x27; satisfaction or their correct use of the product to desire to be helpful to them and therefore receive positive reviews in return, astounds me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using this product, I began to wonder if SKII facial treatment essence  is a rip-off and a scam.</li>
            <li> As a little background:  I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Given the company&#x27;s simple backstory of the sake factory workers hands&#x27; being covered in a thick coating of pitera all day for years on end, it is reasonable to assume that improvements gained with a few drops of this watery product, providing such a tiny dose of pitera, might take a long time (involving enormous expense) or might be quite subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The story line for the entire SK (Secret Key) line of products is that it was noticed that elderly workers in a sake factory had their hands exposed to certain fermenting yeasts daily and the result was that their hands remained youthful, contrasting to their aged wrinkled faces.</li>
            <li> Pitera is presented as the result of an attempt to replicate the material the workers&#x27; hands were in contact with all day long.</li>
            <li> seems to me that P &amp; G is making a claim that this product has a medical impact upon the body/skin condition, yet there is no real data or scientific rationale to support that claim.  </li>

            <li> Removing the appearance dulling dead skin cells on the skin&#x27;s surface would naturally have this brightening effect.</li>
            <li> It did nothing at all for my skin except make it wet for a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> So what is this \\&quot;pitera\\&quot; stuff that SK-II markets as it&#x27;s unique active ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;Pitera is promoted as the \\&quot;secret key\\&quot; to this cosmetic-</li>
            <li> the science and cost are more than a little questionable.</li>

            <li> A small amount goes a long way and if used twice a day, say, morning and evening, it seems to be enough to last perhaps 2 months.  </li>
            <li> you are actually throwing money down the drain.</li>

            <li> product is a bit of an unknown to me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty and will update my review at that point.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, seems like pores are smaller and skin feels</li>
            <li> Another issue is the dispensing of the product: You have to carefully pour it from a plastic hole without allow any drops on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After searching online for a little while, I got the low down on how to use the product, but It seems to me for the price this treatment sells for they could have included a sheet of information.</li>
            <li> I would consider the other products in this line as well.</li>
            <li> But other recipients and users claim to find it beneficial, so it probably is for some complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> that my pores appear shallower – this is something I have not seen reliably with other products.</li>
            <li> You simply assume a small amount is shaken out into the palm of your hand and then dabbed onto your face.</li>
            <li> Tread carefully!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m active.</li>
            <li> Pitera was initially marketed in the form of this clear, watery, extraordinarily expensive \\&quot;essence\\&quot;, and benefit claims over time have included increasing the skin&#x27;s metabolism and regeneration rate, helping the skin retain moisture, smoothing skin texture, minimizing dark spots and helping reduce acne.</li>
            <li> (Is it possible that the demographic this product is marketed to simply has no idea what hard hands-on physical work is like, so they can&#x27;t understand the difference between their small daub or splash of \\&quot;essence\\&quot; and a worker&#x27;s grueling hours of work, day after day, year after year, with hands repeatedly reaching into vats of sticky fermented yeast/covered with a thick coating of it for hours through a work day???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The same results can be achieved with premium priced, though still far less expensive products.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that if you follow the directions, this is a time consuming process.  </li>
            <li> This one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had had even worse results with products containing salicylic acid, a frequently used ingredient for improving complexions, but as I discovered, not recommended for reddish blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I overuse Retin-A by putting it on a few days in a row, I get very dry scaly skin and that lasts a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it easiest to use by pouring a very small amount onto the back of my hand and patting it onto my face.</li>
            <li> This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  </li>
            <li> Because it seems to have a subtle, definite benefit but</li>
            <li> after some thought (especially about the crazy price tag for a bottle of water-like fluid), it saddens me that women (and sometimes men) are so tyrannized by societal pressure to \\&quot;look younger\\&quot;, so obsessed with outward appearances, and so influenced by marketing ploys that they would spend so much money on a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; cosmetic.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;That said, I think this is a little too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to go online to the company&#x27;s website to do a little research.  </li>
            <li> I have seen this in stores but it was a little too pricey for me.</li>

            <li> /&gt;My biggest complaint, price aside, is that this is a bit of a challenge to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s liquid and has a placid smell.</li>
            <li> I have not have any negative reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only negative?</li>
            <li> It’s just an extra (and very expensive) step in my skin care routine and nothing</li>
            <li> This product is seriously the fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> , seriously... do NOT, put this on a cotton ball/pad.</li>
            <li> I like the product and believe it produces subtle, visible results.</li>
            <li> I have tried much less expensive products that have provided visible results, so I can&#x27;t recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> If it were not for the ridiculous price I would give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> While I must admit I did notice a slight improvement this product seems Awfully Expensive for The Improvement I noticed.</li>
            <li> Who could fail to be charmed by a story of elderly sake factory workers whose faces were wrinkled but hands remained youthful?</li>
            <li> dispensing method is awkward.  </li>
            <li> It is colorless, odorless, and from the bit I got on my lips, it is tasteless.  </li>
            <li> No irritation or bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation for this reason, it looks terrible on my face.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was intrigued by this SK-II facial treatment and agreed to review a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates your face.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to tone and reduce appearance of pores.&lt;br /&gt;- Tolerated by my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- Documentation.  The package includes none.  How do I apply it.  Do I put sunscreen over it?  I was able to find more information online.&lt;br /&gt;- Science.  For the price, I&#x27;d expect some studies to be published.  I only found mention of a company-sponsored study on the sk-ii dot com website. Even a breakdown of what it contains (i.e. results of a chemistry spectroscopy test) would be interesting, to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to apply only a couple drops at a time: found needing more like 5 drops to get coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to pay the high price and want to try and see if it works for you, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a bit of an unknown to me.  It certainly contains moisture and a bunch of nutrients that are a byproduct of the yeast fermentation that the product is derived from.  Subjectively it feels good and I feel like my skin looks better after using it for three weeks.  It feels like it is doing something: there is a sensation of warmth / firmness it give you.  I will continue using as recommended and report back with any changes.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the bottle is clear.  You can see how much product is left.  There is no smell to it all which is good for those that might be sensitive to scents.  It&#x27;s a splash applicator and it doesn&#x27;t seem to come out of the bottle very well.  Another draw back it the PRICE!  Yikes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to give the marketing team credit for the story they&#x27;ve developed for this product. The story of the sake brewers with youthful hands and the research to isolate a yeast strain responsible for youth is some of the best marketing copy I&#x27;ve read for a cosmetic product (not that I spend a great deal of time reading marketing copy for cosmetics). They must have a completely different team working on packaging to have omitted instructions from the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s been using this for a couple weeks now, and based on her feedback, I can&#x27;t imagine she&#x27;d ever spend $100... probably not even $20 unless some amazing results begin to take effect after further use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it&#x27;s nice to put on. It feels very lightweight, leaves no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin. But she hasn&#x27;t really seen any results from it yet. If that assessment changes after further use, I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give less than three stars to something when I don&#x27;t really have anything negative to say about the product, but at this price point no negative effects is just not good enough.</li>
            <li> This product is unsealed. I am wondering if this is a trial product.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously the fountain of youth. I actually broke open the bottle and put the solution into a spray bottle. I spray my face three times a day or more, in the morning, after I put on my make-up, etc.. and it&#x27;s given me the most supple skin, it&#x27;s taken years off of my face AND I had acne scarring (I&#x27;m very fair) that is going away because of this product. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth on the skin and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great part of a toner-essence-lotion regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Inadequate on its own for folks with dry-ish skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think this is a little too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been good while it lasted, but I will not buy more.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and loves it... I have used it (I admit) and it does help with those odd age marks, and is great for the skin, especially during the chill winter winds.  My wife swears by this.  My tip is to use it after a shower, when your skin is damp, as I think that seems to be a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger?  No.  Skin younger?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this on age spots, I note that they fade and disappear with use.  The product is clear, feels cool and nice to use, not oily, and so is pleasant.  Simply fading out a few age spots makes me look younger, so this is why it gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As a little background:  I&#x27;m a middle-aged woman with sensitive skin.  I use Cetaphil facial cleanser and Cerave cream on my face.  Reading the ingredient list:  : Saccharomycopsis Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aqua (Water/ Eau), Sodium Benzoate, Methylparaben, Sorbic Acid. Free of Sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and GMO. was very concerning for me, particularly because SKII advertises as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cosmetic line.  It looks like a list of preservatives, with the first ingredient being yeast.  I tried it for a few days; it had no effect on my skin and I will not continue using it.</li>
            <li> really great ..worth every penny!! After a couple of days of this stuff applied with a cotton ball, I looked 10 years younger, and my skin felt AMAZING</li>
            <li> There were no directions for use included in the box so I visited the SK-II website to find out what the recommended use for this product is.  The recommendation is to apply it to the face with a cotton ball each morning and evening after cleansing but before moisturizing.  The product doesn&#x27;t have any harsh smell and I haven&#x27;t had any issue with redness or the appearance of red bumps or breakouts like some reviewers have experienced.  It dissipates off the skin relatively quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or tingling.  I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and evening for 2 weeks now and have not noticed any visible effect to my skin tone or fine wrinkles at all.  I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty and will update my review at that point.</li>
            <li> Well, where to begin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial treatment arrived in a burgundy colored box, with no instructions as to its use and no listing of its ingredients.  The liquid contained within the lovely frosted glass bottle has the consistency of water, and, as far as my face is concerned, about as much effectiveness.  I have used it faithfully for about three weeks now and don&#x27;t look a lick different than I did when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial treatment, however, will lighten your pocket by more than $100.00</li>
            <li> This lightweight skin treatment is easy to apply with a cotton square. You don&#x27;t seem to need a large amount to have coverage of your entire face which is nice as these products are expensive. I like the fact that it is not scented as that tends to bother my sensitive skin. It also appears to be doing a good job at light exfoliation without irritating or causing redness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of results, it seems to be improving the texture of my skin, which is not as even as it was in younger years. I may have to use it a bit longer (about 7 days) to get the full benefit of the reduction in the appearance of wrinkles. Overall, I like the product and it&#x27;s ease of use. I would consider the other products in this line as well.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the best &amp;#34;under makeup&amp;#34; skincare.  I only wear powder on my face and find that many lotions/creams/serums sit on top of my skin, never soaking in, and cause my powder to be thick and greasy looking.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation for this reason, it looks terrible on my face.  The SK-II soaks in beautifully.  I put it on right after my shower, while my hair is still wrapped in a towel.  By the time I am dressed and ready for makeup, there is no residue left on my face. Love!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for several weeks now and can see a difference in my skin.  At this point in life, I only have light/fine wrinkles and this does a great job at filling them in.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint, price aside, is that this is a bit of a challenge to apply.  Do not, seriously... do NOT, put this on a cotton ball/pad. It is such a liquid thin serum that the cotton will soak up your precious money and nothing will be left for your face.  I apply a few drops in the palms of my hand and use my fingertips to rub the serum in.  Since the serum is liquid thin, you do have to be careful not to let it drip off onto the sink from your hand otherwise you are actually throwing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I wanted so much to love this. I have used this on my face, particularly for crows feet for 30 day with no apparent difference. Applying it feels good, sort of like applying salt water to my face. For the cost and reputation, I was very hopeful that it would prove effective, but in before and after photos during the month we see no discernible difference. I will continue to daily apply and see if it just takes more than 30 days to demonstrate a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the meantime, I cannot say that it doesn&#x27;t work but neither do I have any evidence that for me it does anything. At this time, I do not recommend, but I will continue to faithfully use it until my bottle runs out. If anything changes in my perception of SK-II Facial Treatment Essence I will come back here and edit my review.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like it, but like many other reviewers, I expected more. However, I have no complains. I&#x27;m not huge on knowing about ingredients and such, because hey, if it helps me look prettier and it&#x27;s safe to use, I&#x27;m all for it. It&#x27;s liquid and has a placid smell. I&#x27;ve been softly slapping it on my face every morning after cleansing, and my skin has felt softer and looks smooth, but no drastic changes or improvements. I wish I could say my tone has evened out or that I look younger. I will keep using it as I am and update if there are any changes. I do think it&#x27;s incredibly pricey.</li>
            <li> Really not necessary. I&#x27;ll use it but not reorder it.</li>
            <li> My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SK-II is a well-known, high-end skin care line and I was excited to give it a try.  This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  Does it replace your toner or do you use it after your toner?  I had to go online to the company&#x27;s website to do a little research.  You apply this product to clean skin.  You can use a cotton pad or pat it into the skin with your hands.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there&#x27;s no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  I experience no stinging, redness, irritation or breakouts.  This does leave my skin feeling a little tight, and I follow up with my usual daytime moisturizer and nighttime retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily) I have to say that I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  Now I&#x27;m pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that what I&#x27;m using is effective and I&#x27;m not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Pleasant and easy to use; no unwanted side effects but also no noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product?  Hard to say.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I&#x27;ve read online testimonials by women who swear by this stuff.  Since it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I can&#x27;t be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.</li>
            <li> This product had a strike against it before I ever took it out of the box: There were no instructions on how to use it.  Not on the box, not on the bottle.  And the instructions on the product’s website were different from those on the product’s Amazon page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product’s Amazon page says that it “Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and significantly improves skin texture, firmness and radiance.” I’ve used more than half the bottle now, and I can’t see any difference in my skin.  None.  There has been no reduction in my fine lines, no change in firmness or texture, and I’m not any more radiant than I was.  The best I can say is that the product doesn’t seem to have hurt me; there haven’t been any more breakouts, no blotchiness, no allergic reactions.  It’s done…nothing.  It’s just an extra (and very expensive) step in my skin care routine and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t recommend this to anyone.  Save your money.  For this price, you can get a professional facial at a good spa/salon that would probably do you much more good.</li>
            <li> I have been using SKII twice a day for 2 ½ weeks, without benefit. The application of the water-like, clear, unscented fluid is pleasant, and for a few seconds my skin feels smoother (like with a water glow).  But then there is no improvement, and the red spots on my face, artifacts of adult acne, soon start looking a bit redder and more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost and reputation of SKII Facial Treatment Essence, I kept expecting marvelous results –softer skin, fewer lines (I&#x27;m in my 60s), hopefully fewer signs of the aging that only began to show the past few years. I certainly didn&#x27;t expect my skin to look a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having researched SKI-II products, I learned that they were developed in Asia for Asian skin types. Maybe because I am a natural blonde with a somewhat pink, ruddy complexion this product doesn&#x27;t work for me. After all, I don&#x27;t want the rosy color in my face to be magnifiedl, but rather diminished. Previously, I had had even worse results with products containing salicylic acid, a frequently used ingredient for improving complexions, but as I discovered, not recommended for reddish blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that different products work with different skin types, and that often the only way to know if a product will improve your skin&#x27;s appearance is to try it. The most economical option is then, of course, to buy the smallest bottle or tube available, but enough to use for at least a two-week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regard to my own experience with SKII facial treatment essence, I was quite disbelieving – almost to the point of being stunned – that no instructions for use comes with the bottle – and no list of ingredients or information of any kind. Initially, I thought the Amazon or the distributor omitted this information by mistake, until I read Amazon reviews that indicated that other recipients had the same experience. Why at over $100 a bottle the manufacturer or distributor can&#x27;t afford to provide instructions or information, or doesn&#x27;t care enough about customers&#x27; satisfaction or their correct use of the product to desire to be helpful to them and therefore receive positive reviews in return, astounds me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using this product, I began to wonder if SKII facial treatment essence  is a rip-off and a scam. But other recipients and users claim to find it beneficial, so it probably is for some complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those people buying this product, and wish to know its ingredients and how to apply it, here is some information I found (mostly on the SKII web site) that may be of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS – 90% pitera (a blend of vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, although the specific ones don&#x27;t appear to be indicated anywhere, and some sites claim that these ingredients are produced during the fermentation of rice), galoctomyces ferment filtrate, butylene and pentylene glycol (both which some claim can irritate sensitive and blemished skin),  water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, and sorbic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - &amp;#34;Sprinkle the amount of a teaspoon into the palms of the hands. Spread across hands up to the fingertips. Press into the skin gently, making sure the essence is being soaked all over the face and neck. Use twice daily for best results.&amp;#34;instructions or information, or doesn&#x27;t care enough about customers&#x27; satisfaction or their correct use of the product to desire to be helpful to them and therefore receive positive reviews in return, astounds me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using this product, I began to wonder if SKII facial treatment essence  is a rip-off and a scam. But other recipients and users claim to find it beneficial, so it probably is for some complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those people buying this product, and wish to know its ingredients and how to apply it, here is some information I found (mostly on the SKII web site) that may be of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS – 90% pitera (a blend of vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, although the specific ones don&#x27;t appear to be indicated anywhere, and some sites claim that these ingredients are produced during the fermentation of rice), galoctomyces ferment filtrate, butylene and pentylene glycol (both which some claim can irritate sensitive and blemished skin),  water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, and sorbic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - &amp;#34;Sprinkle the amount of a teaspoon into the palms of the hands.

            <li> This facial treatment really works.  After three weeks of usage my face feels so much softer and smoother.  My skin is moist which is great because I always struggle with dry skin.  This is making a big difference.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference on wrinkles yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that if you follow the directions, this is a time consuming process.  You&#x27;re supposed to leave it on your face for two minutes each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I have seen this in stores but it was a little too pricey for me. When this arrived in my queue, I had to try it. I already have nice skin, so I do not see any difference as yet. I have been using it for only a short time, however. I have not have any negative reaction. I watched a YouTube video about it. At least I can continue to use my own moisturizer with this product, so that is a plus. I ordered a travel size kit so I can keep using this while on the road. I would not want someone at a security checkpoint trying to confiscate this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 03/13/15: I had a nasty heat rash on my neck that left a large and obvious dark welt around my neck. Using this product has reduced the discoloration much faster than if I had just used moisturizer. I am definitely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin (makes skin feel tauter). I really like the feel and scent (pretty fragrance free) too. After a few weeks, seems like pores are smaller and skin feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative? Definitely pricey! But don&#x27;t know or havent tried anything that felt or worked better.</li>
            <li> Goes on comfortably... feels cool on the skin.  No irritation or bad reaction.  After a week, the skin feels and looks noticeably smoother.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!  I wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and SK-II Facial Treatment Essence has been a good moisturizer.  It is really light and goes on easily and quickly. My skin absorbs it right away. The fragrance is very mild, almost non-existent, and it fades almost immediately. My skin feels soft and smooth as soon as it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t noticed any difference in my wrinkles during the month I’ve been using it and I’m not sure the product does much exfoliating, but I’ve been really pleased with how my skin feels. It isn’t as dry, It looks and feels smooth. It just seems healthier since I’ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I used SK II morning and evening for 1 full yr faithfully I can honestly say it made no difference. I&#x27;m 40 yrs old w pre-mature aging skin I eat healthy and I&#x27;m active. My skin looks exactly the same. I purchased this at costco when they had gotten it in, and heard a lot about it. Currently looking for a less expensive brand to use. Save your money. This one is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, 2.5 fl. oz. was my favorite product. It is enriched with more than 90% Pitera. Additionally, the SK-II Facial Treatment Essence has vitamins, amino acids, minerals and some organic aides which are added to help promote health skin cells and aid in the skin cell renewal cycle. The website states that with daily application the essence helps improve the texture of the skin. I have to agree with it. It also helped clear up my skin and improve the tone of my skin around my mouth and cheek area. I found it easiest to use by pouring a very small amount onto the back of my hand and patting it onto my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure I notice a difference but when I use it, my skin seems to be tighter and fuller.  I had been thinking that it was the combination of this product and the other products I&#x27;m using - but could be just this!  :  )</li>
            <li> --&gt; So what is this \\&quot;pitera\\&quot; stuff that SK-II markets as it&#x27;s unique active ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;Pitera is promoted as the \\&quot;secret key\\&quot; to this cosmetic- thus the \\&quot;sk\\&quot; in the product name. It is a byproduct of the yeast fermentation process of a specific strand of yeast used in Japanese sake production. (Yeast products are common in cosmetics, but most are developed from beer.) Pitera was initially marketed in the form of this clear, watery, extraordinarily expensive \\&quot;essence\\&quot;, and benefit claims over time have included increasing the skin&#x27;s metabolism and regeneration rate, helping the skin retain moisture, smoothing skin texture, minimizing dark spots and helping reduce acne. The question is, does it work, and is it any better than other cosmetics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&gt;  Why are so many people buying SK-II products?&lt;br /&gt;It may be because of celebrity endorsements or the mistaken idea that \\&quot;if it costs more it must be better\\&quot;. It may also be because of the sweet and hopeful story behind the product. Who could fail to be charmed by a story of elderly sake factory workers whose faces were wrinkled but hands remained youthful? The company website has a lovely children&#x27;s fairytale style commercial with this story at http://www.sk-ii.com/about-us-miracle.html#a-journey-back . Pitera is presented as the result of an attempt to replicate the material the workers&#x27; hands were in contact with all day long. Purchasers seem to ignore the fact that in cosmetic form the user&#x27;s contact with this product is brief and miniscule/does not begin to approach the level of all-day hands-on contact with fermented yeast the sake workers would have experienced. (Is it possible that the demographic this product is marketed to simply has no idea what hard hands-on physical work is like, so they can&#x27;t understand the difference between their small daub or splash of \\&quot;essence\\&quot; and a worker&#x27;s grueling hours of work, day after day, year after year, with hands repeatedly reaching into vats of sticky fermented yeast/covered with a thick coating of it for hours through a work day???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&gt; Product facts&lt;br /&gt;Significantly, this is the largest selling \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; cosmetic in Asia (even inspiring a huge problem with counterfeit products sold in China which happened to be contaminated with dangerous levels of heavy metals). SK-II has now been purchased by American giant Proctor and Gamble, and is one of a small group of P &amp; G products that has achieved more than a billion dollars in annual sales. This is surely due to the extraordinary prices of SK-II products in addition to sales volume (with even the basic 11 oz \\&quot;essence\\&quot; waters selling for $290 on the SK-II website, and this 2.5 fl. oz bottle selling here for $105 ). Clearly, the charm of the pitera story has led many, many people to \\&quot;drink the Koolaid\\&quot;, or more kindly put to have hope and place their faith in a very clever marketing campaign and the idea of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; fountain of youth (although many SK-II products are loaded down with chemical additives of all sorts). The company website includes some research links and reviews, but after reading it and many other online resources related to the pitera ingredients and SK-II products, I am not convinced that these products are good for all skin types or that they work as claimed in the tiny doses these products deliver (we are not talking about a product priced at a level which would allow purchasers to soak hands or face in it, bathe in it, etc,-- we are talking about the impact of just a few drops on the skin). If this was an inexpensive brand, I would say why not try this \\&quot;essence\\&quot; product, which contains 90% pitera, and experiment for yourself for 6 months or a year (which would require multiple bottles). However, given the fact that using even 3-4 SK-II products could cost as much as a home mortgage, experimenting makes no sense except for those for whom money is no object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&gt;  Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is clear whether or not this product is working or might work over the very long term.  To apply it, users pour a small amount of what is essentially water into a cupped hand, spread it along the hands, and then press hands against the face.

            <li> I’ve been using this serum for about 10 days and I like it.  I am 41, have oily skin, and love spending time in the sun.  I have lots of skin goodies at my disposal – everything from basic scrubs to Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very light, only slightly thicker than water.  I sprinkle drops onto my hand and smooth it in.  Using it an avg of 1.5x per day, I’d say this bottle will last me 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- my pores do not look smaller width-wise, but they do seem shallower.  This makes my skin feel smoother and makeup looks better.&lt;br /&gt;- for oily skin this stuff is great.  I can feel like I’m doing something for my skin without getting greasy.  It goes on very light-feeling.  I think ppl with dry skin would need to use a moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;- hardly any scent, and does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- dispensing method is awkward.  It kind of drips out, but you have to shake it and can’t control the flow.&lt;br /&gt;- price!  But that’s just the way it goes when looking for skin fixes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison products:&lt;br /&gt;- Retin-A:  I have Retin-A micro and SK-II is nothing like that.  Retin-A is not useable on a daily basis for me, it would burn my skin off!  If I overuse Retin-A by putting it on a few days in a row, I get very dry scaly skin and that lasts a few days.&lt;br /&gt;SK-II can be used 2x per day and I have not had any dry, scaly skin but my skin is slightly sensitive when I use my clarisonic brush.  This makes me think it is doing a good job in the exfoliating arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Strivectin-A:  I’ve used this for about a year on a nightly basis.  It is a thicker cream and as crazy as it sounds, is good for oily skin.  This cream is probably 10% as potent as Retin-A.  I can feel its effects if I use it day and night, but over the course of a year I don’t see that it has made any difference.  I mainly use it in between Retin-A applications because it is oily-skin friendly.  Now that I’ve found thisSK-II serum, I will use the SK-II during the day and alternate SK-II and Strivectin at night on non-Retin-A days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to purchase this because how friendly it is to oily skin.  I do like that my pores appear shallower – this is something I have not seen reliably with other products.</li>
            <li> Evaluating this SK-II Facial Treatment is a bit of an enigma. Why? Because it seems to have a subtle, definite benefit but the science and cost are more than a little questionable. First impression is that it&#x27;s little more than water with a modicum of active ingredient and a vague fragrance. Applying it to the face produces a minor tingling and feels refreshing, not unlike a conventional toner as, say witch hazel. There are no guidelines printed on the packaging or on the container itself. You simply assume a small amount is shaken out into the palm of your hand and then dabbed onto your face. Logic would imply it should be applied to a freshly cleaned face so facial oils will not impede it&#x27;s absorption. A small amount goes a long way and if used twice a day, say, morning and evening, it seems to be enough to last perhaps 2 months.  The story line for the entire SK (Secret Key) line of products is that it was noticed that elderly workers in a sake factory had their hands exposed to certain fermenting yeasts daily and the result was that their hands remained youthful, contrasting to their aged wrinkled faces. This has a compelling and scientific ring to it since active agents like enzymes and yeasts do promote profound changes to things they&#x27;re exposed to. But the reality is that those workers had continuous contact for hours each day to vast quantities of any active ingredients and weren&#x27;t dabbing on a tiny amount once or twice each day, which immediately raises an eyebrow if not a red flag as well. I used the product for 3 weeks, just adding it to my normal routine before writing a review, to ascertain if there were any noticeable differences. There were. As most users have likewise mentioned, it gives the skin a noticeable glow. SK&#x27;s online presence, claims this product has a balancing effect and encourages exfoliation. Removing the appearance dulling dead skin cells on the skin&#x27;s surface would naturally have this brightening effect. It should quickly be noted, that exfoliation is achieved through other less mystifying ways. Lightly massaging VERY mild abrasives against the skin, loosens and sluffs off dead cells.  I like Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, which is a rice based powder but includes other excellent ingredients, though it&#x27;s an expensive product as well. An economic alternative, costing just pennies, if you&#x27;re adventurous and hands on, is grinding some brown rice or coffee beans to a very fine powder in a good blender like a Vitamix, which takes only seconds to produce a substantial supply. Mix a small amount with a little water or even lemon juice if wanting to lighten spots and gently massage onto skin. An easier option still is just buying organic rice flour. It&#x27;s very fine and can be used daily as a gentle exfoliant with the benefits the rice imparts. An alternative to this mechanical removal, is loosening the grip of dead skin cells chemically, most notably by mild acid products containing glycolic or salicylic acid.  After experimenting, I personally like Topix Pharm Glycolix Elite Facial Cream 20%. (It should quickly be added that using these acid products requires acclimating the skin by using weaker concentrations, 5% then 10% then if needed and preferred 20%.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What then is the impression and verdict in my individual experience with SK-II?  I like the product and believe it produces subtle, visible results. If this was a third or fourth the price ( and not $5376 a gallon, based on the $105 for 2.5 oz price;  Please let me know if my math is incorrect.), it would still be expensive for what it is, but would easily be a 4 or 5 star recommendation as many of its loyal adherents now laud it. It seems fair to say that this Japanese product line (Now owned by Proctor and Gamble) relies on a quaint and endearing sake worker, miracle discovery persona, to justify a grossly overpriced toner. The same results can be achieved with premium priced, though still far less expensive products. More modestly priced products like glycolic acid lotions, or minimally expensive DIY products like powdered brown rice used as a gentle exfoliant, should all provide a similarly glowing complexion. There&#x27;s a human tendency to want to believe in mystical secrets unlocked and packaged in expensive small vials. SK-II isn&#x27;t snake oil but is an effective toner. But it might be considered in the same class as home entertainment, HDMI cables that some companies sold for hundreds of dollars for a mere 18 inches that now sell for a few dollars and arguably are equally effective. You&#x27;re getting results promoted as exotic and almost mystical that are attainable at a tiny fraction of the cost. It seems infinitely more sensible and cost effective, no matter what your disposable income situation is, to try a glycolic acid cream or a mild rice based exfoliant product. With the price difference you can buy, among other things, a nice bottle of sake to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Note: I see some fans of the product are saying my comments are not helpful. Apologies to anyone who feels slighted. I emphasize again that I do like the product and it is effective at giving the skin a glow. Two stars may seem a harsh rating, but it is strictly based on it&#x27;s value compared to other products priced much more affordably that promote exfoliation.ed products like glycolic acid lotions, or minimally expensive DIY products like powdered brown rice used as a gentle exfoliant, should all provide a similarly glowing complexion.

            <li> I received this facial treatment for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  The only thing I can say about this item is that it had no negative effect on my skin.  This fluid has the consistency of water.  In fact, there is no way to distinguish it from water.  It is colorless, odorless, and from the bit I got on my lips, it is tasteless.  It did nothing at all for my skin except make it wet for a short period of time.  My brown spots didn&#x27;t fade. My fine lines didn&#x27;t decrease.  The good news is that I didn&#x27;t break out from using it (which is why I didn&#x27;t give it the one star hate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I would like see some kind of results.  I have tried much less expensive products that have provided visible results, so I can&#x27;t recommend this one.  I wish I could be more positive.</li>
            <li> There has been no change in my skin. I will not purchase another SK-II product!</li>
            <li> With the high price tag and time it takes to see some result, make sure you have some patience with this product.  I am surprised that the only instruction for this treatment is the video that you see on top of the Amazon page.  Another issue is the dispensing of the product: You have to carefully pour it from a plastic hole without allow any drops on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you should see some results within a week such as tightening of the pores, the question is whether or not it is cost-effective to keep buying more bottles after the initial one?  Tread carefully!</li>
            <li> I’m usually very skeptical about the promise of renewed youth, better looking skin, and overall improved appearance from a beauty product, especially a very expensive one.  However, I must say that this watery substance has, over the last 3 weeks, made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin.  I’m going to sound like a commercial here but here goes:  my skin does look smoother, more even, and my lines look less defined. I’m not saying that it took 10 years off my face, but I can definitely notice a change for the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the price, wow! $105.00 for 2.5 ounces. I received this bottle for free in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I really like it, but do I like it enough to purchase my next bottle at full price? Probably not. If it were not for the ridiculous price I would give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is very fluid, like water as I anticipated.  The smell was not bad I was expecting a more chemical like smell but the scent was fine.  My face felt a little sticky after initial applications.  I had some breakouts which seem to be consistent with many users . I have noticed softer skin but no change yet in firmness and physical appearanceof skin.. I will update review after finishing bottle if any changes.</li>
            <li> While my skin felt a little softer and smoother after using this for a month, I question if it is really worth as much as they charge for it.&lt;br /&gt;The package contains no instructions, but the product description I was given instructed me to wipe my face with a cotton ball moistened with the product, twice a day, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> The SK-II Facial Treatment Essence, 2.5 fl. oz bottle that I received came with no instructions or literature of any kind. After searching online for a little while, I got the low down on how to use the product, but It seems to me for the price this treatment sells for they could have included a sheet of information. In the past few years I have started to notice fine lines around the corners of my eyes and above my smile lines. Each night I put a few drops of this treatment on the balls of by fingers and massage it into those areas. After three weeks I did notice that the area seemed to be a little smother and the fine lines slightly less pronounced.  While I must admit I did notice a slight improvement this product seems Awfully Expensive for The Improvement I noticed.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a about a month now. There were no instructions with the packaging, so she was not sure if it is a night product, day, or both. She uses it at night, after washing her face but before applying moisturizer. She reports that it is a very light liquid, almost watery. She shakes four or five drops into my palm, then dab it onto my face and upper chest. She doesn&#x27;t feel anything when she applies it and reports that is is not moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t feel like a toner either. She see no changes to her skin. It has not aggravated the redness that she has, but it has not decreased it either. She will keep using it, in case it helps over a longer period.</li>
