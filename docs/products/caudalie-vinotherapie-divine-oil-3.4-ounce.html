            <li>I love it, because its not over powering</li>
            <li>I love how this oil keeps my skin moisturized ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I JUST received mine in the mail</li>
            <li>Fantastic and luxurious this OIL is!  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>This is the best winter moisturizer I have found for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so well that I purchased a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light once absorbed and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Best buy for trouble skin</li>
            <li>I give a few sprays every morning and then again every evening to feel beautiful going to bed!</li>
            <li>I think it is worth a try and would make a lovely gift.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t your skin worth it? :)</li>
            <li>and it was love at first whiff.</li>
            <li>The aroma is so subtle and delightful as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a decent oil except I can&#x27;t use it coz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>it gives your skin a healthy glow and it has a nice fragrance that becomes very settle shortly after.</li>
            <li>and she says she found her new favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>Skin is very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I of course had to order her a large bottle since it takes a lot for her to love a product that much.</li>
            <li>As a piano teacher I always want my hands to look, and feel smooth,  This really does what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely prefer the smell of Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame Body Oil to this</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil smells much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Caudalie Divine oil is in a spray bottle, which is far more convenient.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on how I smell when I use this oil and compliments on having soft skin to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that Caudalie has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, the scent alone is already well worth the price.</li>
            <li>nothing comes out of the spray ( the same kind of spray in a perfume bottle)  </li>
            <li>I use it right after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The spray makes it easy to apply, and although I live in fear of dropping the glass bottle,  I haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell and penetrate rapidly in the skin, which leaves a soft and dry feeling.</li>
            <li>in all I like this oil since it smells nice and is a solid all-around moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Especially useful for that dry winter skin!  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soft and silky smooth with no greasy buildup.  </li>
            <li>One spray is more than enough</li>
            <li>The smell alone reminds me of France that is when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>and it is has a very convenient spray nozzle so you can spray exactly where you want.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil delivers exactly the same moisturizing benefits as Caudalie Divine Oil.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; note is too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my co-worker for recommending this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, soothing, and moisturizing all at the same time.</li>
            <li>far as the product is concerned, I like it however, it isn&#x27;t worth $49.</li>
            <li>This is just a very spoil me rotten</li>
            <li>I even did the \\&quot;scratch test\\&quot; on my skin, where I lightly scrape the surface of my skin the next day after applying the product the night before just to check for any dryness.  </li>
            <li>Well I didn&#x27;t and really regret it.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add much shine or softness though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be extra special oil</li>
            <li>She is so pleased and all the dry spots on her face are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin; very oily face in the summer and super dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, subtle scent which is in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil is less expensive and more readily available (Target, drug stores, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>When I was shopping in Paris a week ago, I found this exact product (same size) for 21 euros which was equivalent to about $27.</li>
            <li>typically use Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame body oil as my go-to choice.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed a little on my wrist, and it&#x27;s dried down to a gorgeous, rich vanilla floral scent that I can&#x27;t stop sniffing.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and silky and yet does not leave an oily feel on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle took me about a 6-9months to finish, so 3.4oz does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>My issue with it is that I have sensitive, eczema-prone skin that immediately reacted to the product.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this was so much more here when other Caudalie products do not have such an extreme price point</li>
            <li>If you spray on recently showered skin, it sinks right in and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>I think that the scent is very relaxing especially after a long shower.</li>
            <li>I can usually only make it 1 or 2 weeks after a haircut before getting a headful of split ends, but so far it&#x27;s been 2 months since my last cut</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is worth the money, though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sensitive, so I have to be careful about which products to use on my face &amp; body (including cosmetics, soaps, metals, etc.).  </li>
            <li>While I wish that the bottle was larger so the contents would last longer, this mild complaint would not keep me from religiously using this product.  </li>

            <li> It only takes a little bit of oil to do a massive amount of work, this bottle is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> I expected the same from this product, which it delivered.  </li>
            <li> My mom has always suffered from VERY dry skin, then she got a sample of this product in her Birchbox for May</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I tend to use it sparingly, alternating between this and other body moisturizers.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, other reviews raved about the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews that said that the oil spray wouldn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is a bonus as it allows you to apply the oil with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> Something smells off compared to the previous bottles I have purchased from other vendors</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way (I&#x27;ve only used 1/4 the bottle in 3 months), but I still wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> so I spray some on my palms, moisturize my hands a little, and then pat the rest onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually I find products abroad to be about 20% less than what I would pay here.</li>
            <li> I just received the product, and upon opening, found that the sprayer was loose in the cap, making it impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and hoping for resolution since it shows that the item can&#x27;t be returned.</li>

            <li> My mom has always suffered from VERY dry skin, then she got a sample of this product in her Birchbox for May and she says she found her new favorite beauty product. I of course had to order her a large bottle since it takes a lot for her to love a product that much. She is so pleased and all the dry spots on her face are almost completely gone. It only takes a little bit of oil to do a massive amount of work, this bottle is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> Love it! The scent is nice and light. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it on my hair, face and body.</li>
            <li> The oil is beautiful.  It goes on smoothly, hydrates wonderfully &amp; has a divine smell.  It was recommended by my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!  Easy to apply spray, keeps your skin soft and smells great!  The bottle is glass so caution is needed if applying in shower.</li>
            <li> Too oily for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I had a massage recently with this product at a spa. Loved it so looked it up so I could use it every day. I would give it a 5 star but I don&#x27;t like that it is a spray. Would rather a top I could just pour out what I want.  The scent is very nice, not over powering.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs nicely and leaves skin smooth. The scent is overpowering for me. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; note is too much for my liking. I gave it to my mom as I can&#x27;t make myself using it. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it right after I get out of the shower.  It keeps my skin soft and silky and yet does not leave an oily feel on the skin.  It has a nice, subtle scent which is in no way overpowering.  This product is definitely a favorite of mine. Especially useful for that dry winter skin!  It&#x27;s heaven.  The spray makes it easy to apply, and although I live in fear of dropping the glass bottle,  I haven&#x27;t.  My first bottle took me about a 6-9months to finish, so 3.4oz does go a long way.  Price definitely better on amazon then sephora, etc.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product, but it some really good stuff.  I was glad that I purchased it and have been using it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. It softens and tones my skin. Best buy for trouble skin</li>
            <li> As a piano teacher I always want my hands to look, and feel smooth,  This really does what I want it to do.  Divine Oil is not greasy.  That is another perk.  The aroma is so subtle and delightful as well.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the oil as a Christmas gift.  I loved it so well that I purchased a large bottle.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I am preparing to order one for my mother for her birthday. Thanks to my co-worker for recommending this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light, the oil is incredible. You can use it all over your body. I am planning on having this as my &amp;#34;avoid stretch marks&amp;#34; product while preggo.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and penetrate rapidly in the skin, which leaves a soft and dry feeling. My issue with it is that I have sensitive, eczema-prone skin that immediately reacted to the product. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! It&#x27;s light, soothing, and moisturizing all at the same time. I think that the scent is very relaxing especially after a long shower. I also use this oil before bed so that the scent remains on my bedsheets. I am looking forward to taking this to the beach, it seems like it would complement the ocean air and sand. The only downside is that it is very pricey. With that in mind, I tend to use it sparingly, alternating between this and other body moisturizers. The spray nozzle is a bonus as it allows you to apply the oil with minimal mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so wonderful and feels so luxurious on your skin.  I give a few sprays every morning and then again every evening to feel beautiful going to bed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this body oil, expecting to be impressed, simply because the review for it are so good.  However, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame body oil as my go-to choice.  I LOVE THE SCENT of it and it leaves my skin soft and silky smooth with no greasy buildup.  I expected the same from this product, which it delivered.  HOWEVER, other reviews raved about the scent of this product.  IT DOES NOT SMELL SO GREAT.  I absolutely prefer the smell of Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Sesame Body Oil to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while both deliver a great body oil in terms of its purpose, there are 4 factors which set them apart:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil is less expensive and more readily available (Target, drug stores, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil delivers exactly the same moisturizing benefits as Caudalie Divine Oil.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil smells much better.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Caudalie Divine oil is in a spray bottle, which is far more convenient.</li>
            <li> This is the best winter moisturizer I have found for dry skin.  If you spray on recently showered skin, it sinks right in and stays all day.  I get more compliments on how I smell when I use this oil and compliments on having soft skin to the touch.  While I wish that the bottle was larger so the contents would last longer, this mild complaint would not keep me from religiously using this product.  I also love the fact that Caudalie has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the oil and it is has a very convenient spray nozzle so you can spray exactly where you want.  I am not sure it is worth the money, though.  I think it is worth a try and would make a lovely gift.  I do not understand the &amp;#34;divine&amp;#34; label.  I thought it was going to be extra special oil but it is not noticeably different that baby oil.</li>
            <li> When I was shopping in Paris a week ago, I found this exact product (same size) for 21 euros which was equivalent to about $27. Usually I find products abroad to be about 20% less than what I would pay here. I don&#x27;t understand why this was so much more here when other Caudalie products do not have such an extreme price point difference.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product is concerned, I like it however, it isn&#x27;t worth $49. Even $27 is a stretch for what it is.</li>
            <li> This is just a very spoil me rotten kinda of things to get. Its really nice.. I love it and see myself bathing in it for the rest of the summer.. it gives your skin a healthy glow and it has a nice fragrance that becomes very settle shortly after. I love it, because its not over powering and I can still wear my perfume without it getting lost.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin; very oily face in the summer and super dry in the winter.  It&#x27;s also very sensitive, so I have to be careful about which products to use on my face &amp; body (including cosmetics, soaps, metals, etc.).  I love how this oil keeps my skin moisturized ALL DAY.  It&#x27;s very light once absorbed and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  The spray dispenses a good amount of product without any drips or messes which is genius.  I even did the \\&quot;scratch test\\&quot; on my skin, where I lightly scrape the surface of my skin the next day after applying the product the night before just to check for any dryness.  Passed it with flying colors! I&#x27;ve used this on my face and body and it does wonders for skin tone (note: Do not apply around the eyes... YEEE-OUCH!).  Skin is very smooth and soft.  By the way, this oil smells sooooooooo good! Bottom line: If you have the $$$ to splurge on your skin, definitely try this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey but you get what you pay for.  Isn&#x27;t your skin worth it? :)</li>
            <li> Ok, I JUST received mine in the mail and it was love at first whiff. This oil smells absolutely incredible. I sprayed a little on my wrist, and it&#x27;s dried down to a gorgeous, rich vanilla floral scent that I can&#x27;t stop sniffing. I&#x27;m obsessed. I&#x27;m using this as a perfume, but I&#x27;m going to try it on my face and hair tonight. However, the scent alone is already well worth the price. Truly divine!</li>
            <li> Caudalie Divine Oil is Formulated WITHOUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Parabens&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;- Phthalates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And DOES NOT contain animal ingredients and is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I just decided to use this oil now that my Carita body oil finished... I should have listened to other reviews that said that the oil spray wouldn&#x27;t work... Well I didn&#x27;t and really regret it. I am sure it&#x27;s a decent oil except I can&#x27;t use it coz nothing comes out of the spray ( the same kind of spray in a perfume bottle)  I keep trying and trying and it just doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not a twist off cap so there&#x27;s no way to get to the oil short of breaking the glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic and luxurious this OIL is!  The smell is heavenly and my skin is so much softer. Love the spray application!</li>
            <li> Saw this advertised on the week-end news.  It is not greasy and light and refreshing.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my face and hair after showering.  On my face, I like that it gives me a dewy glow without being overly greasy.  One spray is more than enough so I spray some on my palms, moisturize my hands a little, and then pat the rest onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot fewer split ends - I can usually only make it 1 or 2 weeks after a haircut before getting a headful of split ends, but so far it&#x27;s been 2 months since my last cut and I can&#x27;t find any.  It doesn&#x27;t really add much shine or softness though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like this oil since it smells nice and is a solid all-around moisturizer.  A little does go a long way (I&#x27;ve only used 1/4 the bottle in 3 months), but I still wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> The smell alone reminds me of France that is when I first bought it. I love this oil.</li>
            <li> Divine Oil sounds wonderful, so I asked my husband to pick me up a bottle while in France.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the atomizer on mine doesn&#x27;t work.. so I may never know how wonderful or divine this product really is.&lt;br /&gt;He and I have both contacted Caudalie to no avail, they have been contacted a total of three times.  I give up and they get to keep my money, but I&#x27;ll never buy another bottle...  so we both lose. I have a $50. Bottle of Divine Oil I can only look at because Caudalie has no cutomer support and seems unwilling to respond to this problem with their product.</li>
            <li> I just received the product, and upon opening, found that the sprayer was loose in the cap, making it impossible to use.  Very disappointed and hoping for resolution since it shows that the item can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> Something smells off compared to the previous bottles I have purchased from other vendors</li>
