            <li>lol i cant really explain it</li>
            <li>lol I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>I bought this under the impression it would give my hair that cute &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; look, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so lightweight that I can have my &#x27;poofy&#x27; hair again WITHOUT any static electricity.</li>
            <li>This smelled horrible.....did not cause any shine or &amp;#34;radience&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>so it sprays more evenly.  </li>
            <li>It also coats fine hair to give it more volume and texture.</li>
            <li>love Nature&#x27;s Rescue Radiant Sea Spray, I have fine hair and this gives it body</li>
            <li>Light hold if anything.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean, love the scent release aspect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a really cool product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it gives hair great texture and scent.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff, smells sooo unbelievably yummy</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and this really did nothing for  me.</li>
            <li>The whole Nature&#x27;s Rescue line from Redken is amazing, thy have a product that actually exfoliates your hair!</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way as well so great by for the price, will buy again!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin and gets static electricity if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like the whole Nature&#x27;s Rescue line, except for this.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just using too much, but I don&#x27;t see the point of this product</li>
            <li>I was expecting a natural aromatic fresh mist to use on my hair as if I just came out of shower.</li>
            <li>Probably the first in a new wave of products that are scents made specifically for your hair.</li>
            <li>But the scent was too cheap and not very natural.</li>
            <li>Gives my short hair cut right amount of body!</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a long time and your hair will feel fantastic-</li>
            <li>Just like you came back from a day at the beach, only smelling better.</li>
            <li>and when I spray this in my hair, it leaves it kind of sticky and hard to run a brush through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a hair spray as far as providing hold.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, the spray actually works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know maybe I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>redken natures rescue saved my hair having been using for 5 months now my hair is back to normal thankgod for redken</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look wet.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful of how much I use.</li>
            <li>But every other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, even those for fine hair, weighs my hair down and keeps it from holding a style.  </li>

            <li> the best smell ever goes perfect with the shampoo and conditioner had a bad perm had to cut my long hair off to a pixie cut my hair was destroyed redken natures rescue saved my hair having been using for 5 months now my hair is back to normal thankgod for redken</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today. I sprayed some on my dry hair and it works wonders. It softened my hair and now every time I run my fingers through my hair a wonderful oceany scent. I will definitely be buying this product again. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t give a greasy look or feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff, smells sooo unbelievably yummy and you can smell it on your hair all day long. I received so many compliments on the smell of this stuff! A little goes a long way as well so great by for the price, will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and effective at giving volume to my hair. i recommend it very enthusiastically and am disappointed it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this! It lasts a long time too. A little goes a long way. So don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will look wet.</li>
            <li> I like the whole Nature&#x27;s Rescue line, except for this. I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what this was for. I thought it would be a sort of leave-in conditioner/detangler. The scent is wonderful and the only reason it gets 3 stars. I just love the smell. Reminds me of L&#x27;eau de Issey by Issey Miyake, one of my favorite fragrances. Not overpowering, just a light, fresh scent. But this line is supposed to be a detox and residue remover and when I spray this in my hair, it leaves it kind of sticky and hard to run a brush through. Maybe I&#x27;m just using too much, but I don&#x27;t see the point of this product so not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good. It smells like hmm beachy? lol i cant really explain it but it smells really good. My friends always comment and say what are you wearing? you smell so good! Even after i work out my friend was like how does your hair STILL smell good? lol I really recommend this. Also it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I got tired of having to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my hair every day. I bought this under the impression it would give my hair that cute &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; look, but it didn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t do anything except smell really good. I was disappointed because I feel redken would have a product which would have worked better, but it could also just be how my hair is. Unfortunately, i would not buy this again for the stated use, although i may use a few sprays in damp hair just to give it a good smell.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair smell beautiful. People have noticed!  It also coats fine hair to give it more volume and texture.</li>
            <li> I love this spray , it makes my hair so soft, and smells amazing!!!! Why did they stop making it?!</li>
            <li> Love it! Gives my short hair cut right amount of body!</li>
            <li> I use this product by either spraying it all over, covering my entire head, or I&#x27;ll spray about 8-10 pumps into my palm, rub my hands together briefly then saturate my hair with it.  It&#x27;s not a hair spray as far as providing hold.  Light hold if anything.  It sort of thickens your hair and just makes it smell amazing.  The whole Nature&#x27;s Rescue line from Redken is amazing, thy have a product that actually exfoliates your hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It smells great and has a good feel to it. It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product. Probably the first in a new wave of products that are scents made specifically for your hair. It really does give you a wave of scent every time you move and the smell is very pleasant and ocean-y. Kinda floral. I really love it and I imagine it would be a great way to refresh your hair after being in a smoky club or bar or after the gym. My only gripe is that it makes my hair look sort of greasy. I have to be careful of how much I use.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair.  this product is like a day at the beach on my hair.  More body and control.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair sticky or hard. Wonderful product to refresh your hair when you don&#x27;t have time to wash it.  Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is very fine and thin and gets static electricity if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner. But every other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, even those for fine hair, weighs my hair down and keeps it from holding a style.  This stuff is so lightweight that I can have my &#x27;poofy&#x27; hair again WITHOUT any static electricity.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts all day though. Does add a small amount of texture and shine to my hair, but I think it&#x27;s not for someone looking for a LOT of texture. This product seems to me to be just an extra smell-good/finishing type of spray. Overall, very satisfied with it and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and this really did nothing for  me. It will sit on my shelf for a while until I pass it on to some else.</li>
            <li> I like using this spray. Much to my surprise, the spray actually works. It reminds me a great deal of [[ASIN:B00014J0T2 Bach Rescue Remedy Spray 20 ml]]. And the best part is, anyone could use it, so I do recommend it for anyone looking for a good spray.</li>
            <li> This smelled horrible.....did not cause any shine or &amp;#34;radience&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s for sure.  Could have done better&lt;br /&gt;with a Pantene or Tresamme item.  Waste of money. Threw it down the sink.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a natural aromatic fresh mist to use on my hair as if I just came out of shower. But the scent was too cheap and not very natural.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Smells fresh and clean, love the scent release aspect.&lt;br /&gt;However I do echo some other reviews regarding the spray nozzle.  It is 1 stream which doesn&#x27;t give great coverage.  I will be purchasing a small spray bottle so it sprays more evenly.  Other than that it gives hair great texture and scent.  My husband loved the way my hair looked today.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice fragrance!</li>
            <li> This product is nice, I think the scent of this spray is of preference to the person using it and applying it to their hair. For me, the smell is nice sometimes. I don&#x27;t know maybe I have a sensitive nose. But other than the contradicting scent, the shipping was great and everything was sent perfectly.</li>
            <li> The scent of this spray is just wonderful, and if you apply it to damp hair &amp; scrunch it makes the perfect beach waves. The scent lasts a long time and your hair will feel fantastic- Just like you came back from a day at the beach, only smelling better.</li>
