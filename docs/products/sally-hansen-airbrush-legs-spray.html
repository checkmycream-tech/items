            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews, it seems to me some people are just not using this product to its best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;Spraying</li>

            <li>This is a really great product I use when I wear skirts to even out any discoloration or marks on my legs.  </li>
            <li>However, I am happy I tried it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for wearing sandals.</li>
            <li>But you could get it at Walmart for the fraction of the price but still, great product.</li>
            <li>great value for the price.</li>
            <li>A great find.</li>
            <li>my opinion, all three offer great coverage.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>and I love the color!!</li>
            <li>Love this!!  </li>
            <li>This product makes my legs look healthier, very nice.</li>
            <li>and it is nice to have a good flawless glow!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and the difference is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is like make-up for your legs, great coverage and looks good</li>
            <li>Does not have any un pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>If you want to avoid suntan salons and look great, this product is light on the skin with good even coverage, but instead of spraying it on, I spray it into my hands and then apply it for the best results.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as others have written.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a good product if you could find a shade to match you.</li>
            <li>I put some on my hands then smooth it on my legs and comes out great!</li>
            <li>Then my sister told me she had heard good things about S.H. Airbrush Legs.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just challenged, but omg i could not make this look good.</li>
            <li>so do not use your good ones.</li>
            <li>I got the fair color because I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my legs look so good</li>
            <li>Mix it with some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li>I use the medium in the summer and the fair skin tone color the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with it as I did not want a brown or orange mark right there on my shin bone.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Well...I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>choose the right color as descrpition, do not choose darker one than your body color, very useful!!!!</li>
            <li>think it does an amazing job of covering my imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luv this for giving light color to my &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; skin----works great on legs, arms, neck, d√©colletage, feet.  </li>
            <li>and this spray gives them a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m the fairest of the fair, because \\&quot;light glow\\&quot; looks orange on my milky skin!</li>
            <li>It made my legs look nice except...</li>
            <li>I kind of made your legs look ashy.</li>
            <li>so make sure you exfoliate and do it after a good shower).</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot as I do not go tanning</li>
            <li>The SH Light Glow is perfect, it covers the veins and give a light matte tan to the skin.</li>
            <li>-Nice</li>
            <li>I can see that if you already have great skin on your legs this product would make the skin look very pretty and pristine.  </li>
            <li>I went for the light glow and loved it.</li>
            <li>but the most astounding thing is the the color - bright,unadulterated orange.</li>
            <li>Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring.</li>
            <li>it is easy to blend in, covers spots, and isnt orange!</li>
            <li>Great coverage that smooths out legs and makes them look pretty.</li>
            <li>it doesnt smells good, not bad</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but that was perfectly OK.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for more of a tanned look, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It covered up most of the  imperfections</li>
            <li>After applying more and more layers, eventually the veins were halfway covered, but the airbrushed leg did look orange, and as if I were wearing a stocking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looked better with some sheen.</li>
            <li>More like a rub on lotion that just happens to come in spray can</li>
            <li>with many, many &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; in evidence.</li>
            <li>Can still see age spots and veins, but they look way better.</li>
            <li>This stuff used to be a bit better than it is now.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my arms :)</li>
            <li>Then after that I rubbed on some lotion because it dries out your skin a bit and the lotion also helps it look more evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li>Even when I wear capri&#x27;s, it just makes they legs look so much better.</li>
            <li>I apply it from my toes to the nether-regions :)</li>
            <li>and I love that I can build up the color depending on if I want it darker or lighter.</li>
            <li>More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the dim light of my room, I&#x27;d say this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>My legs looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>but I find I get more uniform coverage by mixing it in my hand with body lotion--(3:1 lotion to Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Make-up)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just discovered this product at the drug store and had to have more.  </li>
            <li>The level of color makes my legs look better without any overwhelming fakeness.</li>
            <li>It stayed put and my legs looked lovely in the photos.</li>
            <li>it was just ok</li>
            <li>Perfect for pale skin if you haven&#x27;t tanned in a while and for naturally fair skinned women</li>
            <li>Works very well and is very easy to use...would recommend to anyone i who has fair skin</li>
            <li>-Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed</li>
            <li>Also make sure you spray a good distance from your skin because it comes out fast and quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and my tow pregnancies left me with one spider vein</li>
            <li>Works great, not messy, doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>However, I would recommend to mix with lotion for a more smooth and even look.</li>
            <li>GREAT natural color,</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>If one of you for whom it gave spectacular results would be so kind to post a tutorial on You Tube, or even some clear before and after pictures here on Amazon, I think you would be doing a lot of people</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>but you can easily fix that afterwards with lotion which you would want to put on anyways so that your skin is hydrated.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t run or smear comes off easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I could just as easily put neon lights around my legs like a Christmas decoration  </li>
            <li>&gt;  -Easy</li>
            <li>-Easy application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it transfers so easily.  </li>
            <li>this is fair, natural when rubbed in, healthy color for those who basically avoid sun but want to look healthier in summer.  </li>
            <li>The best Product on the Market is the Air Stocking Brand and it less money here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and my skin has gotten really light</li>
            <li>If you are looking to smooth out imperfections, cover spider veins, scars, etc.</li>
            <li>and your skin is on the light side, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light legs and this color works well for me.</li>
            <li>It works great, but I find it puzzling how people review this product and aren&#x27;t following the directions.</li>
            <li>-I am a light skinned hispanic and I am closer to neutral tones.</li>
            <li>Downright impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001R2IGEC Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Light Glow]] :&lt;br</li>
            <li>-Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs.</li>
            <li>-I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection.</li>
            <li>, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  </li>
            <li>If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>
            <li>, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  </li>
            <li>If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>
            <li>Unless your goal is to look like a cheap stripper or Ke$ha, I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>I got the light glow.  </li>
            <li>It is quite light so if u want a deeper tan, I would try medium.....</li>
            <li>The product makes the skin on my legs look even and hides light imperfections, it also lightens veins.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and no streaking.</li>
            <li>so I cannot use this for spot coverage; that&#x27;s OK though as it looks SO good when properly applied.</li>
            <li>and I also sprayed it right on in spots where I wanted more coverage - it works both ways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was really easy and quick to apply</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply it</li>
            <li>I picked this up at my local walmart and the concept is really amazing!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today, but so far, I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product so much.  </li>
            <li>I was full of hope after reading all the glowing reviews, and hurried to CVS to purchase the product.  </li>
            <li>But overall it had good coverage.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the ease of application and results.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing dresses, not to mention it way to hot in NJ to wear pants in summer.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t streak at all, and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I am super super SUPER fair skinned, and a light coat of this product makes me legs less blue-white and more normal skin color.</li>
            <li>It looks great, gives my legs the look of wearing light tan hose (there isn&#x27;t a shade light enough for my fair/never-sees-the-sun skin color), and I found after it&#x27;s dry a light buffing with a cloth will bring out the shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is WAY too dark for light skin tones!!!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly to a nice smooth texture, but the light glow is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>Despite that, it is the easiest product I&#x27;ve ever used for a quick bit of color - it conceals well, doesn&#x27;t streak and is very water resistant, yet really light.</li>
            <li>Works wonders to help give a natural glow to very light skin tone without getting on clothing.  </li>
            <li>so I know it looks great with any skin tone that just needs a little glow.</li>
            <li>Fair color a little light for me.</li>
            <li>Although I liked this product I felt that Air Stockings went on smoother and was a little more even in its coverage.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try just to see what happens.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blotch, looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing.</li>
            <li>I bought light because I am not tanning  in the sun anymore and have naturally medium to light skin</li>
            <li>I actually used for the scars on my arms and it covered it up nicely.  </li>
            <li>It provides a light coverage and doesn&#x27;t cover every spot or vein, but enough to make your legs look better without looking like you wearing leg makeup.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased; would have loved to have my money back.</li>
            <li>but I am rarely that tan.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful and exactly what I needed for my pale legs.</li>
            <li>And remember go easy the first layer of spraying because you can always go back and get more coverage</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I sprayed it on my legs, arms, shoulders, and chest, I rubbed it around to disperse the color (It sticks pretty good if you have dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash off (with a loufa) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good value for money compared to other coverage products.</li>
            <li>-This isn&#x27;t as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t match up quite right with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>(sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li>(sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li>It lasts for about 2 showers, which is good and it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes if allowed to dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle.</li>
            <li>Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even really try and it came out very even and streak free.</li>
            <li>Bonus, no transfer of color to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to test the waterproof part, I ran my arms under warm water for about three minutes and patted my arms dry . . .</li>
            <li>(I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..</li>
            <li>When my legs are tanner, I&#x27;ve mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow</li>
            <li>has a more gentle direct spray pattern that saves floors, walls from also coloring.  </li>
            <li>and this does not, like very much</li>
            <li>I think it works on scars a little better, but my red veins showed through just as brightly.  </li>
            <li>I guess this fact is a giveaway that Airbrush Legs doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better to work with smaller amounts rather than just spray and go.  </li>
            <li>so it looked better than having a red leg!</li>
            <li>and I would buy tons of it if only the color was better.</li>
            <li>works pretty well</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed</li>
            <li>but it turned out orangy and funny,</li>
            <li>of course I had to wash it out because I wouldn&#x27;t go out with those funny legs.</li>
            <li>and it looked literally funny and</li>
            <li>I got it the first day it said it could be delivered on.</li>
            <li>What I like about Sally Hansen Airbrush legs is that it gives complete coverage with a smooth and neat application .  </li>
            <li>It really is like liquid pantyhose, I swear!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it occasionally causes irritation or a rash.  </li>
            <li>Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li>if I figure out how to add a picture, I&#x27;ll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.itting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li>, that is pretty visible.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>First product of this type that works.  </li>
            <li>I used the lightest glow and loved it, but this one is orangey and uneven.</li>
            <li>This is a little pricey but worth it for sure!</li>
            <li>However, the second you step into daylight, or any other bright light for that matter, you WILL sparkle.</li>
            <li>This sprays on easily and you only have to rub it evenly like lotion right away before it dries.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it really provides airbrush effect, one drawback is that it also dries your skin so you need extra moisture.</li>
            <li>My main focus for using this product is not my legs right now, it is my arms -</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try this out for the first time on a day that it was raining</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would have liked, but the tint was sufficient.  </li>
            <li>The other thing I don&#x27;t love is it has a tendency to transfer, so try not to use it with white clothing :)  </li>
            <li>It does leave a nice finish on the skin, with a slight difference in leg color.</li>
            <li>sure you let it completely dry before you get dressed.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun that much</li>
            <li>the coverage is buildable so you can layer on as much as you like</li>
            <li>Really relies on SOAP + water for removal.</li>
            <li>If there isn&#x27;t a tutorial (or a whole slew of them) showing how it works, it probably doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It really does work well.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t really tested it with alot of physical activity and sweat, but I will when I go on vacation to a warm climate next February.</li>
            <li>That said, this product worked really well in evening the color in my legs, covering sun spots and giving a silken look to my skin.  </li>
            <li>everything was fast shipping 5 stars</li>
            <li>Go lightly over the entire leg.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  -Very</li>
            <li>-Dries very</li>
            <li>but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br</li>

            <li>dries fast</li>
            <li>, I just think I&#x27;m too pale to pull any kind of tanning product off without doing my whole body, which doesn&#x27;t interest me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to have for NYE and also other events where I would be wearing more revealing/night out clothing.</li>
            <li>Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow.</li>
            <li>Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing</li>

            <li>No one wears nylons anymore -- especially not with really cute, open toes shoes!</li>

            <li>Listed from light to dark: Nude Glow, Light Glow, Medium Glow, Tan Glow and Deep Glow.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to tan and didn&#x27;t want to have to wear pantyhose that would cause me to slip around in my open-toed high heel shoes.  </li>
            <li>I think this one is too highly reviewed..</li>

            <li>I am 26 and my 16 year old sister told me about it after she saw The Real Housewives on the Dr Oz show talking about how they use it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what the company that generally makes good products, at least for nails,is thinking of .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please bring back color nude and the previous kind of spray cans.</li>
            <li>was looking for a You Tube video showing the process of how this product works, like some other detailed, step by step videos I have seen of girls with severe acne using foundation to achieve flawless-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>This product label does not mention sparkle, but it does have a little sparkle, and I wanted a more natural look.    </li>
            <li>-Nice colors (a little on yellow</li>
            <li>I spray it into my hands and then rub on my legs (when wearing a skirt) or all over my body (bikini time) and it gives you a nice subtle tan that covers imperfections like bruises and veins.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how long it takes to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, it dries pretty fast and to mix the colors you have to work</li>
            <li>(It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spreads evenly and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural, not orange.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a moisturizer over to see if I can get more shine, I am not sure if this product will hold up to oil, cyclomethicone/dimethicone ingredients</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>: even the light is too dark.  </li>
            <li>The Light Glow is too dark and looks too orange on my skin.</li>
            <li>this is easy to apply and covers spider veins but it gets a little sparkly, like you put glitter on.</li>
            <li>Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps.</li>
            <li>Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps.</li>
            <li>But if the sun shines on it just right it looks make-uppy and not natural.</li>
            <li>The product is fairly easy to apply, but messy.</li>
            <li>Listed from light to dark: Natural, Terra Cotta and Bronze.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I think if I had a little tan it would be fine, so I&#x27;ll try it this summer.    </li>
            <li>It can easily be used year round in the south if desired as it so natural.  </li>
            <li>colors are my least favorite, they just don&#x27;t look natural on me.  </li>
            <li>If I put the undiluted stuff directly on the veined area and don&#x27;t spread it out at all, it indeed covers them (and looks like I have mud on my leg), but as soon as I spread it out, the veins show.  </li>
            <li>The majority of my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; have mellowed considerably (yes, a couple of problem spots required  some additional spot coverage) and my skin looks smoother than before.</li>
            <li>- that is if one wants solid orange legs.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it is something different that I am doing.  </li>
            <li>Does not look like make up, looks natural.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this product would cover the majority of the redness so that I could finally wear shorts again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a far cry from the old runny leg makeups of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>I spray the product directly onto my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
            <li>-Color doesn&#x27;t seem natural to me.</li>
            <li>-Offers three colors as well.</li>
            <li>-Offers three colors as well.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and does not rub off until you wash it off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my spider veins just laughed.  </li>
            <li>They are red and really embarrassing to the point that I won&#x27;t wear shorts out in public.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t messy and it dries so quickly you don&#x27;t even notice.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, I put a shimmer lotion over it to make it extra shine!</li>
            <li>Then again I am super pale.  </li>
            <li>I can bare my legs without feeling embarrassed.</li>
            <li>This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....</li>
            <li>This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....</li>
            <li>It is darker than expected, but not so much so that it is embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>its kinda like a spray tan only doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sat on black leather seats on a hot day, resulting in my legs sweating and saw no transfer.</li>

            <li>Listed from light to dark: Nude, Medium Beige and Dark</li>
            <li>The way I use it which creates much less mess and makes it much more natural looking while still doing it&#x27;s job, is I spray a bit into the palm of my hand and add just a bit of water, rub my hands together and carefully cover my legs, arms or whatever I need to even out.</li>
            <li>It also stays put and is water resistant (I&#x27;ve worn it in the ocean and while it fades a little its still pretty intact)</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it didn&#x27;t even cover anything, I only have some scratches on my legs which are barely visible</li>
            <li>also i wanted to cover some very moderate veins from an injury - they cover with my Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I have been a big fan of Sally Hansen leg makeup but regret color nude being apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li>It will  A) look like you have makeup on your legs as it&#x27;s pretty heavy coverage, and  </li>
            <li>This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now the natural is the closest of these that match and its a little too dark, just a tad, but when blended in, its not THAT obvious.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m very fair.</li>
            <li> But once I figured out a good method for using it, it gave me a very nice glow!</li>

            <li> This is a really great product I use when I wear skirts to even out any discoloration or marks on my legs.  </li>
            <li> However, I am happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for wearing sandals.</li>
            <li> But you could get it at Walmart for the fraction of the price but still, great product.</li>
            <li> great value for the price.</li>
            <li> A great find.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> and the difference is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It is like make-up for your legs, great coverage and looks good</li>
            <li> Does not have any un pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid suntan salons and look great, this product is light on the skin with good even coverage, but instead of spraying it on, I spray it into my hands and then apply it for the best results.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as others have written.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a good product if you could find a shade to match you.</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands then smooth it on my legs and comes out great!</li>
            <li> Then my sister told me she had heard good things about S.H. Airbrush Legs.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just challenged, but omg i could not make this look good.</li>
            <li> so do not use your good ones.</li>
            <li> I got the fair color because I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs look so good</li>
            <li> Mix it with some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> I use the medium in the summer and the fair skin tone color the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with it as I did not want a brown or orange mark right there on my shin bone.</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Well...I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> choose the right color as descrpition, do not choose darker one than your body color, very useful!!!!</li>
            <li> think it does an amazing job of covering my imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luv this for giving light color to my &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; skin----works great on legs, arms, neck, d√©colletage, feet.  </li>
            <li> and this spray gives them a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the fairest of the fair, because \\&quot;light glow\\&quot; looks orange on my milky skin!</li>
            <li> It made my legs look nice except...</li>
            <li> I kind of made your legs look ashy.</li>
            <li> so make sure you exfoliate and do it after a good shower).</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot as I do not go tanning</li>
            <li> The SH Light Glow is perfect, it covers the veins and give a light matte tan to the skin.</li>
            <li> -Nice</li>
            <li> I can see that if you already have great skin on your legs this product would make the skin look very pretty and pristine.  </li>
            <li> I went for the light glow and loved it.</li>
            <li> but the most astounding thing is the the color - bright,unadulterated orange.</li>
            <li> Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring.</li>
            <li> it is easy to blend in, covers spots, and isnt orange!</li>
            <li> Great coverage that smooths out legs and makes them look pretty.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smells good, not bad</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but that was perfectly OK.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for more of a tanned look, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It covered up most of the  imperfections</li>
            <li> After applying more and more layers, eventually the veins were halfway covered, but the airbrushed leg did look orange, and as if I were wearing a stocking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looked better with some sheen.</li>
            <li> More like a rub on lotion that just happens to come in spray can</li>
            <li> with many, many &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; in evidence.</li>
            <li> Can still see age spots and veins, but they look way better.</li>
            <li> This stuff used to be a bit better than it is now.  </li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my arms :)</li>
            <li> Then after that I rubbed on some lotion because it dries out your skin a bit and the lotion also helps it look more evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li> Even when I wear capri&#x27;s, it just makes they legs look so much better.</li>
            <li> I apply it from my toes to the nether-regions :)</li>
            <li> and I love that I can build up the color depending on if I want it darker or lighter.</li>
            <li> More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the dim light of my room, I&#x27;d say this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> My legs looked fabulous!</li>
            <li> but I find I get more uniform coverage by mixing it in my hand with body lotion--(3:1 lotion to Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Make-up)  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this product at the drug store and had to have more.  </li>
            <li> The level of color makes my legs look better without any overwhelming fakeness.</li>
            <li> It stayed put and my legs looked lovely in the photos.</li>
            <li> it was just ok</li>
            <li> Perfect for pale skin if you haven&#x27;t tanned in a while and for naturally fair skinned women</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very easy to use...would recommend to anyone i who has fair skin</li>
            <li> -Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed</li>
            <li> Also make sure you spray a good distance from your skin because it comes out fast and quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and my tow pregnancies left me with one spider vein</li>
            <li> Works great, not messy, doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend to mix with lotion for a more smooth and even look.</li>
            <li> GREAT natural color,</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> If one of you for whom it gave spectacular results would be so kind to post a tutorial on You Tube, or even some clear before and after pictures here on Amazon, I think you would be doing a lot of people</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> but you can easily fix that afterwards with lotion which you would want to put on anyways so that your skin is hydrated.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run or smear comes off easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I could just as easily put neon lights around my legs like a Christmas decoration  </li>
            <li> &gt;  -Easy</li>
            <li> -Easy application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it transfers so easily.  </li>
            <li> this is fair, natural when rubbed in, healthy color for those who basically avoid sun but want to look healthier in summer.  </li>
            <li> The best Product on the Market is the Air Stocking Brand and it less money here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and my skin has gotten really light</li>
            <li> If you are looking to smooth out imperfections, cover spider veins, scars, etc.</li>
            <li> and your skin is on the light side, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light legs and this color works well for me.</li>
            <li> It works great, but I find it puzzling how people review this product and aren&#x27;t following the directions.</li>
            <li> -I am a light skinned hispanic and I am closer to neutral tones.</li>
            <li> Downright impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001R2IGEC Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Light Glow]] :&lt;br</li>
            <li> -Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs.</li>
            <li> -I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection.</li>
            <li> , I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  </li>
            <li> If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>

            <li> If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>
            <li> Unless your goal is to look like a cheap stripper or Ke$ha, I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I got the light glow.  </li>
            <li> It is quite light so if u want a deeper tan, I would try medium.....</li>
            <li> The product makes the skin on my legs look even and hides light imperfections, it also lightens veins.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and no streaking.</li>
            <li> so I cannot use this for spot coverage; that&#x27;s OK though as it looks SO good when properly applied.</li>
            <li> and I also sprayed it right on in spots where I wanted more coverage - it works both ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really easy and quick to apply</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply it</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local walmart and the concept is really amazing!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, but so far, I am in love with it!  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product so much.  </li>
            <li> I was full of hope after reading all the glowing reviews, and hurried to CVS to purchase the product.  </li>
            <li> But overall it had good coverage.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with the ease of application and results.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing dresses, not to mention it way to hot in NJ to wear pants in summer.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t streak at all, and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I am super super SUPER fair skinned, and a light coat of this product makes me legs less blue-white and more normal skin color.</li>
            <li> It looks great, gives my legs the look of wearing light tan hose (there isn&#x27;t a shade light enough for my fair/never-sees-the-sun skin color), and I found after it&#x27;s dry a light buffing with a cloth will bring out the shimmer.</li>
            <li> This is WAY too dark for light skin tones!!!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly to a nice smooth texture, but the light glow is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Despite that, it is the easiest product I&#x27;ve ever used for a quick bit of color - it conceals well, doesn&#x27;t streak and is very water resistant, yet really light.</li>
            <li> Works wonders to help give a natural glow to very light skin tone without getting on clothing.  </li>
            <li> so I know it looks great with any skin tone that just needs a little glow.</li>
            <li> Fair color a little light for me.</li>
            <li> Although I liked this product I felt that Air Stockings went on smoother and was a little more even in its coverage.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a try just to see what happens.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blotch, looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing.</li>
            <li> I bought light because I am not tanning  in the sun anymore and have naturally medium to light skin</li>
            <li> I actually used for the scars on my arms and it covered it up nicely.  </li>
            <li> It provides a light coverage and doesn&#x27;t cover every spot or vein, but enough to make your legs look better without looking like you wearing leg makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very displeased; would have loved to have my money back.</li>
            <li> but I am rarely that tan.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The color was beautiful and exactly what I needed for my pale legs.</li>
            <li> And remember go easy the first layer of spraying because you can always go back and get more coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I sprayed it on my legs, arms, shoulders, and chest, I rubbed it around to disperse the color (It sticks pretty good if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash off (with a loufa) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good value for money compared to other coverage products.</li>
            <li> -This isn&#x27;t as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t match up quite right with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> (sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li> (sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li> It lasts for about 2 showers, which is good and it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes if allowed to dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle.</li>
            <li> Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even really try and it came out very even and streak free.</li>
            <li> Bonus, no transfer of color to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to test the waterproof part, I ran my arms under warm water for about three minutes and patted my arms dry . . .</li>
            <li> (I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..</li>
            <li> When my legs are tanner, I&#x27;ve mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow</li>
            <li> has a more gentle direct spray pattern that saves floors, walls from also coloring.  </li>
            <li> and this does not, like very much</li>
            <li> I think it works on scars a little better, but my red veins showed through just as brightly.  </li>
            <li> I guess this fact is a giveaway that Airbrush Legs doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to work with smaller amounts rather than just spray and go.  </li>
            <li> so it looked better than having a red leg!</li>
            <li> and I would buy tons of it if only the color was better.</li>
            <li> works pretty well</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed</li>
            <li> but it turned out orangy and funny,</li>
            <li> of course I had to wash it out because I wouldn&#x27;t go out with those funny legs.</li>
            <li> and it looked literally funny and</li>
            <li> I got it the first day it said it could be delivered on.</li>
            <li> What I like about Sally Hansen Airbrush legs is that it gives complete coverage with a smooth and neat application .  </li>
            <li> It really is like liquid pantyhose, I swear!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it occasionally causes irritation or a rash.  </li>
            <li> Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li> if I figure out how to add a picture, I&#x27;ll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.itting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li> , that is pretty visible.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li> First product of this type that works.  </li>
            <li> I used the lightest glow and loved it, but this one is orangey and uneven.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey but worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> However, the second you step into daylight, or any other bright light for that matter, you WILL sparkle.</li>
            <li> This sprays on easily and you only have to rub it evenly like lotion right away before it dries.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it really provides airbrush effect, one drawback is that it also dries your skin so you need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> My main focus for using this product is not my legs right now, it is my arms -</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this out for the first time on a day that it was raining</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would have liked, but the tint was sufficient.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I don&#x27;t love is it has a tendency to transfer, so try not to use it with white clothing :)  </li>
            <li> It does leave a nice finish on the skin, with a slight difference in leg color.</li>
            <li> sure you let it completely dry before you get dressed.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun that much</li>
            <li> the coverage is buildable so you can layer on as much as you like</li>
            <li> Really relies on SOAP + water for removal.</li>
            <li> If there isn&#x27;t a tutorial (or a whole slew of them) showing how it works, it probably doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It really does work well.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t really tested it with alot of physical activity and sweat, but I will when I go on vacation to a warm climate next February.</li>
            <li> That said, this product worked really well in evening the color in my legs, covering sun spots and giving a silken look to my skin.  </li>
            <li> everything was fast shipping 5 stars</li>
            <li> Go lightly over the entire leg.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  -Very</li>
            <li> -Dries very</li>
            <li> but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -Dries very</li>
            <li> but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dries fast</li>
            <li> , I just think I&#x27;m too pale to pull any kind of tanning product off without doing my whole body, which doesn&#x27;t interest me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to have for NYE and also other events where I would be wearing more revealing/night out clothing.</li>
            <li> Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow.</li>
            <li> Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing</li>
            <li> Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing</li>
            <li> and I was able to put on my dress and head out the door in less then 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> No one wears nylons anymore -- especially not with really cute, open toes shoes!</li>
            <li> I am older and have some veins and discoloration on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Listed from light to dark: Nude Glow, Light Glow, Medium Glow, Tan Glow and Deep Glow.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to tan and didn&#x27;t want to have to wear pantyhose that would cause me to slip around in my open-toed high heel shoes.  </li>
            <li> I think this one is too highly reviewed..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I am 26 and my 16 year old sister told me about it after she saw The Real Housewives on the Dr Oz show talking about how they use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what the company that generally makes good products, at least for nails,is thinking of .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please bring back color nude and the previous kind of spray cans.</li>
            <li> was looking for a You Tube video showing the process of how this product works, like some other detailed, step by step videos I have seen of girls with severe acne using foundation to achieve flawless-looking skin.  </li>
            <li> This product label does not mention sparkle, but it does have a little sparkle, and I wanted a more natural look.    </li>
            <li> -Nice colors (a little on yellow</li>
            <li> I spray it into my hands and then rub on my legs (when wearing a skirt) or all over my body (bikini time) and it gives you a nice subtle tan that covers imperfections like bruises and veins.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how long it takes to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, it dries pretty fast and to mix the colors you have to work</li>
            <li> (It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spreads evenly and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural, not orange.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a moisturizer over to see if I can get more shine, I am not sure if this product will hold up to oil, cyclomethicone/dimethicone ingredients</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> : even the light is too dark.  </li>
            <li> The Light Glow is too dark and looks too orange on my skin.</li>
            <li> this is easy to apply and covers spider veins but it gets a little sparkly, like you put glitter on.</li>
            <li> Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps.</li>
            <li> Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps.</li>
            <li> But if the sun shines on it just right it looks make-uppy and not natural.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly easy to apply, but messy.</li>
            <li> Listed from light to dark: Natural, Terra Cotta and Bronze.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I think if I had a little tan it would be fine, so I&#x27;ll try it this summer.    </li>
            <li> It can easily be used year round in the south if desired as it so natural.  </li>
            <li> colors are my least favorite, they just don&#x27;t look natural on me.  </li>
            <li> If I put the undiluted stuff directly on the veined area and don&#x27;t spread it out at all, it indeed covers them (and looks like I have mud on my leg), but as soon as I spread it out, the veins show.  </li>
            <li> The majority of my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; have mellowed considerably (yes, a couple of problem spots required  some additional spot coverage) and my skin looks smoother than before.</li>
            <li> - that is if one wants solid orange legs.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it is something different that I am doing.  </li>
            <li> Does not look like make up, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would cover the majority of the redness so that I could finally wear shorts again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a far cry from the old runny leg makeups of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> I spray the product directly onto my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Shake</li>
            <li> -Color doesn&#x27;t seem natural to me.</li>
            <li> -Offers three colors as well.</li>
            <li> -Offers three colors as well.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and does not rub off until you wash it off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my spider veins just laughed.  </li>
            <li> They are red and really embarrassing to the point that I won&#x27;t wear shorts out in public.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t messy and it dries so quickly you don&#x27;t even notice.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, I put a shimmer lotion over it to make it extra shine!</li>
            <li> Then again I am super pale.  </li>
            <li> I can bare my legs without feeling embarrassed.</li>
            <li> This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....</li>
            <li> This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....</li>
            <li> It is darker than expected, but not so much so that it is embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> its kinda like a spray tan only doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sat on black leather seats on a hot day, resulting in my legs sweating and saw no transfer.</li>

            <li> Listed from light to dark: Nude, Medium Beige and Dark</li>
            <li> The way I use it which creates much less mess and makes it much more natural looking while still doing it&#x27;s job, is I spray a bit into the palm of my hand and add just a bit of water, rub my hands together and carefully cover my legs, arms or whatever I need to even out.</li>
            <li> It also stays put and is water resistant (I&#x27;ve worn it in the ocean and while it fades a little its still pretty intact)</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it didn&#x27;t even cover anything, I only have some scratches on my legs which are barely visible</li>
            <li> also i wanted to cover some very moderate veins from an injury - they cover with my Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Sally Hansen leg makeup but regret color nude being apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li> It will  A) look like you have makeup on your legs as it&#x27;s pretty heavy coverage, and  </li>
            <li> This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now the natural is the closest of these that match and its a little too dark, just a tad, but when blended in, its not THAT obvious.  </li>
            <li> However, I tried it on my skin first, it did look different(color), but I think it is a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> The coverage is light, so it does not really hide spider veins or dark spots, but it makes them slightly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but, it does get on your clothing if you are not careful and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> Oh and beware when I sit on leather cars seats and its hot it can sweat off a little so just be careful.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and gives your legs a slight glow.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because unlike some of the other sunless tanners, it doesn&#x27;t streak or go on too dark.</li>
            <li> Plus the product will last you twice as long if you&#x27;re diluting it a bit.  </li>
            <li> I do the spraying in an area where I can lay down a sheet or an old towel, since the spray does get on the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Sometimes my legs look down right pasty, sometimes I have a tan, (occasionally from the sun, usually from sunless tanning sprays)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there was zero coverage of the redness in the scars, even when I tried applying a high quality concealer to the scars first.  </li>
            <li> but I guess there is less product getting everywhere if you do it directly on hands.  </li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to dry.  </li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful when applying not to get it on clothing or linens, but once dried, it really does not rub off on my clothing and even withstands a rain shower or wading into the water without coming off.</li>
            <li> and it lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> middle aged women!&lt;br /&gt;It covers flaws like veins and scars.</li>
            <li> Its harder to mix because it dries faster (like the Nyce Instant Nylons)</li>
            <li> I used it for a long time but after trying the Nyce and Airstockings, my expectations have been raised.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR</li>
            <li> I find that its not too orange and not too pink, it sits somewhere in the middle.</li>
            <li> I find that its not too orange and not too pink, it sits somewhere in the middle.</li>
            <li> I had to apply it over it a few times,and granted, it did not cover it completely, but it was almost gone.</li>
            <li> I recommend having someone else spray you in the shower, and listen to music or watch t.v. while you air dry...</li>
            <li> I sprayed some on my hand and covered my arms, let it dry and did it again.</li>
            <li> If you are pale like me and don&#x27;t have the time to sit out in the sun or don&#x27;t want to because of obvious health reasons this product is instant gratification!</li>
            <li> only suggestion, make a tone just a shade or two lighter for those of us with really pale completions - especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> so if you get caught in the rain you&#x27;re not going to have makeup running down your legs, but I do notice if I don&#x27;t shower it off at night it will be on my sheets the next morning.</li>
            <li> It helps to even out your skin tone, small spider veins, white legs in the summer especially.</li>
            <li> I will never live another Summer without it!</li>
            <li> I recommend spraying it on in the shower (after you shower obviously), otherwise you can make quite a mess in your bathroom (like I did).</li>
            <li> I was a little bit nervous applying this product as I used others before and they left me orang-y or streaky.</li>
            <li> It does not really cover veins or cosmetic imperfections.</li>
            <li> , the only thing is that your hands will be kinda messy after putting it on your legs.  </li>
            <li> Also be careful if your grout isn;t sealed ...</li>
            <li> If you find airstockings to pink, neutralize it, lighten or darken it with Nyce colors.  </li>
            <li> If you find airstockings to pink, neutralize it, lighten or darken it with Nyce colors.  </li>
            <li> another thing is, one layer seems not enough, so i have to put at least two layers on the legs, and if you have some scars on legs like i do, maybe you still need a little facial concealer because this product cannot 100% cover everything.</li>
            <li> Noticed that recently purchased cans seem to clog up and stop spraying after very little use.</li>
            <li> so you have to watch where you spray it due to &amp;#34;overspray&amp;#34; on rugs, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to layer by hand because the newly applied product \\&quot;dissolves\\&quot; what has previously been applied and dried, which is why I tried spraying it directly on (problem solved).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I just received my product today - and yes, if you have really dark discoloration spots, this product is not a perfect cover up (although, if I spot treat these trouble areas with extra product, it does cover really well).</li>
            <li> but it is impossible to get it streak free</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but decided to use it on my legs, as I was wearing a short dress for an outdoor party in the California heat in July.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i have to clean it during application which is very inconvenient, especially when I am mixing colors.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to go back and remove it in places without looking blotchy!</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about is the shimmer in it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my case.</li>
            <li> It will last as least 6 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so dark that you look like you stepped out of a tanning booth, but it gives your legs a sort of matte tanned look.  </li>
            <li> It goes on dark and dries to an amazing&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Sally Hansen hands down.</li>
            <li> The leg makeup was slightly darker that I thought</li>
            <li> the Airstockings with Sally Hansen gives the nicest color (for me) and yields less transfer</li>

            <li> I live in a tropical climate and it works in the heat without coming off or looking fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less messy, and I can control the amount of product I use.  </li>
            <li> little to no transfer:&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I am darker, I mix the terra cotta in a little.</li>
            <li> -Little</li>
            <li> to Airstockings, I saw little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> For each leg, I put a some scented lotion, a bit of coconut oil, and 2-3 sprays of the Airbrush Legs into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together a little to mix it together, and apply that to my legs.</li>
            <li> but i was a little dissapointed about that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my varicose veins, but at least it makes the contrast between my pale legs and dark veins less stark and dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I have several scars on my legs from ant bites that healed poorly.  </li>
            <li> They say the \\&quot;overspray\\&quot; is messy or whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought the lightest shade and it still is a tad too tan looking compared to my pale color</li>
            <li> and we have learned it&#x27;s not healthy anyway.</li>
            <li> usually these type of products may cause me to itch</li>
            <li> usually this when I am going on vacation and during the summer months.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray in the past, but I prefer the lotion form.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will try the other &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade even though it has poor reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very pale legs</li>
            <li> The new ones are bad quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that putting a little lotion on before using helps reduce the chances of it irritating skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy and a little fake looking</li>
            <li> One complaint besides</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not hard at all for me to tan and being this pale makes me look sick!</li>
            <li> What I mean is the last batch I bought was terrible about getting on my bed sheets when I slept at night: gross.  </li>
            <li> I hate stockings and like to go bare legged</li>

            <li> You must read the instructions, and if you follow it correctly it won&#x27;t streak or look weird.</li>
            <li> what added insult to injury was that it also gave me a hard time cleaning it with soap and water!!!</li>
            <li> I hate my legs and summer has been the dreaded season for me because it&#x27;s hard to hide ugly legs.</li>
            <li> I AM OBSESSED!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to go too dramatic!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love!! I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun that much and my skin has gotten really light, it&#x27;s not hard at all for me to tan and being this pale makes me look sick! I bought this and tried it as soon as it came in!! Easy to apply and I love the color!! Not the tark tan I&#x27;m use to but I didn&#x27;t want to go too dramatic!! Perfect for pale skin if you haven&#x27;t tanned in a while and for naturally fair skinned women</li>
            <li> Did not like consistence or coverage</li>
            <li> If you are pale like me and don&#x27;t have the time to sit out in the sun or don&#x27;t want to because of obvious health reasons this product is instant gratification! I spray it into my hands and then rub on my legs (when wearing a skirt) or all over my body (bikini time) and it gives you a nice subtle tan that covers imperfections like bruises and veins. It also stays put and is water resistant (I&#x27;ve worn it in the ocean and while it fades a little its still pretty intact) It comes off when you scrub with soap and water. My friend who is Latina turned me on to this so I know it looks great with any skin tone that just needs a little glow. Love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the coverage is buildable so you can layer on as much as you like til you get the results you want. Oh and beware when I sit on leather cars seats and its hot it can sweat off a little so just be careful.</li>
            <li> Works great.. Love it. Works very well and is very easy to use...would recommend to anyone i who has fair skin</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product so much.  I wore it to my sons&#x27; wedding.  I didn&#x27;t have time to tan and didn&#x27;t want to have to wear pantyhose that would cause me to slip around in my open-toed high heel shoes.  The leg makeup was slightly darker that I thought but that was perfectly OK.  It helped to cover up some imperfections, stayed the same color, didn&#x27;t come off onto my dress and stayed on until I washed it off that night.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, not messy, doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes. I went for the light glow and loved it. Then I thought I would try the darker color, medium glow, and I had to return it. Too orange. So, if you are looking for more of a tanned look, I would not recommend this product. If you are looking to smooth out imperfections, cover spider veins, scars, etc. and your skin is on the light side, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was great.  Just as good as others have written.  It covered up most of the  imperfections so I could wear a dress without nylons.</li>
            <li> I AM OBSESSED! It smooths and brightens the appearance of my legs instantly!! I&#x27;m careful when applying not to get it on clothing or linens, but once dried, it really does not rub off on my clothing and even withstands a rain shower or wading into the water without coming off. Really relies on SOAP + water for removal.</li>
            <li> choose the right color as descrpition, do not choose darker one than your body color, very useful!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very pale legs and this spray gives them a nice glow. My legs look great when I use this product. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was full of hope after reading all the glowing reviews, and hurried to CVS to purchase the product.  Unfortunately, my spider veins just laughed.  I think it works on scars a little better, but my red veins showed through just as brightly.  If I put the undiluted stuff directly on the veined area and don&#x27;t spread it out at all, it indeed covers them (and looks like I have mud on my leg), but as soon as I spread it out, the veins show.  After applying more and more layers, eventually the veins were halfway covered, but the airbrushed leg did look orange, and as if I were wearing a stocking.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a You Tube video showing the process of how this product works, like some other detailed, step by step videos I have seen of girls with severe acne using foundation to achieve flawless-looking skin.  There were plenty of videos on using Airbrush Legs, but none showed high-resolution footage of the process of making red spider veins on legs disappear from view.  The videos ranged from people spraying it on their arms, to just talking about it, or showing a \\&quot;with\\&quot; and \\&quot;without\\&quot; picture in which neither leg has spider veins.  I guess this fact is a giveaway that Airbrush Legs doesn&#x27;t work consistently.  I was hoping that the videos were not there because people were embarrassed to show their veiny legs pre-treatment, but I suspect that the truth is that it just doesn&#x27;t work.  So if there is some cosmetic product you are wondering about, check You Tube.  If there isn&#x27;t a tutorial (or a whole slew of them) showing how it works, it probably doesn&#x27;t.  If one of you for whom it gave spectacular results would be so kind to post a tutorial on You Tube, or even some clear before and after pictures here on Amazon, I think you would be doing a lot of people a favor.&lt;br /&gt;The product did come off promptly with water and soap.</li>
            <li> It does not really cover veins or cosmetic imperfections. It does leave a nice finish on the skin, with a slight difference in leg color.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly easy to apply, but messy. You have to spray it on your hands, then rub it in. It dries quickly to a nice smooth texture, but the light glow is too dark for me. I hoped for a creamy ivory look, but on my white legs it is orange. I think if I had a little tan it would be fine, so I&#x27;ll try it this summer.    The coverage is light, so it does not really hide spider veins or dark spots, but it makes them slightly less noticeable. This product label does not mention sparkle, but it does have a little sparkle, and I wanted a more natural look.    It looks like a self-tanner, but without the bad smell. It seems like a good product if you could find a shade to match you.</li>
            <li> Great coverage that smooths out legs and makes them look pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have never used something like this so I cant compare to anything but it works great! I put some on my hands then smooth it on my legs and comes out great! it is easy to blend in, covers spots, and isnt orange! Looks very natural, I put a shimmer lotion over it to make it extra shine! This is a little pricey but worth it for sure! I only had to apply this once and it lasted all day long. I can not stop using this! Does not have any un pleasant smell. This is a spray can, for best results spray on your hands then spread out evenly. I used a blending brush after I spread it.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the fairest of the fair, because \\&quot;light glow\\&quot; looks orange on my milky skin! This is WAY too dark for light skin tones!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product I use when I wear skirts to even out any discoloration or marks on my legs.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if you use it as directed (just spray on your legs or body) It will  A) look like you have makeup on your legs as it&#x27;s pretty heavy coverage, and  B) get all over everything around you and it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to clean up.  The way I use it which creates much less mess and makes it much more natural looking while still doing it&#x27;s job, is I spray a bit into the palm of my hand and add just a bit of water, rub my hands together and carefully cover my legs, arms or whatever I need to even out. Just continue the process until you&#x27;re covered. I think it&#x27;s better to work with smaller amounts rather than just spray and go.  Plus the product will last you twice as long if you&#x27;re diluting it a bit.  It really does work well.  The other thing I don&#x27;t love is it has a tendency to transfer, so try not to use it with white clothing :)  It is water resistant so if you get caught in the rain you&#x27;re not going to have makeup running down your legs, but I do notice if I don&#x27;t shower it off at night it will be on my sheets the next morning.</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid suntan salons and look great, this product is light on the skin with good even coverage, but instead of spraying it on, I spray it into my hands and then apply it for the best results.  It lasts for about 2 showers, which is good and it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes if allowed to dry for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> After tearing hamstring muscle wanted to cover bruising all over leg. Make up covered well. Fair color a little light for me. Also too chalky looking. Used spray sunscreen over it. Looked better with some sheen. Was on vacation so it looked better than having a red leg!</li>
            <li> I am super super SUPER fair skinned, and a light coat of this product makes me legs less blue-white and more normal skin color. It&#x27;s easy to wash off (with a loufa) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. Love!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local walmart and the concept is really amazing! But it&#x27;s orange.&lt;br /&gt;It was really easy and quick to apply and I didn&#x27;t even really try and it came out very even and streak free. It wasn&#x27;t messy and it dries so quickly you don&#x27;t even notice. It made my legs look nice except... It was definitely fake-tan orange colored. This would be 5 stars and I would buy tons of it if only the color was better. Maybe I will try the other &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade even though it has poor reviews. I think this one is too highly reviewed..</li>
            <li> its like the concealer for your legs. works pretty well, the only thing is that your hands will be kinda messy after putting it on your legs.  another thing is, one layer seems not enough, so i have to put at least two layers on the legs, and if you have some scars on legs like i do, maybe you still need a little facial concealer because this product cannot 100% cover everything.</li>
            <li> This product gave me my confidence back. I hate my legs and summer has been the dreaded season for me because it&#x27;s hard to hide ugly legs. Now that I&#x27;m older my legs don&#x27;t tan evenly and we have learned it&#x27;s not healthy anyway. Self tanners are always a gamble and they too look terrible and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Between the orangey color and awful odor I stopped trying. I was doomed. Then my sister told me she had heard good things about S.H. Airbrush Legs. I decided to try it but reluctantly because I assumed it was just hype. Well...I love it! It is so easy to use. Spreads evenly and looks very natural. I can bare my legs without feeling embarrassed. It dries quickly and washes off easily with soap and water. The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about is the shimmer in it. Not a deal breaker though. But if the sun shines on it just right it looks make-uppy and not natural. I wish they made this in a matte formula too so the consumer had a choice. However, I am happy I tried it. I will never live another Summer without it!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try this out for the first time on a day that it was raining but I did it anyway...needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  It stayed on and the coloring was perfect.  It didn&#x27;t stain my hands at all and I will continue to buy this.  I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. However, I would recommend to mix with lotion for a more smooth and even look.</li>
            <li> Went on lumpy &amp; poor coverage! More like a rub on lotion that just happens to come in spray can</li>
            <li> If you want to spray paint your shower by all means buy this. Maybe I am just challenged, but omg i could not make this look good. I am also as white as paper, so this could be an issue as well.  I recommend having someone else spray you in the shower, and listen to music or watch t.v. while you air dry... its kinda like a spray tan only doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.  Also be careful if your grout isn;t sealed ... its a pain to scrub it out.</li>
            <li> I bought the lightest shade and it still is a tad too tan looking compared to my pale color so I cannot use this for spot coverage; that&#x27;s OK though as it looks SO good when properly applied. I used to work in a day spa and I am used to the prep for applying the fake tans...so the same applies with this product: cleanse, exfoliate, shave or wax and moisturize before applying the product. I applied it with my hands and I also sprayed it right on in spots where I wanted more coverage - it works both ways. It&#x27;s difficult to layer by hand because the newly applied product \\&quot;dissolves\\&quot; what has previously been applied and dried, which is why I tried spraying it directly on (problem solved). It looks great, gives my legs the look of wearing light tan hose (there isn&#x27;t a shade light enough for my fair/never-sees-the-sun skin color), and I found after it&#x27;s dry a light buffing with a cloth will bring out the shimmer. I haven&#x27;t tried a moisturizer over to see if I can get more shine, I am not sure if this product will hold up to oil, cyclomethicone/dimethicone ingredients but it&#x27;s worth a try just to see what happens. Overall I am very pleased with the ease of application and results.</li>
            <li> I just received my product today - and yes, if you have really dark discoloration spots, this product is not a perfect cover up (although, if I spot treat these trouble areas with extra product, it does cover really well). My main focus for using this product is not my legs right now, it is my arms - with many, many &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; in evidence. I sprayed some on my hand and covered my arms, let it dry and did it again. WOW! The majority of my &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; have mellowed considerably (yes, a couple of problem spots required  some additional spot coverage) and my skin looks smoother than before. Bonus, no transfer of color to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to test the waterproof part, I ran my arms under warm water for about three minutes and patted my arms dry . . . coverage was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I haven&#x27;t really tested it with alot of physical activity and sweat, but I will when I go on vacation to a warm climate next February. But for now, it covers what I need it to cover and does not rub off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion, make a tone just a shade or two lighter for those of us with really pale completions - especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as some people say.  Can still see age spots and veins, but they look way better.</li>
            <li> This sprays on easily and you only have to rub it evenly like lotion right away before it dries. Stays on well. Is make-up so you have to watch where you spray it due to &amp;#34;overspray&amp;#34; on rugs, etc. I like the product. It helps to even out your skin tone, small spider veins, white legs in the summer especially. Great for wearing sandals. I have fairly light legs and this color works well for me.</li>
            <li> I kind of made your legs look ashy. But overall it had good coverage.</li>
            <li> It is like make-up for your legs, great coverage and looks good but, it does get on your clothing if you are not careful and let it dry.  Also, when you take a shower after wearing it it will be like make up on your wash cloth so do not use your good ones.</li>
            <li> Works wonders to help give a natural glow to very light skin tone without getting on clothing.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The best Product on the Market is the Air Stocking Brand and it less money here on Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t blotch, looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing.</li>
            <li> I wonder how could Sally Hansen sell a product as shabby as so!! I got the fair color because I have fair skin. I used it exactly as directed but it turned out orangy and funny, of course I had to wash it out because I wouldn&#x27;t go out with those funny legs. Not to mention that it didn&#x27;t even cover anything, I only have some scratches on my legs which are barely visible however I wanted to cover them so I could go out without a pantyhose but that spray didn&#x27;t cover anything and it looked literally funny and what added insult to injury was that it also gave me a hard time cleaning it with soap and water!!! I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Although I liked this product I felt that Air Stockings went on smoother and was a little more even in its coverage.  That said, this product worked really well in evening the color in my legs, covering sun spots and giving a silken look to my skin.  ALso found that it did not transfer (same as Air stockings).</li>
            <li> this is easy to apply and covers spider veins but it gets a little sparkly, like you put glitter on. I would rather look like I have glitter on than have the spider veins show!!</li>
            <li> I used the lightest glow and loved it, but this one is orangey and uneven. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I got it the first day it said it could be delivered on. Amazing! But you could get it at Walmart for the fraction of the price but still, great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t match up quite right with my skin tone.  Then again I am super pale.  Not worth the money in my case.</li>
            <li> What I like about Sally Hansen Airbrush legs is that it gives complete coverage with a smooth and neat application .  It&#x27;s good value for money compared to other coverage products.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, but so far, I am in love with it!  I applied it to just one leg and the difference is amazing!  Even up close, you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on, the skin just looks smoother.  Do they make this for faces???</li>
            <li> A must have for middle aged women!&lt;br /&gt;It covers flaws like veins and scars. It makes my legs look so good again!&lt;br /&gt;It ONLY comes off with soapy water, so there is no need to worry about it coming off in the rain or getting splashed.&lt;br /&gt;A great value for the price. It will last as least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine any human skin color that comes even close to the orange of this product. I bought light because I am not tanning  in the sun anymore and have naturally medium to light skin also i wanted to cover some very moderate veins from an injury - they cover with my Bare Minerals but it comes off-.this product  doesn&#x27;t cover or conceal - unless perhaps put on very thickly-  but the most astounding thing is the the color - bright,unadulterated orange. I tried buffing in a thin layer thinking that it might soften the effect with time but it is impossible to get it streak free - that is if one wants solid orange legs. I can&#x27;t imagine what the company that generally makes good products, at least for nails,is thinking of . Hopefully they don&#x27;t test products on animals but if they do the likely subjects for this were goldfish.</li>
            <li> producto..lo recommend excellent buy again .. !! everything was fast shipping 5 stars</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  No one wears nylons anymore -- especially not with really cute, open toes shoes! But, what do you do about splotchy looking legs when attending some sort of semi-formal event??  This stuff applies evenly, covers well - and gives your legs an &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; tone.  It&#x27;s not so dark that you look like you stepped out of a tanning booth, but it gives your legs a sort of matte tanned look.  Very natural looking.  It didn&#x27;t rub off on anything that I wore, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it with white tube socks! I was impressed and will use again!</li>
            <li> This stuff used to be a bit better than it is now.  What I mean is the last batch I bought was terrible about getting on my bed sheets when I slept at night: gross.  And that has blocked me from applying it.  I used to love this stuff.  I really don&#x27;t think it is something different that I am doing.  One complaint besides: even the light is too dark.  Sally Hansen, make a LIGHTER ONE.  The color has gotten a bit fakey.  Used to be a big fan of this..... now I have 3 cans gathering dust on my shelf because it looks a bit orange and because I don&#x27;t want to wash my bedsheets every morning.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m too white. This product makes my legs look healthier, very nice. Does not look like make up, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I actually used for the scars on my arms and it covered it up nicely.  Now I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my arms :)</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Sally Hansen leg makeup but regret color nude being apparently discontinued. Noticed that recently purchased cans seem to clog up and stop spraying after very little use. This is very unfortunate, not just a waste of money but also very inconvenient if one has no back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back color nude and the previous kind of spray cans. The new ones are bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way darker than I thought!</li>
            <li> I have several scars on my legs from ant bites that healed poorly.  They are red and really embarrassing to the point that I won&#x27;t wear shorts out in public.  I was really hoping that this product would cover the majority of the redness so that I could finally wear shorts again.  Unfortunately, there was zero coverage of the redness in the scars, even when I tried applying a high quality concealer to the scars first.  I can see that if you already have great skin on your legs this product would make the skin look very pretty and pristine.  But if you have any amount of discoloration from scars or veins, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to have for NYE and also other events where I would be wearing more revealing/night out clothing. This airbrush color was a bit darker than I expected and a bit blotchy if you don&#x27;t spray far away enough. But once I figured out a good method for using it, it gave me a very nice glow! I recommend spraying it on in the shower (after you shower obviously), otherwise you can make quite a mess in your bathroom (like I did). Also make sure you spray a good distance from your skin because it comes out fast and quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I sprayed it on my legs, arms, shoulders, and chest, I rubbed it around to disperse the color (It sticks pretty good if you have dry skin so make sure you exfoliate and do it after a good shower). Then after that I rubbed on some lotion because it dries out your skin a bit and the lotion also helps it look more evenly dispersed. I liked this product a lot as I do not go tanning and it is nice to have a good flawless glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product 4 stars was because it didn&#x27;t spray evenly but you can easily fix that afterwards with lotion which you would want to put on anyways so that your skin is hydrated. And remember go easy the first layer of spraying because you can always go back and get more coverage but it&#x27;s hard to go back and remove it in places without looking blotchy!</li>
            <li> Great summer product!</li>
            <li> usually these type of products may cause me to itch and this does not, like very much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I would get through the summer without SH Airbrush Leg Makeup. I enjoy wearing dresses, not to mention it way to hot in NJ to wear pants in summer. However, I have horrible varicose veins all over my legs. Plus the fact I stopped sunbathing about 10 years ago so my legs are so white they look transparent. The SH Light Glow is perfect, it covers the veins and give a light matte tan to the skin. It&#x27;s very natural, not orange. It stays put all day does not require you to reapply. Even when I wear capri&#x27;s, it just makes they legs look so much better. I apply it from my toes to the nether-regions :)</li>
            <li> Mix it with some moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> It works great, but I find it puzzling how people review this product and aren&#x27;t following the directions. They say the \\&quot;overspray\\&quot; is messy or whatever. There should be no overspray because you are supposed to spray it in your hands then apply. It&#x27;s a far cry from the old runny leg makeups of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am older and have some veins and discoloration on my legs.  I spray the product directly onto my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Shake the Can and spray on from a  distance of about 12&#x27;inches. Go lightly over the entire leg.  I do the spraying in an area where I can lay down a sheet or an old towel, since the spray does get on the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you let it completely dry before you get dressed.  It goes on dark and dries to an amazing&lt;br /&gt;Natural look.  Sometimes I just buff off the excess, before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;I think it does an amazing job of covering my imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a couple of days, if you don&#x27;t scrub your legs or shave.&lt;br /&gt;I usually this when I am going on vacation and during the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, it seems to me some people are just not using this product to its best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;Spraying it on my hand or a sponge and applying it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had the can clog and have been using the product for several years.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for me.  It provides a light coverage and doesn&#x27;t cover every spot or vein, but enough to make your legs look better without looking like you wearing leg makeup.  A great find.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it really provides airbrush effect, one drawback is that it also dries your skin so you need extra moisture.</li>
            <li> makes legs look flawless I will be buying more when this runs out! Love it! Doesn&#x27;t run or smear comes off easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Made my legs orange and bought to cover knee surgery scar(s)  Did not work to cover  I could just as easily put neon lights around my legs like a Christmas decoration  Not good Maybe for Halloween!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I am 26 and my 16 year old sister told me about it after she saw The Real Housewives on the Dr Oz show talking about how they use it. I was very skeptical at first, but decided to use it on my legs, as I was wearing a short dress for an outdoor party in the California heat in July. I didn&#x27;t have time to get a spray tan so I used this and it worked wonders. I now use it any time I wear skirts, dresses, shorts, capris. It&#x27;s addicting! You must read the instructions, and if you follow it correctly it won&#x27;t streak or look weird. It really is like liquid pantyhose, I swear! A little bit goes a very long way and I love that I can build up the color depending on if I want it darker or lighter.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it occasionally causes irritation or a rash.  Despite that, it is the easiest product I&#x27;ve ever used for a quick bit of color - it conceals well, doesn&#x27;t streak and is very water resistant, yet really light. It&#x27;s super easy to apply. I find that putting a little lotion on before using helps reduce the chances of it irritating skin.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the color is described as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, it was orange. Very displeased; would have loved to have my money back.</li>
            <li> -I am a light skinned hispanic and I am closer to neutral tones. Sometimes my legs look down right pasty, sometimes I have a tan, (occasionally from the sun, usually from sunless tanning sprays) so my color changes and I&#x27;ve also noticed my arms are always darker than my legs. (I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..)&lt;br /&gt;-In my opinion, all three offer great coverage. Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle. If you want the closest match, you will have to do some color mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AIRSTOCKINGS:&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Very little to no transfer:&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Color doesn&#x27;t seem natural to me. Too pink.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -If it wasn&#x27;t for the color issue, it would be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;  -They offer three colors. Listed from light to dark: Natural, Terra Cotta and Bronze.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;ve used all three. Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring. Right now the natural is the closest of these that match and its a little too dark, just a tad, but when blended in, its not THAT obvious.  When I am darker, I mix the terra cotta in a little. Its harder to mix because it dries faster (like the Nyce Instant Nylons) so you have to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;  -Their colors are my least favorite, they just don&#x27;t look natural on me.  The Natural shade by itself makes my legs look pink from afar and the shade is too different from the color of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Says to spray on legs then use your hands to blend it in and they advise you let set for 1-2 minutes. I guess it has the potential to rub off in that time.  Regardless of how long it takes to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, it dries pretty fast and to mix the colors you have to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Beats the Sally Hansen hands down. I&#x27;ve sat on black leather seats on a hot day, resulting in my legs sweating and saw no transfer. Downright impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001R2IGEC Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Light Glow]] :&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Nice colors (a little on yellow side)&lt;br /&gt;  -Of the three, offer best color selection (5 shades vs. 3)&lt;br /&gt;  -Easy to mix colors.&lt;br /&gt;  -Easy application.&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Nice colors but don&#x27;t like that it transfers so easily.  I used it for a long time but after trying the Nyce and Airstockings, my expectations have been raised.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR&lt;br /&gt;  -They have five colors. Listed from light to dark: Nude Glow, Light Glow, Medium Glow, Tan Glow and Deep Glow.&lt;br /&gt;  -Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs. Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow. The Light Glow is too dark and looks too orange on my skin. When my legs are tanner, I&#x27;ve mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow but I am rarely that tan.&lt;br /&gt;  -I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection. More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Directions say to spray on hands, then apply to legs and blend, then let set 60 seconds. I&#x27;ve done it both ways. Sprayed on hands, sprayed on legs. I end up blending the color on my legs either way so the results are the same but I guess there is less product getting everywhere if you do it directly on hands.  This brand has been the easiest to mix colors with.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -This isn&#x27;t as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  It doesn&#x27;t all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  If you have black leather seats, sit on a towel or something you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002EJ8TFS Nyce Legs Spray On Instant Nylons Nail Treatment Products]]&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Little to no transfer:&lt;br /&gt;  -Neutral colors (It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Bottles clog.&lt;br /&gt;  -Dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -if it wasn&#x27;t for the clogged bottle issue, it would be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;  -Offers three colors as well. Listed from light to dark: Nude, Medium Beige and Dark Beige.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;ve tried the Nude and Medium Beige. Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone. I find that its not too orange and not too pink, it sits somewhere in the middle. When I am darker, I mix it in with the Medium Beige.  This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Says to spray on legs and dries in 10 seconds (sounds about right..).  This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....)&lt;br /&gt;  -The one thing I did not like was that the three bottles i&#x27;ve purchased have clogged at one point or another before I was finished with them. Two I managed to salvage. Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps. I do this by dunking them in a mixture of water and facial cleanser, let it soak then use an old toothbrush to brush it clean. (I just got an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner so I am going to try dunking it in that next.)  Sometimes i have to clean it during application which is very inconvenient, especially when I am mixing colors.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Comparable to Airstockings, I saw little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIXING COLORS:&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing the Airstockings with Sally Hansen gives the nicest color (for me) and yields less transfer but there is still transfer nonetheless so I avoid using but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-I usually do a 50/50 mix just because its easier to spray them on my legs at the same time and can get consistent color through out, then blend them in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  If you find airstockings to pink, neutralize it, lighten or darken it with Nyce colors.  If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  I have had some rub off on clothes but not sure if its because I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to dry.  Because I mixed them, I can&#x27;t pin point which one it was. I have all the colors I mentioned I&#x27;ve tried except for the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Nude Glow, if I figure out how to add a picture, I&#x27;ll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.itting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.

            <li> Let me start by saying that I bought this today, and I tossed it out today. The color was beautiful and exactly what I needed for my pale legs. In the dim light of my room, I&#x27;d say this product is perfect. However, the second you step into daylight, or any other bright light for that matter, you WILL sparkle. It looks almost as though I&#x27;ve rolled around in glitter. Unless your goal is to look like a cheap stripper or Ke$ha, I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who has perfect skin. However, I tried it on my skin first, it did look different(color), but I think it is a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit nervous applying this product as I used others before and they left me orang-y or streaky. This product however is awesome! Super easy to apply it dries fast and I was able to put on my dress and head out the door in less then 30 minutes. My legs looked fabulous! Just FYI I&#x27;m very fair and my tow pregnancies left me with one spider vein, that is pretty visible. I had to apply it over it a few times,and granted, it did not cover it completely, but it was almost gone. I was very happy with it as I did not want a brown or orange mark right there on my shin bone.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  For each leg, I put a some scented lotion, a bit of coconut oil, and 2-3 sprays of the Airbrush Legs into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together a little to mix it together, and apply that to my legs. It goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t streak at all, and looks very natural.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well, I just think I&#x27;m too pale to pull any kind of tanning product off without doing my whole body, which doesn&#x27;t interest me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray in the past, but I prefer the lotion form. It&#x27;s less messy, and I can control the amount of product I use.  GREAT natural color, but I find I get more uniform coverage by mixing it in my hand with body lotion--(3:1 lotion to Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Make-up)  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this product at the drug store and had to have more.  First product of this type that works.  Looks natural and does not rub off until you wash it off with soap and water.  I got the light glow.  I live in a tropical climate and it works in the heat without coming off or looking fake.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cover my varicose veins, but at least it makes the contrast between my pale legs and dark veins less stark and dramatic.  It is darker than expected, but not so much so that it is embarrassing.  The level of color makes my legs look better without any overwhelming fakeness.</li>
            <li> Luv this for giving light color to my &amp;#34;bright white&amp;#34; skin----works great on legs, arms, neck, d√©colletage, feet.  Especially like this product as it is designed not to spray all owner the room....has a more gentle direct spray pattern that saves floors, walls from also coloring.  It is quite light so if u want a deeper tan, I would try medium.....this is fair, natural when rubbed in, healthy color for those who basically avoid sun but want to look healthier in summer.  It can easily be used year round in the south if desired as it so natural.  Packaged well....took a bit longer to receive but....keep a spare &amp; all is set.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because unlike some of the other sunless tanners, it doesn&#x27;t streak or go on too dark. It looks very natural and gives your legs a slight glow. I use the medium in the summer and the fair skin tone color the rest of the year. The product makes the skin on my legs look even and hides light imperfections, it also lightens veins. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy and a little fake looking BUT it totally works. I wore it for family photographs on the beach. It stayed put and my legs looked lovely in the photos. I was also very shocked to find that it didn&#x27;t sweat onto the white dress I wore.</li>
            <li> it doesnt smells good, not bad but i was a little dissapointed about that.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would have liked, but the tint was sufficient.  All in all it was just ok</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I hate stockings and like to go bare legged but I&#x27;m very fair. I spray some on my hands and rub it on my legs. It goes on smooth and no streaking.</li>
