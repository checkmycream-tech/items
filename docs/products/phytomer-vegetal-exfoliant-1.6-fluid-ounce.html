            <li> Fortunately, I have been blessed with &#x27;good skin&#x27;.  This product makes it feel even better.  I only use it about once a week, but my skin feels renewed and refreshed after just five minutes.  I even glow, lol.  Easy to use.  Apply, let sit, rinse off.  Price is much less than at my local salon.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by my facialist due to my sensitive skin.  This has a pleasant smell, goes on ok, and you only have to keep it on for 5 minutes.  I&#x27;ve never had any adverse reaction to it or dryness.  On the other hand, I do feel like I have to use a lot to cover my face and this can be pricy so that is a downside.  Some people say that they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything and I can see where they are coming from.  I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much either but when I went for a couple of months without it, then went for a facial, she could tell.</li>
            <li> If you want beautiful skin use this product. I have been using for years and love it!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive dry skin. I am 62 years old. All my life my skin has been so delicate and sensitive. The wind makes my face red. So, when I found this product I couldn&#x27;t believe it. No redness, no dryness, just gentle exfoliation. I would use this every day, if I could remember, but mostly I use it once or twice a week. Never has the product damaged my skin. I hope it is something that will keep being sold for the next 50 years!!</li>
            <li> This is the very best exfoliant or scrub I have ever used.  I keep buying it over and over again</li>
            <li> All Phytomer products are perfect</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliant!  I&#x27;ve been using this since it was used on me at a spa facial about ten years ago.  I use it about 2-3 times a week and I just put it on about 5-10 minutes before I get in the shower and take it off as soon as I get in, then use a gentle cleanser right after that.  Just a little bit goes a long way and the small tube can last me at least 6 months. The Phytomer exfoliant does a great job keeping my skin clear and refreshed.  There are some people who like to try different things all of the time and then there are others who find something that works and stick with it for a really long time.  I&#x27;m the latter.  This is a great product and I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently got went to a spa and got a facial. They used all phytomer products, and my face felt great afterwards. I loved the exfoliant because it was an enzyme exfoliant and not a harsh scrub. I put it on in the shower and the steam helps to clear out impurities. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic.  I use this along with a clarisonic brush for my skin care repertoire.  It really does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference since using this product.  My skin appears clean, bright and fresh. My pores are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for over 10 years!  Very mild yet very effective at clearing your pores.  Very good for your complexion.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product at a spa over 10 years ago.  Still love it and how &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; it makes my skin fee.  This order was also processed so quickly.</li>
            <li> awesome she loves them! I could not find anything like these anywhere else. will be buying more stuff from them</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Purchased at a fancy spa after a facial but will repurchase from amazon. Even if I leave on longer than directed my super fair skin isn&#x27;t irritated at all. I have acne prone skin and credit my recent skin turnaround to this. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder whose smooth skin that is. It may not be a miracle product for everyone but it&#x27;s been awesome for me and totally worth the money. I purchased a couple months ago, use 2-3x/week and still have at least half left. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for 10 years, and it has never failed me. If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating mask, this is it. I use it once a week, and my skin is very soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> This was recommended for my sensitive skin by an aesthetician at a spa. I didn&#x27;t really notice&lt;br /&gt;any improvement but it was fun to try.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week in the shower.  Just a tiny bit goes a long way, so even though it is on the expensive side, it lasts a long time.  The Phytomer Vegetal Exfoliant is part of my skin regiment now.  It smells good, it feels good, and I think it is really helping my skin.</li>
            <li> Simply the best exfoliating mask I ever used. It is very convenient to use and it&#x27;s also very effective.</li>
