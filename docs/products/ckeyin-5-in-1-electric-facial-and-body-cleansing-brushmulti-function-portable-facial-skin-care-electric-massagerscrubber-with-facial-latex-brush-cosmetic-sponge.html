            <li>:)</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>More attachments then needed.</li>
            <li>but after the first 1 week , it is amazing!</li>
            <li>but it actually works very good</li>
            <li>The GOOD NEWS is that the company is Responsible and, They did Credit me for the Unit.  </li>
            <li>I have had a replacement which also broke very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleans your pores from all oil and dirt, perfect if used before bed, skin will improve within less than a week, if used with a cleanser for your face.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind that inconvenience, it would work fine for you.</li>
            <li>This was a cheap buy.</li>
            <li>and I got my face skin so smooth ,reduced wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be cheap and nit work</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this cheap thing.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li>happy with merchandise, but it takes too long to deliver</li>
            <li>my face feels so clean when I use it</li>
            <li>My face is so clean</li>
            <li>Really need a much stronger device for good results to make or notice a difference with or on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like it, works fine, thanks and was delivery before time!!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do anything special more than washing your face with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It is a good product at a low price.</li>
            <li>but the sander for your feet  work poorly overall good for the price i would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li>It works good the only thing</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>So far it pretty good.</li>
            <li>I can do my own facial.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it as soon as I got it, but quickly it stopped working properly.</li>
            <li>I have been using since April first week</li>
            <li>Yes this brush was exactly what I thought it would be..</li>
            <li>I like the many attachments for the facial machine.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this immensely!</li>
            <li>Works OK for facial cleanings</li>
            <li>Love the different attachments.</li>
            <li>Look, I had bought and was not so pleased because it is a smaller unit which means motor can not be large.  </li>
            <li>needs batteries , but other than that, it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>But if you put it on low or off, and just scrub it on your face it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product .</li>
            <li>I faced much issues.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>However I did like the gently feel of both the brush and circle massage attachment, can be bumpy feeling</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over a month now with my own facial wash and my face has never been so soft, clear, or oil free.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great small compact as a face brush and is not too rough on skin</li>
            <li>It works really well on my skin , its cute , small , affordable ,  &amp; arrived ahead of schedule .</li>
            <li>hmm...I was really excited about the brush but its too rough to use on anyone&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and not damaging.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early.</li>
            <li>I like it compact style works so far just might get another</li>
            <li>BUT THE PRODUCT WORKS, SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected but it does the job</li>
            <li>Only 3 stars because the massage attachment is cheap and doesn&#x27;t really do anything and the bristles on the brush are too hard.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!!!</li>
            <li>Much smaller then I expected wasn&#x27;t that powerful eitherðŸ˜§</li>
            <li>Works fine, hard scrub</li>
            <li>Feel like professional facial....</li>
            <li>I have tried several of these electric face scrubbers and none of them really do anything for me, even the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The product was expected of highly, but as soon as I put the battery in, the device turned on.</li>

            <li> it was earlier than expected to be delivered</li>
            <li> when i first used it, i thought that it was too tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> It performs just I expected.  </li>
            <li> if don&#x27;t use carefully though.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, it&#x27;s small and the bristles aren&#x27;t exfoliating enough.</li>
            <li> It cleared up the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Not worth even using since the reason I bought it was for the brush.</li>
            <li> given to my wife as a gift.. however everyone should know, its not water proof, and uses two AA batteries... also, it can bog down when in use..</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for : ( it is so weak and cheap that I&#x27;m giving it to my grandaughter to use on her Big Barbie head/hair style head.</li>
            <li> The box was a little damaged on the sides however it did not affect the product at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These things are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, not impressed totally with this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> So, give it a whirl and the worst case is that it does work and they will make it right.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again, very slow motor...</li>
            <li> This particular one however, was the worst one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered in a terrible condition still haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but will post an update soon of when I do use it</li>

            <li> This was a cheap buy. I didn&#x27;t like how it worked. You get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> So far it pretty good. The bristles are soft and not damaging. There&#x27;s of things in here for your buck.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered in a terrible condition still haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but will post an update soon of when I do use it</li>
            <li> Cleans your pores from all oil and dirt, perfect if used before bed, skin will improve within less than a week, if used with a cleanser for your face.</li>
            <li> It was good&lt;br /&gt;Fastest delivered</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have been using since April first week and I got my face skin so smooth ,reduced wrinkles. I really recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;It irritate your skin</li>
            <li> The product arrived early. The item is as described. The box was a little damaged on the sides however it did not affect the product at all. It is a good product at a low price. I am happy with the transaction however if you buying this item as a gift (as I did) the box may not be in mint condition. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> given to my wife as a gift.. however everyone should know, its not water proof, and uses two AA batteries... also, it can bog down when in use..</li>
            <li> Terrible cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again, very slow motor...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, it&#x27;s small and the bristles aren&#x27;t exfoliating enough. I know its for foot callus I use the buffer for my nails actually and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I like it. I thought it was going to be cheap and nit work well but it actually works very good</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleared up the dark spots on my face. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the brush keeps falling off every now and then. If you don&#x27;t mind that inconvenience, it would work fine for you.</li>
            <li> very nice! excellent and compact for travel</li>
            <li> Grand Daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Waiting to see any results.</li>
            <li> I like it compact style works so far just might get another</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the brush. Not worth even using since the reason I bought it was for the brush. Waist of money</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these electric face scrubbers and none of them really do anything for me, even the more expensive ones. This particular one however, was the worst one I&#x27;ve tried. The brush continuously spins, which caused my skin to become irritated. I only used it once then I tossed it. These things are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best . I can do my own facial. MY skin already show results</li>
            <li> I give a 4 star because it work fairly well but the sander for your feet  work poorly overall good for the price i would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected but it does the job</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to do for your face and body. The attachable are great and I would recommend it to anyone looking for and affordable face brush.</li>
            <li> But daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Wish this had more power.</li>
            <li> Guaranteed to break in two months. I have had a replacement which also broke very quickly. When I took it apart I saw that it had a lot of rust built up on it which contributed to it&#x27;s wear. Keep it in a dry place and maybe it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Works fine, hard scrub</li>
            <li> This is amazing !!!!!!!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> my face feels so clean when I use it</li>
            <li> Definitely does wonders to my pore.</li>
            <li> just a waste of money.  doesn&#x27;t really do anything special more than washing your face with soap and water.</li>
            <li> happy with merchandise, but it takes too long to deliver</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great small compact as a face brush and is not too rough on skin and it should also come with a body brush</li>
            <li> Awesome product I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeee it&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing.. Feel like professional facial....&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think like this..it is just awesome...</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m using it I fell 2 times and still serves</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works really well on my skin , its cute , small , affordable ,  &amp; arrived ahead of schedule .</li>
            <li> Its very good. I like it</li>
            <li> this is a good product and good quality.  It performs just I expected.  The price was wonderful especially for all the attachments</li>
            <li> I just bought this product, I like it and it works perfectly the only problem is it can&#x27;t be turned off, you put the batteries inside and it starts working.</li>
            <li> Product is not working some times and getting stopped in middle. Please think twice before purchasing product. I faced much issues.</li>
            <li> I love it! its perfect to massage and wash, my face and neck</li>
            <li> hmm...I was really excited about the brush but its too rough to use on anyone&#x27;s face. Trust me it just leaves ur face all scratched up. Don&#x27;t buy this cheap thing. Better to buy an expensive brush</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and would recommend</li>
            <li> Yes this brush was exactly what I thought it would be..It&#x27;s good for non shower washing since it&#x27;s not waterproof</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. I opened the box and it fell apart..</li>
            <li> Very good! I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!!! My face is so clean and already I can see blemishes clearing up. I wish it were waterproof though.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time last night. works very well.</li>
            <li> It works good the only thing it&#x27;s that the box was open...</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dirt. Only worked for about two weeks. Cheaply made. Not water resistant. Head keeps falling off. Will sometimes not work. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The brush hurt my face</li>
            <li> I love this so much it made a huge difference to my skin!!:) my husband won&#x27;t take his hands off me!!:)</li>
            <li> I like the many attachments for the facial machine.  Thanks for a nice product</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for : ( it is so weak and cheap that I&#x27;m giving it to my grandaughter to use on her Big Barbie head/hair style head.</li>
            <li> THE BOXES ARRIVED DAMAGED BUT THE PRODUCT WORKS, SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Kinda hurts the cheeks, it cleans though but the box was all bent up and open and the instructions were in chinese... should probably note that product is chinese...</li>
            <li> Perfect shape when it arrived! I have no problems with it and I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now. It works really great for the price!!</li>
            <li> Look, I had bought and was not so pleased because it is a smaller unit which means motor can not be large.  Hence, you will not get a ton of power and, have a glitch where as the batteries do not engage the power (sometimes have to press on batteries).  The GOOD NEWS is that the company is Responsible and, They did Credit me for the Unit.  With that said, I will be buying another because at the end of the day, It did not cost me shipping either.  So, give it a whirl and the worst case is that it does work and they will make it right.</li>
            <li> The product was expected of highly, but as soon as I put the battery in, the device turned on. So basically I&#x27;m wasting my money because I have to keep buying batteries for the cleanser since it DOES NOT turn off. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for 2 weeks already and my skin is getting better then before</li>
            <li> this is acceptable for the price</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it day and night. Rinse it off when your face is completed. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. I have been using it for a little over a month now with my own facial wash and my face has never been so soft, clear, or oil free. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is awesome it was earlier than expected to be delivered</li>
            <li> I love it, very good quality, shipping to fast</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this immensely!</li>
            <li> Works OK for facial cleanings</li>
            <li> great price and great for facial massages</li>
            <li> I like it, works fine, thanks and was delivery before time!! thanks</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, not impressed totally with this product. However I did like the gently feel of both the brush and circle massage attachment, can be bumpy feeling if don&#x27;t use carefully though. Really need a much stronger device for good results to make or notice a difference with or on your skin.</li>
            <li> It stop working one month after I got it</li>
            <li> As see on tv product. Don&#x27;t buy. Mine were all defective.</li>
            <li> Overall l like the product. More attachments then needed. Only 3 stars because the massage attachment is cheap and doesn&#x27;t really do anything and the bristles on the brush are too hard.</li>
            <li> Much smaller then I expected wasn&#x27;t that powerful eitherðŸ˜§</li>
            <li> The instructions are in Japanese/Chinese.  I do not read either language.</li>
            <li> needs batteries , but other than that, it is an amazing product. when i first used it, i thought that it was too tough on my skin. but after the first 1 week , it is amazing! it leaves my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the different attachments. Directions are not in english so dont know what attachmrnts do. But I still use them all.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it as soon as I got it, but quickly it stopped working properly. But I is a good cleanser for the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> Works good  no complaints</li>
            <li> Worked great, happy with the purchase. Took along time to arrive though.</li>
            <li> Well to start I use it on my face, and when I would use the one that looks like a brush the one with the bristles. I HURTS my face! Like it would rub me. But if you put it on low or off, and just scrub it on your face it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I received it in time, but it doesn&#x27;t work. I waited for this and now I have to send it back. Do not by this, go buy something else.</li>
