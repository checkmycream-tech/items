            <li>It has quality ingredients and leaves my skin feeling super CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>i love it, my face skin is smooth already after first use.</li>
            <li>and the whole process was very easy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Best facial mask I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This all natural mask is certainly a great one to try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The price is great as well considering that the ingredients are of such high quality.</li>
            <li>This mask seems soft and nice at first, but once it dries up, it makes your skin itchy and gives you a rash even after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread and ready to use, unlike some masks where you have to mix powder with water.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask works great.</li>
            <li>Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin was hydrated and felt really fresh.</li>
            <li>Received this mud mask and had to try it right away .</li>
            <li>Spreads evenly, rinses cleanly and doesn&#x27;t hold much of a smell.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work my skin pile of on the first used.</li>
            <li>This mask makes my skin feels so soft and smooth and my pores practically disappear.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised after using this mask that my skin felt very clean, clear and healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m young so looks are important to me haha).</li>
            <li>I kept it in my closet, dark cool place until I was able to use it.</li>
            <li>It dried fairly quickly, and I found it very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>it helps tremendously with rosacea on my nose &amp; chin and adult acne on my jawline.</li>
            <li>And most of the dry skin is gone from my face.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Its too gel like, very slippery to put on the face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It burned the absolute hell out of my face.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my skincare.</li>
            <li>After I finished I could really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I used this mask a few times already and am loving it.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased at how well the mud mask spread, and not too long after I finished spreading I could feel it starting to work.</li>
            <li>Pores are clean and smaller.</li>
            <li>First of all, you know that you are putting all natural ingredients on your face.</li>
            <li>I find my skin tends to suffer due to this, so an effective mask is crucial to keep up with my appearance</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>Wow it left my  face and skin feeling so clean and moisturized and soft .</li>
            <li>First, I made the mistake of using this two days in a row- use it sparingly and only once a week.  </li>
            <li>so I like to keep my face glowing by using natural products.</li>
            <li>Can feel the aloe and a soft brown texture.</li>
            <li>I was sent a trial of TierraPure and decided to use it early one morning before a shower.</li>
            <li>I did not only use it on my face but also my whole body .</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have -mildly- sensitive skin, but nothing has ever caused a reaction like this before.</li>
            <li>Waste of money... don&#x27;t see any significant change to the skin complexion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your daily skincare use.</li>
            <li>The dullness of old dead skin seems to disappear right off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several masks before, including some mint and avocado masks, and the extent to which they cleansed and purified my skin was nowhere near what TierraPure managed to do.</li>
            <li>but apparently it can.  </li>
            <li>I am a 19 year old male, and my face is constantly being covered in sweat from working out, playing sports, and a pressured environment at my job.</li>

            <li> Completely removes the dead and dull skin to reveal a natural glow.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product and found little white mold on the mud.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt while it was on, it only itched a little, but my face felt on fire when I took it off.</li>
            <li> Had facial party with my sisters and applied this dead sea mask.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 20 minutes until it was completely dried.</li>
            <li> I patted it dry and then applied the mask over my face and down my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached the picture, its a small white dot and you can see the consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other muds</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it just got it today, opened it and looks half empty</li>
            <li> Does not clean up blackheads.</li>
            <li> It does tingle a little when I put it one but stops after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought another product that had dead sea mud mask but the price went up</li>
            <li> I would say sample a small patch of your hair and see how you react.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the past month and have not seen any improvement in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff. :(</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding masks that do not break my face out or irritate it.</li>
            <li> you do NOT have to layer this mask on thick.</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer all over my face, neck and decollete.</li>
            <li> Just a thin brosh on works wonders.</li>
            <li> I just used a thin coat.</li>
            <li> After stepping out of the shower (with the mask fully washed off), I was amazed to see my skin appear and feel cleansed and purified in a way i had not experienced before!</li>
            <li> My skin was glowing afterwards, it removed all the bad toxins and cleared my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it went bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love... Love... Love this mask! it helps tremendously with rosacea on my nose &amp; chin and adult acne on my jawline. I put on a thin layer all over my face, neck and decollete. In 10 minutes it washes off with a silky smoothness. I can see a visible difference in my pores and neck skin tightness. This mask does not sting, never any redness, nor irritation to my eyes. It&#x27;s the perfect gentle mask that I can use as often as I feel.</li>
            <li> This mask seems soft and nice at first, but once it dries up, it makes your skin itchy and gives you a rash even after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I have had better masks I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest issue I have is the texture. Its too gel like, very slippery to put on the face.</li>
            <li> Love the mask. Feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ---&lt;br /&gt;Wow...FAB product. Filled with the good stuff. One reminder..you do NOT have to layer this mask on thick. Just a thin brosh on works wonders. Wait 10 min or more..and wrap a warm towel around the face. Wipe clean!!</li>
            <li> Very good product and conforms to specifications and seller fast handling and confident and very suitable prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an organic mud musk for a while and I&#x27;m so glad to have made this purchase! This is truly the best mud mask i&#x27;ve ever used. First of all, you know that you are putting all natural ingredients on your face. Moreover, the mask feels amazing after you wash it off. Completely removes the dead and dull skin to reveal a natural glow. I don&#x27;t like to use any cosmetics so I like to keep my face glowing by using natural products. If you&#x27;re like me, you will absolutely love this! The price is great as well considering that the ingredients are of such high quality. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So I used this at the advice of a friend, and I am so glad I did.  The results were instant, a mini facelift, if you will.  The dullness of old dead skin seems to disappear right off.  Ultimate way to pamper yourself and look good as a result!</li>
            <li> Had facial party with my sisters and applied this dead sea mask. Can feel the aloe and a soft brown texture. Dries into a nice mask. Skin feels clean and exfoliated afterward! It&#x27;s easy to spread and ready to use, unlike some masks where you have to mix powder with water.</li>
            <li> Best facial mask I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with the results I got from this Mud Mask.  My skin was glowing afterwards, it removed all the bad toxins and cleared my skin.  Really impressed with the size of the container.  Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Almost ordered this product, and then I realized almost all the reviews don&#x27;t seem to be legit? check most reviewers&#x27; profiles out and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about. Product may be good, I don&#x27;t know, but the gamed reviews don&#x27;t inspire faith. I&#x27;ll wait for some genuine reviews before I order this product.</li>
            <li> I used this mask a few times already and am loving it.  First, I made the mistake of using this two days in a row- use it sparingly and only once a week.  Since I changed up my routine it has been perfect.  Spreads evenly, rinses cleanly and doesn&#x27;t hold much of a smell. It has quality ingredients and leaves my skin feeling super CLEAN!  It tightens on your skin and you can just feel it working.  This all natural mask is certainly a great one to try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product love it</li>
            <li> I had to return this item. I had tingling feeling when I applied it on my face. Does not clean up blackheads.</li>
            <li> Dries up well not like some others that say they do.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it just got it today, opened it and looks half empty 😤</li>

I have used the product several times since, and I&#x27;ve found that my skin glows and my acne subsides with every use. I wholeheartedly recommend this product, as I will continue to use it routinely and/or whenever needed.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask works great. Skin looks and feels softer healthier then before use. Pores are clean and smaller. Skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> Seems to tighten everything up and feels like I just went to a salon for a wonderful treatment.&lt;br /&gt;You can actually feel it drawing out the junk that has collected in your pores.</li>
            <li> I order two for best price but it doesn&#x27;t work my skin pile of on the first used.</li>
            <li> Waste of money... don&#x27;t see any significant change to the skin complexion.</li>
            <li> i love it, my face skin is smooth already after first use. i recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and my hair feel and looks amazing. I would say sample a small patch of your hair and see how you react. For me I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s better than bentonite clay and Rhassoul clay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to use this product. I kept it in my closet, dark cool place until I was able to use it. I bought another product that had dead sea mud mask but the price went up so I decided to use this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product and found little white mold on the mud. It didn&#x27;t even look like mud, it looked kind of jelly looking. I&#x27;m guessing it went bad. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious enough to refund my money. I don&#x27;t even know how this can happen to mud but apparently it can.  Will never buy from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached the picture, its a small white dot and you can see the consistency. I&#x27;ve bought other muds and it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> Received this mud mask and had to try it right away . Wow it left my  face and skin feeling so clean and moisturized and soft . I did not only use it on my face but also my whole body . I am in love . Thank you .  I do recommend this mud mask .</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, never again. I tried this as soon as it was delivered. I was so excited. It burned the absolute hell out of my face. I looked like I had baked in the sun for 6 hours. It didn&#x27;t hurt while it was on, it only itched a little, but my face felt on fire when I took it off. Wow. My face was actually radiating heat. I have -mildly- sensitive skin, but nothing has ever caused a reaction like this before. I gave it two stars because it has 0 smell, which I like. and the whole process was very easy. And most of the dry skin is gone from my face. I really wanted to like this stuff. :(</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my skincare. I have normal to oily skin and if you do, then this is the mask for you to try. I have a hard time finding masks that do not break my face out or irritate it. I was very surprised after using this mask that my skin felt very clean, clear and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;To use this I washed my face to remove any dirt. I patted it dry and then applied the mask over my face and down my neck. I just used a thin coat. I left it on for 20 minutes until it was completely dried. I then washed it off with warm water and removed the remaining mask with a wash cloth. After I finished I could really see a difference in my skin. It looked brighter and it felt amazing. My skin was hydrated and felt really fresh. I now use this twice a week. I highly recommend this product for your daily skincare use.</li>
            <li> Nothing great. Have been using this for the past month and have not seen any improvement in how my skin looks. It does tingle a little when I put it one but stops after a couple of minutes. I was hoping it would help me with the blackheads and some acne but it hasn&#x27;t. I will finish this jar because i like that it&#x27;s organic but will not purchase again because of lack of results.</li>
            <li> This mask makes my skin feels so soft and smooth and my pores practically disappear.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels so good on your face. Very soothing and relaxing. Leaves my face feeling very soft and fresh. I definitely recommend this mask!</li>
