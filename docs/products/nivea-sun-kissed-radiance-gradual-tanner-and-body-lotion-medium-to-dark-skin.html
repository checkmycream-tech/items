            <li>This product gives me a nice tan look in the winter</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin as soft and well-conditioned as the best moisturizers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells very tropical, kind of citrusy,and it honestly smells just like one of my lotions!</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li>Not orange at all :)</li>
            <li>so I bought this product to give a more youthful appearance to my hands and face...to give me a glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used that one more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the price of my favorite [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love , love , love</li>
            <li>This product is a godsend, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>There are many self-tanning products, but, this one is one of the nicest, for any price, that I have used, so, I&#x27;m thrilled that something, so reasonably priced, is this effective.</li>
            <li>If you go with a light application for several days I think you will accieve the results you are looking for...a great looking tan!!</li>
            <li>the smell is light and seems okay to me.</li>
            <li>Feels Good, Works amazingly and above</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is strong though.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner that didn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>it looked healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get excited about this product.</li>
            <li>The lighter version didn&#x27;t give me much of a tone but medium to dark is perfect.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like a full body massage for yourself.</li>
            <li>I bought Nivea hoping that something with a good name will work but after 2 times of applying it on my legs I saw brown stripes and white spots.</li>
            <li>I love this gentle tanner.  </li>
            <li>I suggest getting the Medium to dark whether you&#x27;re fair skinned or otherwise, because I think it shows up better.</li>
            <li>came quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>It leaves a little shimmer on your skin when you go in the sun and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>so I could get results more like my natural tan.</li>
            <li>nice a is the only lotion that didn&#x27;t turn me orange.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>First of all, it is by NIVEA, so, it&#x27;s first and foremost, a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but right now (feb)</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on how nice I look tan, that I would buy this if it was double the low price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product in the hopes that the odor would not be as strong as most other sun-less tanning creams.  </li>
            <li>It does not take very much so</li>
            <li>Just gives a nice little bit of color to legs and arms which is nice especially when living in Minnesota and</li>
            <li>This you can use as a  moisturizer and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Takes a while longer to darker than I hoped but it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I put it on yesterday afternoon, and this morning I woke up looking pretty tan.</li>
            <li>It does not streak, which is my first concern.  </li>
            <li>However, after a few days of using it, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This seems to make it less apt to streak.</li>
            <li>this product is nice because it has a great smell and gives me a natural tan without staining my fingers too badly.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of work rubbing it in really well</li>
            <li>This one, not so much.</li>
            <li>Self-tanner is just not an item I can see spending much on, so I tried the Nivea.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get the light to medium because I wanted an actual TAN, as well as a glow.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my face, which is very prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I bought this product not hoping for much</li>
            <li>but it is better than I could have expected.</li>
            <li>The powdery smell is a bit much sometimes...</li>
            <li>considering I don&#x27;t go to the beach much or hang out in the sun.</li>
            <li>it really moisturizes your skin and leaves</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, even and consistent sun-less tanner (although takes a while to show) and has a nice smell versus other products such as Jergens Natural Glow which smells a little bit like chemicals.</li>
            <li>I got the fair-to-medium because I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t get too dark or go orange.  </li>
            <li>I have a couple of dark patches on my arm, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my fault for not spreading it evenly.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it will do - build a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Pretty much seemed like a regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first fake tan product I have used in 10 years, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what I&#x27;m doing differently</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a glow, makes it smooth, and also leaves a slight glimmer in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I love the tan it gave me and it had only a slight &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell that no one else noticed except me.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the color, not either particularly flattering or strong to start with even after repeated applications, fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>B0017T398S Sublime Bronze - Gradual Self Tanning Lotion, 6.7 Oz., (L&#x27;oreal)]] went up considerably.</li>
            <li>natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I saw results within a week and it looked so natural -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost afraid to put that much more on, which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li>I have only used ths product for about 4 days leaves my skin very soft and looks tan.</li>
            <li>But after that, but the &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>And it is very greasy, it is not absorbing.</li>
            <li>But be careful how much you put on, because this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li>For me, one application was dark enough and it is lasting pretty well!  </li>
            <li>The other thing is that it smells good for about 3 hours before the \\&quot;fake</li>
            <li>The color is exceptionally natural and long lasting, Thank you Nivea!!</li>
            <li>It smells a bit funky too, but at least that fades fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li>Why pay three to four times more when there is a product that is this nice, that leaves your skin soft, golden-colored, and without any unpleasant streaks, smell or weird color?</li>

            <li> B0017T398S Sublime Bronze - Gradual Self Tanning Lotion, 6.7 Oz., (L&#x27;oreal)]] went up considerably.</li>
            <li> natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a week and it looked so natural -</li>

            <li> The color is exceptionally natural and long lasting, Thank you Nivea!!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit funky too, but at least that fades fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li> Why pay three to four times more when there is a product that is this nice, that leaves your skin soft, golden-colored, and without any unpleasant streaks, smell or weird color?</li>
            <li> After reading/watching about 50% negative reviews, I was pretty discouraged about buying this item.</li>
            <li> only down-side for me with this product is that it feels like it takes forever to dry, which could be problematic if you want to get to bed or out the door already!  </li>
            <li> Takes about 10 min to dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to get a deep dark tan from this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only slightly darker on my arms than I was when I started.</li>
            <li> And I am not particular when putting it on</li>
            <li> I missed a few spots that I tried to fix with a second application that didn&#x27;t quite work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works slowly but looks really natural.</li>
            <li> Not the other Jergins one with firming.  </li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve had other gradual tanners even streak in my cuticles - this one doesn&#x27;t.)  </li>
            <li> I like the Jergins one too with the sunscreen dark.</li>
            <li> As a tanner, it&#x27;s not worth buying.</li>
            <li> so I bought the medium to dark skin with my two dollar off coupon</li>
            <li> I use the medium to dark and mix it with lotion before I apply.</li>
            <li> But it does give you a little bit of a glow.  </li>
            <li> little pricey</li>
            <li> I am a very pale gal but have been using the medium-to-dark shades in self-tanners because they work faster (and you can always tone down a too-dark shade by mixing in a little hand lotion).</li>
            <li> I am as pale as I get</li>
            <li> skin looks like the belly of a dead fish in the winter!  </li>
            <li> Long story short, they all look horrible after 1-3 days and your left with uneven color.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to lay out in the sun to get a tan, but, i live in Florida, where if you&#x27;re very pale, people think you&#x27;re sick.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> It is a gradual process, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that horrible orange-y look, but, a subtle, but, noticeably golden color and almost a glow.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any streaking...</li>
            <li> So I took off 1 star for the initial smell, but didn&#x27;t rank lower than that because of the color.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after a few minutes, this cream stinks as badly as the rest.</li>
            <li> I use it 3-4x a week and can maintain some color in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Not that crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> It smells bad also.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never gotten streaks, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, and I have never had a greasy feeling.</li>

            <li> I have been using Nivea products for over 15 years. Great color. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes that the odor would not be as strong as most other sun-less tanning creams.  Sadly, after a few minutes, this cream stinks as badly as the rest.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to even out my tan.  It&#x27;s the first fake tan product I have used in 10 years, and I love it!  I got the fair-to-medium because I wanted to make sure I didn&#x27;t get too dark or go orange.  I have not experienced any streaking... it helps if you apply the lotion in a circular motion.  For me, one application was dark enough and it is lasting pretty well!  I missed a few spots that I tried to fix with a second application that didn&#x27;t quite work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side for me with this product is that it feels like it takes forever to dry, which could be problematic if you want to get to bed or out the door already!  The other thing is that it smells good for about 3 hours before the \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; smell makes it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it a lot, and it gives me the tan I like!  Not orange at all :)</li>
            <li> After reading/watching about 50% negative reviews, I was pretty discouraged about buying this item. However, after a few days of using it, I am very pleased with this product. I get a good tan in the summer but right now (feb) I am as pale as I get and so I opted for the med-dark color so I could get results more like my natural tan. It takes a lot of work rubbing it in really well but it&#x27;s like a full body massage for yourself. Takes about 10 min to dry. The only downside is that it literally smells like glue when you put it on. But after that, but the &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell is barely noticeable. I spend the night with my boyfriend a lot and he hasn&#x27;t even noticed. So I took off 1 star for the initial smell, but didn&#x27;t rank lower than that because of the color.</li>
            <li> came quickly and well wrapped. this product is nice because it has a great smell and gives me a natural tan without staining my fingers too badly.</li>
            <li> Not getting any younger so I bought this product to give a more youthful appearance to my hands and face...to give me a glow. For whatever reason I decided to place the excess from my hands in my hair...in about a week people were asking what I had done to my hair...if I put highlights in it or something. The excess cream I place in my hair gives it that summer-look I used to get when we&#x27;d go on vacation to the coast. Cool off-label application!!!</li>
            <li> This you can use as a  moisturizer and it works pretty well. It smells good and you don&#x27;t feel like you are putting a tanner on.  IT&#x27;s not too thick. But it does give you a little bit of a glow.  It&#x27;s white in color.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far. I like the Jergins one too with the sunscreen dark. Not the other Jergins one with firming.  I&#x27;ve used that one more.  I&amp;#34;ll bee using this one now since I ran out of Jergins.  I do like this. I don&#x27;t think it is strong though. I can feel the Jergins working when I put it on. This one, not so much.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;gradual tanner and lotion&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks - sometimes twice a day- and I&#x27;m only slightly darker on my arms than I was when I started. It hasn&#x27;t changed the color of my face or torso. My legs are still pasty white. As a lotion, it sits on your skins and takes a while to soak in. As a tanner, it&#x27;s not worth buying. The only plus side is that it hasn&#x27;t stained any of my shirts or towels.</li>
            <li> I bought Nivea hoping that something with a good name will work but after 2 times of applying it on my legs I saw brown stripes and white spots. It smells bad also. And it is very greasy, it is not absorbing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used it all....nice a is the only lotion that didn&#x27;t turn me orange. I use it all the time I just slap it on. No orange on knees or elbows....little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it not being orange</li>
            <li> I love the tan it gave me and it had only a slight &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell that no one else noticed except me. Would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the price of my favorite [[ASIN:B0017T398S Sublime Bronze - Gradual Self Tanning Lotion, 6.7 Oz., (L&#x27;oreal)]] went up considerably. Self-tanner is just not an item I can see spending much on, so I tried the Nivea. I am a very pale gal but have been using the medium-to-dark shades in self-tanners because they work faster (and you can always tone down a too-dark shade by mixing in a little hand lotion). Sadly, the color, not either particularly flattering or strong to start with even after repeated applications, fades quickly. It smells a bit funky too, but at least that fades fairly quickly too. I just can&#x27;t get excited about this product. Won&#x27;t buy again. Continue to haunt the L&#x27;Oreal listing with the dream it&#x27;ll become affordable again. Sigh.</li>
            <li> Takes a while longer to darker than I hoped but it works pretty well and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY fair skinned, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about this lotion, but it&#x27;s working! I didn&#x27;t want to get the light to medium because I wanted an actual TAN, as well as a glow. I have a couple of dark patches on my arm, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s my fault for not spreading it evenly. It works very well on my face, which is very prone to breakouts. It smells very tropical, kind of citrusy,and it honestly smells just like one of my lotions! I suggest getting the Medium to dark whether you&#x27;re fair skinned or otherwise, because I think it shows up better. But be careful how much you put on, because this stuff WORKS. I put it on yesterday afternoon, and this morning I woke up looking pretty tan. I&#x27;m almost afraid to put that much more on, which is kinda cool. I highly recommend this product!! :D</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does not streak, which is my first concern.  And I am not particular when putting it on (i&#x27;ve had other gradual tanners even streak in my cuticles - this one doesn&#x27;t.)  It smells divinely!!!  It gives your skin a glow, makes it smooth, and also leaves a slight glimmer in the sun.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from department store brands to grocery store brands, and this is my fav.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle tanner.  One that you can use daily and not get those streaks or lines.  Good moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, even and consistent sun-less tanner (although takes a while to show) and has a nice smell versus other products such as Jergens Natural Glow which smells a little bit like chemicals.</li>
            <li> My skin is already a lighter brown but I like to have that tanned look so I bought the medium to dark skin with my two dollar off coupon and I like this lotion! I don&#x27;t know exactly what I&#x27;m doing differently but I&#x27;ve never gotten streaks, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, and I have never had a greasy feeling. It leaves a little shimmer on your skin when you go in the sun and my skin looks great. I&#x27;d definitely give it a shot if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several self tanning lotions and most either looked fake or streaky. Because this is gradual, it gives you color but no streaking if you aren&#x27;t perfectly even in applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural looking color. The lighter version didn&#x27;t give me much of a tone but medium to dark is perfect. I use it 3-4x a week and can maintain some color in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Not that crazy about the scent so I apply it at night before bed and then shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have only used ths product for about 4 days leaves my skin very soft and looks tan. I love , love , love it will continue to use this product !</li>
            <li> I bought this product not hoping for much but it is better than I could have expected. Never used a self tanning product before but I was looking for a product that wouldnt streak or leave me looking orangey. It gave me a sun kissed look that I was hoping for. Very fair skinned I bought the medium to tan and loved the results. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This Smells good, Feels Good, Works amazingly and above all its NIVEA!! Love you guys!! Will buy Again and Again!!</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it will do - build a natural looking tan. I saw results within a week and it looked so natural - even my boyfriend commented on it. The powdery smell is a bit much sometimes... but I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner that didn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of moisturizer on my legs during the summer and it feels and looks great. My skin is medium fair and this makes it look like I&#x27;ve got a fair bit of sun considering I don&#x27;t go to the beach much or hang out in the sun. Don&#x27;t expect to get a deep dark tan from this. It just gives a nice glow. Never any streaks I can see and the smell is light and seems okay to me.</li>
            <li> There are many self-tanning products, but, this one is one of the nicest, for any price, that I have used, so, I&#x27;m thrilled that something, so reasonably priced, is this effective. First of all, it is by NIVEA, so, it&#x27;s first and foremost, a fantastic moisturizer. It leaves the skin as soft and well-conditioned as the best moisturizers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a tanner, it&#x27;s amazing. It is a gradual process, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that horrible orange-y look, but, a subtle, but, noticeably golden color and almost a glow. I have gotten so many compliments on how nice I look tan, that I would buy this if it was double the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to lay out in the sun to get a tan, but, i live in Florida, where if you&#x27;re very pale, people think you&#x27;re sick. This product is a godsend, and I love it. I would very highly recommend this great product. Why pay three to four times more when there is a product that is this nice, that leaves your skin soft, golden-colored, and without any unpleasant streaks, smell or weird color?</li>
            <li> This lotion works as good as promised.  Just gives a nice little bit of color to legs and arms which is nice especially when living in Minnesota and skin looks like the belly of a dead fish in the winter!  It goes on nice, has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t get orange.  I really love it!</li>
            <li> This product gives me a nice tan look in the winter and I love it. It works slowly but looks really natural. I use the medium to dark and mix it with lotion before I apply. This seems to make it less apt to streak. It does not take very much so if you over apply you will experience to problems others have mentioned. If you go with a light application for several days I think you will accieve the results you are looking for...a great looking tan!!</li>
            <li> Pretty much seemed like a regular lotion.  I applied it three days in a row and didn&#x27;t get any noticeable color.  The scent is a bit tanner-ish.</li>
            <li> I have tried tanning beds, airbrush tans, mystic tans and the most expensive tanning lotions from Sephora you could buy. Long story short, they all look horrible after 1-3 days and your left with uneven color. Not this lotion...it really moisturizes your skin and leaves it looked healthy and fresh. The color is exceptionally natural and long lasting, Thank you Nivea!!</li>
