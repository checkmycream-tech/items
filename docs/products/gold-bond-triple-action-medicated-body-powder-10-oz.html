            <li>Love the stuff!</li>
            <li>Gold Bond is consistently the best answer to any powder needs.  </li>
            <li>This powder is amazing.</li>
            <li>I tried the Gold Bond powder hoping that it would be as good and more convenient to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It works at a good price - what more can I ask.</li>

            <li>It also has a really nice menthol smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Great for moisture and odor control, specially in a south Texas summer.</li>
            <li>Great for the summer, or right after the shower!  </li>
            <li>great between the legs on warm hot sweaty days.  </li>
            <li>Amazing that this stuff has been around since about 1907 or 1903 and is still a favorite of many...</li>
            <li>the summer, I also sprinkled it on top of mosquito bites, and it eliminated the itching almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Living in the humid south, it&#x27;s as important in dressing as deodorant!</li>
            <li>I like being able repurchase this &amp;#34;bundled&amp;#34; package.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been a life saver (well, that is an exaggeration for sure, but it has relived a lot of pain and discomfort over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I love this product and cannot remember a time that I was without it.  </li>
            <li>put a healthy dash of Gold Bond in your boat shoes every day you&#x27;re gonna wear them, just before you&#x27;re gonna wear them, and shake &#x27;em around a bit.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love, it&#x27;s Gold Bond.  </li>
            <li>On Prime, this product saved me a trip of many blocks in NYC to get a refill.&lt;br /&gt;-David Allen</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Gold bond powder works better than any thing else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love shopping with</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>But this stuff would be noticeable for up to an hour and more.</li>
            <li>What man doesn&#x27;t love Gold Bond powder?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Bond works noticeably better than the alternative.  </li>
            <li>Buy it and be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect makes it that much better.</li>
            <li>I know I love this product because if god-forbid I forget to use it in my morning rush to work, I know within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love wearing no socks in the summer.</li>
            <li>I also love how your feet feel freer in the shoe.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I have used this powder in many places and it works :)</li>
            <li>This product works just fine and is a more affordable product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is obviously gentle on skin since it has so many healing properties, which is perfect for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product relives the pain, itching and soreness and prevents it from becoming worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps you nice and fresh and fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>Nice during hot summers.</li>
            <li>The Gold Bond Powder comes in a nice, large size.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a huge con container of it.</li>
            <li>This Gold Bond powder always does a fantastic job to soothe sweaty areas...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how important it</li>
            <li>She actually loves getting this applied to her tummy, and happily rolls over to have it put on.</li>
            <li>What works best for me is plain talc with 5% zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>It most certainly has a soothing effect and most certainly has preventive powers.  </li>
            <li>Price here on Amazon is good as well, one bottle last me quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting the cooling effect you get from protex ice cool that I used in thailand.</li>
            <li>This product is not only a great price, but it works so good if you need to keep your skin cool and keeps down rashing caused by heat.</li>
            <li>A great product for soothing chaffing, dryness and other mild skin disorders</li>
            <li>It created mild rashes and stung my skin a bit.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great for keeping your feet dry and, frankly,for keeping your scrotum from sticking to your skin in the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m sure that played a part in it, but I couldn&#x27;t continue to use this.</li>
            <li>this is the first product that has truly soothed my bottom&amp;#34;  CAROL HAMHAM!</li>
            <li>and I find that through hot days and workouts, this stuff keeps everything fresh!</li>
            <li>I like it over the spray and fresh balls.</li>
            <li>RARELY BREATHES</li>
            <li>Definitely worth make the purchase.</li>
            <li>Kind of a regular supply item.  </li>
            <li>And if you have any kind of rash, dermatitis, psoriasis, this &amp;quot;medicated&amp;quot; powder isn&#x27;t going to soothe, it&#x27;s only going to sting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right stuff.</li>
            <li>It stopped my itching  right away.</li>
            <li>When I get time or after a days work the cool soothing powder is absolutely relieving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I also find Gold Bond Powder to be quite effective for minor breakouts of poison ivy and chigger bites as it relives the itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps you dry and nice</li>
            <li>Zesorb was a little bit more effective at treating any yeast problems, which can co-exist with other skin conditions, but for psoriasis I ended using coal tar treatments which work better for me than Gold Bond.</li>
            <li>Very Nice Body Powder, helps keep me cool and dry all day long!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wear shoes without socks more than three times before people refuse to get within 10 feet of you, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and no, 10 oz is not too much!</li>
            <li>This is my first chance trying Gold Bond powder</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Keeps you cool and fresh in a very humid environment like New Orleans.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t put near your privates as the cool may burn your testicles</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and feeling great all day long!</li>
            <li>However it is a very fine powder and it drifts and scatters everywhere no matter how careful you are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll estimate I&#x27;ve worn my current pair sockless about 400-500 days, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Fine powder, not at all coarse or clumpy.</li>
            <li>I started using this powder when I was a kid and was very involved in sports.  </li>
            <li>While serving in the heat of the Far East quite a number of years ago, this stuff was worth its weight in gold...</li>
            <li>Bought baby powder instead, and that was much easier on the whole area.</li>
            <li>Very cooling.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>AS MUCH</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really take care of the itching I have on my feet.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gold Bond for coming into my life</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Smells very &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>far better to have a hint of medicine about you than to be constantly scratching your groin \\&quot;area\\&quot; and thighs in public!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slight, but pleasant, medicinal odor (only someone intimately close may notice).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it on other area&#x27;s of the body, because it was just too noticeable after</li>
            <li>: It is really easy to apply too much, so I suggest not fully opening the cap (so the holes are still partially covered).</li>
            <li>If you have amazon prime, go ahead and order online, but if not you can probably get this product cheaper or for the same price at many local stores.</li>
            <li>I grew older the football and baseball</li>
            <li>Gold Bond Body Powder has been around a long time, it seriously is one of the best (old standbys) as far as body powder goes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and while other people might enjoy the &amp;#34;cooling sensation,&amp;#34; it was a real put off for me.</li>
            <li>OK, so there are just some things one does not talk about in public, such as moister and sweating that leads to itching and scratching, that could lead to some funny looks in public.</li>
            <li>It clears up minor skin infections and irritations better than the (possibly harmful) meds your MD will prescribe.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this stuff now, and it&#x27;s nice to have an option to get it without trucking down to the store.</li>
            <li>This is no ordinary powder.</li>
            <li>I started using it on my feet, and it works pretty well, but they have a specific powder just for that.</li>
            <li>My first minibox of this bodypowder I bougt on central station in Chicago.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and fresh where you need it.  </li>
            <li>can only speak here for guys but playing football, baseball on hot summer days, running track events can and does cause major chaffing and itching in the groin area and thighs and when it comes to biking; your hind quarters.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the Gold Bond products make my skin red and very itchy.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, this worked REALLY well on my face, even though your face is one of the last places you would think to apply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just sprinkle some of it directly onto my kabuki brush and apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>I am an adult wearing briefs in a nursing home, I have IBS</li>
            <li>I am completely sold forever on this product.</li>
            <li>WOW within minutes the itching is gone.</li>
            <li>He says it completely eliminates the itching from heat rash, doesn&#x27;t clump, but does stay put.</li>
            <li>My dog has sensitive skin and allergies, and she develops rashes/sores on her tummy.</li>
            <li>Leaves your junk dry and keeps it from smelling like fast food.</li>
            <li>good product ill try the xtra strength next time thou.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t do a lot of sports, and I don&#x27;t have major sweat or chaffing problems.</li>
            <li>When the weather is hot, we need it to heal our rashes; when the weather is cold, we put on more clothes and we need our Gold Bond then.  </li>
            <li>This is the gold standard in body powders, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I bought a low price generic knockoff body powder also in a yellow plastic bottle from my local drug store knowing that the list of ingredients was mostly the same but not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample travel size bottle of this powder with a coupon a few months ago, and my little bottle is still going even after using it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One ingredient in Gold Bond Original Strength Body Powder is missing in the alternative that costs 25% less.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;I also find Gold Bond Powder to be quite effective for minor breakouts of poison ivy and chigger bites as it relives the itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> keeps you dry and nice</li>
            <li> Zesorb was a little bit more effective at treating any yeast problems, which can co-exist with other skin conditions, but for psoriasis I ended using coal tar treatments which work better for me than Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Body Powder, helps keep me cool and dry all day long!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wear shoes without socks more than three times before people refuse to get within 10 feet of you, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and no, 10 oz is not too much!</li>
            <li> This is my first chance trying Gold Bond powder</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Keeps you cool and fresh in a very humid environment like New Orleans.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t put near your privates as the cool may burn your testicles</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and feeling great all day long!</li>
            <li> However it is a very fine powder and it drifts and scatters everywhere no matter how careful you are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll estimate I&#x27;ve worn my current pair sockless about 400-500 days, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Fine powder, not at all coarse or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I started using this powder when I was a kid and was very involved in sports.  </li>
            <li> While serving in the heat of the Far East quite a number of years ago, this stuff was worth its weight in gold...</li>
            <li> Bought baby powder instead, and that was much easier on the whole area.</li>
            <li> Very cooling.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> AS MUCH</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really take care of the itching I have on my feet.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gold Bond for coming into my life</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells very &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> far better to have a hint of medicine about you than to be constantly scratching your groin \\&quot;area\\&quot; and thighs in public!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight, but pleasant, medicinal odor (only someone intimately close may notice).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it on other area&#x27;s of the body, because it was just too noticeable after</li>
            <li> : It is really easy to apply too much, so I suggest not fully opening the cap (so the holes are still partially covered).</li>
            <li> If you have amazon prime, go ahead and order online, but if not you can probably get this product cheaper or for the same price at many local stores.</li>
            <li> I grew older the football and baseball</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Body Powder has been around a long time, it seriously is one of the best (old standbys) as far as body powder goes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and while other people might enjoy the &amp;#34;cooling sensation,&amp;#34; it was a real put off for me.</li>
            <li> OK, so there are just some things one does not talk about in public, such as moister and sweating that leads to itching and scratching, that could lead to some funny looks in public.</li>
            <li> It clears up minor skin infections and irritations better than the (possibly harmful) meds your MD will prescribe.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this stuff now, and it&#x27;s nice to have an option to get it without trucking down to the store.</li>
            <li> This is no ordinary powder.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my feet, and it works pretty well, but they have a specific powder just for that.</li>
            <li> My first minibox of this bodypowder I bougt on central station in Chicago.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and fresh where you need it.  </li>
            <li> can only speak here for guys but playing football, baseball on hot summer days, running track events can and does cause major chaffing and itching in the groin area and thighs and when it comes to biking; your hind quarters.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the Gold Bond products make my skin red and very itchy.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, this worked REALLY well on my face, even though your face is one of the last places you would think to apply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just sprinkle some of it directly onto my kabuki brush and apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I am an adult wearing briefs in a nursing home, I have IBS</li>
            <li> I am completely sold forever on this product.</li>
            <li> WOW within minutes the itching is gone.</li>
            <li> He says it completely eliminates the itching from heat rash, doesn&#x27;t clump, but does stay put.</li>
            <li> My dog has sensitive skin and allergies, and she develops rashes/sores on her tummy.</li>
            <li> Leaves your junk dry and keeps it from smelling like fast food.</li>
            <li> good product ill try the xtra strength next time thou.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do a lot of sports, and I don&#x27;t have major sweat or chaffing problems.</li>
            <li> When the weather is hot, we need it to heal our rashes; when the weather is cold, we put on more clothes and we need our Gold Bond then.  </li>
            <li> This is the gold standard in body powders, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I bought a low price generic knockoff body powder also in a yellow plastic bottle from my local drug store knowing that the list of ingredients was mostly the same but not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample travel size bottle of this powder with a coupon a few months ago, and my little bottle is still going even after using it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One ingredient in Gold Bond Original Strength Body Powder is missing in the alternative that costs 25% less.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly cakey or white as long as you blend well enough, and it gets rid of any grease or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> It works immediately and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw someone complained that this irritated their sensitive skin, well, it does contain menthol which can cause a burning feeling if you have sensitive skin.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I think it helps dry up any excess moisture, and actually does seem to heal it and give her some itch relief.</li>
            <li> Anyone who participates in long distance running or hiking needs this product in their kit bag.</li>
            <li> It keeps them dry inside literally all day -- even a long day of walking.  </li>
            <li> He recommends this product to anyone with heat rash or other similar problems.</li>
            <li> And it keeps my feet feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Using this product eliminates this problem, since it keeps problems areas dry.</li>
            <li> It helps dry the oozing and weeping from poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy.  </li>
            <li> He says that it keeps him feeling dry all day.</li>
            <li> This external analgesic product helps us relieve our minor skin irritations, including little rashes, scrapes, and bites.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing that takes on jock itch, and destroys it, in less than a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have to be careful not to allow it to make contact with our eyes.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no cooling effect.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation can be rather unsettling on your nether regions at first, but I still use it and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is slightly medicated which I do not particularly like, but as long as I get relief it is a small price to pay</li>
            <li> I would give it less than one star if I could.  </li>
            <li> and I could care less if I smell a bit like a medicine cabinet...</li>
            <li> Aroma is  a little mediciny, but seems to tone down once you get it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> ON HOT DAYS WITH GOLD BOND, AND THE MEDICATION KILLS BACTERIA IN THE DIRTY ENVIRONMENT</li>
            <li> The Zeasorb has been difficult for us to get where we live, so we decided to try something else.</li>
            <li> He said it keeps him cooler and drier for a little longer.</li>
            <li> After normal use for a few days, it gave me long, painful rashes on either side of the groin.</li>
            <li> I know of few hikers who do not carry this stuff with them.  </li>
            <li> Dear men, if you have not tried this thing, you are missing out a lot.</li>
            <li> application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because I think a powder should be something you put on, and after a few minutes forget about it (like deodorant).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the knockoff.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for my purposes.</li>
            <li> well, at least a box of Cool-Ade mix or three</li>
            <li> arrived with broken cap</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> Not an antifungal but does seem to prevent fungal infections in vulnerable areas (skin folds, under breasts e.g.).</li>
            <li> Hey, would Shaq steer you wrong?</li>
            <li> cold beers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how bad I am.</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> He rides motorcycles, and the rash is sometimes very painful.</li>

            <li> I am a big fan of this stuff now, and it&#x27;s nice to have an option to get it without trucking down to the store.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample travel size bottle of this powder with a coupon a few months ago, and my little bottle is still going even after using it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do a lot of sports, and I don&#x27;t have major sweat or chaffing problems. So at first, I was not sure what to do with this...Until I ran out of pressed face powder one day, and I decided to test this out. To my surprise, this worked REALLY well on my face, even though your face is one of the last places you would think to apply this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obviously gentle on skin since it has so many healing properties, which is perfect for anyone who has sensitive skin. I just sprinkle some of it directly onto my kabuki brush and apply it to my face. It is not overly cakey or white as long as you blend well enough, and it gets rid of any grease or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the summer, I also sprinkled it on top of mosquito bites, and it eliminated the itching almost immediately. I will be re-purchasing this powder, and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this brand for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the Gold Bond products make my skin red and very itchy.  I would give it less than one star if I could.  What works best for me is plain talc with 5% zinc oxide.  I have to have a compounding pharmacy make it up for me.  I tried the Gold Bond powder hoping that it would be as good and more convenient to purchase.  Wound up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This Gold Bond powder always does a fantastic job to soothe sweaty areas...&lt;br /&gt;... especially during the hotter summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works GREAT...  Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> Excellent product to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right stuff. Works great just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It works at a good price - what more can I ask.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for maintaining a nice coolness in areas that need it most.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but you will notice a difference.  If you have amazon prime, go ahead and order online, but if not you can probably get this product cheaper or for the same price at many local stores.</li>
            <li> It stopped my itching  right away.</li>
            <li> Living in the humid south, it&#x27;s as important in dressing as deodorant! Hubby with construction business uses it daily and keeps it in his truck. It&#x27;s in his boots to help absorb sweat. He said it keeps him cooler and drier for a little longer. I like being able repurchase this &amp;#34;bundled&amp;#34; package.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to.  Keeps you cool and fresh in a very humid environment like New Orleans.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been around even longer than I have which is saying something.  I started using this powder when I was a kid and was very involved in sports.  I have been using it ever since.  This stuff has been a life saver (well, that is an exaggeration for sure, but it has relived a lot of pain and discomfort over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak here for guys but playing football, baseball on hot summer days, running track events can and does cause major chaffing and itching in the groin area and thighs and when it comes to biking; your hind quarters.  That is simply a fact.  This product relives the pain, itching and soreness and prevents it from becoming worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I grew older the football and baseball went to the wayside but the distance running, bicycling and hiking continue to this day.  The chaffing and such continue to be a problem and I continue to use this powder.  It most certainly has a soothing effect and most certainly has preventive powers.  Anyone who participates in long distance running or hiking needs this product in their kit bag. I know of few hikers who do not carry this stuff with them.  While serving in the heat of the Far East quite a number of years ago, this stuff was worth its weight in gold...well, at least a box of Cool-Ade mix or three cold beers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is slightly medicated which I do not particularly like, but as long as I get relief it is a small price to pay and I could care less if I smell a bit like a medicine cabinet...far better to have a hint of medicine about you than to be constantly scratching your groin \\&quot;area\\&quot; and thighs in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find Gold Bond Powder to be quite effective for minor breakouts of poison ivy and chigger bites as it relives the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product and cannot remember a time that I was without it.  Amazing that this stuff has been around since about 1907 or 1903 and is still a favorite of many...that alone will tell you much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarksh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
            <li> Dear men, if you have not tried this thing, you are missing out a lot. It will change your life. You will feel different with this powder on your stuff.</li>
            <li> Even having to pay taxes, it was good to know that I can buy these kind of stuff from Amazon.</li>
            <li> 1.  You can&#x27;t wear boat shoes with socks, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You can&#x27;t wear shoes without socks more than three times before people refuse to get within 10 feet of you, especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only know one way to resolve this:  put a healthy dash of Gold Bond in your boat shoes every day you&#x27;re gonna wear them, just before you&#x27;re gonna wear them, and shake &#x27;em around a bit.  It keeps them dry inside literally all day -- even a long day of walking.  I&#x27;ll estimate I&#x27;ve worn my current pair sockless about 400-500 days, and they&#x27;re still going strong.  If I travel anywhere, I even pack some in a suspicious-looking Ziploc and bring that along.  That&#x27;s how important it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t understand why there is still a &amp;#34;what do you do about boat shoe smell&amp;#34; discussion.  Guys, it&#x27;s over.  This is what you do.</li>
            <li> This product works just fine and is a more affordable product.  I like the size of the bottle.  The others I ordered may be coming back. Too expensive and they don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Body Powder, helps keep me cool and dry all day long!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love, it&#x27;s Gold Bond.  Keeps you dry and fresh where you need it.  Been using the stuff for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Gold Bond fan. On Prime, this product saved me a trip of many blocks in NYC to get a refill.&lt;br /&gt;-David Allen</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation can be rather unsettling on your nether regions at first, but I still use it and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My grandma told me about.  It&#x27;s soothing and cooling.  Especially nice in the summer and when exercising.</li>
            <li> This is the best body powder I have ever found. I use it on my feet and it does not cake. And it keeps my feet feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Body Powder has been around a long time, it seriously is one of the best (old standbys) as far as body powder goes.  I have used it off and on for years and it always works for me.  Great for the summer, or right after the shower!  Price here on Amazon is good as well, one bottle last me quite some time.  Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review</li>
            <li> Gold bond powder works better than any thing else I have tried. I like it over the spray and fresh balls. Leaves your junk dry and keeps it from smelling like fast food. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this to prevent sweating and chafing and to freshen up the groin area. After normal use for a few days, it gave me long, painful rashes on either side of the groin. I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m sure that played a part in it, but I couldn&#x27;t continue to use this. Bought baby powder instead, and that was much easier on the whole area.</li>
            <li> Very cooling. This is no ordinary powder. Give it a try. You will like it a lot I think. Linda</li>
            <li> and no, 10 oz is not too much!</li>
            <li> I love shopping with amazon&lt;br /&gt;GOLD BOND BODY POWDER REALLY WORKS. I AM A MECHANIC AND OUR NYLON UNIFORMS RARELY BREATHES I FIND I DONT SWEAT AS MUCH ON HOT DAYS WITH GOLD BOND, AND THE MEDICATION KILLS BACTERIA IN THE DIRTY ENVIRONMENT I WORK IN. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as &amp;#34;ball powder&amp;#34; and to use on chafing areas that occasionally show up. and while other people might enjoy the &amp;#34;cooling sensation,&amp;#34; it was a real put off for me. I started using it on my feet, and it works pretty well, but they have a specific powder just for that. I wasn&#x27;t able to use it on other area&#x27;s of the body, because it was just too noticeable after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because I think a powder should be something you put on, and after a few minutes forget about it (like deodorant). But this stuff would be noticeable for up to an hour and more.</li>
            <li> Now my shoes don&#x27;t smell like death!</li>
            <li> What man doesn&#x27;t love Gold Bond powder?</li>
            <li> I am an adult wearing briefs in a nursing home, I have IBS this is the first product that has truly soothed my bottom&amp;#34;  CAROL HAMHAM!</li>
            <li> Just what the docter orderd</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is consistently the best answer to any powder needs.  Used by everyone in our house. smells nice and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is my first chance trying Gold Bond powder and I find that through hot days and workouts, this stuff keeps everything fresh! I was using baby powder before and this is like that plus an amazing menthol breeze through the boulders! Love it.</li>
            <li> A great product for soothing chaffing, dryness and other mild skin disorders It always works for me, and smell great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> great between the legs on warm hot sweaty days.  keeps you nice and fresh and fresh and nice. get it</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do even when its 110+ outside.</li>
            <li> keeps you dry and nice&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t put near your privates as the cool may burn your testicles but the product is great</li>
            <li> Since I am at the gym on a regular basis, sweating is an ongoing experience, which causes irritations in different areas of the body. Using this product eliminates this problem, since it keeps problems areas dry. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is very good powder, although I can not find it at the store anymore.  Definitely worth make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought a low price generic knockoff body powder also in a yellow plastic bottle from my local drug store knowing that the list of ingredients was mostly the same but not exactly the same.  One ingredient in Gold Bond Original Strength Body Powder is missing in the alternative that costs 25% less.  - Zinc Oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond works noticeably better than the alternative.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the knockoff.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you know what you are getting. The size/price is excellent. Do not hold back. You are NOT going to get this price in a store. Buy it and be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective. It works immediately and last a long time. However it is a very fine powder and it drifts and scatters everywhere no matter how careful you are.</li>
            <li> Put it on the boys every morning. Great for moisture and odor control, specially in a south Texas summer.</li>
            <li> Kind of a regular supply item.  Exactly what I ordered.  Nice during hot summers.</li>
            <li> For me I couldnt use this.  It created mild rashes and stung my skin a bit. But it is different for everyone I presume.</li>
            <li> If I need mentholated powder I can just buy some peppermint oil and cornstarch. And if you have any kind of rash, dermatitis, psoriasis, this &amp;quot;medicated&amp;quot; powder isn&#x27;t going to soothe, it&#x27;s only going to sting. And is it antimicrobial? I couldn&#x27;t tell from the ingredients that it was. Waste of money for my purposes. Zesorb was a little bit more effective at treating any yeast problems, which can co-exist with other skin conditions, but for psoriasis I ended using coal tar treatments which work better for me than Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> arrived with broken cap</li>
            <li> My first minibox of this bodypowder I bougt on central station in Chicago. It really take care of the itching I have on my feet. I just think it is the best body poeder I have treid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am visiting my daughter in Cali &amp; I cannot tolerate any type of heat I constantly washing my face getting 2-3 showers s day that&#x27;s how bad I am. Well I tried gold bond &amp; I will never go back to baby powder again. The cooling effect makes it that much better. I just ordered a huge con container of it. I am completely sold forever on this product. Also I bought the creme for insect bites. WOW within minutes the itching is gone. Thanks Gold Bond for coming into my life</li>
            <li> Not an antifungal but does seem to prevent fungal infections in vulnerable areas (skin folds, under breasts e.g.). Soothing.</li>
            <li> I know I love this product because if god-forbid I forget to use it in my morning rush to work, I know within 5 minutes. Keeps me dry and feeling great all day long!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder forever, and like it.  Aroma is  a little mediciny, but seems to tone down once you get it on your skin.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gold Bond for years and have always been happy with it. It is great for keeping your feet dry and, frankly,for keeping your scrotum from sticking to your skin in the hot summer months. I saw someone complained that this irritated their sensitive skin, well, it does contain menthol which can cause a burning feeling if you have sensitive skin.[[ASIN:B001G7QSS4 Gold Bond Medicated Powder 10-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)]] Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Zeasorb powder for years to treat his heat rash. He rides motorcycles, and the rash is sometimes very painful. The Zeasorb has been difficult for us to get where we live, so we decided to try something else. We bought some sample sizes of the Gold Bond powder for him to use when he travels, just to see if he would like it. He loves it. He says he wishes he had tried this years ago instead of the Zeasorb. The Gold Bond Powder comes in a nice, large size. He says it completely eliminates the itching from heat rash, doesn&#x27;t clump, but does stay put. He recommends this product to anyone with heat rash or other similar problems.</li>
            <li> I love wearing no socks in the summer. This is my secret weapon. It doesn&#x27;t totally remove the odor, but it does enable the sock-less look without having to wear a nose plug. I also love how your feet feel freer in the shoe.</li>
            <li> I use this in the summer for heat rash which is well known in Texas. It is healing and soothing...</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Medicated Powder is an essential.  This external analgesic product helps us relieve our minor skin irritations, including little rashes, scrapes, and bites.  It helps dry the oozing and weeping from poison sumac, poison oak, and poison ivy.  When the weather is hot, we need it to heal our rashes; when the weather is cold, we put on more clothes and we need our Gold Bond then.  It absorbs moisture, relieves itching, and cools our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have to be careful not to allow it to make contact with our eyes.  It can burn any mucus membranes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is medicine that helps us.  It has been helping people since 1908.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I work in a steel mill and I am always drenched in sweat. When I get time or after a days work the cool soothing powder is absolutely relieving. 4 stars because I wish it would last longer; however, it does say to reapply several times a day.</li>
            <li> This product is not only a great price, but it works so good if you need to keep your skin cool and keeps down rashing caused by heat.</li>
            <li> good product ill try the xtra strength next time thou.</li>
            <li> My dog has sensitive skin and allergies, and she develops rashes/sores on her tummy. This gold bond medicated powder is the only thing we have found that actually helps to heal up her rashes. I think it helps dry up any excess moisture, and actually does seem to heal it and give her some itch relief. She actually loves getting this applied to her tummy, and happily rolls over to have it put on. It also has a really nice menthol smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is really easy to apply too much, so I suggest not fully opening the cap (so the holes are still partially covered).</li>
            <li> I returned this after 1 use. I was expecting the cooling effect you get from protex ice cool that I used in thailand. Not at all. If anything this powder made me hotter than before. Absolutely no cooling effect. Trying Gold Bond triple strength next.</li>
            <li> OK, so there are just some things one does not talk about in public, such as moister and sweating that leads to itching and scratching, that could lead to some funny looks in public. Let&#x27;s just say I have used this powder in many places and it works :)</li>
            <li> Smells very &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.  Doesn&#x27;t smell manly at all. I therefore didn&#x27;t put any of this powder on, therefore I don&#x27;t know if it works..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Like an avalanche on my ballsack</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing. It clears up minor skin infections and irritations better than the (possibly harmful) meds your MD will prescribe. It is the only thing that takes on jock itch, and destroys it, in less than a week. It serves as a deodorant, as well. Highly recommended. Hey, would Shaq steer you wrong?</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> What can one say? This is the gold standard in body powders, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Fine powder, not at all coarse or clumpy. It has a slight, but pleasant, medicinal odor (only someone intimately close may notice).</li>
            <li> My husband loves this powder.  He says that it keeps him feeling dry all day.</li>
