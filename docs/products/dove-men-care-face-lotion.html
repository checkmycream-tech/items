            <li>The compact container is durable, making it perfect to throw in your car or backpack</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for men.</li>
            <li>Another great Dove product!</li>
            <li>This is perfect.</li>
            <li>Dove Men+Care is awesome for a man&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is perfect if you travel.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Feels and smells great!</li>
            <li>And to get the best results it should be used with the Dove face wash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a wonderful product, but the word &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient, needs clarification.</li>
            <li>Smells great!  </li>
            <li>and this is the best moisturizer that has ever happened to me.  </li>
            <li>not saying this is the best moisturizer, but I have acne-prone combination skin and this has been one of the best and cheapest moisturizers I have used.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of moisturizing though.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price, that I know of, for this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Dove has changed their look and I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li>The price is also very good.</li>
            <li>very good lotion for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I feel it is a very good lotion for men.</li>
            <li>This product works great and is perfect for hydrating skin!</li>
            <li>Great after a shave, it is wonderful to wear evening, nights,</li>
            <li>The lotion smells lightly (in a good way), and best of all does NOT irritate my face.</li>
            <li>This is a good, a very good, protective type lotion, a sunscreen if you will.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, feels great, protects great.  </li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>This is a great face lotion that doesn&#x27;t clog up the pores or leave me feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>Great product for all types of faces.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to use after a shave since it moisturizes your skin.</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great travel size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months and really am happy that I switched from the equivalent from L&#x27;Oreal Paris for Men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;good deal for a great product</li>
            <li>It moistens my skin without leaving it feel oily or anything, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li>Great lotion but</li>
            <li>Since I need year-round protection, I don&#x27;t want something that is going to make me breakout and Hydrate seems like a great solution.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a while and is great to use after shaving and when I have been out in the sun for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems like it would be great for people who have sensitivities to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great.</li>
            <li>and it feels great as it quenches your skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>Great product just for men.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells great and it works quite well without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to BzzAgent for letting me try this great product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect - it provides good moisturization without feeling greasy, and has a nice manly scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear full face foundation, not because I&#x27;ve got flawless beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>if Hydrate feels good on me, it should be great for you! :)</li>
            <li>This is a good product that feels pleasant and does what it says it will  Recommended.</li>
            <li>if he likes it, I believe it must be good.  </li>
            <li>So good, i can not go out with out it on my face&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that it took me 46 years to figure out the best way to keep my head, nose and face oil free is to just use this lotion.</li>
            <li>A Good Buy.</li>
            <li>This cream is not as good as the Clinique  </li>
            <li>It feels like it has good body bit</li>
            <li>Good face lotion</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>no issues... good on time delivery..</li>
            <li>this is a really good</li>
            <li>But for a ski trip, or lawn work, or a daytime jog/sports, this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>So good.  </li>
            <li>Good for travel and home.</li>
            <li>some good</li>
            <li>I said, the sunscreen is definitely a good idea - a lifetime of using an SPF 15 product on your face and neck should produce a prettier face at 50 than a lifetime of not.  </li>
            <li>Dove has been pleasantly surprising me with their products for men.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin, no itchiness, no nasty scent, no stickiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased there aren&#x27;t irritants (besides fragrance) in it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied though,</li>
            <li>This is good for that and, with the coming summer, its a nice pickup.</li>
            <li>lotion smells good and comes in a nice, compact case.</li>
            <li>I would think this face lotion is more ideal for the warmer seasons of the year, as opposed to the cooler months, seeing as how it is a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Another top product from Dove!</li>
            <li>My favorite face lotion at a discounted price!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It also has some spf which is always nice.  </li>
            <li>What if we want to wear our OWN cologne that doesn&#x27;t knock people over at 15 yards?  </li>
            <li>It was nice to try</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as clinique but definitely a better buy for the price.</li>
            <li>The 15 SPF is a nice touch for day to day activity.  </li>
            <li>quite nice.</li>
            <li>When used by itself the effect is not quite as good, but still more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes nicely, but that&#x27;s because I have lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s nice to know that Dove is concerned that people might pass by me and say, \\&quot;What</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin, it does not have a smell that reminds me of being on a beach or at a pool</li>
            <li>Really nice moisturizer and my wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li>He liked this dove lotion and said it felt \\&quot;not greasy\\&quot; on his skin, which he hates.</li>
            <li>I think my title says it all \\&quot;Not greasy, smells nice,</li>
            <li>this one he liked because it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some others I&#x27;ve bought, and it didn&#x27;t cause him to break out like some I tried.</li>
            <li>all three products do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>, It doesn&#x27;t feel Oily or Greasy at all and has a nice smell but nothing too over</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The pump is very good as I would always get the right amount I need for face application</li>
            <li>/&gt;And most importantly it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>No grease and good frarance, easy to use</li>
            <li>, has a light pleasant scent, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Moisturiser as it was very easy to apply</li>
            <li>My face looks great and will continue to look good when i get older because of the spf 15.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves your face smooth</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve purchased made for men!</li>
            <li>good SPF provides good daily protection against the sun, especially important here in Texas.</li>
            <li>It feels great and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week on hands and face, his skin looks healthy and recovered nicely from the winter weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy lotion which is really good for men ( and women lol).</li>
            <li>I wish I could find this product more easily in stores!</li>
            <li>(I found it very light.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This provides a very light SPF for protection against the sun.</li>
            <li>I give this maximum rating as it&#x27;s very cheap and does the job</li>
            <li>My face did feel refresh and feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>lack of a scent is really nice because I am not a fan of strong scents</li>
            <li>I have used this for a week now as a bzz agent and I must say it is a really nice moisturiser with a really nice smell which lasts for hours ,it makes your skin nice and smooth and really does seem to energise your face I highly recommend this to anyone love it!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is light and refreshing and the face that their is sunscreen in it makes me love it more!</li>
            <li>i like it, there are probably better products out there</li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and lightness of it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is definitely better than stealing moisturizers from your wife.</li>
            <li>Like all Dove products, Dove Men+Care Face Lotion is top shelf.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite cream I ever use</li>
            <li>Im glad I found something with SPF that is manly smelling and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face moisturized for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also love the smell</li>
            <li>If i&#x27;m going to be mostly indoors, i use jojoba oil (sometimes will still use this).</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil no matter what, for my beard (for those that don&#x27;t know, many beard oils use jojoba oil as their primary ingredient, so I just cut the BS and buy jojoba, though I do own some fancy beard oils when I want something</li>
            <li>This is one of the better products for my son learning to take care of his skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves his face nice and smooth, well hydrated with no bleeding and no girlie/flower scents.</li>
            <li>This goes on nice and light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>Light, non-greasy, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and gives me a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has sunscreen in it</li>
            <li>love the product&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li>Really satisfied with this Face lotion.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be ok Dove.</li>
            <li>I guess because silicome makes makeup go on better.</li>
            <li>Often, an itching face seems the most intolerable.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably get more than you need until you get used to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It really feels nice against my skin and feels like it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Also, after wearing this, nobody has mentioned that I now smell more like a man....</li>
            <li>love using the Hydrate</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sun screens and have found them to be a hassle to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product succeeds on both counts, which makes it a success.</li>
            <li>One pump should be more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need more moisturizer but he loves it.</li>
            <li>I have been real impressed with the entire Men&#x27;s line of products from Dove.</li>
            <li>it a shot:)</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Love the dove men care items</li>
            <li>As a moisturizing lotion, this is just okay.  </li>
            <li>daytime, I buy it again for Christmas presents my son in-law  love it.</li>
            <li>but this one is even better.</li>
            <li>may not be satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some good success with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this product, it keeps my face moisturized with out leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Awesome face lotion especially post shave.</li>
            <li>The hydrate is pretty good, goes on very light, non-greasy, just</li>
            <li>There is a very light scent, so it may not be great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Of course because my skin is far from flawless, full of problems...</li>
            <li>in all, a nice hydrating lotion with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>three are pretty good for not having a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>This product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be chock full of vitamins or antioxidants; this isn&#x27;t that kind of product.</li>
            <li>Loved this lotion, makes your skin feel light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout and has a nice moisturizing affect that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product for those whose skin tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on the skin, has a mild smell and has an SPF-15 sun protection.</li>
            <li>The lotion in the bottle has a very mild smell, it smells like a lotion smell for lack of a better description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that it is available as a subscribe and save item.  </li>
            <li>revitalize doesn&#x27;t have SPF, goes on light, but has a refreshing skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>Has a great masculine smell, and isn&#x27;t greasy when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Positives included the light smell and the pump on the container, which is one of the better pumps</li>
            <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>it soaks in nicely, has a fresh but not overpowering scent, and seems to have staying power.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and not overpowering, but if you have a sensitivity to certain chemicals, knowing what &#x27;fragrance&#x27; consists of can be important.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, feels nice, and I keep stealing it whenever I notice a spot of dry skin on my own face, so we have to buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that this lotion is nice if I use it right after I shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly rich lotion, and probably best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion applies easily.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The lotions absorbs very quickly and does not leave feeling sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a shame because its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easily five stars for how well it works for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this face moisturizer because it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clot, feeling good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it running off when I sweat, but I did notice that it washed away fairly easily if I happened to get something on my face that needed washing off.</li>
            <li>however, it smells too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>The difference is the scent of the Dove is way too strong.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a fragrance counter sense of smell, but I think the Revitalize has a strong smell than the Hydrate and Sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something with a higher SPF would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>It also works well against coming into contact with the sun and that&#x27;s pretty nice to find here as well.</li>
            <li>Just a clean, hydrating, soft and great product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer without SPF, I think the Aveeno moisturizer is still the hands down best.  </li>
            <li>The pump is nice and does not dispense too much of the product, easy to control quantity.  </li>
            <li>Great face lotion in a nice little container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Dove for Men products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>No break-outs or any after effect.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is light to non-existent, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of re-hydrating after a shave, but tends to feel greasy and not absorb very well.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>If you want a light face moisturizer that has some SPF in it, you must try Dove&#x27;s Men+Care Hydrate.</li>
            <li>2 get one free</li>
            <li>I also like the scent which is fairly light not to overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling silky smooth before and after he&#x27;s shaved</li>
            <li>I should also note that during my radiation, my radiation oncologist said to use fragrance free Dove soap, which I used.</li>
            <li>Face lotion needs to be light and not greasy, but still do the job of hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li>I tried all 3 because they are cheap compared to the products I buy from department store, i.e., Lab Series.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted to smell like a cheap cologne, I would wear cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Wish it was fragrance free</li>
            <li>This really feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice no need for an after shave, will be too much scent.</li>
            <li>had used the aftershave with GREAT results, so I thought I&#x27;d give the facial lotion a shot by Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh and keeps my face moisterized all day.</li>
            <li>Works fine and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>He noticed significant improvements when he started to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t really leave any type of residue on your skin like most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product has a clean, somewhat unisex scent that fades away</li>
            <li>Clean and works well for my skin.</li>
            <li>I can see the Unilever marketing machine at work, with so many positive reviews of this series of moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>It does suffer the same problem as many with built-in SPF--slight stinging on freshly shaved skin, takes more effort to rub in completely--but the solar protection is a worthwhile trade off to my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it stops working when its about halfway full.</li>
            <li>for the amount and only 1.69 ounce, you are not getting a good value deal.</li>
            <li>no bad smell, not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>you are willing to spend more, department stores offer far better and far more advanced products like Lab Series.  </li>
            <li>I found was that this is a nice light lotion with undertones of the classic Dove scent, only slightly more manly.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff because it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t give him a greasy after feeling, or burn after applying post shave.  </li>
            <li>It does have some sun blocking ability, but one should re-apply as this absorbs quickly and won&#x27;t block the sun all day - none do.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or burn after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is mildly fragranced with a silky feel to it.  </li>
            <li>When I use SPF, it&#x27;s usually super water resistant, for fishing/surfing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super creamy when it comes out put the minute you spread it on your face</li>
            <li>(A quick reapplication solved this problem.)</li>
            <li>The scent dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing on your face and provides a light but quite masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pretty light, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling richer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for any type of skin and I highly recommend it to men who have to shave on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>my wife bought me last year, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>For a product that is going to be located around your nose the odor is much too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and would keep the lotion as travel moisturizer, but now I think I&#x27;m ready to graduate to a higher quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It had positives and will surely please some men who don&#x27;t care so much about the lack of a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I do not attribute this to the soap, I just mention it, because I never got any kind of skin infection (of course I also ended up having to use some heavy duty burn cream which was pretty amazing).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended face cream for men because its very light, really moisturizes and protects against the number one ager for men, THE SUN!</li>
            <li>Very light not heavy or greasy as well.</li>
            <li>It applies light without really having to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to go into it,but asking for comfortable, calm skin isn&#x27;t asking much considering what I am working with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will update the star rating and the details later when I have a more accurate opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is so effective that I find it even keeps working the next day if I forget to reapply.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and goes on greaseless.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself comes in its own box and is pleasing enough to leave out on the counter.  </li>
            <li>Just buy this, put it on, and be pleasantly surprised when you find more people in/around your face area.</li>
            <li>most frequently with the Hydrate+</li>
            <li>The sun screen is a nice bonus (this appears to be in the Hydrate version only).</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed in my skin</li>
            <li>After watching an ad, thought this might be good for me, but empty, no.</li>
            <li>The lotion is absorbed into my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion fulfills the need for SPF moisturizer for me at a far better price point.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a nice, basic product that is non-offensive for people who don&#x27;t like to feel residue on their faces.</li>
            <li>And why does Dove add fragrance to a product for sensitive skin when it is scientifically established fragrance is a top skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s face lotion so far.</li>
            <li>but it gets quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Hydrate, the Revitalize is more clear, not as creamy as the Hydrate.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a light fast absorbing facial moisturizer, with a nice good manly scent.</li>
            <li>The glycerin and dimethicone are the main moisturizing ingredients, and that is fine for what this is.</li>
            <li>It will certainly cost more since I normally get hand lotion in mongo sized pump</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy, yet absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I use it as a morning cream, and it provides just the right amount of moisture that I like-</li>
            <li>The redness didn&#x27;t go away right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid thirties woman, and I find most moisturizers for women to be full of promises and silicone.</li>
            <li>This lotion also provides a small amount of protection from the sun, which is a great added bonus.</li>
            <li>Yes, my skin feels light, however the stretchiness I feel does not change until I go back to Clearasil, and I&#x27;m going back for good.</li>
            <li>This is a definite must have if you live in a semiarid/arid climate or just have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did a great job of shipping the product and made sure that it arrived well within the promised time-frame.</li>
            <li>I never really noticed summer-related issues with my skin before, but the older I get, the more and more I find the sun making my face feel like a worn saddle.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it did not dry out my face like most lotions do.</li>
            <li>I tried to reapply again more generously, but again my face dried out once more.</li>
            <li>Men are becoming more concerned about their faces, even though women have gotten old and wrinkly while men traditionally have been described as ruggedly</li>
            <li>Well in regards to this specific product, I have to say I love it right away.  </li>
            <li>In short, I&#x27;m very comfortable using this product</li>
            <li>but hey, it is your face ;)</li>
            <li>I subscribed to this item without first trying it in the store, because I figured that it would just be face lotion with SPF 15 in it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon</li>
            <li>I tried Neutragenas \\&quot;equivalent\\&quot; and with it being a NON-Broad Spectrum product that was my first turn off.  </li>
            <li>hydrates pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to simply putting hand lotion on my face, and this is nicer feeling, though more fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that Dove is making a very competitive line of men&#x27;s care products that are worth trying.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I do break out occasionally, sometimes more often than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jim is funny about his face.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think men want smelly lotions on their face in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pick it up with a sizable discount when it went on promotion from my local store, and was eager to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>suppose I can also say that I like the way it dispenses the lotion (just press down on the top lightly).</li>
            <li>As the other reviews have stated, this is a decent to good product...</li>
            <li>My husband has dry skin, especially in the winter, but like many men isn&#x27;t so great about actually doing anything about it.</li>
            <li>Works great as a daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try Dove Men+ Care as I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and recieved some free from them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lotion was absorbed very fast and had subtle pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine.</li>
            <li>One I use when I am out walking and in the sun and the other after shaving and when I am home and want my face to feel nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this is a fantastic lotion for men, and it has adequate SPF protection (if your face protection doesn&#x27;t have at least SPF15, I would look into that, and make sure that&#x27;s the face lotion you want)</li>
            <li>Long story short, he liked it!</li>
            <li>Dried out my skin more than it was originally.  </li>
            <li>Even though adding one more grooming chore seems like at least one more too much (\\&quot;You want me to floss AND moisturize?  </li>
            <li>It goes on the face clean, while the Hydrate goes on white but gets absorbed in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that&#x27;s light, and will NOT MAKE MY FACE ITCH!</li>
            <li>Before re-buying this, however, I would probably want to try Jack Black&#x27;s Double-Duty Face Moisturizer, seeing as it is also quite popular.</li>
            <li>(with 15 SPF sunscreen) feels slightly smoother and the revitalize felt kind of oily</li>
            <li>just liquid enough to spread easily.</li>
            <li>The Dove Face Lotion also seems to be less oily and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>way to strong a smell for use in public.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I felt that it was time to get smart and take care of</li>
            <li>This product though goes on very smooth, rubs in and dries quickly, and actually makes me last longer through the day before I start noticing an oily forehead.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my face and much cheaper than the Jack Black</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use lotion on my face before I decided to give this a go for no particular reason at all, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Great for staying moisturized after shaving and especially in the harsh winter months.  </li>
            <li>It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really helped protect my face against the desert heat and the SPF 15</li>
            <li>Anyway, I noticed an immediate difference using this in combination with Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Creamy Formula.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use facial moisturizers and daily SPF, my face tends to be on the oily side and most leave in products make my face feel oilier and like it can&#x27;t breath.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to but does not bother me as much now.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your skin very hydrated when you use it in the morning and night.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t travel much, but it was still very convenient.</li>
            <li>Well it must of really worked/</li>
            <li>It goes really fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Dove Men Care Hydrate Face Lotion is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Like a lot of Dove face lotions it is gentle on your skin and also includes SPF 15 protects skin from sun</li>
            <li>and, it is much cheaper than a lot of the specialty lotions, like Arbonne, etc.</li>
            <li>for the fragrance of still smelling like a man, I don&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li>but thanks totheir fragrance, I guess that shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>My skin burned VERY severely, they told me they never saw anyone burn as much as I had.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>and I found it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Dove Men+Care hydrate face lotion is very oily.  </li>
            <li>I guess men don&#x27;t really get the difference between face lotion and body lotion?</li>
            <li>Well, that isn&#x27;t very helpful, so I gave it a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t walk away feeling you have goop on your face.</li>
            <li>moisturizers are so basic, they are no known advanced ingredients to provide any anti-aging or skin-repairing benefits.  </li>
            <li>And if it does not work, your bank is not broken in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One pump is way too much for my face and leaves it really greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle \\&quot;oatmeal\\&quot; smell that fades away almost immediately</li>
            <li>that REALLY dries out your face</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I started using Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not, as pointed out by others, an aftershave, but instead it&#x27;s a product very specifically designed to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a very strong scent reminiscent of Dove soap or women&#x27;s facial products, and the smell lasts ALL day until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>, this is why it got a 4 out of 5, other than that its ok</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like other sunscreens that have to be washed off, or that sweat off, rather it is much more like a lotion, as the name would indicate.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and provides moisture for the dry skin on my face and provides SPF15 protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>For really active people, this should be treated more like a bit of bonus sunscreen in a moisturizer, rather than a full-on sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your budget restrict you to drugstore products, then there still better choices such as Neutrogena for Men, or just Olay products (though not grey color</li>
            <li>Just one full squeeze of the bottle and that should be enough to use.</li>
            <li>15 isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;s better than nothing in my book, especially since my husband doesn&#x27;t use sunscreen on a daily basis when outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I am new to the face-care product world, but I like this non-greasy formula and my girlfriend really likes it on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent lotion for the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out, isn&#x27;t too thick, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with a stronger SPF, especially for after the winter, when I will be outside much more</li>
            <li>This facial lotion has a silky feel that absorbs relatively quickly, for being a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>B003USG91S Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce]] which has double the SPF and to me has a nicer fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and makes his skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For anything lighter like the dove face wash, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a self-care product.</li>
            <li>With all the rave reviews, I had high hopes for the lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but this is very inexpensive and also offers a SPF protection.</li>
            <li>Tried this and did not like it as much as I like Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It seems to really be geared toward sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Of course if you spend hundreds of dollars on expensive face products, this will be in no comparison to them obviously, welcome to drugstores.  </li>
            <li>Now when i decited to order this i was getting it because after ever shower i use face lotion, normally usher face lotion, but i wanted to change it up, so i got this, the headline says face lotion, nothing about sunscreen,</li>
            <li>even though the discription does, i didnt read that tho, so when it arrived, first of all the container really couldnt be any smaller, but</li>
            <li>After a few days my skin feels healthy.</li>
            <li>However if you do have a sensitive skin be aware that even sensitive version of the lotion contains fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Affordable, SPF 15 is powerful enough for hours in the sun (for me), and helps keep your face from getting dry/peely.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like smaller, super short shaving cream dispensers.  </li>
            <li>A small amount covers the whole face and leaves it feeling nice, but doesn&#x27;t have enough odor to linger.</li>
            <li>I am always trying new lotions for my face and neck</li>
            <li>Been looking for a new face lotion</li>
            <li>Both of them gave me pretty similar reviews on this and the other Dove Men product we tried, and while both though it was &#x27;fine&#x27;, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>the negative side, both agreed that SPF 15 is nothing, especially if you&#x27;re fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>The only issues is that it isn&#x27;t very much in that tub.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, but not to the point where I break out with clusters of pimples.  </li>
            <li>(My face is VERY VERY VERY sensitive to chemicals.)</li>
            <li>I originally got this in a gift set and figured that it was like any other lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>The bottle of this looks almost exactly the same as Clarins Men Moisture Balm.</li>
            <li>(I especially look forward to using this in the winter, when proper moisturizing is more valuable and critical.)</li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;ve spent full days laying out on Miami Beach.)  </li>
            <li>The masculine scent is fairly strong but that&#x27;s not a huge turnoff</li>
            <li>pump is very economical, you can squeeze out an amount smaller than half the size of a raindrop if you press very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll just make sure I apply as little as possible).</li>
            <li>I am nearly 50 years old and  look like I am  in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>--skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About a year ago, I started swiping dollops of moisturizer from my wife&#x27;s vast collection; however, the feminine fragrances weren&#x27;t much to my liking, so I grabbed a container of Dove Men + Care Hydrate + Face Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is I wish the SPF lasted longer than 3 hours, who wants to reapply this throughout the day?</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to smells, otherwise, stay away.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He is in his 50&#x27;s, but better late than never.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like the smell</li>
            <li>have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I the lotion worked for me even though I didn&#x27;t use sensitive version.</li>
            <li>It produces foam that you apply to your face and it does not apply as well as gel and also do not feel as moisturized as Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>what happen to the rest, it&#x27;s very short and for the price it seems like they pulled a fast one on me</li>
            <li>Sensitive+</li>
            <li>Sensitive was the thinnest with an</li>
            <li>plan to use the Sensitive+</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well with sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li>(I had 35 days of radiation to my left side from my cheek bone to just under my clavicle) trying to find something that is really going to moisturize my skin, protect me from the sun</li>
            <li>Dove makes both a Hydrate and Sensitive + in this line of products.</li>
            <li>Sensitive + has no smell.</li>
            <li>It just makes your skin feel soft and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only that, it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well...</li>
            <li>With the results so far, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the price to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months now and I really appreciate the combination of SPF protection and the soothing lotion.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to the Nivea Men Sensitive Gel Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had enough sun exposure to tell if the SPF ingredient is working as it should, but it seems like my face has been protected somewhat in that it hasn&#x27;t tanned as much as my arms have while I&#x27;ve been out in the yard working.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get it ANYWHERE near my eyes at all whatsoever, or it burns like hell</li>
            <li>also tried the Sensitive.</li>
            <li>But after a shave, I could feel the Sensitive soothing a bit</li>
            <li>the three, I would rate the Hydrate and Sensitive ahead of the Revitalize.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>of unusual, given the fact that pretty much all face lotions on the market can at least be rubbed in near the eyes.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little strong for him, but only because he prefers completely unscented.</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry area, so this really helps.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smooth, which lasts for at least 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, this will really help.</li>
            <li>Personally I like the fragrance of this face lotion, as it is smells very manly and lasts for around ten minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, as I have poor oily skin and have trouble finding a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft, and was even comfortable on my usually over-oily nose.</li>
            <li>Much better than all the other heavy greasy lotions on the market.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft throughout the day and the smell is light and subtle.</li>
            <li>This is a light face lotion, you can hardly tell its there.</li>
            <li>He also uses it instead of sunscreen when we go out on sunny days for general</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in my pocket or in the glove compartment of my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going back to Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(I no longer had any natural protection on the left side), and not irritate my skin or feel oilly.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li>You really do not want that much oil on your face.  </li>
            <li>I get sebhorreic dermatitis on my face and this makes it worse than when using more benign lotions like CeraVae.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product if the summer has your face feeling cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or wants to add some moisture to their face to help prevent acne products from drying their skin out as severely.</li>
            <li>It does not go on greasy, and feels rich and thick when being applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 yr old Hispanic male and my skin dries out instantly when we hit October.</li>
            <li>The Sensitive+ is a bit more faint, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li>While it may be a little more expensive than some of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; lotions, I think it is worth it....</li>
            <li>, no side effects like greasy face later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the container, in smaller font, states that it has broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to understand, my skin on the left side is soft, but will always need to be moisturized and protected from the sun, so I need something I can use every day, hopefully for what will be a very long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li>Face Lotion is a moisturizer / face lotion especially designed for men with sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>It stays slick just long enough to be spread and then quickly seeps into the skin.</li>

            <li> Feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> And to get the best results it should be used with the Dove face wash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a wonderful product, but the word &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient, needs clarification.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  </li>
            <li> and this is the best moisturizer that has ever happened to me.  </li>
            <li> not saying this is the best moisturizer, but I have acne-prone combination skin and this has been one of the best and cheapest moisturizers I have used.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price, that I know of, for this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Dove has changed their look and I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li> The price is also very good.</li>
            <li> very good lotion for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I feel it is a very good lotion for men.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is perfect for hydrating skin!</li>

            <li> This is a good, a very good, protective type lotion, a sunscreen if you will.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, feels great, protects great.  </li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> This is a great face lotion that doesn&#x27;t clog up the pores or leave me feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li> Smells great too.</li>

            <li> Great travel size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months and really am happy that I switched from the equivalent from L&#x27;Oreal Paris for Men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;good deal for a great product</li>
            <li> It moistens my skin without leaving it feel oily or anything, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Great lotion but</li>
            <li> Since I need year-round protection, I don&#x27;t want something that is going to make me breakout and Hydrate seems like a great solution.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a while and is great to use after shaving and when I have been out in the sun for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems like it would be great for people who have sensitivities to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great.</li>
            <li> and it feels great as it quenches your skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great</li>
            <li> Great product just for men.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and it works quite well without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to BzzAgent for letting me try this great product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect - it provides good moisturization without feeling greasy, and has a nice manly scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear full face foundation, not because I&#x27;ve got flawless beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> if Hydrate feels good on me, it should be great for you! :)</li>
            <li> This is a good product that feels pleasant and does what it says it will  Recommended.</li>
            <li> if he likes it, I believe it must be good.  </li>
            <li> So good, i can not go out with out it on my face&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that it took me 46 years to figure out the best way to keep my head, nose and face oil free is to just use this lotion.</li>
            <li> A Good Buy.</li>
            <li> This cream is not as good as the Clinique  </li>
            <li> It feels like it has good body bit</li>
            <li> Good face lotion</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> no issues... good on time delivery..</li>
            <li> this is a really good</li>
            <li> But for a ski trip, or lawn work, or a daytime jog/sports, this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> So good.  </li>
            <li> Good for travel and home.</li>
            <li> some good</li>
            <li> I said, the sunscreen is definitely a good idea - a lifetime of using an SPF 15 product on your face and neck should produce a prettier face at 50 than a lifetime of not.  </li>
            <li> Dove has been pleasantly surprising me with their products for men.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin, no itchiness, no nasty scent, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased there aren&#x27;t irritants (besides fragrance) in it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied though,</li>
            <li> This is good for that and, with the coming summer, its a nice pickup.</li>
            <li> lotion smells good and comes in a nice, compact case.</li>
            <li> I would think this face lotion is more ideal for the warmer seasons of the year, as opposed to the cooler months, seeing as how it is a very light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Another top product from Dove!</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion at a discounted price!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also has some spf which is always nice.  </li>
            <li> What if we want to wear our OWN cologne that doesn&#x27;t knock people over at 15 yards?  </li>
            <li> It was nice to try</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as clinique but definitely a better buy for the price.</li>
            <li> The 15 SPF is a nice touch for day to day activity.  </li>
            <li> quite nice.</li>
            <li> When used by itself the effect is not quite as good, but still more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes nicely, but that&#x27;s because I have lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s nice to know that Dove is concerned that people might pass by me and say, \\&quot;What</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my skin, it does not have a smell that reminds me of being on a beach or at a pool</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturizer and my wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> He liked this dove lotion and said it felt \\&quot;not greasy\\&quot; on his skin, which he hates.</li>
            <li> I think my title says it all \\&quot;Not greasy, smells nice,</li>
            <li> this one he liked because it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some others I&#x27;ve bought, and it didn&#x27;t cause him to break out like some I tried.</li>
            <li> all three products do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> , It doesn&#x27;t feel Oily or Greasy at all and has a nice smell but nothing too over</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The pump is very good as I would always get the right amount I need for face application</li>
            <li> /&gt;And most importantly it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> No grease and good frarance, easy to use</li>
            <li> , has a light pleasant scent, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Moisturiser as it was very easy to apply</li>
            <li> My face looks great and will continue to look good when i get older because of the spf 15.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves your face smooth</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve purchased made for men!</li>
            <li> good SPF provides good daily protection against the sun, especially important here in Texas.</li>
            <li> It feels great and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week on hands and face, his skin looks healthy and recovered nicely from the winter weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy lotion which is really good for men ( and women lol).</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this product more easily in stores!</li>
            <li> (I found it very light.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This provides a very light SPF for protection against the sun.</li>
            <li> I give this maximum rating as it&#x27;s very cheap and does the job</li>
            <li> My face did feel refresh and feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> lack of a scent is really nice because I am not a fan of strong scents</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week now as a bzz agent and I must say it is a really nice moisturiser with a really nice smell which lasts for hours ,it makes your skin nice and smooth and really does seem to energise your face I highly recommend this to anyone love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is light and refreshing and the face that their is sunscreen in it makes me love it more!</li>
            <li> i like it, there are probably better products out there</li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and lightness of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than stealing moisturizers from your wife.</li>
            <li> Like all Dove products, Dove Men+Care Face Lotion is top shelf.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite cream I ever use</li>
            <li> Im glad I found something with SPF that is manly smelling and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturized for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also love the smell</li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m going to be mostly indoors, i use jojoba oil (sometimes will still use this).</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil no matter what, for my beard (for those that don&#x27;t know, many beard oils use jojoba oil as their primary ingredient, so I just cut the BS and buy jojoba, though I do own some fancy beard oils when I want something</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products for my son learning to take care of his skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves his face nice and smooth, well hydrated with no bleeding and no girlie/flower scents.</li>
            <li> This goes on nice and light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and gives me a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has sunscreen in it</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with this Face lotion.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be ok Dove.</li>
            <li> I guess because silicome makes makeup go on better.</li>
            <li> Often, an itching face seems the most intolerable.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably get more than you need until you get used to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It really feels nice against my skin and feels like it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Also, after wearing this, nobody has mentioned that I now smell more like a man....</li>
            <li> love using the Hydrate</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sun screens and have found them to be a hassle to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product succeeds on both counts, which makes it a success.</li>
            <li> One pump should be more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need more moisturizer but he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been real impressed with the entire Men&#x27;s line of products from Dove.</li>
            <li> it a shot:)</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Love the dove men care items</li>
            <li> As a moisturizing lotion, this is just okay.  </li>
            <li> daytime, I buy it again for Christmas presents my son in-law  love it.</li>
            <li> but this one is even better.</li>
            <li> may not be satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some good success with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my face moisturized with out leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Awesome face lotion especially post shave.</li>
            <li> The hydrate is pretty good, goes on very light, non-greasy, just</li>
            <li> There is a very light scent, so it may not be great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Of course because my skin is far from flawless, full of problems...</li>
            <li> in all, a nice hydrating lotion with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> three are pretty good for not having a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> This product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be chock full of vitamins or antioxidants; this isn&#x27;t that kind of product.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion, makes your skin feel light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout and has a nice moisturizing affect that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent product for those whose skin tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin, has a mild smell and has an SPF-15 sun protection.</li>
            <li> The lotion in the bottle has a very mild smell, it smells like a lotion smell for lack of a better description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, I love that it is available as a subscribe and save item.  </li>
            <li> revitalize doesn&#x27;t have SPF, goes on light, but has a refreshing skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> Has a great masculine smell, and isn&#x27;t greasy when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Positives included the light smell and the pump on the container, which is one of the better pumps</li>
            <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> it soaks in nicely, has a fresh but not overpowering scent, and seems to have staying power.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, and not overpowering, but if you have a sensitivity to certain chemicals, knowing what &#x27;fragrance&#x27; consists of can be important.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, feels nice, and I keep stealing it whenever I notice a spot of dry skin on my own face, so we have to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that this lotion is nice if I use it right after I shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly rich lotion, and probably best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion applies easily.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The lotions absorbs very quickly and does not leave feeling sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a shame because its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easily five stars for how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer because it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clot, feeling good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it running off when I sweat, but I did notice that it washed away fairly easily if I happened to get something on my face that needed washing off.</li>
            <li> however, it smells too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> The difference is the scent of the Dove is way too strong.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a fragrance counter sense of smell, but I think the Revitalize has a strong smell than the Hydrate and Sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something with a higher SPF would have been nice.  </li>
            <li> It also works well against coming into contact with the sun and that&#x27;s pretty nice to find here as well.</li>
            <li> Just a clean, hydrating, soft and great product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer without SPF, I think the Aveeno moisturizer is still the hands down best.  </li>
            <li> The pump is nice and does not dispense too much of the product, easy to control quantity.  </li>
            <li> Great face lotion in a nice little container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Dove for Men products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> No break-outs or any after effect.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is light to non-existent, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of re-hydrating after a shave, but tends to feel greasy and not absorb very well.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> If you want a light face moisturizer that has some SPF in it, you must try Dove&#x27;s Men+Care Hydrate.</li>
            <li> 2 get one free</li>
            <li> I also like the scent which is fairly light not to overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling silky smooth before and after he&#x27;s shaved</li>
            <li> I should also note that during my radiation, my radiation oncologist said to use fragrance free Dove soap, which I used.</li>
            <li> Face lotion needs to be light and not greasy, but still do the job of hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried all 3 because they are cheap compared to the products I buy from department store, i.e., Lab Series.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted to smell like a cheap cologne, I would wear cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Wish it was fragrance free</li>
            <li> This really feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice no need for an after shave, will be too much scent.</li>
            <li> had used the aftershave with GREAT results, so I thought I&#x27;d give the facial lotion a shot by Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh and keeps my face moisterized all day.</li>
            <li> Works fine and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> He noticed significant improvements when he started to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t really leave any type of residue on your skin like most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product has a clean, somewhat unisex scent that fades away</li>
            <li> Clean and works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I can see the Unilever marketing machine at work, with so many positive reviews of this series of moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It does suffer the same problem as many with built-in SPF--slight stinging on freshly shaved skin, takes more effort to rub in completely--but the solar protection is a worthwhile trade off to my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it stops working when its about halfway full.</li>
            <li> for the amount and only 1.69 ounce, you are not getting a good value deal.</li>
            <li> no bad smell, not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> you are willing to spend more, department stores offer far better and far more advanced products like Lab Series.  </li>
            <li> I found was that this is a nice light lotion with undertones of the classic Dove scent, only slightly more manly.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff because it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t give him a greasy after feeling, or burn after applying post shave.  </li>
            <li> It does have some sun blocking ability, but one should re-apply as this absorbs quickly and won&#x27;t block the sun all day - none do.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or burn after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is mildly fragranced with a silky feel to it.  </li>
            <li> When I use SPF, it&#x27;s usually super water resistant, for fishing/surfing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super creamy when it comes out put the minute you spread it on your face</li>
            <li> (A quick reapplication solved this problem.)</li>
            <li> The scent dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It feels refreshing on your face and provides a light but quite masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is pretty light, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling richer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for any type of skin and I highly recommend it to men who have to shave on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> my wife bought me last year, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> For a product that is going to be located around your nose the odor is much too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and would keep the lotion as travel moisturizer, but now I think I&#x27;m ready to graduate to a higher quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It had positives and will surely please some men who don&#x27;t care so much about the lack of a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I do not attribute this to the soap, I just mention it, because I never got any kind of skin infection (of course I also ended up having to use some heavy duty burn cream which was pretty amazing).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended face cream for men because its very light, really moisturizes and protects against the number one ager for men, THE SUN!</li>
            <li> Very light not heavy or greasy as well.</li>
            <li> It applies light without really having to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to go into it,but asking for comfortable, calm skin isn&#x27;t asking much considering what I am working with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will update the star rating and the details later when I have a more accurate opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is so effective that I find it even keeps working the next day if I forget to reapply.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and goes on greaseless.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself comes in its own box and is pleasing enough to leave out on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Just buy this, put it on, and be pleasantly surprised when you find more people in/around your face area.</li>
            <li> most frequently with the Hydrate+</li>
            <li> The sun screen is a nice bonus (this appears to be in the Hydrate version only).</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed in my skin</li>
            <li> After watching an ad, thought this might be good for me, but empty, no.</li>
            <li> The lotion is absorbed into my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion fulfills the need for SPF moisturizer for me at a far better price point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really is a nice, basic product that is non-offensive for people who don&#x27;t like to feel residue on their faces.</li>
            <li> And why does Dove add fragrance to a product for sensitive skin when it is scientifically established fragrance is a top skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s face lotion so far.</li>
            <li> but it gets quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Hydrate, the Revitalize is more clear, not as creamy as the Hydrate.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a light fast absorbing facial moisturizer, with a nice good manly scent.</li>
            <li> The glycerin and dimethicone are the main moisturizing ingredients, and that is fine for what this is.</li>
            <li> It will certainly cost more since I normally get hand lotion in mongo sized pump</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy, yet absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I use it as a morning cream, and it provides just the right amount of moisture that I like-</li>
            <li> The redness didn&#x27;t go away right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid thirties woman, and I find most moisturizers for women to be full of promises and silicone.</li>
            <li> This lotion also provides a small amount of protection from the sun, which is a great added bonus.</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin feels light, however the stretchiness I feel does not change until I go back to Clearasil, and I&#x27;m going back for good.</li>
            <li> This is a definite must have if you live in a semiarid/arid climate or just have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did a great job of shipping the product and made sure that it arrived well within the promised time-frame.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed summer-related issues with my skin before, but the older I get, the more and more I find the sun making my face feel like a worn saddle.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it did not dry out my face like most lotions do.</li>
            <li> I tried to reapply again more generously, but again my face dried out once more.</li>
            <li> Men are becoming more concerned about their faces, even though women have gotten old and wrinkly while men traditionally have been described as ruggedly</li>
            <li> Well in regards to this specific product, I have to say I love it right away.  </li>
            <li> In short, I&#x27;m very comfortable using this product</li>
            <li> but hey, it is your face ;)</li>
            <li> I subscribed to this item without first trying it in the store, because I figured that it would just be face lotion with SPF 15 in it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon</li>
            <li> I tried Neutragenas \\&quot;equivalent\\&quot; and with it being a NON-Broad Spectrum product that was my first turn off.  </li>
            <li> hydrates pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to simply putting hand lotion on my face, and this is nicer feeling, though more fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that Dove is making a very competitive line of men&#x27;s care products that are worth trying.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I do break out occasionally, sometimes more often than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jim is funny about his face.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think men want smelly lotions on their face in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I was able to pick it up with a sizable discount when it went on promotion from my local store, and was eager to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> suppose I can also say that I like the way it dispenses the lotion (just press down on the top lightly).</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have stated, this is a decent to good product...</li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin, especially in the winter, but like many men isn&#x27;t so great about actually doing anything about it.</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try Dove Men+ Care as I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and recieved some free from them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lotion was absorbed very fast and had subtle pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine.</li>
            <li> One I use when I am out walking and in the sun and the other after shaving and when I am home and want my face to feel nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this is a fantastic lotion for men, and it has adequate SPF protection (if your face protection doesn&#x27;t have at least SPF15, I would look into that, and make sure that&#x27;s the face lotion you want)</li>
            <li> Long story short, he liked it!</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin more than it was originally.  </li>
            <li> Even though adding one more grooming chore seems like at least one more too much (\\&quot;You want me to floss AND moisturize?  </li>
            <li> It goes on the face clean, while the Hydrate goes on white but gets absorbed in a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that&#x27;s light, and will NOT MAKE MY FACE ITCH!</li>
            <li> Before re-buying this, however, I would probably want to try Jack Black&#x27;s Double-Duty Face Moisturizer, seeing as it is also quite popular.</li>
            <li> (with 15 SPF sunscreen) feels slightly smoother and the revitalize felt kind of oily</li>
            <li> just liquid enough to spread easily.</li>
            <li> The Dove Face Lotion also seems to be less oily and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> way to strong a smell for use in public.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I felt that it was time to get smart and take care of</li>
            <li> This product though goes on very smooth, rubs in and dries quickly, and actually makes me last longer through the day before I start noticing an oily forehead.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face and much cheaper than the Jack Black</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use lotion on my face before I decided to give this a go for no particular reason at all, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for staying moisturized after shaving and especially in the harsh winter months.  </li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has really helped protect my face against the desert heat and the SPF 15</li>
            <li> Anyway, I noticed an immediate difference using this in combination with Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Creamy Formula.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use facial moisturizers and daily SPF, my face tends to be on the oily side and most leave in products make my face feel oilier and like it can&#x27;t breath.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to but does not bother me as much now.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your skin very hydrated when you use it in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel much, but it was still very convenient.</li>
            <li> Well it must of really worked/</li>
            <li> It goes really fast.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate Face Lotion is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of Dove face lotions it is gentle on your skin and also includes SPF 15 protects skin from sun</li>
            <li> and, it is much cheaper than a lot of the specialty lotions, like Arbonne, etc.</li>
            <li> for the fragrance of still smelling like a man, I don&#x27;t really get that.</li>
            <li> but thanks totheir fragrance, I guess that shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> My skin burned VERY severely, they told me they never saw anyone burn as much as I had.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> and I found it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Dove Men+Care hydrate face lotion is very oily.  </li>
            <li> I guess men don&#x27;t really get the difference between face lotion and body lotion?</li>
            <li> Well, that isn&#x27;t very helpful, so I gave it a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t walk away feeling you have goop on your face.</li>
            <li> moisturizers are so basic, they are no known advanced ingredients to provide any anti-aging or skin-repairing benefits.  </li>
            <li> And if it does not work, your bank is not broken in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One pump is way too much for my face and leaves it really greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle \\&quot;oatmeal\\&quot; smell that fades away almost immediately</li>
            <li> that REALLY dries out your face</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I started using Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not, as pointed out by others, an aftershave, but instead it&#x27;s a product very specifically designed to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has a very strong scent reminiscent of Dove soap or women&#x27;s facial products, and the smell lasts ALL day until you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> , this is why it got a 4 out of 5, other than that its ok</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like other sunscreens that have to be washed off, or that sweat off, rather it is much more like a lotion, as the name would indicate.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and provides moisture for the dry skin on my face and provides SPF15 protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> For really active people, this should be treated more like a bit of bonus sunscreen in a moisturizer, rather than a full-on sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your budget restrict you to drugstore products, then there still better choices such as Neutrogena for Men, or just Olay products (though not grey color</li>
            <li> Just one full squeeze of the bottle and that should be enough to use.</li>
            <li> 15 isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;s better than nothing in my book, especially since my husband doesn&#x27;t use sunscreen on a daily basis when outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I am new to the face-care product world, but I like this non-greasy formula and my girlfriend really likes it on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent lotion for the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a decent lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out, isn&#x27;t too thick, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with a stronger SPF, especially for after the winter, when I will be outside much more</li>
            <li> This facial lotion has a silky feel that absorbs relatively quickly, for being a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> B003USG91S Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce]] which has double the SPF and to me has a nicer fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and makes his skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For anything lighter like the dove face wash, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as a self-care product.</li>
            <li> With all the rave reviews, I had high hopes for the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but this is very inexpensive and also offers a SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Tried this and did not like it as much as I like Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It seems to really be geared toward sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Of course if you spend hundreds of dollars on expensive face products, this will be in no comparison to them obviously, welcome to drugstores.  </li>
            <li> Now when i decited to order this i was getting it because after ever shower i use face lotion, normally usher face lotion, but i wanted to change it up, so i got this, the headline says face lotion, nothing about sunscreen,</li>
            <li> even though the discription does, i didnt read that tho, so when it arrived, first of all the container really couldnt be any smaller, but</li>
            <li> After a few days my skin feels healthy.</li>
            <li> However if you do have a sensitive skin be aware that even sensitive version of the lotion contains fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Affordable, SPF 15 is powerful enough for hours in the sun (for me), and helps keep your face from getting dry/peely.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like smaller, super short shaving cream dispensers.  </li>
            <li> A small amount covers the whole face and leaves it feeling nice, but doesn&#x27;t have enough odor to linger.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new lotions for my face and neck</li>
            <li> Been looking for a new face lotion</li>
            <li> Both of them gave me pretty similar reviews on this and the other Dove Men product we tried, and while both though it was &#x27;fine&#x27;, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> the negative side, both agreed that SPF 15 is nothing, especially if you&#x27;re fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> The only issues is that it isn&#x27;t very much in that tub.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, but not to the point where I break out with clusters of pimples.  </li>
            <li> (My face is VERY VERY VERY sensitive to chemicals.)</li>
            <li> I originally got this in a gift set and figured that it was like any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> The bottle of this looks almost exactly the same as Clarins Men Moisture Balm.</li>
            <li> (I especially look forward to using this in the winter, when proper moisturizing is more valuable and critical.)</li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;ve spent full days laying out on Miami Beach.)  </li>
            <li> The masculine scent is fairly strong but that&#x27;s not a huge turnoff</li>
            <li> pump is very economical, you can squeeze out an amount smaller than half the size of a raindrop if you press very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll just make sure I apply as little as possible).</li>
            <li> I am nearly 50 years old and  look like I am  in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> --skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About a year ago, I started swiping dollops of moisturizer from my wife&#x27;s vast collection; however, the feminine fragrances weren&#x27;t much to my liking, so I grabbed a container of Dove Men + Care Hydrate + Face Lotion.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is I wish the SPF lasted longer than 3 hours, who wants to reapply this throughout the day?</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to smells, otherwise, stay away.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He is in his 50&#x27;s, but better late than never.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like the smell</li>
            <li> have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I the lotion worked for me even though I didn&#x27;t use sensitive version.</li>
            <li> It produces foam that you apply to your face and it does not apply as well as gel and also do not feel as moisturized as Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> what happen to the rest, it&#x27;s very short and for the price it seems like they pulled a fast one on me</li>
            <li> Sensitive+</li>
            <li> Sensitive was the thinnest with an</li>
            <li> plan to use the Sensitive+</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well with sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> (I had 35 days of radiation to my left side from my cheek bone to just under my clavicle) trying to find something that is really going to moisturize my skin, protect me from the sun</li>
            <li> Dove makes both a Hydrate and Sensitive + in this line of products.</li>
            <li> Sensitive + has no smell.</li>
            <li> It just makes your skin feel soft and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only that, it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well...</li>
            <li> With the results so far, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the price to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now and I really appreciate the combination of SPF protection and the soothing lotion.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the Nivea Men Sensitive Gel Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough sun exposure to tell if the SPF ingredient is working as it should, but it seems like my face has been protected somewhat in that it hasn&#x27;t tanned as much as my arms have while I&#x27;ve been out in the yard working.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it ANYWHERE near my eyes at all whatsoever, or it burns like hell</li>
            <li> also tried the Sensitive.</li>
            <li> But after a shave, I could feel the Sensitive soothing a bit</li>
            <li> the three, I would rate the Hydrate and Sensitive ahead of the Revitalize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> of unusual, given the fact that pretty much all face lotions on the market can at least be rubbed in near the eyes.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little strong for him, but only because he prefers completely unscented.</li>
            <li> We live in a very dry area, so this really helps.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and smooth, which lasts for at least 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this will really help.</li>
            <li> Personally I like the fragrance of this face lotion, as it is smells very manly and lasts for around ten minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, as I have poor oily skin and have trouble finding a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft, and was even comfortable on my usually over-oily nose.</li>
            <li> Much better than all the other heavy greasy lotions on the market.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft throughout the day and the smell is light and subtle.</li>
            <li> This is a light face lotion, you can hardly tell its there.</li>
            <li> He also uses it instead of sunscreen when we go out on sunny days for general</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in my pocket or in the glove compartment of my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going back to Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (I no longer had any natural protection on the left side), and not irritate my skin or feel oilly.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li> You really do not want that much oil on your face.  </li>
            <li> I get sebhorreic dermatitis on my face and this makes it worse than when using more benign lotions like CeraVae.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product if the summer has your face feeling cracked and dry.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or wants to add some moisture to their face to help prevent acne products from drying their skin out as severely.</li>
            <li> It does not go on greasy, and feels rich and thick when being applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 yr old Hispanic male and my skin dries out instantly when we hit October.</li>
            <li> The Sensitive+ is a bit more faint, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li> While it may be a little more expensive than some of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; lotions, I think it is worth it....</li>
            <li> , no side effects like greasy face later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the container, in smaller font, states that it has broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to understand, my skin on the left side is soft, but will always need to be moisturized and protected from the sun, so I need something I can use every day, hopefully for what will be a very long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li> Face Lotion is a moisturizer / face lotion especially designed for men with sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> It stays slick just long enough to be spread and then quickly seeps into the skin.</li>
            <li> For people who are sensitive to smells, you may want to consider one of the other formulas of this lotion or another one entirely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a small dab of this product to cover one&#x27;s whole face.</li>
            <li> That might suggest that it is excessively oily and needs to be spread around to get it all absorbed, but that&#x27;s really not the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this, this early, because while Amazon is typically cheaper than local places, this product can be picked up for $5.50 at Target.</li>
            <li> A lot of cosmetics and toiletries companies have started to expand their markets by telling men they need products that have long been the realm of women only.</li>
            <li> The stuff is pretty thick</li>
            <li> but when it does it works very very well as little as a little thick to make sure to take on a small amounts the leather on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white, very thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially alongside my nose (I also have eczema, so that&#x27;s probably why).  </li>
            <li> I only use it when I feel dry, for example after a day in the sun or when I plan to spend time</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face tends to get dry, especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it on a daily basis since my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it is in the winter, so by then I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> To get a second opinion I ask several other men and women and they all agree it</li>
            <li> You can probably find it similarly priced at other local businesses.</li>
            <li> offers a little sun protection without being all greasy like some sunscreens are.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who already has an oily face, It did make my face soft but excessively oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser also makes it less likely to end up all over whatever else it&#x27;s kept with -- unlike the flip cap bottles that open all the time, getting your lotion everywhere</li>
            <li> After I applied this Dove Lotion everyday, one week later, I feel my face not dry anymore</li>
            <li> I originally thought $7 (in store price) was ridiculous for such a small amount, but a little goes a long way and I am using the same bottle months later.</li>
            <li> Within 5-6 minutes, my face begins to dry out, and feels stretched.</li>
            <li> last thing I want to mention is the smell, as other reviewers have touched upon.  </li>
            <li> If it holds up long term and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, it&#x27;ll be a triumph!</li>
            <li> I got it to help out my husbands dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It has helped relieve razor burn and scaly patches he gets during the dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> The dry skin was gone, and it stayed gone.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after i shower and have never had dry skin again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something for my husband to use on his extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Its not cakey and doesnt dry out his face.</li>
            <li> I got this Hydrating Face Lotion for my husband, who gets dry skin during winter months.  </li>
            <li> However i would not recommend this for extremly dry skin types like myself.</li>
            <li> Might be because my skin was dry from Acne wipes.</li>
            <li> It may of been considered a bit of a splurge (or waste of money beforehand by my husband) but we will definitely be purchasing these Dove Men+Care products again in the future.</li>
            <li> B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]].&lt;br</li>
            <li> texture is decent, and is neither runny like water nor excessively thick like Nivea.  </li>
            <li> Normally, he&#x27;s not a lotion man, so to speak, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it comes down to personal preference...</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin from being dry and I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it half my face for a week, and I can definitely tell a difference -</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry in the winter</li>
            <li> My face is very dry and esp.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this routine would leave my face very dry and make my face break out.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get very dry skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tiny little thing to remove before you can get the lotion to come out.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is a little gimmicky but it works so far.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time: a small dab is enough each day.</li>
            <li> So I went and purchased both the Dove Men + Care Face Wash &amp; Face Lotion both in sensitive for him to at least try to see if that helped his skin.</li>
            <li> He is not really into face creams and fancy things, so</li>
            <li> Also it ran out quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> I never really felt the need, or even the desire to put lotion on my face, but I thought I would give this product a test run.</li>
            <li> I never really smelled any poduct that was marketed for men that smelled overly feminine, and my wife has never told me I smell like her, nor have my friends ever told me I smell like their wife/girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste it, I tried using it on my arms instead of my face, but even so, the smell was overpowering so its simply unusable in my book.</li>
            <li> their lifelong face lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While they may not have become lifelong friends with this Dove Men product, they didn&#x27;t dislike it.  </li>
            <li> Although the lotion doesn&#x27;t &#x27;dry&#x27; up immediately, it does feel dry within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Definitely felt like my skin was hydrated after using, though my skin was also oddly shiny for a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> and it is small enough that I can carry it in my pocket and not really notice it.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m a non-caucasion male who knows very little about sunblock/sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> What amazes me is that this product costs pennies compared to all the other &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; men&#x27;s face hydration lotions.</li>
            <li> Check my other Dove Care Men products reviews.</li>
            <li> I would probably consider re-buying this lotion, although I might test one of the other formulas.  </li>
            <li> this did not make my face burn like other lotions</li>
            <li> Usually if I plan on going outside a lot/getting a lot of sun, I will use this.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face about every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have used it by itself and in conjunction with other Dove products like their face wash.  </li>
            <li> You might want to buy some small sample sizes at your local pharmacy and see which you prefer.  </li>
            <li> You put it on and you then forget that you even put it on - in other words</li>
            <li> This is such a small amount of product</li>
            <li> Other than that the smell isn&#x27;t bad, just unecessary, and really helps with dry skin when used daily.</li>
            <li> my only complaint about this is the design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong here.</li>
            <li> my advice would be for them to add a tube that reaches down to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> No watering down necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotion.</li>
            <li> I find myself applying loction as well just to keep my face half hydrated.</li>
            <li> the moisturized side feels smoother and has less friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always found them to be slightly Oily /</li>
            <li> Also has a slight manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> a little research and previously knowledge</li>
            <li> It hydrates but leaves my skin with a tight, sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> but it was a little oily.</li>
            <li> Even at times I&#x27;m told his face/skin would bleed a little bit.</li>
            <li> it does it&#x27;s job, but $5 dollars plus for this little thing is a joke, offer 2 for that price</li>
            <li> It can take a little bit to squeeze some out</li>
            <li> If you do not mind a little guyish scent and want a product that does what it claims, then this is for you.  </li>
            <li> (Perhaps I put it on a little heavy)  </li>
            <li> I swear by this product and will continue using it in the future, especially during the cold winter.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because the winter cold really dries out his skin.</li>
            <li> ive been through a few bottles of this and each time the pump stops working halfway through forcing me to pry the pump off and just put my finger in to apply.</li>
            <li> I found that I can do sort of a &#x27;half-pump&#x27; and spread it thinly over my entire face without feeling to heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Will throw away, waste of money, no more Dove products.  </li>
            <li> At least if you try this and do not like it, you will not end up spending half a paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;C)</li>
            <li> If you do choose to buy it, use very little of it and spread it across your face evenly.  </li>
            <li> takes a small amount to spread across my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Too small amount though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day and the small bottle has lasted about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> three come in surprisingly small dispensers  -1.69 oz.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is somewhat small for the price, but it&#x27;s advertised like that, so just a head up there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Healthy Skin from Neutrogena, but the scent was so awful compared to the Dove Men Care Hydrate Lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Skin Creams and After Shave Balms in the past</li>
            <li> so I usually put a dab with some water and rub it in my hands before spreading it onto my face.</li>
            <li> I have bad dry skin, especially due to the dry winters up here in the northeast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The can is sleek and very small, and after shaving and washing your face, you pump out a small amount and rub it in.  </li>
            <li> If he got desperate enough he would try something I had then complain about the scent (girlie/flower</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate ladies who looks like an aged whore in makeup.</li>
            <li> The benefits of Hydrate are easier to spot than Revitalize, at least for me on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s face wash, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> to being serious.</li>
            <li> But after reading a fairly gruesome article about facial skin cancer in a men&#x27;s magazine, I started to take some of the hype seriously and began using face care products regularly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The smell that is emanating from my face right now is pungent and terrible.  </li>
            <li> If you have greasy skin, this will probably make it worse.</li>
            <li> A lot smoother than usual and also when it comes to Shaving, I&#x27;ve found my skin isn&#x27;t as bad after I&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> Apparently Dove thinks that \\&quot;for men\\&quot; means it should smell like a car air freshener knockoff of horrible cologne from 1991.  </li>
            <li> Oh, how wrong I was.  </li>
            <li> if we don&#x27;t want to smell like creepy nightclub dude cologne, Dove?  </li>
            <li> This is something that is often exaggerated.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I wish all three were this faint or that they have no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance from the lotion irritates my eyes, making it uncomfortable for about an hour after use.  </li>
            <li> but like getting out and hiking and fishing, and I hate something that feels heavy.</li>
            <li> The lotion stinks like hell...</li>
            <li> suffers the pain in the cold winter.</li>
            <li> I think it stinks.</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it stinks.</li>
            <li> Boy was I so wrong!</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive morning moisturizer with antioxidants and sunscreen that I use on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells bad.  </li>
            <li> an ugly woman,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> oh well, but the lotion litterally smells like sun screen, and i absolutly hate the smell of sun screen</li>
            <li> You do get what you pay for and these products are crap...</li>
            <li> hate, hate, hate this item.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only face moisturizer ive ever tried so take that with a grain of salt. i like it, there are probably better products out there but this is very inexpensive and also offers a SPF protection. my only complaint about this is the design of the bottle. ive been through a few bottles of this and each time the pump stops working halfway through forcing me to pry the pump off and just put my finger in to apply. it stops working when its about halfway full. my advice would be for them to add a tube that reaches down to the bottom of the container. no bad smell, not greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> It works ok.  I got it to help out my husbands dry skin.  It seems to work but not like I was hoping.  It is not overly oily.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this will really help. If you have greasy skin, this will probably make it worse. It also has spf, so if you don&#x27;y like skin cancer, you might like this product.</li>
            <li> this was on sale so i bought this.  works great--skin feels soft.  however, it smells too strong for my taste.  i</li>
            <li> Love this product. Bought another one already. It feels great on the skin, no itchiness, no nasty scent, no stickiness. Just a clean, hydrating, soft and great product. Do recommend. A bit pricey but hey, it is your face ;)</li>
            <li> Nice facial moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout and has a nice moisturizing affect that absorbs quickly into the skin. Personally I like the fragrance of this face lotion, as it is smells very manly and lasts for around ten minutes or so. I would think this face lotion is more ideal for the warmer seasons of the year, as opposed to the cooler months, seeing as how it is a very light moisturizer. Overall I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a light fast absorbing facial moisturizer, with a nice good manly scent.</li>
            <li> Dove attached a sample of this lotion to my husband&#x27;s deodorant. He started using it and asked me to buy him some. He uses it every morning. He has oily skin but this doesn&#x27;t seem to make his face greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves your face smooth</li>
            <li> Now when i decited to order this i was getting it because after ever shower i use face lotion, normally usher face lotion, but i wanted to change it up, so i got this, the headline says face lotion, nothing about sunscreen, even though the discription does, i didnt read that tho, so when it arrived, first of all the container really couldnt be any smaller, but oh well, but the lotion litterally smells like sun screen, and i absolutly hate the smell of sun screen, this is why it got a 4 out of 5, other than that its ok</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff because it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t give him a greasy after feeling, or burn after applying post shave.  Plus, I love that it is available as a subscribe and save item.  He is not really into face creams and fancy things, so if he likes it, I believe it must be good.  We live in a very dry area, so this really helps.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry in the winter so I wanted something I could use that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts.  Well this works perfectly.  It&#x27;s about medium consistensy and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue.  It also has some spf which is always nice.  If you want something that keeps your face from drying out and goes on invisible then I recommend this.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and makes his skin feel very smooth.  It has helped relieve razor burn and scaly patches he gets during the dry winter weather.  There is a very light scent, so it may not be great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I originally got this in a gift set and figured that it was like any other lotion.  Boy was I so wrong! I was needing a lotion that I could put on my face after I got out of the shower that wouldn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.  This lotion is great for any type of skin and I highly recommend it to men who have to shave on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> So good, i can not go out with out it on my face&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this product more easily in stores! I bought this for my brother, but I (a female) like to use it too. I use it as a morning cream, and it provides just the right amount of moisture that I like- anyone and everyone can use this!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve purchased made for men! Love the feel and lightness of it. The smell is light and refreshing and the face that their is sunscreen in it makes me love it more! This is the only one I will ever buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I cannot believe that it took me 46 years to figure out the best way to keep my head, nose and face oil free is to just use this lotion. It is so effective that I find it even keeps working the next day if I forget to reapply. What amazes me is that this product costs pennies compared to all the other &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; men&#x27;s face hydration lotions. My head is no longer oily and shiny now that I use this product.</li>
            <li> I also recommend for barbers to use after they give baldys and shaves.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend gifted this lotion to me and it is a solid product, but its too expensive for 1.69oz. I&#x27;d rather buy another brand of face lotion, instead of wasting 6 bucks on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed summer-related issues with my skin before, but the older I get, the more and more I find the sun making my face feel like a worn saddle.  It is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, I started swiping dollops of moisturizer from my wife&#x27;s vast collection; however, the feminine fragrances weren&#x27;t much to my liking, so I grabbed a container of Dove Men + Care Hydrate + Face Lotion.  It has really helped protect my face against the desert heat and the SPF 15 offers a little sun protection without being all greasy like some sunscreens are.  I&#x27;ve also found that this lotion is nice if I use it right after I shave.  It helps sooth those spots where I sometimes catch a layer of skin along with the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product if the summer has your face feeling cracked and dry.  It is definitely better than stealing moisturizers from your wife.</li>
            <li> No grease and good frarance, easy to use</li>
            <li> I subscribed to this item without first trying it in the store, because I figured that it would just be face lotion with SPF 15 in it.  Oh, how wrong I was.  Apparently Dove thinks that \\&quot;for men\\&quot; means it should smell like a car air freshener knockoff of horrible cologne from 1991.  The smell that is emanating from my face right now is pungent and terrible.  I&#x27;m never putting this stuff on my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if we don&#x27;t want to smell like creepy nightclub dude cologne, Dove?  What if we want to wear our OWN cologne that doesn&#x27;t knock people over at 15 yards?  What if I want to breathe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate, hate, hate this item.  Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Finally a fix to my problem. I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially alongside my nose (I also have eczema, so that&#x27;s probably why).  Anyway, I noticed an immediate difference using this in combination with Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Creamy Formula.  The dry skin was gone, and it stayed gone.  I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the product for you! Like all Dove products, Dove Men+Care Face Lotion is top shelf. The compact container is durable, making it perfect to throw in your car or backpack so you&#x27;ll have it when needed. The pump dispenser also makes it less likely to end up all over whatever else it&#x27;s kept with -- unlike the flip cap bottles that open all the time, getting your lotion everywhere but on your skin! Dove Men+Care Face Lotion is as advertised -- rather than leaving an oily film, your skin will soak it up. It isn&#x27;t like other sunscreens that have to be washed off, or that sweat off, rather it is much more like a lotion, as the name would indicate. Another top product from Dove!</li>
            <li> I am nearly 50 years old and  look like I am  in my early 30&#x27;s. I have been using face lotion since the 80&#x27;s.This product is excellent for men.The scent is fresh and goes on greaseless. A Good Buy. Check my other Dove Care Men products reviews.</li>
            <li> Another great Dove product! I rarely use facial moisturizers and daily SPF, my face tends to be on the oily side and most leave in products make my face feel oilier and like it can&#x27;t breath. This product though goes on very smooth, rubs in and dries quickly, and actually makes me last longer through the day before I start noticing an oily forehead. Only downside is I wish the SPF lasted longer than 3 hours, who wants to reapply this throughout the day?</li>
            <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great as a daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t dry your skin.  It does have some sun blocking ability, but one should re-apply as this absorbs quickly and won&#x27;t block the sun all day - none do.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or burn after shaving.  No break-outs or any after effect.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is light to non-existent, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;Only takes a small amount to spread across my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite cream I ever use</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh and keeps my face moisterized all day. I especially like the SPF 15 protection. I used another MUCH more expensive face cream that had SPF 15 in it, but was looking for a replacement. This is perfect.</li>
            <li> This cream is not as good as the Clinique  my wife bought me last year, but it is pretty good. It lasts a long time: a small dab is enough each day. It feels like it has good body bit it does not leave your face feeling oily or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good SPF provides good daily protection against the sun, especially important here in Texas. After a few days my skin feels healthy. I only use it when I feel dry, for example after a day in the sun or when I plan to spend time outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great face lotion that doesn&#x27;t clog up the pores or leave me feeling slimy.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> For a product that is going to be located around your nose the odor is much too strong. After an hour I had to wash off the product and discontinue its use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Too small amount though. Im glad I found something with SPF that is manly smelling and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon but I&#x27;ll try to be as thorough as possible.  Please keep in mind that this is a review for the &#x27;Hydrate&#x27; formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent lotion for the price.  The bottle itself comes in its own box and is pleasing enough to leave out on the counter.  It&#x27;s about the size of a standard bottle of cologne.  The pump retracts into the bottle itself and comes with a cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is decent, and is neither runny like water nor excessively thick like Nivea.  You could say that it&#x27;s consistency compares to that of hair conditioner.  When I put it on, it does not feel greasy at all.  This is something that is often exaggerated.  A company says that its lotion isn&#x27;t greasy yet it feels like you&#x27;re smearing butter on your face.  This lotion is not greasy at all and does not leave your face looking shiny as if it were polished silver.  It keeps my face moisturized for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I want to mention is the smell, as other reviewers have touched upon.  For people who are sensitive to smells, you may want to consider one of the other formulas of this lotion or another one entirely.  To me, the smell seems to be a cross between vanilla and coconut.  It took some getting used to but does not bother me as much now.  The scent does tend to linger for a while, so that is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent lotion.  I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to smells, otherwise, stay away.  I would probably consider re-buying this lotion, although I might test one of the other formulas.  Before re-buying this, however, I would probably want to try Jack Black&#x27;s Double-Duty Face Moisturizer, seeing as it is also quite popular.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. this did not make my face burn like other lotions</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin very hydrated when you use it in the morning and night. Also love the smell</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and jojoba oil. Usually if I plan on going outside a lot/getting a lot of sun, I will use this. If i&#x27;m going to be mostly indoors, i use jojoba oil (sometimes will still use this). I use jojoba oil no matter what, for my beard (for those that don&#x27;t know, many beard oils use jojoba oil as their primary ingredient, so I just cut the BS and buy jojoba, though I do own some fancy beard oils when I want something scented)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a fantastic lotion for men, and it has adequate SPF protection (if your face protection doesn&#x27;t have at least SPF15, I would look into that, and make sure that&#x27;s the face lotion you want)</li>
            <li> I FINALLY got my husband to use a moisturizer for his face.  He is in his 50&#x27;s, but better late than never.  He uses this after every shower and loves it.  It soaks in, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  He uses this in conjunction with the Dove Men&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m a non-caucasion male who knows very little about sunblock/sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve never been burnt or had any irritation from the sun.  (And I&#x27;ve spent full days laying out on Miami Beach.)  Anyways, I felt that it was time to get smart and take care of my skin/face more.&lt;br /&gt;With a little research and previously knowledge I&#x27;ve arrived at this product.  I tried Neutragenas \\&quot;equivalent\\&quot; and with it being a NON-Broad Spectrum product that was my first turn off.  Well in regards to this specific product, I have to say I love it right away.  It applies light without really having to rub it in.  The masculine scent is fairly strong but that&#x27;s not a huge turnoff (I&#x27;ll just make sure I apply as little as possible). I will say I cannot stand the design of how the lotion is dispensed.  I do recommend this product and I think I&#x27;ll be a user for awhile to come.</li>
            <li> Good face lotion but it was a little oily. It was nice to try but I will stick to my preferred brand.</li>
            <li> Great product for all types of faces. I am not Anglo and the lotion works well on my face. I added the lotion to my Amazon subscription list.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Works fine and shipped quickly. I would buy this product again all things being considered. Not quite as good as clinique but definitely a better buy for the price.</li>
            <li> look no further.  Dove Men+Care is awesome for a man&#x27;s face.  It&#x27;s also great to use after a shave since it moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. The product is the only one I use for my face.</li>
            <li> The hydrate is pretty good, goes on very light, non-greasy, just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The revitalize doesn&#x27;t have SPF, goes on light, but has a refreshing skin feeling.  It&#x27;s just a tad greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face about every other day.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t really leave any type of residue on your skin like most moisturizers.  The 15 SPF is a nice touch for day to day activity.  Just remember that this wont replace sunscreen.  The SPF wears away and it isn&#x27;t water or sweat prof.</li>
            <li> I apply this product to my face immediately after shaving and it cools the skin without over-cooling it. My face feels soft throughout the day and the smell is light and subtle. I have received compliments about the look of my skin after using. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I put it on after i shower and have never had dry skin again. My face looks great and will continue to look good when i get older because of the spf 15.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen/heard of a man buying lotion.  Was referenced in a movie, but literally never heard or talked about buying lotion.  Why would you, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to talk about it.  Just buy this, put it on, and be pleasantly surprised when you find more people in/around your face area.</li>
            <li> I am new to the face-care product world, but I like this non-greasy formula and my girlfriend really likes it on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something for my husband to use on his extremely dry skin. This actually helped him. He noticed significant improvements when he started to use it. It smells nice, feels nice, and I keep stealing it whenever I notice a spot of dry skin on my own face, so we have to buy more. Great product.</li>
            <li> quite nice. Title should have said &#x27;sun screen.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t work too well for me. It does a nice job of re-hydrating after a shave, but tends to feel greasy and not absorb very well.</li>
            <li> So far, I like the smell and it is not oily or greasy after put it on my face. My upper lip get scruffy skin and hopefully this will take care of it. Will report back.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products for my son learning to take care of his skin. Its not cakey and doesnt dry out his face. Works well!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who already has an oily face, It did make my face soft but excessively oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is perfect if you travel. I don&#x27;t travel much, but it was still very convenient. The pump is very good as I would always get the right amount I need for face application and I not have any residue left on the dispenser. I purchased moisturizer and sun screen version of the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer was great. It didn&#x27;t feel greasy, skin did not have any shine and felt great. Lotion was absorbed very fast and had subtle pleasant smell. I think the effects of the lotion lasted for about 2-3 hours. I have an combination skin and after that the skin turned oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin and I the lotion worked for me even though I didn&#x27;t use sensitive version. However if you do have a sensitive skin be aware that even sensitive version of the lotion contains fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the sun protection lacked and was almost non existent. I burned my face after 2 hours in the sun after I applied the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and would keep the lotion as travel moisturizer, but now I think I&#x27;m ready to graduate to a higher quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works great. as described.. no issues... good on time delivery..</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used this every day and the small bottle has lasted about 3 months.  The lotion applies easily.  Skin feels both moist but not oily afterwards.  The price is also very good.</li>
            <li> very good lotion for my boyfriend. Maybe i will buy it as a gift for my dad next time. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using it. I feel it is a very good lotion for men. No complain. Go with it!</li>
            <li> Tried this and did not like it as much as I like Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  It produces foam that you apply to your face and it does not apply as well as gel and also do not feel as moisturized as Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.  Also it ran out quicker than expected.  I am going back to Nivea Sensitive Gel Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Every time my husband would wash his face with just soap and water he would come out and start complaining about how his face would hurt &amp; look ridiculously red. Even at times I&#x27;m told his face/skin would bleed a little bit. My husband is stubborn and he would never consider going to buy a Face Wash &amp; Face Lotion tailored just for men. If he got desperate enough he would try something I had then complain about the scent (girlie/flower you get the idea). We kept seeing commercials on tv advertising about Dove having products just for men. When I suggested he try that he didn&#x27;t want to waste/spend the money on junk.. So I went and purchased both the Dove Men + Care Face Wash &amp; Face Lotion both in sensitive for him to at least try to see if that helped his skin. Well it must of really worked/helped his skin because he just basically came up to me and told me that I should review them on here and tell people that it does work. He can now wash his face! The redness didn&#x27;t go away right away but it does eventually go away. Also it leaves his face nice and smooth, well hydrated with no bleeding and no girlie/flower scents. It may of been considered a bit of a splurge (or waste of money beforehand by my husband) but we will definitely be purchasing these Dove Men+Care products again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works well without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Great travel size. Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy. Smells clean without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> hydrates pretty well. Has a great masculine smell, and isn&#x27;t greasy when you apply it. The only issues is that it isn&#x27;t very much in that tub. It goes really fast.</li>
            <li> If you want a light face moisturizer that has some SPF in it, you must try Dove&#x27;s Men+Care Hydrate. This goes on nice and light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months and really am happy that I switched from the equivalent from L&#x27;Oreal Paris for Men.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and gives me a nice healthy glow.  My go-to facial lotion</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion, makes your skin feel light and fresh.  I also love that it has sunscreen in it and I can leave my hat at home.  Much better than all the other heavy greasy lotions on the market.</li>
            <li> love the product&lt;br /&gt;got the 3 pack hydrate when the offer was buy 2 get one free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good deal for a great product</li>
            <li> Really satisfied with this Face lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion stinks like hell...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use lotion on my face before I decided to give this a go for no particular reason at all, but I love it. It moistens my skin without leaving it feel oily or anything, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great lotion but what happen to the rest, it&#x27;s very short and for the price it seems like they pulled a fast one on me, don&#x27;t get me wrong it does it&#x27;s job, but $5 dollars plus for this little thing is a joke, offer 2 for that price and you&#x27;ll be ok Dove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid thirties woman, and I find most moisturizers for women to be full of promises and silicone. I guess because silicome makes makeup go on better. I don&#x27;t wear full face foundation, not because I&#x27;ve got flawless beautiful skin. I am one of those unfortunate ladies who looks like an aged whore in makeup. Of course because my skin is far from flawless, full of problems...I don&#x27;t need to go into it,but asking for comfortable, calm skin isn&#x27;t asking much considering what I am working with.&lt;br /&gt;I digress.&lt;br /&gt;Most lotions for the face make mine itch, and that is a big problem. Often, an itching face seems the most intolerable. Then comes welts and/hives. I have searched high and low for something that&#x27;s light, and will NOT MAKE MY FACE ITCH! I saw this at Walmart and I figured as fellow reviewer Jasmine and thought: &amp;#34;hey, it smells a bit guyish but it just might work&amp;#34; You know what? It does. No itchy face, no hives, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended face cream for men because its very light, really moisturizes and protects against the number one ager for men, THE SUN! I&#x27;m a 27 yr old Hispanic male and my skin dries out instantly when we hit October. Thus I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of different kinds of moisturizers. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out, isn&#x27;t too thick, and smells great.</li>
            <li> Amazon won&#x27;t let me write separate reviews so I am combining them here for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dove Men+ Care Hydrate+ face lotion&lt;br /&gt;- Dove Men+ Care Sensitive+ face lotion&lt;br /&gt;- Dove Men+ Care Revitalize+ face lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three come in surprisingly small dispensers  -1.69 oz.  They look exactly like smaller, super short shaving cream dispensers.  You&#x27;ll probably get more than you need until you get used to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 have the same, neutral scent.  The Sensitive+ is a bit more faint, which I prefer.  I wish all three were this faint or that they have no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are pretty good for not having a greasy feel.  The Hydrate+ (with 15 SPF sunscreen) feels slightly smoother and the revitalize felt kind of oily (Perhaps I put it on a little heavy)  Sensitive was the thinnest with an in-between feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a convenient way to go.  I&#x27;m used to simply putting hand lotion on my face, and this is nicer feeling, though more fragrant.  It will certainly cost more since I normally get hand lotion in mongo sized pump dispensers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use the Sensitive+ most frequently with the Hydrate+ on sunny days.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove&#x27;s Face lotion for 3 weeks now and I really like this product.  It is mildly fragranced with a silky feel to it.  I have used it by itself and in conjunction with other Dove products like their face wash.  And to get the best results it should be used with the Dove face wash.  I like to use it as an after shave lotion.  It leaves my skin very soft and smooth, which lasts for at least 8 hours.  When used by itself the effect is not quite as good, but still more than acceptable.  I have to say that Dove is making a very competitive line of men&#x27;s care products that are worth trying.</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate Face Lotion is better than I expected.  The lotions absorbs very quickly and does not leave feeling sticky or oily. I also like the scent which is fairly light not to overpowering.  The dispenser is a little gimmicky but it works so far.  The sun screen is a nice bonus (this appears to be in the Hydrate version only).</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Hydrate  Face Lotion is a moisturizer / face lotion especially designed for men with sensitive or dry skin. Like a lot of Dove face lotions it is gentle on your skin and also includes SPF 15 protects skin from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt; It leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling silky smooth before and after he&#x27;s shaved and I absolutely love it. He also uses it instead of sunscreen when we go out on sunny days for general protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well with sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or dryness. I would recommend trying the face lotion in combination with a dove face wash that also hydrates and moisturizes your skin for added all day/night results.</li>
            <li> I never really felt the need, or even the desire to put lotion on my face, but I thought I would give this product a test run. It moisturizes nicely, but that&#x27;s because I have lotion on my face. If choosing any of these again, I would stick with Hydrate, as it is the only one that has SPF 15 sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product for those whose skin tends to be dry. I feel the lotion residue on my face still an hour or two later, so for me, I seem to be just putting lotion on my face for no reason.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new lotions for my face and neck (I had 35 days of radiation to my left side from my cheek bone to just under my clavicle) trying to find something that is really going to moisturize my skin, protect me from the sun (I no longer had any natural protection on the left side), and not irritate my skin or feel oilly. So when I saw the Dove Revitalize I snagged it, but then saw the Dove Hydrate and got that, too. You have to understand, my skin on the left side is soft, but will always need to be moisturized and protected from the sun, so I need something I can use every day, hopefully for what will be a very long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Hydrate works as advertised. It does not go on greasy, and feels rich and thick when being applied. Fragrance is sometimes a problem for me, but not this time. I had no irritations on my skin at all. It really feels nice against my skin and feels like it is doing a good job. Since I need year-round protection, I don&#x27;t want something that is going to make me breakout and Hydrate seems like a great solution. While it may be a little more expensive than some of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; lotions, I think it is worth it....and, it is much cheaper than a lot of the specialty lotions, like Arbonne, etc. I do wish it came with a stronger SPF, especially for after the winter, when I will be outside much more....maybe I can find this in a travel size and keep it with me in  my car or in my personal travelling storage compartment (aka my wifes purse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance of still smelling like a man, I don&#x27;t really get that. I never really smelled any poduct that was marketed for men that smelled overly feminine, and my wife has never told me I smell like her, nor have my friends ever told me I smell like their wife/girlfriend. Also, after wearing this, nobody has mentioned that I now smell more like a man....but I guess it&#x27;s nice to know that Dove is concerned that people might pass by me and say, \\&quot;What an ugly woman,\\&quot; but thanks totheir fragrance, I guess that shouldn&#x27;t happen. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to being serious. I should also note that during my radiation, my radiation oncologist said to use fragrance free Dove soap, which I used. My skin burned VERY severely, they told me they never saw anyone burn as much as I had. I do not attribute this to the soap, I just mention it, because I never got any kind of skin infection (of course I also ended up having to use some heavy duty burn cream which was pretty amazing). I mention this to give you an idea of the quality of my skin, and the severity of the burn.....if Hydrate feels good on me, it should be great for you! :)</li>
            <li> Dove makes both a Hydrate and Sensitive + in this line of products. I can&#x27;t do separate reviews for both so I am combining them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensitive + has no smell. It seems to really be geared toward sensitive skin. It feels great and is quickly absorbed. It lasts for a while and is great to use after shaving and when I have been out in the sun for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a scent is really nice because I am not a fan of strong scents and I do react to some colognes. This seems like it would be great for people who have sensitivities to perfumes.  I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using the Hydrate I am going out walking.  It feels nice on the skin, has a mild smell and has an SPF-15 sun protection. It is small enough to fit in my pocket or in the glove compartment of my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I used this I didn&#x27;t like using any type of sun protection when I went walking. I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sun screens and have found them to be a hassle to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is different. It feels nice on my skin, it does not have a smell that reminds me of being on a beach or at a pool and it is small enough that I can carry it in my pocket and not really notice it. It is easily absorbed in my skin and I don&#x27;t notice a greasy residue that I have found in some sun screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has gotten me to use sun protection when I am walking so this is a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both products. One I use when I am out walking and in the sun and the other after shaving and when I am home and want my face to feel nice.</li>
            <li> This product seems pretty good. I mean, it&#x27;s face wash, so there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it. It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine. Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturizer and my wife loves the smell. It can take a little bit to squeeze some out but when it does it works very very well as little as a little thick to make sure to take on a small amounts the leather on your face.</li>
            <li> While there are facial products (like Kiehl&#x27;s) that are gender-neutral, and facial care specifically for men (like Axe), Dove has targeted the mid-range male demographic.&lt;br /&gt;This would be a wonderful product, but the word &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient, needs clarification. The scent is pleasant, and not overpowering, but if you have a sensitivity to certain chemicals, knowing what &#x27;fragrance&#x27; consists of can be important.</li>
            <li> Face lotion needs to be light and not greasy, but still do the job of hydrating your skin. Face lotion for a guy needs to not smell like face lotion. This product succeeds on both counts, which makes it a success. A small amount covers the whole face and leaves it feeling nice, but doesn&#x27;t have enough odor to linger. This lotion also provides a small amount of protection from the sun, which is a great added bonus. If it holds up long term and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, it&#x27;ll be a triumph!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile.  It works well as a face moisturizer, a sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just bought 3 of these and I found it works very well. My face is very dry and esp. suffers the pain in the cold winter. After I applied this Dove Lotion everyday, one week later, I feel my face not dry anymore and the pain is gone. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will. Been looking for a new face lotion and I found a gem. Smells great!  Do not question it, buy it!</li>
            <li> way to strong a smell for use in public. that&#x27;s a shame because its easy to apply. just liquid enough to spread easily.</li>
            <li> This product works great and is perfect for hydrating skin! This is a definite must have if you live in a semiarid/arid climate or just have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did a great job of shipping the product and made sure that it arrived well within the promised time-frame.</li>
            <li> This is not for the sensitive-skin customer.  You are warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but not to the point where I break out with clusters of pimples.  I do break out occasionally, sometimes more often than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Dove Men+Care hydrate face lotion is very oily.  You really do not want that much oil on your face.  If you do choose to buy it, use very little of it and spread it across your face evenly.  One pump should be more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even then, this caused some break outs.  Like I said, it is not for the sensitive-skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the amount and only 1.69 ounce, you are not getting a good value deal.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin, especially in the winter, but like many men isn&#x27;t so great about actually doing anything about it. He liked this dove lotion and said it felt \\&quot;not greasy\\&quot; on his skin, which he hates. The smell was a little strong for him, but only because he prefers completely unscented. (I found it very light.) This is a fairly rich lotion, and probably best for dry skin. It does suffer the same problem as many with built-in SPF--slight stinging on freshly shaved skin, takes more effort to rub in completely--but the solar protection is a worthwhile trade off to my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to caution him to use small amounts, as in his first attempt he glopped on a quarter (or larger) size dollop and didn&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t all immediately rub in. I guess men don&#x27;t really get the difference between face lotion and body lotion?</li>
            <li> Jim is funny about his face. He doesn&#x27;t like to be greasy, and I have actually caught him using a scrubby for nonstick dishes on his face. I ordered the Dove face lotion for us both to try. I need more moisturizer but he loves it. He like the way it soaks in, has a light pleasant scent, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I like the SPF of 15 because we both are outside a lot and he doesn&#x27;t remember to put sunscreen on. Men are becoming more concerned about their faces, even though women have gotten old and wrinkly while men traditionally have been described as ruggedly handsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for it&#x27;s non greasy moisturizing with added SPF</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It goes on easily and provides moisture for the dry skin on my face and provides SPF15 protection from the sun. It doesn&#x27;t have a gross smell either, and doesn&#x27;t harm the skin. I look forward to wearing this all summer, and giving my skin the protection it deserves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use lotion. When I use SPF, it&#x27;s usually super water resistant, for fishing/surfing. But for a ski trip, or lawn work, or a daytime jog/sports, this is good stuff. Affordable, SPF 15 is powerful enough for hours in the sun (for me), and helps keep your face from getting dry/peely.</li>
            <li> Will throw away, waste of money, no more Dove products.  After watching an ad, thought this might be good for me, but empty, no.</li>
            <li> I got this Hydrating Face Lotion for my husband, who gets dry skin during winter months.  After using it for a week with the facial wash he says \\&quot;It Works.\\&quot;  Well, that isn&#x27;t very helpful, so I gave it a try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that this is a nice light lotion with undertones of the classic Dove scent, only slightly more manly.  The lotion is absorbed into my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used together with the Dove Hydrating Facial Wash, it works quite well, leaving skin feeling hydrated buy not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides a very light SPF for protection against the sun.</li>
            <li> This facial lotion has a silky feel that absorbs relatively quickly, for being a sunscreen. You really don&#x27;t walk away feeling you have goop on your face. It just makes your skin feel soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF is 15, so don&#x27;t expect the sun protection to last all day: in outdoorsy conditions or for after sweaty workouts, it will need to be reapplied. For really active people, this should be treated more like a bit of bonus sunscreen in a moisturizer, rather than a full-on sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like this for is my neck and chest area, personally. I have a very expensive morning moisturizer with antioxidants and sunscreen that I use on my face. I do like t protect and hydrate my neck and chest, but can&#x27;t afford to slather my pricey stuff there. This lotion fulfills the need for SPF moisturizer for me at a far better price point. I feel like I don&#x27;t have t be miserly with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a clean, somewhat unisex scent that fades away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a nice, basic product that is non-offensive for people who don&#x27;t like to feel residue on their faces. I&#x27;m very pleased there aren&#x27;t irritants (besides fragrance) in it. Don&#x27;t expect it to be chock full of vitamins or antioxidants; this isn&#x27;t that kind of product. The glycerin and dimethicone are the main moisturizing ingredients, and that is fine for what this is.</li>
            <li> I have been real impressed with the entire Men&#x27;s line of products from Dove. This moisturizer is no exception. Rich and creamy, yet absorbs fast. Unscented which I like. It also has sunscreen properties. You really cannot go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I think my title says it all \\&quot;Not greasy, smells nice, no complexion issues\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I can also say that I like the way it dispenses the lotion (just press down on the top lightly).</li>
            <li> I can see the Unilever marketing machine at work, with so many positive reviews of this series of moisturizers.  I tried all 3 because they are cheap compared to the products I buy from department store, i.e., Lab Series.  You do get what you pay for and these products are crap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These moisturizers are so basic, they are no known advanced ingredients to provide any anti-aging or skin-repairing benefits.  They also don&#x27;t provide sufficient moisture for combination skin.  And why does Dove add fragrance to a product for sensitive skin when it is scientifically established fragrance is a top skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to spend more, department stores offer far better and far more advanced products like Lab Series.  If your budget restrict you to drugstore products, then there still better choices such as Neutrogena for Men, or just Olay products (though not grey color containers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line of Dove products are so underwhelming, it&#x27;s embarrassing by today&#x27;s standard.</li>
            <li> In reply to the person slandering this product here is my reply:&lt;br /&gt;A) This product NOWHERE claims to do a million miracles to the skin, it&#x27;s for hydration and that&#x27;s that.  Dove products try to keep them simple at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;B) Of course if you spend hundreds of dollars on expensive face products, this will be in no comparison to them obviously, welcome to drugstores.  At least if you try this and do not like it, you will not end up spending half a paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;C) I have combination skin and this is the best moisturizer that has ever happened to me.  Remember that everybodies skin reacts to products differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this is the best moisturizer, but I have acne-prone combination skin and this has been one of the best and cheapest moisturizers I have used.  It does not break me out or make my face greasy.  If you do not mind a little guyish scent and want a product that does what it claims, then this is for you.  And if it does not work, your bank is not broken in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot:)</li>
            <li> This stuff is super creamy when it comes out put the minute you spread it on your face it becomes glue..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of it, but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is a light face lotion, you can hardly tell its there. However i would not recommend this for extremly dry skin types like myself. I find myself applying loction as well just to keep my face half hydrated. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The bottle of this looks almost exactly the same as Clarins Men Moisture Balm. The texture and feel of the lotion also feels very similar to Clarins. The difference is the scent of the Dove is way too strong. Almost nauseating. Would not recommend. It does an excellent job of moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> Its about time. Now if there were larger options...</li>
            <li> Been using this for year.  Amazon has the best price, that I know of, for this lotion.  Great for staying moisturized after shaving and especially in the harsh winter months.  Highly recommend, as I have poor oily skin and have trouble finding a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So good.  My face loves it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is somewhat small for the price, but it&#x27;s advertised like that, so just a head up there. However it hydrates well (especially when you combine this with Dove Men+Care Face Wash) and the lotion doesn&#x27;t result in a greasy feeling face. Although the lotion doesn&#x27;t &#x27;dry&#x27; up immediately, it does feel dry within a few minutes. Just one full squeeze of the bottle and that should be enough to use. I haven&#x27;t been using it on a daily basis since my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it is in the winter, so by then I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. With the results so far, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the price to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now and I really appreciate the combination of SPF protection and the soothing lotion. I&#x27;ve also used Healthy Skin from Neutrogena, but the scent was so awful compared to the Dove Men Care Hydrate Lotion. The Dove Face Lotion also seems to be less oily and has a nice scent. It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s face lotion so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells bad.  I think it stinks. My wife thinks it stinks. To get a second opinion I ask several other men and women and they all agree it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why have it smell at all? If I wanted to smell like a cheap cologne, I would wear cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but a little goes a long way. One pump is way too much for my face and leaves it really greasy. I found that I can do sort of a &#x27;half-pump&#x27; and spread it thinly over my entire face without feeling to heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Put this on my face before I go running in the sun. Nice light scent. Love the dove men care items</li>
            <li> As a moisturizing lotion, this is just okay.  It hydrates but leaves my skin with a tight, sticky feeling.  The biggest problem for me, however, is the smell.  This lotion has a very strong scent reminiscent of Dove soap or women&#x27;s facial products, and the smell lasts ALL day until you wash it off.  Not wanting to waste it, I tried using it on my arms instead of my face, but even so, the smell was overpowering so its simply unusable in my book.</li>
            <li> I get sebhorreic dermatitis on my face and this makes it worse than when using more benign lotions like CeraVae.</li>
            <li> So, I never used to use any type of lotion on my face. Every night before bed I shave and wash my face with a facial cleanser. Sometimes this routine would leave my face very dry and make my face break out. I decided to give this a shot and started patting it on my face every morning. I almost immediately saw improvement in my complexion. I swear by this product and will continue using it in the future, especially during the cold winter. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or wants to add some moisture to their face to help prevent acne products from drying their skin out as severely. Easily five stars for how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> As advertised, my face drinks this stuff up immediately. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin and take forever to rub in like a lot of lotions. Definitely felt like my skin was hydrated after using, though my skin was also oddly shiny for a half hour or so. Might be because my skin was dry from Acne wipes. Very satisfied though, and I recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I give this maximum rating as it&#x27;s very cheap and does the job well. Keeps my skin from being dry and I like it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because the winter cold really dries out his skin. Long story short, he liked it! Normally, he&#x27;s not a lotion man, so to speak, but this one he liked because it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some others I&#x27;ve bought, and it didn&#x27;t cause him to break out like some I tried. It&#x27;s not a heavy lotion which is really good for men ( and women lol). Overall, I would buy this again for my husband.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion in a nice little container. I&#x27;m a huge fan of all Dove for Men products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have stated, this is a decent to good product... it soaks in nicely, has a fresh but not overpowering scent, and seems to have staying power.  However, at this price point, I prefer [[ASIN:B003USG91S Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce]] which has double the SPF and to me has a nicer fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer without SPF, I think the Aveeno moisturizer is still the hands down best.  It has a gentle \\&quot;oatmeal\\&quot; smell that fades away almost immediately and it feels great as it quenches your skin.  [[ASIN:B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it comes down to personal preference... all three products do a nice job.  You might want to buy some small sample sizes at your local pharmacy and see which you prefer.  For me, it&#x27;s Neutrogena when I need sunscreen, Aveeno when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great after a shave, it is wonderful to wear evening, nights, daytime, I buy it again for Christmas presents my son in-law  love it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance from the lotion irritates my eyes, making it uncomfortable for about an hour after use.  Wish it was fragrance free, I don&#x27;t think men want smelly lotions on their face in the first place.  Other than that the smell isn&#x27;t bad, just unecessary, and really helps with dry skin when used daily.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the Nivea Men Sensitive Gel Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out crew face lotion but this one is even better. The case is a big plus. Good for travel and home. I originally thought $7 (in store price) was ridiculous for such a small amount, but a little goes a long way and I am using the same bottle months later. I recommend this brand only if you are not using any &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; face wash. Acne wash or anything that REALLY dries out your face may not be satisfied with this. For anything lighter like the dove face wash, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, feels great, protects great.  I will buy this again.  Do yourself a favor and take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> This Dove product was used by the men in our home, namely my brother and father.  Both of them gave me pretty similar reviews on this and the other Dove Men product we tried, and while both though it was &#x27;fine&#x27;, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve found their lifelong face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they didn&#x27;t dislike this.  On the contrary, they plan on using it till it runs out.  Positives included the light smell and the pump on the container, which is one of the better pumps they&#x27;ve both used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, both agreed that SPF 15 is nothing, especially if you&#x27;re fair skinned.  Something with a higher SPF would have been nice.  Also, while this didn&#x27;t feel like a mask, they mentioned that it felt like wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they may not have become lifelong friends with this Dove Men product, they didn&#x27;t dislike it.  It had positives and will surely please some men who don&#x27;t care so much about the lack of a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer because it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clot, feeling good on my skin. It also works well against coming into contact with the sun and that&#x27;s pretty nice to find here as well. I&#x27;m not big into wearing sunscreen unless I have to but like getting out and hiking and fishing, and I hate something that feels heavy. This is good for that and, with the coming summer, its a nice pickup.</li>
            <li> A lot of cosmetics and toiletries companies have started to expand their markets by telling men they need products that have long been the realm of women only. But after reading a fairly gruesome article about facial skin cancer in a men&#x27;s magazine, I started to take some of the hype seriously and began using face care products regularly. I&#x27;ve had some good success with [[ASIN:B00A0J0A8I Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce]], but since I don&#x27;t shave every day, I felt I could do with a non-shave day face product like this one. After several weekends of use, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small dab of this product to cover one&#x27;s whole face. That might suggest that it is excessively oily and needs to be spread around to get it all absorbed, but that&#x27;s really not the case. It stays slick just long enough to be spread and then quickly seeps into the skin. It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft, and was even comfortable on my usually over-oily nose. I didn&#x27;t notice it running off when I sweat, but I did notice that it washed away fairly easily if I happened to get something on my face that needed washing off. (A quick reapplication solved this problem.) I haven&#x27;t had enough sun exposure to tell if the SPF ingredient is working as it should, but it seems like my face has been protected somewhat in that it hasn&#x27;t tanned as much as my arms have while I&#x27;ve been out in the yard working. In short, I&#x27;m very comfortable using this product and I feel that it is probably doing my skin some good, so I plan to continue using it in the future. (I especially look forward to using this in the winter, when proper moisturizing is more valuable and critical.)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but I can&#x27;t get it ANYWHERE near my eyes at all whatsoever, or it burns like hell and my eyes won&#x27;t stop watering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of unusual, given the fact that pretty much all face lotions on the market can at least be rubbed in near the eyes.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: for twenty years now, I&#x27;ve watched the women in my life put on a daily moisturizer/sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve always believed that it would fight wrinkles and aging over time, but never thought about using one myself.  Even though adding one more grooming chore seems like at least one more too much (\\&quot;You want me to floss AND moisturize?  Who am I, Brad Pitt?\\&quot;), this is a solid product, and I&#x27;ll try to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is sleek and very small, and after shaving and washing your face, you pump out a small amount and rub it in.  (Or else you get the hose).  The fragrance is pretty light, and absorbs quickly, leaving skin feeling richer and smoother.  I&#x27;ve been using it half my face for a week, and I can definitely tell a difference - the moisturized side feels smoother and has less friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the sunscreen is definitely a good idea - a lifetime of using an SPF 15 product on your face and neck should produce a prettier face at 50 than a lifetime of not.  This is a good product that feels pleasant and does what it says it will  Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men + Care Hydrate face lotion comes in a 50ml (1.69fl oz) container that looks like a smaller version of a travel size shaving cream container. There&#x27;s a tiny little thing to remove before you can get the lotion to come out. The lotion in the bottle has a very mild smell, it smells like a lotion smell for lack of a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is very economical, you can squeeze out an amount smaller than half the size of a raindrop if you press very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on your face, you see a white layer but it gets quickly absorbed into the skin. You put it on and you then forget that you even put it on - in other words, no side effects like greasy face later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the container, in smaller font, states that it has broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the container shows the recycling symbol with the number seven (07).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Revitalize. Compared to the Hydrate, the Revitalize is more clear, not as creamy as the Hydrate. It goes on the face clean, while the Hydrate goes on white but gets absorbed in a couple of seconds. I used each on each side of my face, that&#x27;s why I noticed these differences. The benefits of Hydrate are easier to spot than Revitalize, at least for me on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Sensitive. The texture and the way it disappears on your skin is similar to the Revitalize. On a regular day, putting them on on each side of my face, I couldn&#x27;t tell them apart. But after a shave, I could feel the Sensitive soothing a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a fragrance counter sense of smell, but I think the Revitalize has a strong smell than the Hydrate and Sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, I would rate the Hydrate and Sensitive ahead of the Revitalize.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week now as a bzz agent and I must say it is a really nice moisturiser with a really nice smell which lasts for hours ,it makes your skin nice and smooth and really does seem to energise your face I highly recommend this to anyone love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This really feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion at a discounted price! I love it! 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin more than it was originally.  Smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 star review because I have only used it once. I will update the star rating and the details later when I have a more accurate opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this, this early, because while Amazon is typically cheaper than local places, this product can be picked up for $5.50 at Target. You can probably find it similarly priced at other local businesses.</li>
            <li> Leaving in Florida I like something on my face with a bit of SPF in it. I like that this lotion is just for your face. The scent is nice no need for an after shave, will be too much scent.I have to say it did not dry out my face like most lotions do. It does not giving a burning sensation as well.  My face did feel refresh and feel very smooth. Very light not heavy or greasy as well. Great product just for men.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s face tends to get dry, especially in the winter months.  He&#x27;s borrowed my face cream in desperation a time or two, but didn&#x27;t care for the girly scent.  This lotion is perfect - it provides good moisturization without feeling greasy, and has a nice manly scent.  The scent dissipates fairly quickly.  After using it for a week on hands and face, his skin looks healthy and recovered nicely from the winter weather. I also like that SPF 15 is included.  15 isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;s better than nothing in my book, especially since my husband doesn&#x27;t use sunscreen on a daily basis when outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice hydrating lotion with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and it works quite well without being greasy.  My husband loves it because of these two things.  The pump is nice and does not dispense too much of the product, easy to control quantity.  Dove has changed their look and I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try Dove Men+ Care as I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and recieved some free from them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used Moisturiser before so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I started using Dove Men+Care Hydrate+ Moisturiser. I&#x27;ve used Skin Creams and After Shave Balms in the past but I&#x27;ve always found them to be slightly Oily / Greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised with Dove Men+Care Hydrate+ Moisturiser as it was very easy to apply, It doesn&#x27;t feel Oily or Greasy at all and has a nice smell but nothing too over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly it leaves my skin feeling great. A lot smoother than usual and also when it comes to Shaving, I&#x27;ve found my skin isn&#x27;t as bad after I&#x27;ve shaved. I would highly recommend Dove Men+Care Hydrate+ Moisturiser to anyone that&#x27;s never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to BzzAgent for letting me try this great product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]]</li>
            <li> This is a good, a very good, protective type lotion, a sunscreen if you will.  It feels refreshing on your face and provides a light but quite masculine scent.  It&#x27;s not, as pointed out by others, an aftershave, but instead it&#x27;s a product very specifically designed to protect your skin.  Highly recommended as a self-care product.</li>
            <li> This is such a small amount of product it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get very dry skin. This causes scaly patches around my nose and eyebrows.  Dove has been pleasantly surprising me with their products for men.  I am a big fan of the smell and quality.  Like alot of people have been saying, it does not leave your face feeling greasy.  It makes my face feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Big fan of the dove for men products</li>
            <li> Nice product. Clean and works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have bad dry skin, especially due to the dry winters up here in the northeast. I love this product, it keeps my face moisturized with out leaving a greasy feeling. Also has a slight manly fragrance. Awesome face lotion especially post shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to be disappointed in this product. With all the rave reviews, I had high hopes for the lotion. I was able to pick it up with a sizable discount when it went on promotion from my local store, and was eager to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now I have been using Clearasil cream, and lotion. The stuff is pretty thick so I usually put a dab with some water and rub it in my hands before spreading it onto my face. It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used the aftershave with GREAT results, so I thought I&#x27;d give the facial lotion a shot by Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells good and comes in a nice, compact case. The lid does NOT prevent the lotion in the nozzle from drying out however. The lotion smells lightly (in a good way), and best of all does NOT irritate my face. (My face is VERY VERY VERY sensitive to chemicals.) It&#x27;s white, very thin and easy to apply. No watering down necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the negativity begins. My face does NOT get hydrated by this lotion. Within 5-6 minutes, my face begins to dry out, and feels stretched. I tried to reapply again more generously, but again my face dried out once more. Tried freshening up with water, but it didn&#x27;t do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last three weeks but things have not improved. Yes, my skin feels light, however the stretchiness I feel does not change until I go back to Clearasil, and I&#x27;m going back for good.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my face and much cheaper than the Jack Black I was using before. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never see a product like this.  I also would resommen this product for men needing to hydrate their skin.</li>
