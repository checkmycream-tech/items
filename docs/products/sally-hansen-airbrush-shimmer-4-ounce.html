            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and plan on trying this over the airbrush legs by Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>This product is a great idea, but perhaps they need to work on their formula more.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and evenly and never streaks or looks ORGANGE!</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>Still 3 Stars; it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>I applied more than I needed to to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>It saves our skins from the harmful rays of the sun but still lets us have that healthy tan that we all crave.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really shiny:) I love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and blend in the cream form.</li>
            <li>I made a HUGE mistake buying it</li>
            <li>Almost like both bottles were just filled with air.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Airbrush for legs and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I first applied the spray as the instructions says which was to spray it on your hands and rub it in</li>
            <li>First of all, I received this product super-fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price makes it very affordable and I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li>It looks good on tan or pale skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the product because of the shimmer effect but it wasnt really what I would have expected.</li>
            <li>Save your money, it adds a bit of sheen, but doesn&#x27;t really do much else.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels like hairspray, which I guess I could live with if I had some shimmer--but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I am african american and bought sally hansen airbrush legs shimmer because of a previous review from another african american girl who loved the apperance of the spray.</li>
            <li>I used as directed and barely noticed a shimmer.  </li>

            <li> I am african american and bought sally hansen airbrush legs shimmer because of a previous review from another african american girl who loved the apperance of the spray. I first applied the spray as the instructions says which was to spray it on your hands and rub it in so when i sprayed it on my hands the spray was really cold and seem to stick to my hand and when I glided the spray on my legs I hardly seen a difference I could see the shimmer but did not see the airbrush effect like the models legs on the can. I liked the product because of the shimmer effect but it wasnt really what I would have expected. If someone is looking for an airbrush effect this probably wouldnt be something you should get (for african americans)but if you like goldent tint of shimmer this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It didn&#x27;t look like anything had been applied to my legs after spraying it on. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this. Smells and feels like hairspray, which I guess I could live with if I had some shimmer--but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> what I expected to be</li>
            <li> First of all, I received this product super-fast.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that was very subtle and natural looking.......and found just that.  Perfect glow and even tried it on my arms.  Long-lasting, non-transferring formula is perfect.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and plan on trying this over the airbrush legs by Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> I did not get no glow/shimmer on my legs. I followed directions to spray on hands and then apply. Not sure what I did wrong but got it all on my hands nothing on my legs. Disappointed with the product since I was going to my son&#x27;s out door wedding and didn&#x27;t want to wear any stockings. My skin is medium tan with olive. I must say its stays on until removed with soap, that&#x27;s how I got it off my hands.</li>
            <li> This product did not made any difference and does not cover or so ! I did not liked it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Slight sheen but wears off. Tried to use in a fashion show for the models and nothing happened on any of the models. Almost like both bottles were just filled with air.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The previous comment was for an old seller of this product, NOT \\&quot;Little Rileys\\&quot;.  Please see my approval rating.  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Used the SH leg makeup in the cream form. The stuff is AMAZING! Easy to apply and blend in the cream form. I was afraid of rub off if I used lotion on top to give sheen so I bought this spray which seals it in it seems! I actually have left it on for up to 2 days and slept in it with no transfer. Legs look awesome without nylons! Love this....</li>
            <li> I dunno the color made me look like an alien i picked up a wrong color it seems but the good thing is that it doesnt fade but i have to go for a different color</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Airbrush for legs and it worked great! This one is the &amp;#34;Shimmer Edition&amp;#34;….it did nothing for me. I used it over the weekend and it ended in the trash today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sticky and provides no color at all. Not much glitter/shimmer either. Kind of disappointing. Still 3 Stars; it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> I was convinced to purchase Sally Hansen Airbrush I was said it will hide the small venues and make the skin even. In fact this did not happen, I did not see any differences \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot;, the spray makes impression of dryness of the skin. Maybe it helps to someone, not to me.&lt;br /&gt;Sophia</li>
            <li> Save your money, it adds a bit of sheen, but doesn&#x27;t really do much else. Too pricey for what you get...</li>

            <li> It makes my skin really shiny:) I love it! It looks good on tan or pale skin. I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Thie spray is awesome.  It goes on easily and evenly and never streaks or looks ORGANGE! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, since a trip to Maui. The price makes it very affordable and I hope they never stop making it! It saves our skins from the harmful rays of the sun but still lets us have that healthy tan that we all crave.</li>
            <li> This product was just a big smeary mess. I made a HUGE mistake buying it and I&#x27;ll NEVER throw my money away on something like this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but it became hard to find where I live.  It&#x27;s a great product. especially in the spring and summer.</li>
