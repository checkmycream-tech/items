            <li>cause I was extremely excited for these.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited when it came in the mail.</li>
            <li>it looks lovely , my husbands hair is much darker and though it didn&#x27;t come out as well, it was still noticeable, so i recommend these for children and adults</li>
            <li>My deluxe set of feather extensions arrived like 3 days early.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try to do it myself because it seemed pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They did ship and arrive quickly though.</li>
            <li>They blend easily, stay where they are put, and are MUCH easier to control.</li>
            <li>I love how natural they are.  </li>
            <li>i ordered the deluxe back and this feather extension came in the pack.  </li>
            <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>niece loves these, easy to put on hair, wash out easily, and deliverred timely....great gift for teen</li>
            <li>I wish that the product came with more of the crimping beads because 3 in one color weren&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li>Then, it washes out on the first wash.</li>
            <li>I picked the nicest ones they had and paid $25 for three (way too much in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>But never the less I love the feathers</li>
            <li>Well, they do have some sparkle, but it turns out that that is ok, it is easier to see them with the slight sparkle</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and all the sticks were whole, i expected chalk sticks to have some breakage.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I thought the beads and feathers comes with the looper so I can use it right away.</li>
            <li>The chalks, especially the kind that come in little pots, drop excess everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have used hair color chalk in the past and honestly as great as it was, it was so messy ! .&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These from LAC Beauty isn&#x27;t like that, it&#x27;s not messy at all</li>
            <li>I even thought it might be soft like pastels I used for art.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally waivy</li>
            <li>It was nice to have the seller behind you all the way.     </li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s not five stars is because some of the colors seem to be exactly the same, just with a sparkle option on one.</li>
            <li>High quality feathers that I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Most of the feathers were very delicate and short.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they would have sent more crimp beads with them cuz the feathers are too thick for just one, and I have dark hair</li>
            <li>One of the children has light hair, so I expected the chalk to at least show up on her hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is medium to long</li>
            <li> It starts to dry and a brush wont go through it.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel extremely dry.</li>
            <li> so I need to bow dry and straighten my hair and with the chalk in my hair</li>
            <li> The only reason this is not a five star review is because it doesn&#x27;t work as well for dark haired users.</li>
            <li> My Feathers came in 3 days, way before I expected them.</li>
            <li> (At least the three different brands I&#x27;ve sampled do.)</li>
            <li> The colors show up well on my daughters&#x27; dark blond hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as colorful as advertised, and all of the feathers come taped down to the cardboard and unattached to one another.</li>
            <li> The color of the feathers were all a dull brown, nothing like the picture and were all about 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> When applied your hair becomes stiff and slightly matted or glued together and brushes with difficulty.  </li>
            <li> it is a dull pink  after four shampoos, swim lessons and a week.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so it looked pretty stupid, but I decided to try it out anyway.</li>
            <li> have one son with dirty blond hair and one with brown hair and the colors are much easier to see on the blond.  </li>
            <li> but you are really only getting one that is as thin as floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> extremely skinny longer one!!!</li>
            <li> but she is blond so not sure what the results on darker hair would be.  </li>
            <li> Once its applied to wet hair, your are unable to style it.</li>
            <li> I ordered other feathers from others sellers previously that ended up being short and horrible quality</li>
            <li> be carefull people with dark hair some hair chalk does not show up in your hair sad to say.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a young relatives for Christmas, and I am extremely disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I applied different colors into my hair and was extremely disappointed in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> Sprays are impossible to aim and use on small sections.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the feathers..</li>
            <li> The feathers had the smell of moth balls, and had to finally take them out because of the horrific smell.</li>
            <li> i was unable to do that.</li>
            <li> The chalk is very difficult to get to show up at all, and once it does, it makes hair stiff and impossible to style.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Too bad the feathers suck</li>
            <li> After a day of wearing the feathers I noticed a really bad smell.</li>
            <li> Worthless product.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!!!</li>

            <li> I have used hair color chalk in the past and honestly as great as it was, it was so messy ! .&lt;br /&gt;These from LAC Beauty isn&#x27;t like that, it&#x27;s not messy at all and it&#x27;s beautiful .&lt;br /&gt;Each color is beautiful and has so much pigmentation in it , it&#x27;s fun and easy to use and seals fairly quick ^-^&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that i have had no issues at all with the colors coming off on my hands or pillows after the sealing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink and purple the best and on the lighter parts of my hair it looks lovely , my husbands hair is much darker and though it didn&#x27;t come out as well, it was still noticeable, so i recommend these for children and adults&lt;br /&gt;i have received these for free in exchange for my honest opinion ^_^</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair platinum specifically so I could wear streaks of color. This is the best product I have found. The chalks, especially the kind that come in little pots, drop excess everywhere. It gets on your clothes, on your face, and all over your hands. (At least the three different brands I&#x27;ve sampled do.) Sprays are impossible to aim and use on small sections. These are waxy and pliable. They blend easily, stay where they are put, and are MUCH easier to control. The only reason it&#x27;s not five stars is because some of the colors seem to be exactly the same, just with a sparkle option on one.</li>
            <li> All of my feathers are extremely short with one extremely skinny longer one!!! This add implies they are longer feathers but you are really only getting one that is as thin as floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did ship and arrive quickly though. Too bad the feathers suck cause I was extremely excited for these. The pictured ones are beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as colorful as advertised, and all of the feathers come taped down to the cardboard and unattached to one another. I had to glue them together to get them into one. And the beads that it came with sucked.</li>
            <li> I bought the brown set of feathers and they are stinkin cute!! They flatiron great and look really good with any style/color of hair. I would and do recommend these to EVERYONE! I just wish they would have sent more crimp beads with them cuz the feathers are too thick for just one, and I have dark hair so I couldn&#x27;t use the blonde bead.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt response when I contacted you about my post office misplacing the package. I finally received the package. The only thing is I thought the beads and feathers comes with the looper so I can use it right away. But never the less I love the feathers, I both my own looper and can&#x27;t wait to use it right away. Thank you again for all your help regarding my postmaster. It was nice to have the seller behind you all the way.     Aloha!</li>
            <li> I went to a salon to get feather extensions and they had a so-so selection.  I picked the nicest ones they had and paid $25 for three (way too much in my opinion).  I wanted to try to do it myself because it seemed pretty easy.  I bought these feathers-- they are BEAUTIFUL and come with a great amount of feathers.  I love how natural they are.  I wish that the product came with more of the crimping beads because 3 in one color weren&#x27;t enough (it came with 6 total 3 white/ 3 brown).  High quality feathers that I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Most of the feathers were very delicate and short.  I bought them based on good reviews.  I&#x27;d pass on these.  My hair is medium to long so I am looking for feathers that are longer than 7 inches.  I&#x27;d rate these a 2 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I got the feathers in about four days, so promptness wasn&#x27;t an issues. The issue was with the feathers. The color of the feathers were all a dull brown, nothing like the picture and were all about 4 inches long. I have long hair, so it looked pretty stupid, but I decided to try it out anyway. After a day of wearing the feathers I noticed a really bad smell. The feathers had the smell of moth balls, and had to finally take them out because of the horrific smell. I wore the feathers for one day and I had to take them out. What a waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one i must say its the best. i ordered the deluxe back and this feather extension came in the pack.  I&#x27;m in love. its very very full!!! VERY noticeable!!!! its more sophisticated b/c of the colors.  i will be purchasing more because my mom loved it on me.  if you have to pick one go with this look.  The company offers variety, but if you are looking for full and natural, the color are perfect!!!  If you have any questions feel free to contact they are very helpful and nice.  My deluxe set of feather extensions arrived like 3 days early.</li>
            <li> My Feathers came in 3 days, way before I expected them. I ordered other feathers from others sellers previously that ended up being short and horrible quality so when I got these I was so so happy. They are high quality and gorgeous. Way worth the price for such great quality!!</li>
            <li> be carefull people with dark hair some hair chalk does not show up in your hair sad to say.</li>
            <li> The description said that the crimp beads and directions were included- I got the feathers and the wire tool. No beads and no directions. I was a little disappointed in the feathers..they&#x27;re really big and chunky, I was hoping for stringy-er ones..but I guess that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> colors were plenty bright but she is blond so not sure what the results on darker hair would be.  Arrived quickly and all the sticks were whole, i expected chalk sticks to have some breakage.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a young relatives for Christmas, and I am extremely disappointed in the results. One of the children has light hair, so I expected the chalk to at least show up on her hair. The chalk is very difficult to get to show up at all, and once it does, it makes hair stiff and impossible to style. Then, it washes out on the first wash. I would not recommended this product at all; sidewalk chalk would likely have the same result.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they did not seem to have any sparkle to them (I have boys) and they didn&#x27;t require flat ironing to set the color (I am much too lazy for that level of effort).  Well, they do have some sparkle, but it turns out that that is ok, it is easier to see them with the slight sparkle and my boys don&#x27;t mind.  When applied your hair becomes stiff and slightly matted or glued together and brushes with difficulty.  The color washes out easily in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one son with dirty blond hair and one with brown hair and the colors are much easier to see on the blond.  The only reason this is not a five star review is because it doesn&#x27;t work as well for dark haired users.</li>
            <li> Works best on lighter hair but still shows on dark hair. I especially love the vibrancy of the color. Nice!</li>
            <li> Worthless product. My daughter and I were so excited about getting these, as the pics showed these bright, glamorous colors - not the case at all. It&#x27;s nothing more than chalk that you use on the sidewalk. I even thought it might be soft like pastels I used for art. Just awfull! What a disappointment!!!!</li>
            <li> My kids love these.  The colors show up well on my daughters&#x27; dark blond hair.  The red hasn&#x27;t washed out yet.  it is a dull pink  after four shampoos, swim lessons and a week.</li>
            <li> niece loves these, easy to put on hair, wash out easily, and deliverred timely....great gift for teen and she loves all the colors</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and I love the colors! I did my hair just as instructed and it all worked great!</li>
            <li> I have seen this product on TV and in magazines so I was really excited when it came in the mail. I applied different colors into my hair and was extremely disappointed in the look and feel of my hair. Once its applied to wet hair, your are unable to style it. It starts to dry and a brush wont go through it. It makes your hair feel extremely dry. My hair is naturally waivy so I need to bow dry and straighten my hair and with the chalk in my hair i was unable to do that. Waste of money!!!!!</li>
