            <li>the smell just amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely warm, sensual, sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great for summer and hot days.  </li>
            <li>It turns out that the company claims that this perfume is no longer manufactured with the shell charm, which is a huge bummer to find out after the fact!</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>I love love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the fruity smell.</li>
            <li>This is an authentic bottle</li>
            <li>I liked it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks it smell amazing !</li>
            <li>He walked past me and said UMMM YOU SMELL GOOD! Lol</li>
            <li>Instead it smelled more like rancid sunscreen or a night of regretfully cheap tequila drinks.</li>
            <li>My wife really like this perfume, the price it is really good</li>
            <li>but it really is a nice pretty, girly scent.  </li>
            <li>but, jts a fabulous summer fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is light not to strong, It smells good to me and is my second bottle.</li>
            <li>It is beachy and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this from TJ Maxx on a whim since it was such a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh clean with some floral scents.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear this I always get compliments, but the best compliment I have yet to receive was from a little boy around 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Similar to Miami Glow, but it has its own thing.  </li>
            <li>Not over-powering at all, just enough of a fruity, sweet, exotic scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would smell like anything</li>
            <li>Very grown up.</li>
            <li>The item is working very well</li>
            <li>So, the stock photo is very misleading.</li>
            <li>but it does make for a much cuter bottle to display.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very close to JLO&#x27;s \\&quot;Miami</li>
            <li>Kind of embarrassing to get this as a gift, looking as plain as it did.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks unique, but looks so naked.</li>
            <li>After googling it for the high and low notes, I purchased it and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few different fragrances by Jennifer Lopez as replacements, and all the rest of them were good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not cheap or youthfully sweet.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good to the point that it drives me crazy for her.</li>

            <li> I ordered this for my Wife as an anniversary present and she loved it. Smells really good to the point that it drives me crazy for her.</li>
            <li> I like this cause it smells like summer and like the beach. It is light not to strong, It smells good to me and is my second bottle. I would like to get the body lotion to this.</li>
            <li> This is summer in a bottle!! It is beachy and clean. This is my summer go to perfume. I love this scent</li>
            <li> My wife loved the perfume but was dissapointed that the bottle did not have the charm that was in the photo.</li>
            <li> I love love this perfume. Every time I wear this I always get compliments, but the best compliment I have yet to receive was from a little boy around 7 years old. He walked past me and said UMMM YOU SMELL GOOD! Lol</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing!!! I wear it all year but, jts a fabulous summer fragrance.  It&#x27;s fresh clean with some floral scents. You wont regret buying this scent of glow!!! I ended buying a bigger one after this one too I liked it so much!!!</li>
            <li> Love the perfume. It smells great.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume without smelling it first. I was hoping that it would smell something like her regular, so-juicy-you-can-taste-it Glow perfume with a hint of summer tones - I mean, pineapple juice, hot sand... how can you go wrong? Instead it smelled more like rancid sunscreen or a night of regretfully cheap tequila drinks. I was really hoping this would smell like anything but what it smelled like. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it anyone. I plan on returning it and sticking with regular Glow. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this! In fact, I&#x27;m going to go take a shower asap and wash this stuff off of me. The smell&#x27;s making me a little nauseated...</li>
            <li> This perfume was Fake. I ordered a few different fragrances by Jennifer Lopez as replacements, and all the rest of them were good. But this one was a knock-off version. It didn&#x27;t have the charm that comes around the bottle, the smell was faint, and wore off within minutes. It had definitely been watered down... disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the fruity smell.</li>
            <li> Gross smelled terrible never will buy another jlo product because of it.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance! Especially for summmer! I bought this from TJ Maxx on a whim since it was such a good price. After googling it for the high and low notes, I purchased it and I am not disappointed. It&#x27;s a lovely warm, sensual, sexy fragrance.  It&#x27;s sweet but not cheap or youthfully sweet.  Very grown up. Great for summer and hot days.  Not sure if I would wear this when it&#x27;s cold but it really is a nice pretty, girly scent.  I do however wish it lasted longer without re-applying and I wish I could find the lotion to increase the scent&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li> Wife loves her products smell great</li>
            <li> Just got this today as a birthday gift. Oh my! This scent is sexy and sultry! Not over-powering at all, just enough of a fruity, sweet, exotic scent. I am in love!</li>
            <li> Missing the rope and sea shell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful, and the bottle is beautiful!! I rated this item 3 stars for two reasons: The shipping took forever: nearly 2 weeks, which angered me! The second reason is my bottle did NOT come with the shell charm! It turns out that the company claims that this perfume is no longer manufactured with the shell charm, which is a huge bummer to find out after the fact! The bottle looks unique, but looks so naked.</li>
            <li> The item is working very well, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is an authentic bottle but I am very disappointed that my perfume did NOT come with the shell charm as shown. So, the stock photo is very misleading. I wouldn&#x27;t wear the bracelet but it does make for a much cuter bottle to display. This perfume is very close to JLO&#x27;s \\&quot;Miami Glow\\&quot;  but with a touch of Lilly flower is detected. I would recommend this as a summer scent because it smells of a floral beach but look elsewhere if you want it to look like the stock photo. Kind of embarrassing to get this as a gift, looking as plain as it did.</li>
            <li> My wife really like this perfume, the price it is really good the smell just amazing She loves it&lt;br /&gt;Yessss</li>
            <li> Thanks it smell amazing !</li>
            <li> I adore this scent.  Similar to Miami Glow, but it has its own thing.  It&#x27;s my signature summer scent.</li>
            <li> My wife loved Sunkissed Glow. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
