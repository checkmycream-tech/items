            <li>Great results!!!  </li>
            <li>The eye gel makes my eyes feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love this line of skin care I&#x27;ve been using it for years !!!</li>
            <li>Perfect condition as described great seller  would buy again</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have it or if the product prevents it (LOL).  </li>
            <li>It great stuff</li>
            <li>use many of skinceuticals products, and are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Really good for maintaining a youthful appearance around eyes.</li>
            <li>However, this is one product I have continued to use and am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff works great</li>
            <li>I have purchased many times from CEO Marketing via Amazon and they are very reputable, sell quality products and prices great.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Love saving $ on their products!</li>
            <li>love this eye rx!</li>
            <li>Great eye gel - smooths out fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, probably better than some the eye treatments out there</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, in good, unopened and authentic condition.</li>
            <li>and I find it increasingly effective as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li>love skinceutical products.</li>
            <li>as many reviewers have pointed out.  </li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly and wears well!</li>
            <li>Totally love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I love this skin line but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li>The product does reduce puffiness under the eyes and smooths fine lines.  </li>
            <li>and it gives you smooth eyes all day.</li>
            <li>It is light on the skin and seems to tighten the skin around my eyes immediately.</li>
            <li>Not dramatically, of course, but noticeably and more rapidly than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and far more than doing nothing.</li>
            <li>This gel greatly diminished the fine lines and got rid of the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>it feels good using it, but the wrinkle repair properties i haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement.</li>
            <li>(previously it was in a dropper bottle) and find it very effective in reducing under eye circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser).</li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of frustration until I learned how to get just the right amount (a 1/2 pump) onto my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>serum not cream- goes right into skin ..</li>
            <li>My aesthetician suggested the Skinceuticals skin care line to me at my last appointment, she stated the product line was really good and a lot of clients that live in Vegas use</li>
            <li>I have to say mine were not very bad</li>
            <li>My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic</li>
            <li>and so I changed the routine to include them both with the AOX gel coming first.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying AOX eye gel.</li>
            <li>If I apply it in the morning when I first arise, it does reduce the drooping.</li>
            <li>For the money it did not do much.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>However, then i read they were really meant to be used together</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper than to buy it at the spa.</li>
            <li>No, it won&#x27;t make up for an evening of too much salt, wine, or insufficient sleep</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with Origins GinZing in the morning</li>
            <li>Think there are better products for undereye at less cost</li>
            <li>and it is looking overall better with the recent</li>
            <li>but wow this stuff really rids the eye area of wrinkles and sagging skin.  </li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>I do like the new design</li>
            <li>Repair for eyes, wear every am, then a Skin Ceuticals eye repair and their new eye sunblock.  </li>
            <li>This product not only seems to be helping but combined with other Skinceutical products seems to be making my skin more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked well for this 46 year old!</li>
            <li>I also love the price I pay for it with Amazon, much less than my local salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem since my teenage years and, in that time, have searched for the wondrous solution but nothing really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the eye gel product about five weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell much of a change, but I&#x27;ll stick with it, since the CE Ferrulic has made me a believer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For now, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My eyes were nearly swollen shut and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent under $10.00 on other products purchased in drugstores and had better results.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is helping with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
            <li>It took nearly a week and several doctors visits to clear up.  </li>
            <li>For about a week i used one on my right eye and the other on my left (to see which was better) - without any dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I find that this product is really helping with the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as infatuated with this products as I was when first used - I&#x27;ve been using about a year.</li>
            <li>And a little bit goes a long way, so it is actually economical.</li>

            <li> And a little bit goes a long way, so it is actually economical.</li>
            <li> I also with age have developed some cross hatching where my cheek bones are, due to smiling and squinting.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but I am wondering if it is normal for the eye gel to have a smoky, woodsy burnt smell.</li>
            <li> I have recently been using Philosophy instead due to the cost of the Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes and the gel is yellow/gold so it actually made them appear darker.  </li>
            <li> Better than some very expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I feel there is a definite difference in my eye area.  </li>
            <li> While this worked and made my skin look good for awhile, the long term effects have been terrible for me.  </li>
            <li> One small pump will be enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> then other online distributors</li>
            <li> May work on other people</li>
            <li> A plastic surgeon told me, basically, to just live with it because surgery would cause other, worse problems for my situation.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wakes up with puffy eyes for dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dark circles ordered this and within two weeks those I could see a visible difference.</li>
            <li> found the prices on Amazon were much less</li>
            <li> I use it with their AGE Eye Complex Cream where a little goes a long way with the Antioxident.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed little bumps under my skin that make me wonder if the product is clogging pores and congesting skin.  </li>
            <li> the skin underneath was raw and felt like sand paper.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in the past I ran out.</li>
            <li> In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening</li>
            <li> Worse, I used it about 5 times and happened to get a sty (the first one in my life) - and though&#x27;s probably just a bad coincidence</li>
            <li> so I went crazy and bought a bunch of different items to try out..</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for about a year, then developed a terrible allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> Using a very small amount each day, this serum performs as the packaging promises.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and dark, it smells bad, and it feels sticky.  </li>
            <li> I use this eye gel if I look tired and exhausted.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on tired puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been told it was because my under eye skin is thin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and saw no change in my tired eyes  </li>
            <li> (BTW, I have discovered that melatonin pills may make under eye sagging worse).</li>
            <li> I am almost to 40 and wanted to up my skin routine game.  </li>
            <li> I never had much puffiness, but my terrible terrible dark circles are definately a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> I am unable to have surgery at this time, so I have been searching for products that will help with this problem.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I had not replaced it sooner.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged guy who suffers from genetic drooping of skin under my eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love skinceutical products.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Skinceuticals and have used them for about five years.  I have recently been using Philosophy instead due to the cost of the Skinceuticals.  However, this is one product I have continued to use and am very pleased with.  I do like the new design (previously it was in a dropper bottle) and find it very effective in reducing under eye circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works great</li>
            <li> Really good for maintaining a youthful appearance around eyes. Has a campfire aroma but wow this stuff really rids the eye area of wrinkles and sagging skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It&#x27;s worked well for this 46 year old!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks.  People keep asking me if I changed my foundation or my eye makeup.  One small pump will be enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 3 weeks....it&#x27;s good, probably better than some the eye treatments out there however it&#x27;s not a miracle wonder for eliminating under eye puffiness.  I&#x27;ve had this problem since my teenage years and, in that time, have searched for the wondrous solution but nothing really does what it claims.  This one was as close as it gets.</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care I&#x27;ve been using it for years !!!..... I have no wrinkles and people always say I look so much younger than what I am !!!!</li>
            <li> Great eye gel - smooths out fine wrinkles.  Another great Skinceuticals product!  Use before eye cream and it gives you smooth eyes all day.</li>
            <li> For the money it did not do much. Think there are better products for undereye at less cost Think it does not stand up to the task</li>
            <li> My aesthetician suggested the Skinceuticals skin care line to me at my last appointment, she stated the product line was really good and a lot of clients that live in Vegas use them.&lt;br /&gt;Of coarse I came home from my appointment and went online to search for them, Amazon offered an array of products both for myself and my hubby.&lt;br /&gt;I found the prices on Amazon were much less then other online distributors so I went crazy and bought a bunch of different items to try out..&lt;br /&gt;Both my hubby and I are happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Using a very small amount each day, this serum performs as the packaging promises. I purchased it to reduce the puffiness under my eyes. It works. Almost nothing else has. I am unable to have surgery at this time, so I have been searching for products that will help with this problem. I used this product in the past I ran out. I am sorry I had not replaced it sooner. The puffiness was reduced within a week.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but I am wondering if it is normal for the eye gel to have a smoky, woodsy burnt smell. I applied one pump between both under eye areas, and I can still smell this odor15 minutes after applying- smells like I have been at a campfire. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;I use many of skinceuticals products, and are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser). In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the eye gel product about five weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell much of a change, but I&#x27;ll stick with it, since the CE Ferrulic has made me a believer. I&#x27;m losing weight and fear that will increase the crows feet by my eyes. I hope the eye creams minimize that. Time will tell. I had read the product is supposed to prevent creping. I have no idea what creping means, so I don&#x27;t know if I have it or if the product prevents it (LOL).  Again, overall, people have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and \\&quot;great\\&quot; without solicitation. I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
            <li> The product does reduce puffiness under the eyes and smooths fine lines.  The pump is a pain - as many reviewers have pointed out.  Lot&#x27;s of frustration until I learned how to get just the right amount (a 1/2 pump) onto my fingertips.  I&#x27;m not as infatuated with this products as I was when first used - I&#x27;ve been using about a year. I have sensitive skin and I have noticed little bumps under my skin that make me wonder if the product is clogging pores and congesting skin.  I&#x27;ve switched to a Body Time product to see if it helps reduce the problem.  I&#x27;ll check back in on this sight and update.  For now, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $ on their products! I really like this AOX+ Eye Gel Antioxidant Gel! It glides on so smoothly and wears well! Makeup and mascara don&#x27;t smear, run or cake. I use it with their AGE Eye Complex Cream where a little goes a long way with the Antioxident. Great results!!!  Product arrived on time, in good, unopened and authentic condition. Recommend seller.</li>
            <li> I start using this product after someone had recommended the c + E freulic gel for the face.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I feel there is a definite difference in my eye area.  I would recommend this to anyone that wakes up with puffy eyes for dark circles.  I have to say mine were not very bad but they are non existent now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the skinceuticals AGE eye cream. For about a week i used one on my right eye and the other on my left (to see which was better) - without any dramatic results. However, then i read they were really meant to be used together and so I changed the routine to include them both with the AOX gel coming first. 3 weeks later i&#x27;m sold! I never had much puffiness, but my terrible terrible dark circles are definately a shade lighter. I plan to use them both forever and ever and ever.</li>
            <li> Makes a difference over time, I notice a firmer eye area</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this item. May work on other people but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this eye gel if I look tired and exhausted.  It works wonders on tired puffy eyes.  A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> it feels good using it, but the wrinkle repair properties i haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement. I am on bottle #2 and my facial lady tells me to just be patient. the next bottle i buy, i might try a different brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle.... But....</li>
            <li> I have used this product and will use it again.  My doctor also sells it.  The eye gel makes my eyes feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;d been told it was because my under eye skin is thin.  I also with age have developed some cross hatching where my cheek bones are, due to smiling and squinting.  This gel greatly diminished the fine lines and got rid of the dark circles.  Better than some very expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I find that this product is really helping with the dark circles.  Not sure if it is helping with fine lines.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying AOX eye gel. Totally love the way my skin feels. Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition as described great seller  would buy again</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for over a year. It is light on the skin and seems to tighten the skin around my eyes immediately. I also love the price I pay for it with Amazon, much less than my local salon.</li>
            <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for about a year, then developed a terrible allergic reaction to it.  My eyes were nearly swollen shut and the skin underneath was raw and felt like sand paper.  It took nearly a week and several doctors visits to clear up.  The way the antioxidants are delivered to the skin is by using denatured alcohol, which is a known skin irritant.  While this worked and made my skin look good for awhile, the long term effects have been terrible for me.  Beware.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my dark circles ordered this and within two weeks those I could see a visible difference. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper than to buy it at the spa. It great stuff</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t achieve my expactation</li>
            <li> I bought this product and saw no change in my tired eyes  For the price this is not a product I would buy again.  I also think it has a wierd smell to it.  I&#x27;ve spent under $10.00 on other products purchased in drugstores and had better results.</li>
            <li> This actually works!  It helps with the circles and puffiness.  I found that you have to use it once in the morning and once @ night to get maximum results.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged guy who suffers from genetic drooping of skin under my eyes. A plastic surgeon told me, basically, to just live with it because surgery would cause other, worse problems for my situation. I have tried Neocutis Lumiere and found it did nothing for my problem. This gel works well. If I apply it in the morning when I first arise, it does reduce the drooping. Not dramatically, of course, but noticeably and more rapidly than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and far more than doing nothing. It has an almond scent, which I suspect is a cover-up of offending odors, but it&#x27;s not a problem if one expects it and it disipates. And BTW, all these non-aerosol products with pump mechanisms can be opened up with pliers. Always, there are several days of applications left in the bottle. Follow up 6/14: I have increased my rating to 5 stars. I have now been using it form several months and I find it increasingly effective as time goes on. No, it won&#x27;t make up for an evening of too much salt, wine, or insufficient sleep (BTW, I have discovered that melatonin pills may make under eye sagging worse). And a little bit goes a long way, so it is actually economical.</li>
            <li> Repair for eyes, wear every am, then a Skin Ceuticals eye repair and their new eye sunblock.  I have purchased many times from CEO Marketing via Amazon and they are very reputable, sell quality products and prices great.</li>
            <li> love this eye rx! serum not cream- goes right into skin ..</li>
            <li> execelentes delivery and products.</li>
            <li> This product is not as I had hoped.  The texture is thick and dark, it smells bad, and it feels sticky.  Worse, I used it about 5 times and happened to get a sty (the first one in my life) - and though&#x27;s probably just a bad coincidence I&#x27;m not going to use it again.  I&#x27;m much happier with Origins GinZing in the morning and Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight recovery eye at night.</li>
            <li> I love this skin line but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have dark circles under my eyes and the gel is yellow/gold so it actually made them appear darker.  I started putting it on before I go to bed to see if that worked and it didn&#x27;t.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again, but will buy this skin care line again.</li>
            <li> I am almost to 40 and wanted to up my skin routine game.  This product not only seems to be helping but combined with other Skinceutical products seems to be making my skin more vibrant.  I would recommend this product!</li>
