            <li>Wife loved this!</li>
            <li>People often wonder what smells so good, and it&#x27;s me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that that was over 5 years ago!</li>
            <li>That makes it a good lotion, but the smell is incredible!!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and feels great on skin!</li>
            <li>Great scent - not too over-powering.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, as well as all over my body..with great results skin wise..and the smell..</li>
            <li>Coconut milk shampoo and papaya face scrub are also great.</li>
            <li>I think this is creamy and works great.</li>
            <li>The scent is great...</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love Kirkuk anything!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still good and smells great.</li>
            <li>It is creamy, and best of all free of unneeded chemicals!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says it is as good as any skin moisturizer product</li>
            <li>I am going to buy it today on Amazon as the price seems really good</li>
            <li>so much it&#x27;s so good and smell good</li>
            <li>I have reordered it and given it as gifts, its that good.</li>
            <li>and this goes on smooth with a wonderful yummy scent.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law loved this cream I sent her.</li>
            <li>This Kukui Nut is very nice too, nice scent.  </li>
            <li>However, this is a great product and soaks into the skin better than the &amp;#34;Kukui Nut Body Oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just the right texture, hydrating and a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>this is the most intoxicating smell..to me!</li>
            <li>Simply love this stuff!</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body cream!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the smell of this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I cannot stand the smell of any kind of coffee, nor the taste for that matter.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin look radiant, smell nice, and feel moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is creamy and soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the coconut body cream, but have heard it is equally nice.</li>
            <li>Apart from the high moisture it provides, it emits a magnificent scent that heightens that after-shower feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It is very soothing, non-oily, absorbs quickly, and leaves a wonderful scent on my skin!</li>
            <li>It was also something that didn&#x27;t bother my wife when she was in labor --  a huge plus!</li>
            <li>Best part of this is definitely the smell!</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous, just a hint or aroma and it does not bother the sinuses!  </li>
            <li>Lovely nutty smell that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin cream.</li>
            <li>I love this for sun burned skin as well.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both LOVE the scent of the Alba Kukui Nnt body cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Had I been able to smell it beforehand</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This Alba Botanical Hawaiian Body Cream goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely without being too greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion is my favorite</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of my favorite body creams.</li>
            <li>This is the creamiest, most buttery body moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this body cream, and it is all I use.  </li>
            <li>I do love the coconut scented cream, but I can&#x27;t always find it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, smells great and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and it smells much more like coconut than this.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the smell has changed to be more fruity, rather than the almost coffee-like scent from before.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this body cream.  </li>
            <li>and now I have to buy more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it feels on.  </li>
            <li>love it alot</li>
            <li>Not to mention, changing the ingredients from healther to more toxic ones.</li>
            <li>So smooth, keeps skin silky all day, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, I love the smell and how it conditions my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I can layer my perfume on top (Prada Infusion D&#x27;Orangeur), and well, it smells like I just came in from Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like so many lotions that feel like water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d agree more with the reviewer who says it smells like brown sugar :)</li>
            <li>I love the feel</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Most people like/love the scent.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent, and medium level emollient that soaks in easily.</li>
            <li>kind of sweet cereal&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Loved the first jar of this.  </li>
            <li>Super creamy - amazing smelling - hydrating and lasts.</li>
            <li>It is a yummy scent, that pampers my dry skin beautifully!</li>
            <li>I love the sensuous, smooth feel of the cream going on my body and it does absorb quickly, leaving a nice hydrated feel.  </li>
            <li>This is the best smelling body cream and works better than any other cream I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are wonderful and we find this yet another carefully crafted product by Alba.  </li>
            <li>So silky soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li>It really works good all over the body and even the face.</li>
            <li>and it also feels good on and really hydrates</li>
            <li>Alba is both extremely hydrating and smells absolutely delicious.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong, which I like</li>
            <li>So, the cream part of the product is fine, but the smell wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the application, is goes on smooth and absorbs relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Meaning, throughout all my switching around I will always have a jar of this available.</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers but have never found one worth sticking with until now.</li>
            <li>Free of &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and softens skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over 4 years and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This cream is so light yet moisturizes so well and</li>
            <li>When I wear it on my legs, it gives that glowy look that makes your skin look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>First bought alba brand in Maui and fell in love with the products.</li>
            <li>It has cocoa butter and shea in it, so it&#x27;s going to have that rich buttery, nutty smell.</li>
            <li>but it keeps my skin looking and feeling WONDERFUL all year round!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The feel of the cream is amazing and softens right away and much to my surprise ...</li>
            <li>Reading some of the reviews I thought the scent would be too sweet.</li>
            <li>My niece said it smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>True to life body cream.</li>
            <li>Likewise, the original version smelled WONDERFUL, but the new version smell is reminiscent of some chemical glue now, and is not even closely reminiscent of the kukui nut.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell AMAZING</li>
            <li>and it is always worth it.  </li>
            <li>Still totally worth it, and it IN NO WAY smells like coffee.</li>
            <li>While there are still undertones of the original smell and the lotion is still creamy, I dislike the new scent and hope they return to their original formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been the FIRST lotion I&#x27;ve ever been able to put on my very sensitive legs, right after shaving, that has not burned, stung, caused irritation, or made them break out in hives afterward.  </li>
            <li>It has a delicious brown sugar scent that remains subtle so it doesn&#x27;t clash too much if you wear perfume or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first found a similar Kukui Nut lotion on a trip to Hawaii, and was thrilled to find this Alba product.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent is very strong and very specific -- it is certainly a nutty and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has very sensitive skin that dries easily, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for&lt;br /&gt;new moisturizing products</li>
            <li>It is a personal and very subjective choice of course, but will say..that not only are the ingredients superior, but I just LOVE using this product.</li>
            <li>Alba Kukui Body Cream is a good moisturizer; it left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>I love how Alba&#x27;s products are so natural and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and melts into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff because it is all natural and very moisturizing and thicker than lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a soft, yet very rich scent, very nutty, and maybe a tad bit of vanilla &amp; fig.</li>
            <li>I like this body cream very much.</li>
            <li>Smells great, soaks in quickly, and after trying a number of other products the Kukui nut butter as been the only one that&#x27;s noticeably saved my skin through out the winter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume and I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products, but this one is fantastic and reminds me of being on the beach in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>This is the first cream I have used that stays with me all day.</li>
            <li>I call this my Lypeda, juice it makes my skin feel smooth and always soft</li>
            <li>I am on my second jar and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I will probably be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I have been using Alba Botanica&#x27;s body cream for years now and have loved the subtle, but rich, nutty scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and all the nut oils are extremely nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs well and is makes my skin super soft and comfy.</li>
            <li>I used to buy products from L&#x27;Occitane, but have noticed their new formulations don&#x27;t work as well as some of their older products (alcohol, glycerin and water are the first three ingredients!), and I was willing to pay any price.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff, I use it for my dry skin Just what I expected.</li>
            <li>As opposed to the original moisturizer, which used to absorb instantly and without greasiness, the new version is no longer as easily absorbed and it feels almost as if it had &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I can be very eloquent in my description of it....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This lotion is creamy and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>As much as I smell this stuff, I never seem to tire of it.</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find a lotion which I could put on my legs right after shaving - and not have them instantly irritated and dotted with red for hours.  </li>
            <li>We switched from the Coconut - our other favorite.  </li>
            <li>Why in the world would such a great company change such a great moisturizer into such a useless product?</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this body cream, so I do not have any reference to how it compares with the old formula.</li>
            <li>It is not bad, just not one of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li>Leaves my dry skin silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is interesting, slightly nutty, coffee, coconut?  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would be thicker with a lighter scent; it did not suit my preferences, although it is a decent body cream.</li>
            <li>The second had a slightly different fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love at all.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in a bigger container. :)</li>
            <li>I do not detect much of a fruity scent at all, unless you count the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Texture-wise, it is fluffy &amp; light, very moisturizing without being overly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this the Kukui nut smell and only lotion I have found in a long time that does not break me out</li>
            <li>My significant other immediately noticed the difference too, as he used to use it, but now thinks the scent is less gender neutral and more like tropical fruit.</li>
            <li>With these super moisturizing ingredients, your skin will feel like a dream all day long.</li>
            <li>and it really works to keep my super dry hands soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this body cream.</li>
            <li>I am new to this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved it - until this last batch that I ordered in 2014 (can hardly finish the jar by 2015).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works like a dream - not too heavy, not greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>well, just makes me go wild with delight.</li>
            <li>The only problem is she likes this so much she used it all up</li>
            <li>I use this lotion on my body, and even face, without any irritation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>for a few years and love the scent, but the oil can be a bit greasy for  me, so I picked up this body cream since it seemed like it has the same scent -- and</li>
            <li>I mean I really love it.</li>
            <li>My family tends to have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li>First lotion in a long time to actually moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and this is one of the only body creams that prevent so much of skin dryness.  </li>
            <li>The product is all natural (LOVE this!), and extremely moisturizing without getting hard (ever bought cocoa butter that was solid in the jar?).  </li>
            <li>34;a little goes a long way,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s true for all body butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I live in Idaho, a very dry climate, and need major moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin which I lotion religiously after every shower.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the smell of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand the smell of any kind of coffee, nor the taste for that matter.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin look radiant, smell nice, and feel moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is creamy and soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the coconut body cream, but have heard it is equally nice.</li>
            <li> Apart from the high moisture it provides, it emits a magnificent scent that heightens that after-shower feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It is very soothing, non-oily, absorbs quickly, and leaves a wonderful scent on my skin!</li>
            <li> It was also something that didn&#x27;t bother my wife when she was in labor --  a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Best part of this is definitely the smell!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, just a hint or aroma and it does not bother the sinuses!  </li>
            <li> Lovely nutty smell that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream.</li>
            <li> I love this for sun burned skin as well.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE the scent of the Alba Kukui Nnt body cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Had I been able to smell it beforehand</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This Alba Botanical Hawaiian Body Cream goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of my favorite body creams.</li>
            <li> This is the creamiest, most buttery body moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream, and it is all I use.  </li>
            <li> I do love the coconut scented cream, but I can&#x27;t always find it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, smells great and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and it smells much more like coconut than this.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the smell has changed to be more fruity, rather than the almost coffee-like scent from before.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream.  </li>
            <li> and now I have to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it feels on.  </li>
            <li> love it alot</li>
            <li> Not to mention, changing the ingredients from healther to more toxic ones.</li>
            <li> So smooth, keeps skin silky all day, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, I love the smell and how it conditions my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I can layer my perfume on top (Prada Infusion D&#x27;Orangeur), and well, it smells like I just came in from Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like so many lotions that feel like water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d agree more with the reviewer who says it smells like brown sugar :)</li>
            <li> I love the feel</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Most people like/love the scent.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, and medium level emollient that soaks in easily.</li>
            <li> kind of sweet cereal&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Loved the first jar of this.  </li>
            <li> Super creamy - amazing smelling - hydrating and lasts.</li>
            <li> It is a yummy scent, that pampers my dry skin beautifully!</li>
            <li> I love the sensuous, smooth feel of the cream going on my body and it does absorb quickly, leaving a nice hydrated feel.  </li>
            <li> This is the best smelling body cream and works better than any other cream I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are wonderful and we find this yet another carefully crafted product by Alba.  </li>
            <li> So silky soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li> It really works good all over the body and even the face.</li>
            <li> and it also feels good on and really hydrates</li>
            <li> Alba is both extremely hydrating and smells absolutely delicious.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong, which I like</li>
            <li> So, the cream part of the product is fine, but the smell wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the application, is goes on smooth and absorbs relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> Meaning, throughout all my switching around I will always have a jar of this available.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers but have never found one worth sticking with until now.</li>
            <li> Free of &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and softens skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 4 years and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> This cream is so light yet moisturizes so well and</li>
            <li> When I wear it on my legs, it gives that glowy look that makes your skin look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> First bought alba brand in Maui and fell in love with the products.</li>
            <li> It has cocoa butter and shea in it, so it&#x27;s going to have that rich buttery, nutty smell.</li>
            <li> but it keeps my skin looking and feeling WONDERFUL all year round!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The feel of the cream is amazing and softens right away and much to my surprise ...</li>
            <li> Reading some of the reviews I thought the scent would be too sweet.</li>
            <li> My niece said it smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> True to life body cream.</li>
            <li> Likewise, the original version smelled WONDERFUL, but the new version smell is reminiscent of some chemical glue now, and is not even closely reminiscent of the kukui nut.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell AMAZING</li>
            <li> and it is always worth it.  </li>
            <li> Still totally worth it, and it IN NO WAY smells like coffee.</li>
            <li> While there are still undertones of the original smell and the lotion is still creamy, I dislike the new scent and hope they return to their original formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been the FIRST lotion I&#x27;ve ever been able to put on my very sensitive legs, right after shaving, that has not burned, stung, caused irritation, or made them break out in hives afterward.  </li>
            <li> It has a delicious brown sugar scent that remains subtle so it doesn&#x27;t clash too much if you wear perfume or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first found a similar Kukui Nut lotion on a trip to Hawaii, and was thrilled to find this Alba product.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent is very strong and very specific -- it is certainly a nutty and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has very sensitive skin that dries easily, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for&lt;br /&gt;new moisturizing products</li>
            <li> It is a personal and very subjective choice of course, but will say..that not only are the ingredients superior, but I just LOVE using this product.</li>
            <li> Alba Kukui Body Cream is a good moisturizer; it left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> I love how Alba&#x27;s products are so natural and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and melts into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff because it is all natural and very moisturizing and thicker than lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a soft, yet very rich scent, very nutty, and maybe a tad bit of vanilla &amp; fig.</li>
            <li> I like this body cream very much.</li>
            <li> Smells great, soaks in quickly, and after trying a number of other products the Kukui nut butter as been the only one that&#x27;s noticeably saved my skin through out the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume and I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products, but this one is fantastic and reminds me of being on the beach in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> This is the first cream I have used that stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> I call this my Lypeda, juice it makes my skin feel smooth and always soft</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I will probably be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alba Botanica&#x27;s body cream for years now and have loved the subtle, but rich, nutty scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and all the nut oils are extremely nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs well and is makes my skin super soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> I used to buy products from L&#x27;Occitane, but have noticed their new formulations don&#x27;t work as well as some of their older products (alcohol, glycerin and water are the first three ingredients!), and I was willing to pay any price.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I use it for my dry skin Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> As opposed to the original moisturizer, which used to absorb instantly and without greasiness, the new version is no longer as easily absorbed and it feels almost as if it had &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I can be very eloquent in my description of it....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> As much as I smell this stuff, I never seem to tire of it.</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find a lotion which I could put on my legs right after shaving - and not have them instantly irritated and dotted with red for hours.  </li>
            <li> We switched from the Coconut - our other favorite.  </li>
            <li> Why in the world would such a great company change such a great moisturizer into such a useless product?</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this body cream, so I do not have any reference to how it compares with the old formula.</li>
            <li> It is not bad, just not one of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li> Leaves my dry skin silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is interesting, slightly nutty, coffee, coconut?  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be thicker with a lighter scent; it did not suit my preferences, although it is a decent body cream.</li>
            <li> The second had a slightly different fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love at all.</li>
            <li> I only wish it came in a bigger container. :)</li>
            <li> I do not detect much of a fruity scent at all, unless you count the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Texture-wise, it is fluffy &amp; light, very moisturizing without being overly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this the Kukui nut smell and only lotion I have found in a long time that does not break me out</li>
            <li> My significant other immediately noticed the difference too, as he used to use it, but now thinks the scent is less gender neutral and more like tropical fruit.</li>
            <li> With these super moisturizing ingredients, your skin will feel like a dream all day long.</li>
            <li> and it really works to keep my super dry hands soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this body cream.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved it - until this last batch that I ordered in 2014 (can hardly finish the jar by 2015).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works like a dream - not too heavy, not greasy, not too light.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> well, just makes me go wild with delight.</li>
            <li> The only problem is she likes this so much she used it all up</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on my body, and even face, without any irritation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> for a few years and love the scent, but the oil can be a bit greasy for  me, so I picked up this body cream since it seemed like it has the same scent -- and</li>
            <li> I mean I really love it.</li>
            <li> My family tends to have pretty dry skin.</li>
            <li> First lotion in a long time to actually moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and this is one of the only body creams that prevent so much of skin dryness.  </li>
            <li> The product is all natural (LOVE this!), and extremely moisturizing without getting hard (ever bought cocoa butter that was solid in the jar?).  </li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s true for all body butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I live in Idaho, a very dry climate, and need major moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin which I lotion religiously after every shower.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the product for the past three years, but the scent and consistency changed in a negative direction for me.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and need a little scent of hydration.</li>
            <li> My legs are often extra dry after shaving and they&#x27;ll be irritated by the spandex in my jeans or leggings throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of vanilla and food scented lotions and perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product to keep my legs and arms from getting dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I use immediately after I shower and my skin never feels dry, never.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a natural product without a ton of artificial crap, and still manages to be a far superior moisturizer than any other I have used, even ones more expensive.</li>
            <li> body cream is what I would say is mid-weight in terms of how thick or thin body butters can be, but it sinks right in and leaves your skin silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Also, my very dry skin with a tendency to rashes and eczema is at its calmest since I started using this body cream every time I shower.</li>
            <li> My husband is not really a fan and has made comments that I smell &amp;#34;like a cinnamon roll&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;some</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s whipped and not greasy like other body butters I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> sweet, but not overpowering or artificial at all.</li>
            <li> However, I was sorely disappointed to get my latest shipment of this product, as Alba has now changed the formula (along with the style of packaging).</li>
            <li> The smell does not bother me but it is a little sweeter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me, but I read the reviews and agree with those that question the change in formula from previous shipments.  </li>
            <li> The scent is part cacao (it&#x27;s one of the ingredients) with a little vanilla.  </li>
            <li> However, it has a very strong coffee smell that I find very annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m past the age where I want to keep all my little beauty secrets too myself</li>
            <li> The scent is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The alluring scent is hard to describe, sort of nutty vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I use it to massage my wife practically every night (or at least once a week).</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent - subtle, fading within about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Very thick body butter.</li>
            <li> It must have been broken along the way.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not too bad!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite lotion! Just the right texture, hydrating and a wonderful smell. I don&#x27;t wear perfume and I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances in products, but this one is fantastic and reminds me of being on the beach in Hawaii.  The only lotion I&#x27;ve worn for ~8 years now.</li>
            <li> Nice. I purchase it often.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product to keep my legs and arms from getting dry in the winter.  It&#x27;s whipped and not greasy like other body butters I&#x27;ve tried.  Plus the kukui nut scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the only every day body moisture I use. My family tends to have pretty dry skin. This is the first cream I have used that stays with me all day. It smells amazing and all the nut oils are extremely nourishing to my skin. I love how Alba&#x27;s products are so natural and gentle on the skin. I can&#x27;t live without this body cream.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and feels great on skin! Best part of this is definitely the smell!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, just a hint or aroma and it does not bother the sinuses!  I give it away as birthday and Christmas gifts and it is always a HIT!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has very sensitive skin that dries easily, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for&lt;br /&gt;new moisturizing products she might like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hit the jackpot when I got her some Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Body Cream.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it is as good as any skin moisturizer product she&#x27;s ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has become a standby, a skin product staple in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it the highest rating!!</li>
            <li> Reading some of the reviews I thought the scent would be too sweet. Not at all. Lovely nutty smell that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;love the silky texture. Will def repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin cream. I use it almost every day on my hands and after showering all over. I love the smell and the application, is goes on smooth and absorbs relatively quickly. I&#x27;ve been using in for years and my skin is that of someone ten years younger.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. Super creamy - amazing smelling - hydrating and lasts. I love this for sun burned skin as well.</li>
            <li> Alba Kukui Body Cream is a good moisturizer; it left my skin feeling very soft.  However, I&#x27;m only using it at night because it leaves my skin feeling sticky and I don&#x27;t love the smell.  Although I&#x27;ll finish using the product I have, the stickiness and smell will keep me from purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am amazed to find people who complain about the scent.  My husband and I both LOVE the scent of the Alba Kukui Nnt body cream.  It is a delicious scent with undertones of vanilla. We switched from the Coconut - our other favorite.  This moisturizer works like a dream - not too heavy, not greasy, not too light. The ingredients are wonderful and we find this yet another carefully crafted product by Alba.  We hope that it is around forever.</li>
            <li> The lotion seems to be thinner now.  But it&#x27;s still good and smells great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best. It really works good all over the body and even the face. I order this for myself and my mother.</li>
            <li> Rub it on your lady and close your eyes. Cookies and pussy are the bomb dot com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve been using their [[ASIN:B000ILKUZ6 Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil, 8.5-Ounce]] for a few years and love the scent, but the oil can be a bit greasy for  me, so I picked up this body cream since it seemed like it has the same scent -- and it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body cream is what I would say is mid-weight in terms of how thick or thin body butters can be, but it sinks right in and leaves your skin silky soft.  It has a delicious brown sugar scent that remains subtle so it doesn&#x27;t clash too much if you wear perfume or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the kukui nut body cream for a number of years now.  I love the sensuous, smooth feel of the cream going on my body and it does absorb quickly, leaving a nice hydrated feel.  The scent is part cacao (it&#x27;s one of the ingredients) with a little vanilla.  It&#x27;s not an overpowering scent - subtle, fading within about 30 minutes.  I am going to buy it today on Amazon as the price seems really good - hope it&#x27;s the same product that I&#x27;ve been using!</li>
            <li> Very thick body butter. Great scent - not too over-powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m past the age where I want to keep all my little beauty secrets too myself (actually, don&#x27;t think I was ever that girl). Anyway, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based upon the fact that my mother has been using the mango version of this body cream.  I thought I would try this different version.  Had I been able to smell it beforehand, I would never have ordered it and would have stuck with the mango that my mother uses.  To me, and it is only my opinion and sense of smell, it smells like a flavored coffee.  I cannot stand the smell of any kind of coffee, nor the taste for that matter.  So, the cream part of the product is fine, but the smell wasn&#x27;t for me.  Also, the product came with the lid having damage to the side.  It must have been broken along the way.  So, if you aren&#x27;t a fan of the smell of coffee, I would suggest you not order this version of Alba&#x27;s body cream.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Luxurious product.  Makes my skin so soft and I love it! I&#x27;m very happy with this body cream. Sometimes I use it as a gift</li>
            <li> I use this for my dry hands. It leaves my hands feeling nice and smooth.  The scent is unbelievable. My niece said it smelled good enough to eat. She lives it too. Great product.</li>
            <li> this is the most intoxicating smell..to me! and has the creamiest yummiest texture of any moisturizer I have ever used. It is a personal and very subjective choice of course, but will say..that not only are the ingredients superior, but I just LOVE using this product. I use it on my face, as well as all over my body..with great results skin wise..and the smell..well, just makes me go wild with delight.</li>
            <li> This Alba Botanical Hawaiian Body Cream goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely without being too greasy. However, the scent is very strong and very specific -- it is certainly a nutty and sweet smell. I was hoping this product would be thicker with a lighter scent; it did not suit my preferences, although it is a decent body cream.</li>
            <li> Love this the Kukui nut smell and only lotion I have found in a long time that does not break me out</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite I like it so much it&#x27;s so good and smell good I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I call this my Lypeda, juice it makes my skin feel smooth and always soft</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this body cream, so I do not have any reference to how it compares with the old formula. All I know is, it is heavenly! I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of scents, so I don&#x27;t know that I can be very eloquent in my description of it....but I will try:&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft, yet very rich scent, very nutty, and maybe a tad bit of vanilla &amp; fig. I do not detect much of a fruity scent at all, unless you count the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Texture-wise, it is fluffy &amp; light, very moisturizing without being overly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite body creams. I tend to switch around a lot and I seldom come back to the same product once it&#x27;s gone. This one however, will probably end up being one of my mainstays. Meaning, throughout all my switching around I will always have a jar of this available. It is a yummy scent, that pampers my dry skin beautifully!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and this is one of the only body creams that prevent so much of skin dryness.  It is creamy, and best of all free of unneeded chemicals!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was like &amp;#34;Babe! I&#x27;m outta my body cream!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was like &amp;#34;I got you baby...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went online and ordered said body cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it came and I was all like &amp;#34;Baby... I got somethin&#x27; for you. wanna play with our body cream?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she swooned and the rest of the night violates the PG rules on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the creamiest, most buttery body moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I use immediately after I shower and my skin never feels dry, never. Apart from the high moisture it provides, it emits a magnificent scent that heightens that after-shower feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li> I bought this Kukui Nut Body Cream to try to help with my psoriasis. After using it for a couple of weeks daily I didn&#x27;t see any signs of clearing my psoriasis. It would just make the red areas no longer scaly white color, but the scales were translucent in color and still there. However, this is a great product and soaks into the skin better than the &amp;#34;Kukui Nut Body Oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream, and it is all I use.  It is very creamy and melts into the skin quickly.  I have found a lot of organic creams that do not absorb quickly enough.  I do love the coconut scented cream, but I can&#x27;t always find it.  This Kukui Nut is very nice too, nice scent.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy and absorbs fast. Moisturizers heal and repair cracked skin. That makes it a good lotion, but the smell is incredible!! Smells like a buttery vanilla caramel macadamia nut cookie. Delicious. Smell fades after a while but it&#x27;s just Devine!! First bought alba brand in Maui and fell in love with the products. Coconut milk shampoo and papaya face scrub are also great. This is by far the best! I buy this online now because it&#x27;s $12 at the grocery store (if you can find it)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, smells great and soaks in fast.  First lotion in a long time to actually moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Lasts a long time. I have reordered it and given it as gifts, its that good.</li>
            <li> I think this is creamy and works great. The smell does not bother me but it is a little sweeter than I expected. I have the Kukui nut body oil and it smells much more like coconut than this. The smell is different. My husband is not really a fan and has made comments that I smell &amp;#34;like a cinnamon roll&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;some kind of sweet cereal&amp;#34; - I will use this all but will probably not order again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers but have never found one worth sticking with until now. I am on my second jar and will be buying more. The scent is great... sweet, but not overpowering or artificial at all. I like that it&#x27;s a natural product without a ton of artificial crap, and still manages to be a far superior moisturizer than any other I have used, even ones more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and it continues to satisfy with its effectiveness. Nice light scent, and medium level emollient that soaks in easily.</li>
            <li> Loved the first jar of this.  The second had a slightly different fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alba Botanica&#x27;s body cream for years now and have loved the subtle, but rich, nutty scent. However, I was sorely disappointed to get my latest shipment of this product, as Alba has now changed the formula (along with the style of packaging). I immediately noticed the smell has changed to be more fruity, rather than the almost coffee-like scent from before. My significant other immediately noticed the difference too, as he used to use it, but now thinks the scent is less gender neutral and more like tropical fruit. While there are still undertones of the original smell and the lotion is still creamy, I dislike the new scent and hope they return to their original formula.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, very moisturizing.  Free of &amp;#34;off limits&amp;#34; chemicals. However, it has a very strong coffee smell that I find very annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and it is always worth it.  Makes your skin look radiant, smell nice, and feel moisturized.  You also don&#x27;t have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  It goes on smoothly and softens skin.  I would recommend this product for any skin dryness.</li>
            <li> Simply love this stuff! Smells great, soaks in quickly, and after trying a number of other products the Kukui nut butter as been the only one that&#x27;s noticeably saved my skin through out the winter.</li>
            <li> True to life body cream. With these super moisturizing ingredients, your skin will feel like a dream all day long. Would recommend to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin which I lotion religiously after every shower. My legs are often extra dry after shaving and they&#x27;ll be irritated by the spandex in my jeans or leggings throughout the day. This lotion helps with these problems a lot. A lot of people are complaining that it smells like coffee, but I think this is their oversight. It has cocoa butter and shea in it, so it&#x27;s going to have that rich buttery, nutty smell. Personally, I find the smell addictive. The lotion itself is creamy and soaks into the skin nicely. The smell is strong, which I like and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I would recommend this to anyone who likes cocoa butter lotion.</li>
            <li> Alba is both extremely hydrating and smells absolutely delicious.  I live in the desert and need a little scent of hydration.</li>
            <li> We love it!  My son calls it his cookie lotion and asks for it every day!!</li>
            <li> I like this body cream very much. I use it to massage my wife practically every night (or at least once a week). As much as I smell this stuff, I never seem to tire of it. It was also something that didn&#x27;t bother my wife when she was in labor --  a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Smells like snickerdoodles.  My fiance can&#x27;t get enough.  Makes my skin soft &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I have very sensitive skin and this goes on smooth with a wonderful yummy scent. People often smell baked goods when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream.  Leaves my dry skin silky and smooth.  Long lasting. I haven&#x27;t tried the coconut body cream, but have heard it is equally nice.</li>
            <li> Wife loved this! The only problem is she likes this so much she used it all up and now I have to buy more.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Non greasy.  Love the smell and the way it feels on.  One of the best and great price for the quality.  Wish they made a non scented one.  Have used the mango scented one and it also feels good on and really hydrates well but it is too sweet/fruity for me.  Also use the Kukui oil and like that too.</li>
            <li> love this stuff because it is all natural and very moisturizing and thicker than lotion.  the best! love it alot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this moisturizer for about 2-3 years from my local health food store. I&#x27;ve always loved it - until this last batch that I ordered in 2014 (can hardly finish the jar by 2015). The consistency of the moisturizer has changed, and so have the ingredients. As opposed to the original moisturizer, which used to absorb instantly and without greasiness, the new version is no longer as easily absorbed and it feels almost as if it had &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; in it. Likewise, the original version smelled WONDERFUL, but the new version smell is reminiscent of some chemical glue now, and is not even closely reminiscent of the kukui nut. What a disappointment. Why in the world would such a great company change such a great moisturizer into such a useless product? Not to mention, changing the ingredients from healther to more toxic ones. What a shame. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! So smooth, keeps skin silky all day, and it smells amazing. Every time I wear it I get compliments on smelling like a sugar cookie.</li>
            <li> This body cream is my FAVOURITE!  Not only does it smell AMAZING but it keeps my skin looking and feeling WONDERFUL all year round!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling body cream and works better than any other cream I have tried.  I have been using this for over 4 years and my skin is silky smooth.  I only wish it came in a bigger container. :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s not greasy, I love the smell and how it conditions my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body cream! It is luscious!</li>
            <li> This cream is so light yet moisturizes so well and the biggest plus is the scent.  It smell absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loved this cream I sent her. She said it&#x27;s very creamy and moisturizing. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> So silky soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I found this product!!  I live in Idaho, a very dry climate, and need major moisturizing.  I used to buy products from L&#x27;Occitane, but have noticed their new formulations don&#x27;t work as well as some of their older products (alcohol, glycerin and water are the first three ingredients!), and I was willing to pay any price.  The product is all natural (LOVE this!), and extremely moisturizing without getting hard (ever bought cocoa butter that was solid in the jar?).  When I wear it on my legs, it gives that glowy look that makes your skin look fantastic.  When you add the cost factor into this product, I&#x27;m over the moon.  Never again am I spending $40 on jars of cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is interesting, slightly nutty, coffee, coconut?  Smells like a bottle of suntan lotion with a twist.  It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s ok.  The smell seems to fade after awhile.  I can layer my perfume on top (Prada Infusion D&#x27;Orangeur), and well, it smells like I just came in from Hawaii.  Not too bad!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! This is my second jar. I first found a similar Kukui Nut lotion on a trip to Hawaii, and was thrilled to find this Alba product.  I use this lotion on my body, and even face, without any irritation on my sensitive skin.  It is very soothing, non-oily, absorbs quickly, and leaves a wonderful scent on my skin! The alluring scent is hard to describe, sort of nutty vanilla.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find a lotion which I could put on my legs right after shaving - and not have them instantly irritated and dotted with red for hours.  The search has finally ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the FIRST lotion I&#x27;ve ever been able to put on my very sensitive legs, right after shaving, that has not burned, stung, caused irritation, or made them break out in hives afterward.  Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li> Big advocate of this product for cracking skin.</li>
            <li> Love Kirkuk anything!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I mean I really love it. It goes on thick, but not greasy. It isn&#x27;t like so many lotions that feel like water. I put it on at night and it really works to keep my super dry hands soft.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me, but I read the reviews and agree with those that question the change in formula from previous shipments.  I have enjoyed the product for the past three years, but the scent and consistency changed in a negative direction for me.  I hope it returns as it once was marketed.  I would also like to recommend to the marketing division that a pump version of the shampoo and conditioner Honey Dew be considered.  I can no  longer use the flip top/squeeze lids.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and makes my skin very soft. I can&#x27;t say that &amp;#34;a little goes a long way,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s true for all body butters I&#x27;ve tried. Still totally worth it, and it IN NO WAY smells like coffee. I&#x27;d agree more with the reviewer who says it smells like brown sugar :)</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica Hawaiian Body Cream, Kukui nut, 6.5-Ounce Jar  This is great stuff, I use it for my dry skin Just what I expected. I love the feel</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. People often wonder what smells so good, and it&#x27;s me! I smell like snickerdoodles. Also, my very dry skin with a tendency to rashes and eczema is at its calmest since I started using this body cream every time I shower. It&#x27;s so good that that was over 5 years ago!</li>
            <li> I read an article about this lotion/body cream and wanted to try it. I would have giving it a 5 star but am still trying to get accustom to the sent. Most people like/love the scent. It is not bad, just not one of my personal favorites. The feel of the cream is amazing and softens right away and much to my surprise ...IT IS NOT OILY OR GREASY. I will probably be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product.  I am reading reviews that the formula and scent have been recently changed. I don&#x27;t know how it used to be... but I LOVE the smell of this stuff!  I am a long time fan of vanilla and food scented lotions and perfumes. This has a fruity, vanilla coffee smell that is perfect for me!!  The lotion absorbs well and is makes my skin super soft and comfy. BIG FAN.</li>
