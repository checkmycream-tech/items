            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good hair straightener!</li>
            <li>she liked this one better than my bio-ionic.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been a very good purchase.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Visibly it was awesome but the actual ceramic plates and</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>I love that the temperature IS adjustable on this one.  </li>
            <li>When my bio died, i replaced it with another of these and love, love, love it (tried the HSI, but didn&#x27;t like it either).  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>This iron made my hair shiny and soft, and my stylist would be proud to say she cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am SO impressed with what it did for my hair in about a minute and half.  </li>
            <li>-consuming!$28-$35 is a steal - anything less than $60 is still a great deal!</li>
            <li>is probably perfect for a teens first flat iron.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this iron, but it does not slide smoothly over my hair.  </li>
            <li>It pulls and snags my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh wow, when I saw this in here with 5 stars given by two customers saying good things about it, I decided to try it</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener to have as a backup since it was such a good price (I also have a Sedu, which I LOVE).  </li>
            <li>very happt with my purchase plus its super cute!</li>
            <li>Love the fast FREE 2 day prime shipping as well.  </li>
            <li>With so many positive reviews, maybe this one is a fluke, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing a Proliss again.</li>
            <li>price&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It manages your hair perfectly, it is better than a blower, and faster too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is works very well</li>
            <li>Really happy to be able to purchase this item for such a low price.</li>
            <li>This straightener caught fire when I first plugged it in when I took it out of the box!</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had is a more visible light showing that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>This is way better than my old $25 straightener.  </li>
            <li>This Proliss makes your hair FLAT, smooth and shiny - even better than the bio.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works excellently on my very wavy hair .</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stay hot.  </li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t really easy to maneuver while trying to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li>It worked really well for a year.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for another for my daughter to take to her dads, so bought this one--</li>
            <li>that well it was kind of heavy</li>
            <li>I have natural nappy hair and these flat irons make me look like i have a relaxer i love them</li>
            <li>I love it but one of my ceramic plates had a piece come off the other day</li>
            <li>I love the pink animal print too!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my straightener for about a year and mainly use it to do my bangs.</li>
            <li>The iron is decent.</li>
            <li>It does not heat up very quickly and it takes more than one stroke over a thin piece of hair before it straightens!</li>
            <li>I find I have to go over the same section of hair multiple times before it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it there was a burning smell, but I think that&#x27;s just because it was new.</li>
            <li>I was not impressed I have used really good flat irons before</li>
            <li>It should last a very long time and work very well.</li>
            <li>I bought it on Living Social for next to nothing, and I could not be happier.  </li>

            <li> However, half of the flat iron no longer heats up so it does not work.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered a flat iron from Groupon goods, but misunderstood the description that said heats up to 450 degrees.  </li>
            <li> The price here on Amazon is money well spent</li>
            <li> I got the flat iron very quickly no doubt it was on time</li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks to receive the other one from Groupon.</li>
            <li> I recommend any other straightener .</li>
            <li> I have owned A LOT of straighteners (many different brands) and I have to say that this one is the worst.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, no problems.</li>
            <li> I have 54 year old, fairly thick, white girl hair, that has a crazy wave, and I am SO challenged as it relates to styling it.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> but over half the price, this is what to buy!</li>
            <li> We both have THICK hair and this iron makes it straightening much less time</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how difficult it would be if I tried to curl my hair with it</li>
            <li> It works poorly and lacks control resulting in uneven  heating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this flat iron gets ANY bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> So when I use it now, it snags my hair where the broken piece fell out.</li>
            <li> 1st one was broken</li>
            <li> I have extremely difficult hair to straighten and this product does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible straightener brand I&#x27;ve had 1 other</li>
            <li> Its also awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it worked awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my straightener for about a year and mainly use it to do my bangs. It worked really well for a year. However, half of the flat iron no longer heats up so it does not work. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my Revlon straightener from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this flat iron gets ANY bad reviews.  I am SO impressed with what it did for my hair in about a minute and half.  I bought it on Living Social for next to nothing, and I could not be happier.  The price here on Amazon is money well spent too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to longevity, as it just came today.  But I will say this.  I have 54 year old, fairly thick, white girl hair, that has a crazy wave, and I am SO challenged as it relates to styling it.  This iron made my hair shiny and soft, and my stylist would be proud to say she cut my hair.  What more could you ask for? Buy it!!</li>
            <li> I love it but one of my ceramic plates had a piece come off the other day and it has never been dropped, handled improperly, etc.  So when I use it now, it snags my hair where the broken piece fell out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> IT IS PERFECT. YOU Can STYLE your  hair  &amp;#34;this is exactly what I need Great quality and Great price&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It manages your hair perfectly, it is better than a blower, and faster too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is works very well and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got the flat iron very quickly no doubt it was on time and  it was a l very cute the pattern. Visibly it was awesome but the actual ceramic plates and how it worked was not all that good at all. The Flatiron did snag my hair and it seemed as if it didn&#x27;t heat up all that well it was kind of heavy so it wasn&#x27;t really easy to maneuver while trying to flat iron my hair I can only imagine how difficult it would be if I tried to curl my hair with it I was not impressed I have used really good flat irons before and I was trying to save some money and I guess you just get what you pay for this is probably perfect for a teens first flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great item. The only reason on a 4 and not a 5 is because it pulls  the hair as you flate iron it.</li>
            <li> I know nothing about hair straighteners but must my sister who does said this is the perfect one. It should last a very long time and work very well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this iron, but it does not slide smoothly over my hair.  Its also awkward to hold.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of flat irons and I just don&#x27;t like this one.  I do like the heat setting being within the iron to avoid accidentally changing the heat level setting.</li>
            <li> Love it!! The first few times I used it there was a burning smell, but I think that&#x27;s just because it was new. It works great, and I love that you can adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! Really happy to be able to purchase this item for such a low price. Arrived quickly and works excellently on my very wavy hair . I love the pink animal print too!!</li>
            <li> Oh wow, when I saw this in here with 5 stars given by two customers saying good things about it, I decided to try it and I love it, the best I&#x27;ve ever try, my sister is in love and im getting one for her too.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. we have very long real hair and thick, just in case if you need to know</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! Does not pull my hair. If ur wanting something as good as a chi but over half the price, this is what to buy!</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered a flat iron from Groupon goods, but misunderstood the description that said heats up to 450 degrees.  I &#x27;assumed&#x27; that meant the temperature was adjustable.  That was not the case.  I saw this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try since it was the same brand.  This one was actually cheaper too (or the same price).  I love that the temperature IS adjustable on this one.  Love the fast FREE 2 day prime shipping as well.  Took about 2 weeks to receive the other one from Groupon.</li>
            <li> Only wish that I ordered one with the coper plates&lt;br /&gt;Was told about this product by a family member try</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener to have as a backup since it was such a good price (I also have a Sedu, which I LOVE).  I have owned A LOT of straighteners (many different brands) and I have to say that this one is the worst.  I accidentally left my Sedu at a family member&#x27;s house over the holidays, but I figured it was no big deal because I could use this one until I get it back.  So far, I am not impressed. It pulls and snags my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair.  I can&#x27;t even imagine trying to curl my hair with this straightener.  It also doesn&#x27;t stay hot.  I can tell as I&#x27;m using it that it&#x27;s always trying to heat back up. I find I have to go over the same section of hair multiple times before it&#x27;s straight. With so many positive reviews, maybe this one is a fluke, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing a Proliss again.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as my Chi and I was able to get a great deal on it.  I have extremely difficult hair to straighten and this product does the job.</li>
            <li> Works great. Have had this for several months and had no issues. The only thing I wish it had is a more visible light showing that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> This is way better than my old $25 straightener.  My hair is so shiny and beautiful after I use this.  my hairdresser recommended the babyliss, but I saw the price on this and couldn&#x27;t say no.  Works even better than the babyliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!!! i have paid hundreds of dollars on straighteners and them not work as well as this! very happt with my purchase plus its super cute! will def recommend to friends and family!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It works poorly and lacks control resulting in uneven  heating.</li>
            <li> The iron is decent. It does not heat up very quickly and it takes more than one stroke over a thin piece of hair before it straightens!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is awesome!!  I had another that was $100 (Bio-ionic one-pass)...didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for another for my daughter to take to her dads, so bought this one--she liked this one better than my bio-ionic.  When my bio died, i replaced it with another of these and love, love, love it (tried the HSI, but didn&#x27;t like it either).  This Proliss makes your hair FLAT, smooth and shiny - even better than the bio.  We both have THICK hair and this iron makes it straightening much less time-consuming!$28-$35 is a steal - anything less than $60 is still a great deal!</li>
            <li> I have natural nappy hair and these flat irons make me look like i have a relaxer i love them</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clamp the hair not hot enough. Have to re straighten over and over. didn&#x27;t even last me 2 months now I find myself having to buy another one. save your money not worth the price if I could id get my money back.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! It doesn&#x27;t snag the hair strands, nor does it burn my hair or flatten it between the plates. The settings are perfect and it won&#x27;t stiffen the hair either. I used IC hair polishing oil on my blow dry and flat iron and my hair was silky and bouncing after using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good hair straightener!</li>
            <li> 2nd times the charm.  1st one was broken so i had to return the item and repurchase.</li>
            <li> So far this has been a very good purchase. Shipped quickly, no problems. Works great.</li>
            <li> This straightener caught fire when I first plugged it in when I took it out of the box! It&#x27;s a horrible straightener brand I&#x27;ve had 1 other and it worked awful. I recommend any other straightener . And the design was peeled too!</li>
