            <li> highly recommend this product.  leaves very smooth, rashless skin</li>
            <li> OMG... this stuff is amazing.  I have never tried anything remotely close to this shaving cream, its amazing.  I gave one to my teenage daughters and this is what she had to say &amp;#34;This is amazing stuff created by geniuses&amp;#34; and I could not agree more.  I have very thick coarse hair and all it took was a small amount and I had a smooth sleek shave.  It&#x27;s been a week since I shaved and it has just started growing in plus the new growth is not as thick either.  You have to try it!!!!  The seller was great I had quick delivery as well; I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing rash free shaving cream!!! My brothers even use it for their beards!  Love! Love! Love! Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well! Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> Love this brand.  The sent is great. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Favorite shaving creme</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaving cream for the past few years as a shave gel for legs and under arms.  It works much better than any store product I&#x27;ve used especially since I have quite sensitive skin and breakout from many types of shaving creams.  It leaves a smooth feeling to your skin all day.  The 16 oz. lasted me almost an entire year, a little goes a long way.  While I usually opt to buy the 16 oz. bottle, I went with this twin pack of 8 oz. bottles this time.  Delivered within 2 days which was a pleasant surprise as I hadn&#x27;t selected that option.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Such a great deal on here! I bought a 4 Oz bottle of it in stores for 10 bucks and spent $22 on Amazon for a package of two 8 Oz bottles! The best shaving cream ever. I have very sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t get nearly as many ingrown hairs and irritation with this stuff. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> best shave cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have dark, thick and stubborn hair, this has cut down my shaving my legs everyday. Soft and smooth for a few days.</li>
            <li> I had some of this when me and my husband first started dating and he used it once and hasn&#x27;t used another shave cream since! Highly recommend to male or female!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shave cream. Provides a close smooth shave with no irritation!!! Where has this been all my life.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Just realized I could buy it on Amazon. I have always used the Green Tea version. I like the scent and it&#x27;s not overbearing. The product does what it says. No rash/ bumps and you get a smooth shave, close shave, and soft skin. Will be buying more when I need it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I swear by it. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this for shaving his face! It really helps reduce the razor rash and makes for a smoother shave!</li>
            <li> Did not realize that it was only 8oz; my fault. Next time I will look closer because the cost was not worth it. But the product does work good.</li>
            <li> Super silky legs and underarms! No irritation downstairs in my lady basement either!&lt;br /&gt;Not foamy like most shaving creams so less mess...a little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time. Overall good product:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brand for years. Allergic to reg. shave products.</li>
            <li> Amazing! what a smooth rash free shave!</li>
            <li> Best shave cream I&#x27;ve used. As in on face. Down south also. 4 vs 5 because one pump didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream! But... The pump didn&#x27;t work! And also I thought I was getting a two pack? I only got one, The picture and bold description clearly shows two pack!</li>
            <li> I love coochy cream, especially this green tea one! Your skin is so soft after shaving with this product. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did not look at the size. These are 8oz bottles &amp; I usually get the 2 pack 16 oz for the same price. My fault!</li>
