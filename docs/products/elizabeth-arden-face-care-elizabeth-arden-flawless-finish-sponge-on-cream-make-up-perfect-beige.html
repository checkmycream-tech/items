            <li>Can be hard to find at a good price in my color of perfect beige.</li>
            <li>Great makeup, comes sealed, brand new</li>
            <li>I have found buying thru amazon is easy and satisfying.  </li>
            <li>and the coverage is good but not as much as I prefer.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I have been using Elizabeth Arden products for quite a few years, I was delighted to find this at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Fabulous price on Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
            <li>Great buy, same as You&#x27;d find in department store.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I was able to get the makeup I love in the old package and at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>Color true.</li>
            <li>Received the item quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Make up is great though &amp; 20$ less than the stores.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this exact same makeup at the mall and loved the makeup</li>
            <li>i love this, it is exact makeup but in the older style case.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely keep this site on hand to order more products from Elizabeth Arden.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as promised</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Elizabeth Arden products for several years now and love them.  </li>
            <li>While it would be hard to select a shade online, if you know your shade this is a great site to purchase refills or maybe try a new eyeshadow shade.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy but loose powder on top helps.</li>
            <li>So much easier and cheaper than going to the mall.</li>
            <li>it goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li>thanks, gail</li>
            <li>This is a high quality make up.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this make-up for anyone who likes a heavier coverage and a truly &amp;#34;flawless finish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>- I apply early each morning and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Order early.</li>
            <li>Arden is currently packaging this makeup in a smaller container--new and improved is really just smaller packaging.</li>
            <li>I found this on here and it is like half the price for the exact same thing.</li>

            <li> I gave 4 stars not because of the mkup,  because it took so long to get to me.</li>
            <li> Will be going back to my other brands.</li>
            <li> I use Bareminerals or Merle Norman and this brand seems a little thick and hard to smooth on!</li>
            <li> Half the price that I pay in my local dept store.  </li>
            <li> You can put it on with a wet sponge for a lighter coverage.  </li>
            <li> but it became pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually use a different sponge than what is provided because I find the sponge that comes in the compact very small.  </li>
            <li> , I was a make up artist, it covers but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friend and she loves this hard to find makeup.</li>
            <li> Stinks like vaseline all day long.  </li>
            <li> Very unpleasant aroma.</li>

            <li> This is a high quality make up. It becomes more expensive with smaller make up area every year though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this brand before now.. I use Bareminerals or Merle Norman and this brand seems a little thick and hard to smooth on! It does not blend easily! Will be going back to my other brands.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish for over 30 years.  It works for me!  I was very pleased to find a more affordable source to purchase it from.</li>
            <li> My elderly aunt will only use this make-up and requests for me to purchase every 3 months. So much easier and cheaper than going to the mall. Delivery is always on time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this make-up for anyone who likes a heavier coverage and a truly &amp;#34;flawless finish&amp;#34;.  I have used this brand for several years and I love it.

            <li> I love this make up I&#x27;ve used it for years. I&#x27;ve even worked for Elizabeth Arden yrs ago, I was a make up artist, it covers but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  You can put it on with a wet sponge for a lighter coverage.  I gave 4 stars not because of the mkup,  because it took so long to get to me. But in all honesty the place I bought it from was very nice &amp; returned my emails promptly. .UT was probably the postal system but maybe not. It took mote than 10 says to get, but I&#x27;d still buy from them again, giving them the benefit of the dought. Make up is great though &amp; 20$ less than the stores. Plus you get more! The company reduced the amount you get but raised the price! So buy amazon it&#x27;ll save you $...thanks, gail</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Elizabeth Arden products . I always get compliments on my makeup.</li>
