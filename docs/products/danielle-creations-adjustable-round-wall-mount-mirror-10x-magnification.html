            <li>Makes it handy for the area I put it in.  </li>

            <li>Excellent item, highly recommended.</li>

            <li>Nice to be able to adjust height for guests.</li>
            <li>I love the mirror.  </li>
            <li>my Christmas company will love it.</li>
            <li>Love my mirror...</li>
            <li>the power would make it even better for putting on make up without glasses.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>For the money there must be better choices.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but now I am used to it and am glad to have it for eye make up application.</li>
            <li>I love that you can adjust the height as needed.</li>
            <li>love it for the movement of it.  </li>
            <li>you see more than you might want to see.</li>
            <li>It is well made and my wife is a satisfied user.</li>
            <li>I love the slide bar that lets you adjust the height.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE MAGNIFIER.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought one for each of the ladies and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would be.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it swings in and out</li>
            <li>This seemed the better of many choices out there and the price was in line.  </li>
            <li>Needs to extend more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t want a mirror that had lights (no outlet) but this mirror articulates is so many ways you can pick up the light from a window or overhead very easily.</li>
            <li>This one meets all her requirements: Great extension, easy motion, clarity, 10x AND Regular mirrors, and a classic design at a great price!</li>
            <li>Easy to install, love the arm and the way the mirror can be maneuvered.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, installation to my sheetrock bathroom wall was very easy and quick, maybe 10 minutes max with cleanup.</li>
            <li>mentioned in other reviews, the plastic wall anchors supplied are not the best</li>
            <li>easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>It was also quite easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li>Easy install.</li>
            <li>The mirror easily adjusts so that he can move it to practically any angle for shaving or combing his hair.  </li>
            <li>Without my glasses I can easily put on makeup using the 10X side.</li>
            <li>Our daughter said it was easy to install</li>
            <li>The adjustable arm makes it easy for any size person to see.</li>
            <li>It was easy to mount and it stays in position.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EASY TO PUT UP.  </li>
            <li>easy to install and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Though it is easy to do with a set screw on the end(closest to the mount).  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how strong it would be.</li>
            <li>The magnification was too strong for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is being used inside the wardrobe door in my camper and it works fine and solved the issue of no mirror in the bath area of the camper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the old mirror did the job great but the \\&quot;chromed\\&quot; metal started to rust relatively quickly and after 5 years, I no longer trusted it to stay on the wall.  </li>
            <li>It magnifies so huge, you may want to see some things you don&#x27;t want to see (wrinkles &amp; lines) but that is just what I want when I need to see a stray hair or the like.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t fit into the mirror.</li>
            <li>The 10x is big, but works great for eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>so i set it at the lowest level to fit me.  </li>
            <li>I could see an eye or my nose or my lips and great big caverns in my skin called pores.  </li>
            <li>I will be a great present.</li>
            <li>my bathroom mirror where it can be swung into the light or out toward me</li>
            <li>If I need to see something clearly, I need to either reposition the mirror or my face to get a good look.  </li>
            <li>The mirror quality is clean and the magnification is accurate.  </li>
            <li>The hot water from the shower softens my hair more than the shaving cream ever did</li>
            <li>It is mounted near her sink and does a great job and adjusts to any position she wants.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had to return it, but it came in excellent condition and was a nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, hangs easily, and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>10x magnification is very powerful and is great for plucking and/or extreme closeup.</li>
            <li>Most of these are too much.  </li>
            <li>As expected, easy to mount and is good quality.  </li>
            <li>10X magnification seems to work, but is probably too much magnification to useful for most purposes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would like to have looked at the mirror prior to ordering but am very happy with the unit overall.  </li>
            <li>Also a super gift for your relatives, neighbors and friends.</li>
            <li>The clarity is excellent and I like that you can adjust the height for different users or different tasks.</li>
            <li>The product was quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li>However, I, as many others, found the 10X magnification too high, despite I am farsighted and do need magnification to put on eye make-up.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered, hands are free to apply makeup, et al.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and practical.</li>
            <li>My friend is enjoying her new mirror</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and very quick shipment.</li>
            <li>The 10X magnification is humbling but too useful to do without.</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for my poor eyesight.</li>
            <li>but so far we love it.  </li>
            <li>Get an 8x, this one is way too powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and easy to install and the mirror is high quality.</li>
            <li>We really liked that it swiveled outward but also would swing inward folding flat against the wall -- out of the way.  </li>
            <li>Still looking for the right one.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to be the right choice.  </li>
            <li>It swings out to just the right place, and the height can be adjusted at the mount as well.</li>
            <li>It fits right into the space I have in the bathroom and is not in the way.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to install and so far has been durable and stayed in the wall.  </li>
            <li>My lovely wife has been looking for a nice looking, moderately priced &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; mirror for a long time.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to really be useful and the swing arm moves very smoothly yet stays put when I have it where I want it.</li>
            <li>I can see every little place on my face (which might not be so good).  </li>
            <li>magnification is too much!  </li>
            <li>The Danielle 10x magnification, wall-mounted mirror was exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>I thought the magnification was too much at first</li>
            <li>so I have natural light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it and am installing it in our second bathroom in case</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that I wasn&#x27;t able to get a the mirror in brush nickle.</li>
            <li>We fell in love with it while we were there last year.  </li>
            <li>Overall my wife is pleased with this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have a tiny bathroom &amp; was looking for a 10x magnification wall mounted mirror that could be mounted in an area that is only about 2&amp;#34; wide so this mirror was perfect!  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror, I have wanted one for a long while.</li>
            <li>My girlfriends and I spend a long weekend at the MGM Grand who have something like this mirror in their guest suites.  </li>
            <li>large,  I mounted it to wall in guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a large 10x mountable swing arm mirror and this mirror fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mirror diameter is large and the arm is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Very high resolution and easily installed with basic tools.  </li>
            <li>This mirror really does magnify which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>Mirror is very functional with the extendable/pivoting arm as well as some up/down adjustability.</li>
            <li>Just too much magnification.</li>
            <li>You do have to get really close to see on the 10x side</li>
            <li>Had to return this mirror because the 10x magnification was too much.  </li>
            <li>It is also very to install.</li>
            <li>Putting on make up in the morning is so much easier now.</li>
            <li>and you have to stand very close for clarity on focusing.</li>
            <li>..LOOKS VERY GLAM.</li>
            <li>Since I use the mirror primarily for shaving I soon discovered I could only see my face&lt;</li>
            <li>The 10x provides her very close vision when putting on her makeup.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quality and ease of installation.</li>
            <li>At 50 I was ready to move to these mirrors also.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient, just pull from the wall and push out of the way when your done.  </li>
            <li>like I thought I should, but I&#x27;ve been gentle with it and it is working.</li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>I have a ripped up wall now thanks to this junk.  </li>
            <li>I purchased higher quality stainless steel, round top screws that did the job without stripping.</li>
            <li>do wish they made a 5x/10x combination for times when 10x is too much, so that I may flip the mirror and have 5x instead of the normal mirror that comes with the10x.</li>
            <li>This one caught our eye because not only does it fold flat against the wall, it is easily adjustable for height!  </li>
            <li>But if it last about the same time as the previous mirror, I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied because I don&#x27;t think these were made to me in a we environment like a shower</li>
            <li>Does all she expected and is easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I find the older</li>
            <li>I love the 10x magnification for doing my makeup and the regular side for seeing the back of my head during hair styling.</li>
            <li>My older sister moved to magnified mirrors years ago.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is great with high magnification on one side and a plain mirror on the other side.</li>
            <li>I like that one side is 10x and one side is normal.</li>
            <li>I recently renovated my bathroom and installed this on the wall to the right side of my sink.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves her new mirror.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it. ..</li>
            <li>This is new review as of September 22nd, 2013.</li>
            <li>Certainly can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>Sent this back because I thought it a bit flimsy...really needs a back plate to make it secure.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this a lot in the morning when there is not a great deal of light, easier for middle-aged eyes to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>Love that the other side is a normal mirror for checking your hair in the back!  </li>
            <li>From the wall to the end of the arm measures 14.\\&quot;  I needed the extra length, but am managing pretty well.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The reason I did not like it was because more is not better in this case.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>mounting bracket was small enough to fit into the space I had, but strong enough to support the weight.  </li>
            <li>sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;It is able to slide up and down on the mount to accommodate users of different heights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One side for makeup and the other for tweezing and whatever else that calls for a super close-up view.</li>
            <li>This mirror allows me to see clearly what I am doing when working in close proximity of my eye.</li>
            <li>So far no complaints and no signs of rust</li>
            <li>so far.  </li>
            <li>I am near sighted but with my contacts in, i can&#x27;t see anything near.  </li>
            <li>nearly flush against the wall when I am not using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, sleek and really functional.</li>
            <li>Wow, now I can see, tried for years to put on eye makeup without my glasses.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;manufacturer applies stickers directly to the galss surface of the mirror which will not peel off</li>
            <li>It is really solid and really functional.</li>
            <li>process of ordering was fast and simple.  </li>
            <li>I order this mirror as I am getting older and my old make-up mirror did not magnify enough.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this mirror to replace an older, similar type mirror that I had mounted about 5 years ago in my shower.  </li>
            <li>Too much magnification, only focuses in the very center and have to be very close to achieve focus.</li>
            <li>Although this mirror is priced as if the whole mirror is  magnified at  10x, in actuality, only a tiny,tiny part of the total is focused to that magnification.  </li>
            <li>This is such an improvement over the old swing arm mirror I had in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and I also recomment using better ones with a small lip on the end to keep the anchor from slipping into the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love this, my eye sight has been getting much worse, without this</li>
            <li>What doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose at the first stage of its performance, it won&#x27;t serve any further purpose after several tries.</li>
            <li>We just moved and left the first one at our previous house.</li>
            <li>It is not a huge deal, but for the money this thing cost, I had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is the slight distortion in certain areas of the magnified side.  </li>
            <li>The arm is also not long enough.</li>
            <li>Also like that it is reversible and the other side is a normal mirror with no magnification.</li>

            <li> Makes it handy for the area I put it in.  </li>
            <li> it was very easy to put up, and I love the way it fits out of the way up against the wall!</li>
            <li> A perfect product for anyone with the need to see as a result of growing older.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Looks good and was fairly easy to install.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to adjust height for guests.</li>
            <li> I love the mirror.  </li>
            <li> my Christmas company will love it.</li>
            <li> Love my mirror...</li>
            <li> the power would make it even better for putting on make up without glasses.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> For the money there must be better choices.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but now I am used to it and am glad to have it for eye make up application.</li>
            <li> I love that you can adjust the height as needed.</li>
            <li> love it for the movement of it.  </li>
            <li> you see more than you might want to see.</li>
            <li> It is well made and my wife is a satisfied user.</li>
            <li> I love the slide bar that lets you adjust the height.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE MAGNIFIER.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought one for each of the ladies and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would be.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it swings in and out</li>
            <li> This seemed the better of many choices out there and the price was in line.  </li>
            <li> Needs to extend more.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t want a mirror that had lights (no outlet) but this mirror articulates is so many ways you can pick up the light from a window or overhead very easily.</li>
            <li> This one meets all her requirements: Great extension, easy motion, clarity, 10x AND Regular mirrors, and a classic design at a great price!</li>
            <li> Easy to install, love the arm and the way the mirror can be maneuvered.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, installation to my sheetrock bathroom wall was very easy and quick, maybe 10 minutes max with cleanup.</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews, the plastic wall anchors supplied are not the best</li>
            <li> easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> It was also quite easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy install.</li>
            <li> The mirror easily adjusts so that he can move it to practically any angle for shaving or combing his hair.  </li>
            <li> Without my glasses I can easily put on makeup using the 10X side.</li>
            <li> Our daughter said it was easy to install</li>
            <li> The adjustable arm makes it easy for any size person to see.</li>
            <li> It was easy to mount and it stays in position.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EASY TO PUT UP.  </li>
            <li> easy to install and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Though it is easy to do with a set screw on the end(closest to the mount).  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how strong it would be.</li>
            <li> The magnification was too strong for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is being used inside the wardrobe door in my camper and it works fine and solved the issue of no mirror in the bath area of the camper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the old mirror did the job great but the \\&quot;chromed\\&quot; metal started to rust relatively quickly and after 5 years, I no longer trusted it to stay on the wall.  </li>
            <li> It magnifies so huge, you may want to see some things you don&#x27;t want to see (wrinkles &amp; lines) but that is just what I want when I need to see a stray hair or the like.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t fit into the mirror.</li>
            <li> The 10x is big, but works great for eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> so i set it at the lowest level to fit me.  </li>
            <li> I could see an eye or my nose or my lips and great big caverns in my skin called pores.  </li>
            <li> I will be a great present.</li>
            <li> my bathroom mirror where it can be swung into the light or out toward me</li>
            <li> If I need to see something clearly, I need to either reposition the mirror or my face to get a good look.  </li>
            <li> The mirror quality is clean and the magnification is accurate.  </li>
            <li> The hot water from the shower softens my hair more than the shaving cream ever did</li>
            <li> It is mounted near her sink and does a great job and adjusts to any position she wants.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return it, but it came in excellent condition and was a nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, hangs easily, and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> 10x magnification is very powerful and is great for plucking and/or extreme closeup.</li>
            <li> Most of these are too much.  </li>
            <li> As expected, easy to mount and is good quality.  </li>
            <li> 10X magnification seems to work, but is probably too much magnification to useful for most purposes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would like to have looked at the mirror prior to ordering but am very happy with the unit overall.  </li>
            <li> Also a super gift for your relatives, neighbors and friends.</li>
            <li> The clarity is excellent and I like that you can adjust the height for different users or different tasks.</li>
            <li> The product was quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li> However, I, as many others, found the 10X magnification too high, despite I am farsighted and do need magnification to put on eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, hands are free to apply makeup, et al.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and practical.</li>
            <li> My friend is enjoying her new mirror</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and very quick shipment.</li>
            <li> The 10X magnification is humbling but too useful to do without.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my poor eyesight.</li>
            <li> but so far we love it.  </li>
            <li> Get an 8x, this one is way too powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and easy to install and the mirror is high quality.</li>
            <li> We really liked that it swiveled outward but also would swing inward folding flat against the wall -- out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Still looking for the right one.</li>
            <li> This one seemed to be the right choice.  </li>
            <li> It swings out to just the right place, and the height can be adjusted at the mount as well.</li>
            <li> It fits right into the space I have in the bathroom and is not in the way.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to install and so far has been durable and stayed in the wall.  </li>
            <li> My lovely wife has been looking for a nice looking, moderately priced &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; mirror for a long time.</li>
            <li> She likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough to really be useful and the swing arm moves very smoothly yet stays put when I have it where I want it.</li>
            <li> I can see every little place on my face (which might not be so good).  </li>
            <li> magnification is too much!  </li>
            <li> The Danielle 10x magnification, wall-mounted mirror was exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> I thought the magnification was too much at first</li>
            <li> so I have natural light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it and am installing it in our second bathroom in case</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that I wasn&#x27;t able to get a the mirror in brush nickle.</li>
            <li> We fell in love with it while we were there last year.  </li>
            <li> Overall my wife is pleased with this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have a tiny bathroom &amp; was looking for a 10x magnification wall mounted mirror that could be mounted in an area that is only about 2&amp;#34; wide so this mirror was perfect!  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I have wanted one for a long while.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends and I spend a long weekend at the MGM Grand who have something like this mirror in their guest suites.  </li>
            <li> large,  I mounted it to wall in guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a large 10x mountable swing arm mirror and this mirror fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror diameter is large and the arm is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Very high resolution and easily installed with basic tools.  </li>
            <li> This mirror really does magnify which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Mirror is very functional with the extendable/pivoting arm as well as some up/down adjustability.</li>
            <li> Just too much magnification.</li>
            <li> You do have to get really close to see on the 10x side</li>
            <li> Had to return this mirror because the 10x magnification was too much.  </li>
            <li> It is also very to install.</li>
            <li> Putting on make up in the morning is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> and you have to stand very close for clarity on focusing.</li>
            <li> ..LOOKS VERY GLAM.</li>
            <li> Since I use the mirror primarily for shaving I soon discovered I could only see my face&lt;</li>
            <li> The 10x provides her very close vision when putting on her makeup.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the quality and ease of installation.</li>
            <li> At 50 I was ready to move to these mirrors also.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient, just pull from the wall and push out of the way when your done.  </li>
            <li> like I thought I should, but I&#x27;ve been gentle with it and it is working.</li>
            <li> REALLY?</li>
            <li> I have a ripped up wall now thanks to this junk.  </li>
            <li> I purchased higher quality stainless steel, round top screws that did the job without stripping.</li>
            <li> do wish they made a 5x/10x combination for times when 10x is too much, so that I may flip the mirror and have 5x instead of the normal mirror that comes with the10x.</li>
            <li> This one caught our eye because not only does it fold flat against the wall, it is easily adjustable for height!  </li>
            <li> But if it last about the same time as the previous mirror, I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied because I don&#x27;t think these were made to me in a we environment like a shower</li>
            <li> Does all she expected and is easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I find the older</li>
            <li> I love the 10x magnification for doing my makeup and the regular side for seeing the back of my head during hair styling.</li>
            <li> My older sister moved to magnified mirrors years ago.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is great with high magnification on one side and a plain mirror on the other side.</li>
            <li> I like that one side is 10x and one side is normal.</li>
            <li> I recently renovated my bathroom and installed this on the wall to the right side of my sink.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves her new mirror.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. ..</li>
            <li> This is new review as of September 22nd, 2013.</li>
            <li> Certainly can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> Sent this back because I thought it a bit flimsy...really needs a back plate to make it secure.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this a lot in the morning when there is not a great deal of light, easier for middle-aged eyes to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> Love that the other side is a normal mirror for checking your hair in the back!  </li>
            <li> From the wall to the end of the arm measures 14.\\&quot;  I needed the extra length, but am managing pretty well.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The reason I did not like it was because more is not better in this case.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> mounting bracket was small enough to fit into the space I had, but strong enough to support the weight.  </li>
            <li> sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;It is able to slide up and down on the mount to accommodate users of different heights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One side for makeup and the other for tweezing and whatever else that calls for a super close-up view.</li>
            <li> This mirror allows me to see clearly what I am doing when working in close proximity of my eye.</li>
            <li> So far no complaints and no signs of rust</li>
            <li> so far.  </li>
            <li> I am near sighted but with my contacts in, i can&#x27;t see anything near.  </li>
            <li> nearly flush against the wall when I am not using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, sleek and really functional.</li>
            <li> Wow, now I can see, tried for years to put on eye makeup without my glasses.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;manufacturer applies stickers directly to the galss surface of the mirror which will not peel off</li>
            <li> It is really solid and really functional.</li>
            <li> process of ordering was fast and simple.  </li>
            <li> I order this mirror as I am getting older and my old make-up mirror did not magnify enough.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror to replace an older, similar type mirror that I had mounted about 5 years ago in my shower.  </li>
            <li> Too much magnification, only focuses in the very center and have to be very close to achieve focus.</li>
            <li> Although this mirror is priced as if the whole mirror is  magnified at  10x, in actuality, only a tiny,tiny part of the total is focused to that magnification.  </li>
            <li> This is such an improvement over the old swing arm mirror I had in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and I also recomment using better ones with a small lip on the end to keep the anchor from slipping into the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love this, my eye sight has been getting much worse, without this</li>
            <li> What doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose at the first stage of its performance, it won&#x27;t serve any further purpose after several tries.</li>
            <li> We just moved and left the first one at our previous house.</li>
            <li> It is not a huge deal, but for the money this thing cost, I had higher expectations.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the slight distortion in certain areas of the magnified side.  </li>
            <li> The arm is also not long enough.</li>
            <li> Also like that it is reversible and the other side is a normal mirror with no magnification.</li>
            <li> East to install, swings away to lie flat against the wall and adjusts easily to different heights for multiple users</li>
            <li> I was replacing one that I had previously, and did not want to have to drill new holes in my bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror to anyone that has trouble seeing up close.  </li>
            <li> It folds flat against the wall.</li>
            <li> 10X magnification is amazing (a little frightening</li>
            <li> : It is my opinion that when installing you should mount slightly lower than you think it should be since it is much easier to bend down towards it than stretch up to it.</li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been that long</li>
            <li> I just wish it hadn&#x27;t taken so long to arrive.  </li>
            <li> The 10 x is not clear at all.</li>
            <li> and no longer have razor burn or any of the other razor related problems I used to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the magnification, and unfortunately, I can see everything that shouldn&#x27;t be there!</li>
            <li> The regular side works like any other mirror.  </li>
            <li> You have to get in close and focus on just a tiny part of the entire round?  </li>
            <li> It seems to slip down to the bottom constantly.</li>
            <li> It can be adjusted up and down... folds flat against the wall when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were just a little larger.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a little smaller than one we purchased from Brookstone... and the 10x magnification takes getting used to ...</li>
            <li> If you have trouble seeing and need to shave or do any sort of facial maintenance, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> I found the mirror to be just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really usable for anything.</li>
            <li> The mirror was as expected...</li>
            <li> I am wondering if perhaps a part was missing from the package so for that reason I am only rating this as a 3 star.</li>
            <li> but they put a sticker on one side that says Danielle that will take you 50 years to take off... not a smart decision.</li>
            <li> /&gt;when dead center in front of it.</li>
            <li> so when you swing it works its way down.</li>
            <li> Once she set the vertical adjustment set she doesn&#x27;t move it up or down.  </li>
            <li> I have had other mirrors of this magnification and never imagined that this would  need to be clarified!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Made in China which sucks and the tightening bracket to hold it up doesn&#x27;t tighten down tight enough to hold a mirror there</li>
            <li> I bought and attempted to install several big box store vanity mirrors only to be appalled at the flimsy quality and subsequently return them.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> When I turned my face slightly to the side distortion from the curvature prevented me from seeing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hinge was so tight it would not move and the focal point on the 10X mirror was so close your nose almost hit the mirror.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to get my glasses out to catch those little hairs or apply make up.</li>
            <li> I did use a little heavier molly to mount however.</li>
            <li> The mounting can be placed in a narrow spot, unlike some with round mounts.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, 10x makes your face so big</li>
            <li> No more leaning over the sink; now the mirror comes to me.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get close enough to focus.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just a damaged/incomplete product or if this is the case with all of them.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to use when trying to style the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they put adhesive stickers on the glass that was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Using the swivel is how my previous one was broken (granted after 10 years)</li>
            <li> The mounting and the extended arm is useless because at its maximum tightness, it still hanging loose and falls downward by its weight force.</li>
            <li> Thin mounting bracket, not easy to work with</li>
            <li> By the time you realize this is too small of an area to cover up the hole in the wall (x4) -- you&#x27;re hosed!  </li>
            <li> with a very small viewing area.</li>
            <li> If your eyes are not as bad as mine, i would recommend 5X or 8X, but definitely some type of magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I use it to see extra-close to tough areas, ie under my nose, when shaving or trimming.  </li>
            <li> I have an eyelash that grows towards my eye and gets extremely irritating when it grows in.</li>
            <li> The associated metal screws I found to be poor quality, as the heads stripped when I used a power drill.  </li>
            <li> Beware and know what you&#x27;re buying, this is for people with POOR vision.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed because the attachment that allows it to move up and down 4 inches does not stay where I tighten it.</li>
            <li> Useless product.</li>
            <li> It works well; not too difficult to mount, but why the company supplies two and one-half inch screws for installation is beyond my comprehension.</li>
            <li> How cheesy is that?  </li>
            <li> Lousy mounting bracket.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to mount and does not tell you what drill bit size or screw size.</li>
            <li> In order not to be frustrated with this I am going to have to figure out how to fix this problem.</li>

            <li> Nice mirror. I wish it were just a little larger.</li>
            <li> I love the mirror.  My only issue with it is that it advertises that it \\&quot;extends out 17\\&quot; from the wall.\\&quot;  That is only the case if you have the mirror sideways and are looking at the end of the mirror, not the actual surface of the mirror.  From the wall to the end of the arm measures 14.\\&quot;  I needed the extra length, but am managing pretty well.</li>
            <li> very nice mirror.  large,  I mounted it to wall in guest bathroom.  easy to mount.  my Christmas company will love it.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, but magnification is too much!  Didn&#x27;t realize how strong it would be. Should have returned it</li>
            <li> 10x great for those ear hairs, etc you wont see.  wall mount works great</li>
            <li> I have a tiny bathroom &amp; was looking for a 10x magnification wall mounted mirror that could be mounted in an area that is only about 2&amp;#34; wide so this mirror was perfect!  It was packaged very well &amp; everything that was supposed to be in the box was there, &amp; only took a few minutes to mount.  I finally have a mirror that I can use to apply makeup &amp; see in without my glasses.  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife loves her new mirror. It is mounted near her sink and does a great job and adjusts to any position she wants.</li>
            <li> I order this mirror as I am getting older and my old make-up mirror did not magnify enough.  Wow!  This great.  I can see every little place on my face (which might not be so good).  I highly recommend this mirror to anyone that has trouble seeing up close.  It was also quite easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mirror although I found it too maginified for what I wanted.  (I ended up re-ordering a 5x which I like better.)&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is well built, good quality and I would recommend it if your looking for a 10x.</li>
            <li> I like that one side is 10x and one side is normal. Has a great reach and nice looking. Easy install.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror for the money. Sturdy when mounted on wall, great size and attractive. Nice finish in silver and extends from wall perfectly.</li>
            <li> The magnification was too strong for my eyes.  Unfortunately, I had to return it, but it came in excellent condition and was a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! It is sturdy and easy to install and the mirror is high quality. It folds flat against the wall. I can now put on my makeup with confidence.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror to replace an older, similar type mirror that I had mounted about 5 years ago in my shower.  I shave my head as well as my face and found shaving in the shower not only saves time but money as well since I don&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream.  The hot water from the shower softens my hair more than the shaving cream ever did and no longer have razor burn or any of the other razor related problems I used to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the old mirror did the job great but the \\&quot;chromed\\&quot; metal started to rust relatively quickly and after 5 years, I no longer trusted it to stay on the wall.  This mirror has taken its place perfectly.  So far no complaints and no signs of rust but it&#x27;s only been a couple of months.  But if it last about the same time as the previous mirror, I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied because I don&#x27;t think these were made to me in a we environment like a shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, the mirror was out of stock when I order it but when it finally shipped, it was delivered within the time frame as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter in law.  She is in love with it!</li>
            <li> This mirror really does magnify which is what I wanted. One side for makeup and the other for tweezing and whatever else that calls for a super close-up view.</li>
            <li> Love my mirror...thank you. Fast shipping...as described</li>
            <li> Mirror is very functional with the extendable/pivoting arm as well as some up/down adjustability. 10x magnification is very powerful and is great for plucking and/or extreme closeup. This is not a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Sent this back because I thought it a bit flimsy...really needs a back plate to make it secure. Still looking for the right one.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  This is the second one I purchased.  We just moved and left the first one at our previous house.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not like it was because more is not better in this case. I thought 10x the power would make it even better for putting on make up without glasses. I was wrong, 10x makes your face so big it can&#x27;t fit into the mirror.</li>
            <li> No instructions for installing.  Figured it out but wish it would have come with some suggestions for height placement.  Seems okay so far.  Really good tweezing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a large 10x mountable swing arm mirror and this mirror fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they made a 5x/10x combination for times when 10x is too much, so that I may flip the mirror and have 5x instead of the normal mirror that comes with the10x.</li>
            <li> No more leaning over the sink; now the mirror comes to me. Install correctly (into your wall&#x27;s studs) and you&#x27;ll have a nice-looking, sturdy hotel-style mirror. The 10X magnification is humbling but too useful to do without. Take a deep breath and pluck away!</li>
            <li> The Danielle 10x magnification, wall-mounted mirror was exactly what I hoped it would be.  It was a Christmas gift for my 82-year-old father, who is losing his eyesight.  The mirror easily adjusts so that he can move it to practically any angle for shaving or combing his hair.  It mounted effortlessly and is quite sturdy!</li>
            <li> Just too much magnification. It was difficult to get close enough to focus.  Simply would not work for me as a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> This is being used inside the wardrobe door in my camper and it works fine and solved the issue of no mirror in the bath area of the camper.</li>
            <li> I have a hand-held magnifying mirror for travel, but needed one for hands-free use at home.  This one seemed to be the right choice.  Looks good on the wall, and I like the fact that the height is adjustable.  What I don&#x27;t like is the slight distortion in certain areas of the magnified side.  If I need to see something clearly, I need to either reposition the mirror or my face to get a good look.  I do not have this problem with the hand-held cheepo I bought a Walmart.  It is not a huge deal, but for the money this thing cost, I had higher expectations.  Probably would not buy again and would not recommend.  For the money there must be better choices.</li>
            <li> I just love this, my eye sight has been getting much worse, without this I couldn&#x27;t see to put my make up on as nice as I like it to be.</li>
            <li> This mirror is excellent quality, installed with ease, and looks very nice in the bathroom wall near the sink.  Plus, my gorlfriend is now very happy with me for adding this feature to my bathroom!</li>
            <li> Love it. Good quality. I thought the magnification was too much at first but now I am used to it and am glad to have it for eye make up application.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mirror.  You do have to get really close to see on the 10x side but that&#x27;s good for putting on make-up.  I find the older I get the more magnification I need!  My husband had no problems putting it up.  The arm swings so you can angle however you need to.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my poor eyesight. Without my glasses I can easily put on makeup using the 10X side. I mounted it at a window so I have natural light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Useless product. On magnification view you can&#x27;t see nothing but blurred pig face. The mounting and the extended arm is useless because at its maximum tightness, it still hanging loose and falls downward by its weight force. Retuned it without giving the second chance or thought. What doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose at the first stage of its performance, it won&#x27;t serve any further purpose after several tries. Defective by default workmanship.</li>
            <li> Great and worked as stated</li>
            <li> Looks good and was fairly easy to install. 10X magnification seems to work, but is probably too much magnification to useful for most purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint, tape it together with masking/blue painters tape so that the mirror doesn&#x27;t swing around when you are trying to screw it into the wall!</li>
            <li> excellant mirror can see good even without my glasses</li>
            <li> Used one in Las Vegas hotel. My wife had to have one. Very happy with it.Would and will recommend if asked.</li>
            <li> This was a gift we sent to our daughter. However, we inspected it and we were very pleased with the quality and design of the Mirror. Our daughter said it was easy to install and it was just what she wanted. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it.  It&#x27;s well made, hangs easily, and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for the space and good quality over all.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble seeing and need to shave or do any sort of facial maintenance, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Nice but they put a sticker on one side that says Danielle that will take you 50 years to take off... not a smart decision.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for putting on her make-up without having to lean over the vanity.  Installation was a snap wth all mounting hardware included.  Works great with the magnification.  My wife loves it and that makes me a happy man.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is such an improvement over the old swing arm mirror I had in my bathroom.  It magnifies so huge, you may want to see some things you don&#x27;t want to see (wrinkles &amp; lines) but that is just what I want when I need to see a stray hair or the like.  It is large enough to really be useful and the swing arm moves very smoothly yet stays put when I have it where I want it.</li>
            <li> Too big for my application. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Just wish I had one earlier in life....</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for styling my hair. Didn&#x27;t think I would use the magnifier side, but I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I ever did without this. The 10x is big, but works great for eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> I am near sighted but with my contacts in, i can&#x27;t see anything near.  I could not put on my eyeliner without this magnifying mirror.  I love it and am installing it in our second bathroom in case i have to use that one, too.  10X might be too strong for some people, though it is perfect for me.  If your eyes are not as bad as mine, i would recommend 5X or 8X, but definitely some type of magnifying mirror.  I also like that the height is adjustable.  I am very short so i set it at the lowest level to fit me.  But i can move it up for those taller then me.</li>
            <li> Had to return this mirror because the 10x magnification was too much.  I could see an eye or my nose or my lips and great big caverns in my skin called pores.  I also realized I did not have a place to mount it; so went with the tabletop mirror with 5x magnification.  I am giving 3x magnifying mirror to my granddaughter for Christmas.  I will be a great present.</li>
            <li> It works well; not too difficult to mount, but why the company supplies two and one-half inch screws for installation is beyond my comprehension. I had to get some smaller screws for drywall. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what my wife wanted.  Does all she expected and is easy to adjust.  It is also very to install.</li>
            <li> While on vacation at a very nice hotel my husband and I noticed the Magnification Mirror used.  We really liked that it swiveled outward but also would swing inward folding flat against the wall -- out of the way.  When we returned home we started looking for a similar model.  This one caught our eye because not only does it fold flat against the wall, it is easily adjustable for height!  I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; while my husband is 6&#x27;.  This mirror meets our needs and I would highly recommend this one.  It&#x27;s just what we wanted -- and more!</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews before ordering. I found the mirror to be just as I expected. The 10 X magnification works great. It is very sturdy and the reach on the arm is perfect. I love that you can adjust the height as needed. For those that cannot see close up without glasses anymore, this is the perfect mirror for you. Putting on make up in the morning is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror; great quality; adjustable and attractive.</li>
            <li> I installed this in our bathroom for my wife to use.  She likes it very much.  10X magnification is amazing (a little frightening sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;It is able to slide up and down on the mount to accommodate users of different heights.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in other reviews, the plastic wall anchors supplied are not the best and I also recomment using better ones with a small lip on the end to keep the anchor from slipping into the hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product- very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mirror! I only wish I had ordered it sooner!  Installation was simple.  I would recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Made in China which sucks and the tightening bracket to hold it up doesn&#x27;t tighten down tight enough to hold a mirror there so when you swing it works its way down.</li>
            <li> the hinge was so tight it would not move and the focal point on the 10X mirror was so close your nose almost hit the mirror.</li>
            <li> RETURNING IT TODAY  CHINESE JUNK</li>
            <li> Thin mounting bracket, not easy to work with and you have to stand very close for clarity on focusing.</li>
            <li> I recently renovated my bathroom and installed this on the wall to the right side of my sink.  It is perfect to see exactly what you are doing to apply makeup, insert contacts, etc.  and it tucks away nearly flush against the wall when I am not using it.</li>
            <li> I bought and attempted to install several big box store vanity mirrors only to be appalled at the flimsy quality and subsequently return them. This mirror is solidly built and it&#x27;s magnification allows for ease in grooming especially for a visually challenged person.</li>
            <li> A perfect product for anyone with the need to see as a result of growing older. My wife loves it as she now doesn&#x27;t have to sit on the bathroom sink to apply her make up.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I have wanted one for a long while. My only issue is What the heck was I thinking with a 10X magnification!! But that is my problem, not yours! Works great, mounted easily. It&#x27;s all good, good, good!</li>
            <li> Great Mira great purchase</li>
            <li> Well ladies if you want a great 10x magnificent makeup mirror and for tweezing your eyebrows this is it.  love it for the movement of it.  It can be adjusted up and down... folds flat against the wall when not in use.  Can&#x27;t live without it. ..</li>
            <li> This mirror works perfect for me. I have an eyelash that grows towards my eye and gets extremely irritating when it grows in. The only choice I have is to pull it with tweezers. This mirror allows me to see clearly what I am doing when working in close proximity of my eye. I have it mounted to the side om my bathroom mirror where it can be swung into the light or out toward me so I don&#x27;t have to stretch over the counter too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is my opinion that when installing you should mount slightly lower than you think it should be since it is much easier to bend down towards it than stretch up to it. If you expect to use it over the bathroom counter for example, know that you will have to bend over which will lower your point of view.</li>
            <li> I can put make up on without my glasses-  Works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, sleek and really functional. The mounting can be placed in a narrow spot, unlike some with round mounts. It swings out to just the right place, and the height can be adjusted at the mount as well. I didn&#x27;t install it (my contractor did) so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but it&#x27;s just a great mirror.</li>
            <li> I just bought this mirror for my husband for Christmas so it hasn&#x27;t been that long but so far we love it.  It looks good and works well.</li>
            <li> I should have looked for a 5x instead of this one which is a 10x. The 10 x is not clear at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good quality.  Awkward to mount and does not tell you what drill bit size or screw size.</li>
            <li> Works great! Hangs nicely next to my bathroom mirror. Love the magnification, and unfortunately, I can see everything that shouldn&#x27;t be there! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered, hands are free to apply makeup, et al.</li>
            <li> The magnification seems a bit off---flimsy frame--wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item</li>
            <li> Fab. Now I can see ALL my wrinkles!!!!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for my aging eyes. It works perfectly too, although I did use better screws than the ones included in the order.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT 2 ,I LIKED THEM SO MUCH.GOOD QUALITY .GREAT PRICE.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE.EASY TO INSTALL..LOOKS VERY GLAM.</li>
            <li> East to install, swings away to lie flat against the wall and adjusts easily to different heights for multiple users</li>
            <li> Great for the bath. Don&#x27;t have to get my glasses out to catch those little hairs or apply make up.</li>
            <li> Beautiful ! Nice to be able to adjust height for guests.</li>
            <li> Wow, now I can see, tried for years to put on eye makeup without my glasses. Now I can see.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a little smaller than one we purchased from Brookstone... and the 10x magnification takes getting used to ... you see more than you might want to see. It is well made and my wife is a satisfied user.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.Looks great and I like the ability to make adjustments so my wife and I can use it. The only issue I have is that I wasn&#x27;t able to get a the mirror in brush nickle.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on make-up.  I love the slide bar that lets you adjust the height.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Danielle 10X Mirror is wonderful!!! It looks great in my bathroom too!!!  The adjustable arm makes it easy for any size person to see.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification, only focuses in the very center and have to be very close to achieve focus. Not really usable for anything.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It was easy to mount and it stays in position.</li>
            <li> It mounted great to the wall. I love the 10x magnification for doing my makeup and the regular side for seeing the back of my head during hair styling. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchased mirror to assist my aging eyes with my daily mens shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a similiar wall-mount mirror I decided to purchase&lt;br /&gt;this model. I decided to purchase the 10x model, which I later regretted.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the magnification of the mirrow I used before to be 5 - 6 x which was perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the curvature of the glass to achieve the 10x maginification results in a&lt;br /&gt;mirror with a very small viewing area. Since I use the mirror primarily for shaving I soon discovered I could only see my face&lt;br /&gt;when dead center in front of it. When I turned my face slightly to the side distortion from the curvature prevented me from seeing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, men, if you intend to use it for shaving your entire face, this is not the model for you.&lt;br /&gt;Get a lower magification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Easy installation&lt;br /&gt;Nice chrome Finish&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy design&lt;br /&gt;Good included fasteners&lt;br /&gt;Packaged sturdily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;manufacturer applies stickers directly to the galss surface of the mirror which will not peel off, I had to use a razor and scrap them off&lt;br /&gt;10x magnifcation will not allow you to see sides of your face - big negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, by the time I realized the 10x magnification was an isse I had already mounted it and thrown away the box.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it would have gone back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, installation to my sheetrock bathroom wall was very easy and quick, maybe 10 minutes max with cleanup.</li>
            <li> I was replacing one that I had previously, and did not want to have to drill new holes in my bathroom wall.  I did accomplish that.  However, I, as many others, found the 10X magnification too high, despite I am farsighted and do need magnification to put on eye make-up. Also it is a good idea to turn the mirror by flipping it.  Using the swivel is how my previous one was broken (granted after 10 years)</li>
            <li> Very pretty and practical. It is really solid and really functional.</li>
            <li> My wife lives it....easy to install</li>
            <li> The mirror was as expected...mounting bracket was small enough to fit into the space I had, but strong enough to support the weight.  Regarding the mounting kit, would suggest using alternative plastic anchors for drywall, as the ones that come with it simply spin and do not expand when tightening the screws.  Ended up intentionally pushing on through the wall and using the type with a lip.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.... I LOVE THE MAGNIFIER. IT&#x27;S EASY TO PUT UP.  I AM ORDERING SEVERAL FOR XMAS PRESENTS.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends and I spend a long weekend at the MGM Grand who have something like this mirror in their guest suites.  We fell in love with it while we were there last year.  Upon my arrival home. I researched and ordered this for my home.  Everyone here just loves it!  We&#x27;ve bought one for each of the ladies and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> easy to install and easy to use. Enjoy this a lot in the morning when there is not a great deal of light, easier for middle-aged eyes to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> As expected, easy to mount and is good quality.  Excellent magnification for makeup and eyebrows.  Love that the other side is a normal mirror for checking your hair in the back!  Keeps my posture tall by not sitting in front of a mirror and hunching over. Very handy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> looks and works great</li>
            <li> Great, but the 10x was way too strong, had to return.</li>
            <li> Good value. Overall my wife is pleased with this makeup mirror.  The 10x provides her very close vision when putting on her makeup.  The regular side works like any other mirror.  Once she set the vertical adjustment set she doesn&#x27;t move it up or down.  Though it is easy to do with a set screw on the end(closest to the mount).  Finish looks good though we&#x27;ll see how it holds up in a steamy bathroom.  This item comes with plastic anchors to put into sheetrock, if needed.  I anchored mine into the wooden medicine cabinet frame. The associated metal screws I found to be poor quality, as the heads stripped when I used a power drill.  I did predrill the holes but the heads still rounded out.  I purchased higher quality stainless steel, round top screws that did the job without stripping. The extending arms have not bent and appears to be well constructed and maneuverable. As a guy, I use it to see extra-close to tough areas, ie under my nose, when shaving or trimming.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed because the attachment that allows it to move up and down 4 inches does not stay where I tighten it. It seems to slip down to the bottom constantly. I am wondering if perhaps a part was missing from the package so for that reason I am only rating this as a 3 star. However, the mirror itself and the workmanship are sturdy enough everywhere else. In order not to be frustrated with this I am going to have to figure out how to fix this problem. I am hoping I can. By the way, this product is made in China and distributed through a Canadian company called Danielle LTD, which is a subsidiary of a Canadian soap company. Just FYI, buyer beware about all of this. If I had read any reviews about the height adjustment not working properly I never would have purchased this. Not sure if this is just a damaged/incomplete product or if this is the case with all of them. Just think everyone should know about this before purchasing. This is new review as of September 22nd, 2013. I received this item about 3 days ago and installed it two days ago.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I ordered. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Secured nicely to the wall.</li>
            <li> Great mirror in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very high resolution and easily installed with basic tools.  Would like to have looked at the mirror prior to ordering but am very happy with the unit overall.  Thanks for the quality and ease of installation.</li>
            <li> This works perfect if your eyes no longer do!  I installed mine on a bathroom cabinet, so I can see the beck of my hair for styling!</li>
            <li> My older sister moved to magnified mirrors years ago.  At 50 I was ready to move to these mirrors also.  Just started wearing contacts and this mirror is wonderful for putting in and taking out, also a must have for applying eye makeup.  Very convenient, just pull from the wall and push out of the way when your done.  Certainly can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would be.  Mirror is a great size.  It was easy to install and so far has been durable and stayed in the wall.  Couldn&#x27;t quite get it secured to the wall like I thought I should, but I&#x27;ve been gentle with it and it is working.</li>
            <li> The mirror is great with high magnification on one side and a plain mirror on the other side. My wife loves it but I would have preferred a lower magnification for shaving.</li>
            <li> This is well made and seems durable enough.  What can you say about a mirror?  It works.  I did use a little heavier molly to mount however.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, everyone should have this mirror in every bathroom. Also a super gift for your relatives, neighbors and friends.</li>
            <li> If you need magnification this is the mirror for you.  You do need to get close to the mirror to see but it does magnify.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and very quick shipment. We didn&#x27;t want a mirror that had lights (no outlet) but this mirror articulates is so many ways you can pick up the light from a window or overhead very easily. Folds along the wall and is a great addition to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife has been looking for a nice looking, moderately priced &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; mirror for a long time. This one meets all her requirements: Great extension, easy motion, clarity, 10x AND Regular mirrors, and a classic design at a great price! What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> 1. Love the way it swings in and out easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. Magnification very good. 10x is very effective for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;3. Excellent quality construction.&lt;br /&gt;4. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year now and it has not tarnished and the extension arm still works great.  The magnification is the perfect amount.  Most of these are too much.  Also like that it is reversible and the other side is a normal mirror with no magnification.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, love the arm and the way the mirror can be maneuvered.  My only complaint is that they put adhesive stickers on the glass that was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It&#x27;s a great way to see the details of putting on makeup or working with contact lenses. The clarity is excellent and I like that you can adjust the height for different users or different tasks.</li>
            <li> The mirror is exactly what I wanted.  It fits right into the space I have in the bathroom and is not in the way.  I just pull it out to use it and with the two sides it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of ordering was fast and simple.  The product was quickly delivered.  The mounting was also very simple.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had a mirror similar in a hotel in Key West and we had to have one.  This seemed the better of many choices out there and the price was in line.  Do yourself a favor and get the X10 magnification side like we did.</li>
            <li> Although this mirror is priced as if the whole mirror is  magnified at  10x, in actuality, only a tiny,tiny part of the total is focused to that magnification.  REALLY? You have to get in close and focus on just a tiny part of the entire round?  How cheesy is that?  I have had other mirrors of this magnification and never imagined that this would  need to be clarified! What a possibility! Shame on you!  Do not order this mirror. IT IS A RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> Well made, just like in the pictures. All installation screws provided.</li>
            <li> Excellent products. I wish the arm of the mirror was longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect magnification for makeup. Needs to extend more. A bit difficult to use when trying to style the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for one I had to return.  I love it.  I just wish it hadn&#x27;t taken so long to arrive.  The mirror diameter is large and the arm is adjustable.  Makes it handy for the area I put it in.  I know I can adjust it in the future if I need to.  The mirror quality is clean and the magnification is accurate.  Great for people like me who wear glasses to read and have problems putting eye makeup on without them.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful just like when you go to the motels.  Wished I had gotten it sooner.</li>
            <li> it was very easy to put up, and I love the way it fits out of the way up against the wall!</li>
            <li> Great for up close and make up application. East to install. Folds away for space saving. My friend is enjoying her new mirror</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a makeup mirror, this is not the one you want.  Get an 8x, this one is way too powerful.  The arm is also not long enough. Beware and know what you&#x27;re buying, this is for people with POOR vision.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Lousy mounting bracket.  Basically the mounting bracket has 1/8&amp;#34; from the edge of the hole to the edge of the mounting plate.  By the time you realize this is too small of an area to cover up the hole in the wall (x4) -- you&#x27;re hosed!  I have a ripped up wall now thanks to this junk.  Don&#x27;t Buy !!!!!!!!!!</li>
