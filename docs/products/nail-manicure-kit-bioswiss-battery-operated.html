            <li> I am returning due to defect.</li>
            <li> It is simply not worth 10 bucks or even 5...</li>
            <li> Certainly, my worst such experience.&lt;br /&gt;Storage pouch, a really cheap fabric, won&#x27;t hold tool body plus small box of grinding heads</li>
            <li> Did not like this product because it was too small for my wife to use for nails.</li>
            <li> I was never able to use it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Bad design.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice unit, works well.</li>
            <li> The manicure kit is okay.  I have an older one from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s that I like infinitely better.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find where Dr. Scholl&#x27;s makes the product any more.  The Bioswiss kit requires constant pressure on the on button for operations and only has 1 speed.  My Dr. Scholl&#x27;s has a dial for multiple speeds in both directions and stays on.  The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is much more heavy duty, too.  My only reason for purchasing a new one was that one of the attachments (of course, the one I use the most) broke.</li>
            <li> horrible...not worth the $ or trouble to send it back</li>
            <li> Did not like this product because it was too small for my wife to use for nails. It is not what we were expecting. We sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> It took getting use to because it is a lot faster then my old one. It works great the only problem I have is you have to hold down the on button to make it work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item but do not like it.  Not the power I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> After struggling for more than an hour to close the unit after inserting batteries, I gave up. The problem - an almost nonexistant extension and slot in which it was supposed to go and an apparently super tough battery spring. Bad design.&lt;br /&gt;Think I gave up too soon? Seriously? One should not have to struggle with something like this, period. Realistically, this went beyond a reasonable effort. Certainly, my worst such experience.&lt;br /&gt;Storage pouch, a really cheap fabric, won&#x27;t hold tool body plus small box of grinding heads so what good is that?&lt;br /&gt;The one star is for the easy-to-open blister pack.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered another brand.</li>
            <li> sort of rickety but does ok, should have paid more for a better quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who has acrylic nails. She loves it. She can maintain her nails in between fills.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. The file head came out everytime it started to spin.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to file anything.</li>
            <li> This makes doing a pedicure an easy job. The variety of tips are easy to change and are very useful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it looked as if it was the same one I was trying to replace that lasted 10 years.... This one is light weight plastic. I opened and it is very cheap. When I put batteries in it - it would not stay together. This has a very specific way to open just as my old one but this one would not stay together. I was never able to use it.  If I could rate lower than a one star - I would. It is simply not worth 10 bucks or even 5... I am returning due to defect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool. I got it to try &amp; retrain my toe nails because of ingrown nails. Works just fine. I picked mine up at Big Lots though for only $6.00 !!!</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the tips would lock into place somehow.</li>
            <li> This product has more uses than you can imagine....Not only for nails.  This is great for trimming things and the buffer is great too...</li>
            <li> Easy to use, a 5 yo can figure it out. Highly recommend it. I have 3 other ones which cost quite a bit more and they are now in the trash can.</li>
            <li> Good product for my purpose.</li>
            <li> This nail manicure kit is easy to use and saves me money and keeps my nails smooth w/o damage, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool to use on acrylic nails. Smooths out edges so you can prolong a fill in at nail salon.</li>
