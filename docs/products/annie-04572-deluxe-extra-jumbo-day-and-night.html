            <li>its perfect for my long box braids!</li>

            <li>This is certainly a jumbo bonet!!!</li>
            <li>Super huge!</li>
            <li>This is LARGE works great for my curlers but to large to wear without</li>
            <li>, I know a lot of people said it was huge, which it is, but that&#x27;s what I like about it.</li>
            <li>This thing is huge.  </li>
            <li>but I wont...ridiculously huge.</li>
            <li>This thing is ridiculously huge.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge</li>
            <li>This bonnet is huge.  </li>
            <li>You could see it is not made out of cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing box braids, Marley twists &amp; I needed a bonnet that could fit them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s secure</li>
            <li>good for big hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>If you need a LARGE bonnet this is the one for you!!</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be good for a wig or local updo, but I rarely style my hair that way</li>
            <li>that being said be aware it is huge.</li>
            <li>It was a nice size cap but way bigger than what I was looking for to keep my locs wrapped up at night.</li>
            <li>It was MUCH bigger than i expected,  which is perfect</li>
            <li>I love it, big and comfortable, and it looks pretty fashionable.</li>
            <li>Cap is very large.</li>
            <li>Very large and will cover rollers while sleeping</li>
            <li>Stretchy headband, satin, large enough for people with braids, hair rollers, or nice updos.</li>
            <li>I plan to order a couple more for future use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than most bonnets.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I purchased this cap to sleep in, but it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>This Cap makes me Hot.</li>
            <li>many of us have enough hair for this bonnet, but I like it anyway.  </li>
            <li>I might buy more in different colors.</li>
            <li>It is good for a person with long dreads are really think natural hair (AA).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Size is perfect for long hair or really thick hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this might have been good for long braids or similar styles.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to wear over  large rollers and flexi rods.</li>
            <li>This cap is huge, picture doesnt show quite how big this is.</li>
            <li>My twist out is just shoulder length, so my hair is too much for the regular size cap, hopefully my hair will grow into this one comfortably.</li>
            <li>I found the elastic to be very restricting around my head.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this</li>
            <li>So I enjoy the extra room</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered this and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t skimp out on this cap, it&#x27;s made of High quality fabric!</li>
            <li>This cap is very well made.</li>
            <li>Snatches your edges too much.</li>
            <li>However, I am sure I will get plenty of use out of it down the road when I am full blown natural with length.</li>
            <li>The elastic band is not too tight around the head at first, and it should loosen even more with time.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The quality seems decent for the price</li>
            <li>As many other reviews have shared, this Deluxe Extra Jumbo Hair Bonnet is rather tight around the hairline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a few more of these to have on hand.</li>
            <li>I have a head full of long locs, and this is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Once I get a few wears out of it, I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see myself buy more of these in different colors in the very near future!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HUGE and the elastic is tight.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, but stays on tight, and has a lot of room.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and the band is not too tight around my head.</li>
            <li>I cut the elastic band and sewed on a little extra material to make it more manageable for myself.</li>
            <li>Whenever I do my twist-outs or have my hair in perm rods, this is really the only thing that fits.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS CAP FOR TRANSITIONING FROM RELAXED TO NATURAL HAIR 1YR &amp; 4MONTHS TODAY.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the cap because it is to big and</li>
            <li>I understand that it is meant to be &#x27;extra jumbo&#x27; but it really is like a novelty night cap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>This needs to be fixed to make this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It has an inner lining that really protects the hair.</li>
            <li>But I guess it being tight is a good thing as I read plenty other bonnets slip off in the middle of the night smh</li>
            <li>Finally something for my super long locs, my baby pulls my hair constantly..</li>
            <li>Best suited for those with long thick dreads or long thick hair</li>
            <li>and I can barely keep it on my head.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and needed a larger size.  </li>
            <li>This cap double lined, and on the inside it has soft satin to protect your hair.</li>
            <li>The band is elastic and fits really snug around your head, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off during the night.</li>
            <li>I like it because the normal &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; bonnets do not hang long enough, so my hair gets bunched up inside.  </li>
            <li>It gets a little hot</li>
            <li>But honestly I would not be leaving a negative review if it had not been for the raw elastic band they use on this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think other normal size heads would have this issue</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Finally something for my super long locs, my baby pulls my hair constantly..</li>
            <li> Best suited for those with long thick dreads or long thick hair</li>
            <li> and I can barely keep it on my head.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and needed a larger size.  </li>
            <li> This cap double lined, and on the inside it has soft satin to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> The band is elastic and fits really snug around your head, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off during the night.</li>
            <li> I like it because the normal &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; bonnets do not hang long enough, so my hair gets bunched up inside.  </li>
            <li> It gets a little hot</li>
            <li> But honestly I would not be leaving a negative review if it had not been for the raw elastic band they use on this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think other normal size heads would have this issue</li>
            <li> It is very large, but with thick hair, the smaller versions did not stay on my head at night.  </li>
            <li> The band is a little tight right now</li>
            <li> I HAVE ONE SMALL ISSUE BUT NOT SERIOUS</li>
            <li> It is tight at first, but it gives after a few wears.</li>
            <li> The Bonnet itself is made with two layers of polyester blended material, so it is not completely satin through and through.</li>
            <li> I have long locs</li>
            <li> I have long locs and really wanted to like this cap, however, I found the material to be too thick for my use.</li>
            <li> , my two complaints however is that the band is extremely tight, after a few days it did start to loosen up, but then it loosened up too much</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the same that everyone else on here has which is how tight the elastic band is around the head.</li>
            <li> You do look a bit crazy with such a huge cap on but as long as it keep my hair protected I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Definitely large enough for my long thick locs but too tight &amp; gives me headache</li>
            <li> The elastic band is a little tight, but I know it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the elastic band is tight around the edges of your hairline and this can create problems like baldness</li>
            <li> The elastic around the edge was initially too tight for my head.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the elastic band is a bit tight.</li>
            <li> It has a rough cotton textured band.  </li>
            <li> It is not waterproof, nor would I recommend using this with wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> Your pillows will become wet.</li>
            <li> but just stretch it over something big for a few days.</li>
            <li> Item as expected, I like them</li>
            <li> Too much pulling on such a delicate part of your hair is not good.</li>
            <li> Extremely tight around the hair line and ears may need some head ache medicine if wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the same satin-like material that bonnets usually have, but it is double lined, so it is a bit stiff.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I feel like if defeats the purpose of using a night cap when you have this rough elastic band snatching out your edges!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too tight and rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I finally found a bonnet big enough to actually hold all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Good grief!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loose that I&#x27;m not able to wear it all without securing the excess (non)elastic band in a hair tie.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black</li>
            <li> I ordered mine in brown, the brown one is dark brown, not light brown like the picture.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too tight around my head</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews stated that it was too tight.</li>
            <li> The band is soooooo tight</li>
            <li> The band around the head was too tight and would damage the edges if I wore it</li>
            <li> but the elastic band is too tight.</li>
            <li> the band is a little  tight, but will probably loosen up over time.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll take the trade off of stuffing my hair in a little bonnet and getting lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> BUT A LITTLE STREGHTING WILL FIX THAT.</li>
            <li> Having a little problem getting it over my head after putting the rollers in</li>
            <li> OMG it nearly killed me in my sleep.</li>
            <li> I just ordered me another one in black, got my Mom one too!</li>
            <li> The band does not easily stretch and it messes up the hair when trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S VERY TIGHT AND FEELS LIKE</li>
            <li> But for me , it&#x27;s very tight around my forehead</li>
            <li> The band around the cap is a firm, hard material.</li>
            <li> I have hair that extends past my bra-strap/slightly above mid-back length; it has always been rather difficult finding bonnets that can accommodate this hair length without having to pin my hair up all across my head.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not pleased with the elastic band</li>
            <li> I have a small head.</li>
            <li> Lining is thick &amp; makes my hair sweat.</li>
            <li> It is soooo tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> band is stiff without being uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The design was poorly thought out.</li>
            <li> and I personally don&#x27;t think it looks that bad!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S CUTTING OFF YOUR CIRCULATION</li>
            <li> It is painful beyond belief.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for my do - stays on all night and band is stiff without being uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I would of loved to give it 5 stars but couldn&#x27;t because of the elastic band that holds the cap in place. The size of the cap and quality are just what I needed to keep my hair moist at night but since I do have a lot of hair and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10 with a sizable head I found the elastic to be very restricting around my head. I don&#x27;t think other normal size heads would have this issue but I am one of those people who get headaches when I put my hair up in a simple elastic. I cut the elastic band and sewed on a little extra material to make it more manageable for myself. All in all I think its still a great buy.</li>
            <li> Finally something for my super long locs, my baby pulls my hair constantly.. Keeps it out of the way. It gets a little hot but I&#x27;ll take the trade off of stuffing my hair in a little bonnet and getting lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> Size is perfect for long hair or really thick hair. Doesn&#x27;t smash/flatten hair like smaller caps. The outside is a material that can function as a shower cap too. Would be perfect 5 stars if the inner lining was silkier/a better satin.</li>
            <li> The quality of the cap seems good. It has held up to a wash in the washing machine. The cap is humongous. It is good for a person with long dreads are really think natural hair (AA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am growing out my relaxer so it is too big for me now. However, I am sure I will get plenty of use out of it down the road when I am full blown natural with length.</li>
            <li> I love this cap.  I have a lot of natural hair and it is perfect.  The head band is good.  I plan to order a couple more for future use.  Cap is very large. Great material.</li>
            <li> It has a rough cotton textured band.  This is death to the kinky hair types textures!</li>
            <li> i returned this item because it was not 100% satin.  it had a cotton lining which didn&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this, I know a lot of people said it was huge, which it is, but that&#x27;s what I like about it. Whenever I do my twist-outs or have my hair in perm rods, this is really the only thing that fits. So I enjoy the extra room, my two complaints however is that the band is extremely tight, after a few days it did start to loosen up, but then it loosened up too much and I can barely keep it on my head. I do like it, but I feel that I would have to continuously buy them to keep them on my head. I haven&#x27;t even owned this for a month and I am already struggling.</li>
            <li> This cap is huge!! good for big hairstyles. Extremely tight around the hair line and ears may need some head ache medicine if wearing for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it! Stretchy headband, satin, large enough for people with braids, hair rollers, or nice updos.</li>
            <li> It seems to be drying out my hair and it&#x27;s too tight around my head</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE NIGHT CAP ,IT PROTECTS YOUR HAIR FROM BREAKAGE AND WILL NOT COME OFF WHILE SLEEPING.  I HAVE ONE SMALL ISSUE BUT NOT SERIOUS AND IT&#x27;S THE ELASTIC BAND , IT&#x27;S VERY TIGHT AND FEELS LIKE IT&#x27;S CUTTING OFF YOUR CIRCULATION BUT A LITTLE STREGHTING WILL FIX THAT. I BOUGHT THIS CAP FOR TRANSITIONING FROM RELAXED TO NATURAL HAIR 1YR &amp; 4MONTHS TODAY. THIS WILL HOLD ALL THE HAIR IN ONCE IT GROWS OUT.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, however, after just a couple months of use the elastic no longer held its shape. It&#x27;s so loose that I&#x27;m not able to wear it all without securing the excess (non)elastic band in a hair tie. I&#x27;m so disappointed because I finally found a bonnet big enough to actually hold all of my hair.</li>
            <li> This cap is huge, picture doesnt show quite how big this is. Reminds me of a rasta cap. It works for my curly hair great as my night routine. My curls dont get smashed and they stay protected. Great buy for five bucks and change as an add-on item. Would buy again abd recommend....that being said be aware it is huge.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this and I love it. The band is a little tight right now but I am sure it will loosen up in time. I ordered the black and I personally don&#x27;t think it looks that bad! I&#x27;m going to sleep, it isn&#x27;t a night out on the town or in public! My SO personally hates when I sleep with these things on, but the pillow just doesn&#x27;t protect my hair enough, so I will have to keep wearing the bonnets to protect my hair. My twist out is just shoulder length, so my hair is too much for the regular size cap, hopefully my hair will grow into this one comfortably. I&#x27;m going to order a few more of these to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The band around the cap is a firm, hard material. The band does not easily stretch and it messes up the hair when trying to put it on. The design was poorly thought out.</li>
            <li> Great product. You could see it is not made out of cheap quality. The only issue I have is the same that everyone else on here has which is how tight the elastic band is around the head. Also, I understand why some say the elastic might rip out your edges. Too much pulling on such a delicate part of your hair is not good. Other than that I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I loved this concept until it arrived in the mail. OMG it nearly killed me in my sleep. It is soooo tight and uncomfortable. The manufacturer needs to rethink the type of elastic that is used to affix this cap to the head. It is painful beyond belief. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> A great idea for long hair, and a great buy.  Comfortable, but stays on tight, and has a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the cap because it is to big and the price was over priced I saw the same cap for $4.99</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than most bonnets.  I finally have enough room for my hair.  It&#x27;s perfect, and the fit around my head is perfect.  I have natural hair and needed a larger size.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> As many other reviews have shared, this Deluxe Extra Jumbo Hair Bonnet is rather tight around the hairline. I would disagree and say it causes headaches, but it is snug. I prefer this fit since I toss and turn in my sleep, causing great a many bonnets to come off in the night. This one won&#x27;t come off unless you actually take it off! The Deluxe size is quite ideal, especially for those who have hair any longer than their shoulders. I have hair that extends past my bra-strap/slightly above mid-back length; it has always been rather difficult finding bonnets that can accommodate this hair length without having to pin my hair up all across my head. The Bonnet itself is made with two layers of polyester blended material, so it is not completely satin through and through. It is not waterproof, nor would I recommend using this with wet or damp hair. Your pillows will become wet. The quality seems decent for the price and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase. I would have given it five stars if it was indeed Satin and/or were able to be used with semi-damp hair.</li>
            <li> It was a nice size cap but way bigger than what I was looking for to keep my locs wrapped up at night. Maybe it would be good for a wig or local updo, but I rarely style my hair that way so I returned it for a different one.</li>
            <li> Is very large just like the picture which is great.  The band that fits around your head is too big (for me).  It almost covers my eyes which causes it to fall around my face.</li>
            <li> Super huge! Only problem is the elastic band is tight around the edges of your hairline and this can create problems like baldness theres so I don&#x27;t use it often</li>
            <li> I received my bonnet yesterday, I put curlers in my hair every night, and this is the perfect bonnet. Having a little problem getting it over my head after putting the rollers in but I get my husband to help me, otherwise it is very nice.</li>
            <li> Really good size bonnet for women with a lot of hair!</li>
            <li> I love this cap. I have a head full of long locs, and this is just what I needed. Some of the reviews stated that it was too tight. It is tight at first, but it gives after a few wears. Perfect for for me. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this and really likes it.  I don&#x27;t think it was going to be that big.</li>
            <li> The band is soooooo tight I couldn&#x27;t put up with it!&lt;br /&gt;And the size is ridiculously HUGE!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my curlformers. I ordered 2!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so freaking Excited about this cap!!!! This cap double lined, and on the inside it has soft satin to protect your hair.They didn&#x27;t skimp out on this cap, it&#x27;s made of High quality fabric! The band is elastic and fits really snug around your head, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off during the night. I ordered mine in brown, the brown one is dark brown, not light brown like the picture. I purchased this cap to sleep in, but it&#x27;s so pretty, I&#x27;m going to wear it out as well! I just ordered me another one in black, got my Mom one too! I Love It!!!! I can definitely see myself buy more of these in different colors in the very near future!!! Great Buy for someone with Natural hair, Dreads, Braids, etc.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a jumbo bonet!!! IT&#x27;S HUGE! But for me , it&#x27;s very tight around my forehead and it gives me a headache. I&#x27;m only going to use this when I have my big hair and not my brains.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge.  I would compare it to a a pillow case. The band around the head was too tight and would damage the edges if I wore it but I wont...ridiculously huge.</li>
            <li> Great slumber cap for my sister locks!</li>
            <li> This thing is ridiculously huge. I understand that it is meant to be &#x27;extra jumbo&#x27; but it really is like a novelty night cap. Best suited for those with long thick dreads or long thick hair but you will still have plenty of wiggle room.</li>
            <li> this is truly a jumbo cap, my wife loves it, it keeps her hair in place without clumping it all togather.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is everything that I hoped it would be. It is the perfect size to cover a head full of braids and the material is soft and durable!</li>
            <li> It was MUCH bigger than i expected,  which is perfect</li>
            <li> It is very large, but with thick hair, the smaller versions did not stay on my head at night.  This one does.</li>
            <li> Will not purchase this product again.  It is not the same as the Satin cap you can find in any local store.  This Cap makes me Hot.</li>
            <li> This thing is big!!! But just what I needed. I have been wearing box braids, Marley twists &amp; I needed a bonnet that could fit them. If you need a LARGE bonnet this is the one for you!!</li>
            <li> I love this cap. I needed something to cover my hair (I have shoulder length dred locs) when I put them in curlers. With this cap I had plenty of space. The band fits snuggly and it does not fall off at night. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BONNET!!! It&#x27;s secure it&#x27;s huge it&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s comfy. I feel like a chef in the nap sack!</li>
            <li> This is a good bonnet if you have a lot of hair or if you&#x27;re wearing your hair in a &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; hairstyle. The elastic around the edge was initially too tight for my head. I had to stretch it out some.</li>
            <li> Definitely large enough for my long thick locs but too tight &amp; gives me headache</li>
            <li> This cap is very well made. I have long locs and really wanted to like this cap, however, I found the material to be too thick for my use.</li>
            <li> This satin cap is very roomy and great for sleeping when you have quite a bit of length to cover.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is huge.  I like it because the normal &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; bonnets do not hang long enough, so my hair gets bunched up inside.  As a result, they cause my locks to curl at the bottom.  I hate that.  This bonnet allows the hair to hang while still keeping it in place.&lt;br /&gt;It is the same satin-like material that bonnets usually have, but it is double lined, so it is a bit stiff.  The elastic band is not too tight around the head at first, and it should loosen even more with time.&lt;br /&gt;Not many of us have enough hair for this bonnet, but I like it anyway.  If you ever need to wear rollers to bed, this bonnet could accommodate them, though you would still have to stretch the elastic band over them to work that out.  Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is almost joke. Its &amp;#34;Extra Jumbo&amp;#34; alright. But honestly I would not be leaving a negative review if it had not been for the raw elastic band they use on this. I feel like if defeats the purpose of using a night cap when you have this rough elastic band snatching out your edges! Otherwise this might have been good for long braids or similar styles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to wear over  large rollers and flexi rods. This is really a super size night cap but perfect for wearing rollers to bed, maintaining curly styles, and covering longer hair without having to pin the hair up.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing box braids and I didn&#x27;t have a sleeping bonnet that was big enough to keep them protected at night. This cap does the trip and it doesn&#x27;t come off during the night. You do look a bit crazy with such a huge cap on but as long as it keep my hair protected I don&#x27;t care. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the elastic band is a bit tight. It took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This will be perfect for when I have my hair extensions in. I love it, big and comfortable, and it looks pretty fashionable. I might buy more in different colors.</li>
            <li> This is LARGE works great for my curlers but to large to wear without</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HUGE and the elastic is tight. but just stretch it over something big for a few days. i wear mine inside out because the stitching inside irritates my edges a bit. i wear it. its double lined so if ur home is on the warmer side this will definitely make u sweat.</li>
            <li> Love the size. Lining is thick &amp; makes my hair sweat.</li>
            <li> Just received my bonnet and I&#x27;m not pleased with the elastic band the goes around your head. It&#x27;s way too tight and rough. Snatches your edges too much.</li>
            <li> Item as expected, I like them</li>
            <li> Good grief!!! This thing is huge, but perfect for my braids and twists! The elastic band is a little tight, but I know it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s new. Once I get a few wears out of it, I&#x27;m sure it will loosen up. But I guess it being tight is a good thing as I read plenty other bonnets slip off in the middle of the night smh</li>
            <li> Very large and will cover rollers while sleeping but the elastic band is too tight. I have a small head. I cut two splits in the banding to make it fit better without the tension. This needs to be fixed to make this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have long locs AND I roll them up in rollers most nights so I needed a night cap that would cover a lot of hair plus big rollers. This product is the best. It is comfortable and the band is not too tight around my head. It has an inner lining that really protects the hair. If you have a lot of hair this is an awesome night cap. I&#x27;m glad I found this product because that satin scarf of mine was just not working no matter which way I tried folding it over my head!</li>
            <li> This bonnet fits all of my hair and I have been growing my locks for 8 years.  Great investment!</li>
            <li> Love it! its perfect for my long box braids!</li>
            <li> I you have a lot of hair, this is nice! doesn&#x27;t smash your hair while you sleep.  the band is a little  tight, but will probably loosen up over time.  I would recommend you try.</li>
