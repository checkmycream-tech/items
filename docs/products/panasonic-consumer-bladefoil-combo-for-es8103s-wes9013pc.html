            <li>Not as good shave as with original blades.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not going to fall in love with a maintenance item :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic ES8103S for years and have always pleased with the shaves it delivers.  </li>

            <li>I sure wish they were cheaper to replace, but otherwise to have to buy regular razor blades, and they ain&#x27;t cheap!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, very sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing electric razor for the cost however the replacement blade/foil cost too much.</li>
            <li>The blades and head were super easy to install.  </li>
            <li>exact arrived on monday love it</li>
            <li>I recommend the replacement part to bring the razor up to original working order.</li>
            <li>My original blades needed to be replaced</li>
            <li>clean often to insure a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, after using both blades for several weeks, am getting as good a shave as originals.</li>
            <li>My razor probably works better than it did when it was brand new!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, Fit razor exactly</li>
            <li>Glad not to have to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>A bit spendy but worth it.</li>
            <li>The replacement blade and foil combo arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed to refresh my sons electric razor.</li>
            <li>These blades work extremely well and my shaver works just as good as it did two years ago when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Easy fix for my razor and shave likes new again.</li>
            <li>Like I just bought a new razor, easy to install.</li>
            <li>Good to have a sharp blade again!</li>
            <li>I was concerned the foil wouldn&#x27;t attach properly, but it works just fine!</li>
            <li>Service was very fast.</li>
            <li>The 2years+ original blades are still shave well as the new set I got for X-Mas (2014).</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The price of these replacement blades is always a sting, but each time I see it&#x27;s still better than replacing the entire razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is much more quiet.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The cost is more than a third of what I paid for the shaver!  </li>
            <li>OK, but foil seems a bit thicker than original and blades not as sharp.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what he needed and shipping was much quicker than estimated despite the snow.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The foil dropped right in as well as the new blades.  </li>
            <li>My skin doctor recommended me to buy the Panasonic razor because I can use it as a wet shave and better for my skin.</li>
            <li>The refill does the job - no issues with quality and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about a shaver refill.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I shaves much closer again.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the place to get exactly the replaceable parts you need without buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I have high expectation in quality wise, however, the set I received were poor.</li>
            <li>Like a new shaver.</li>
            <li>My shaver cuts like new again.</li>
            <li>Electric razor was brand new again, I should have purchased this combo along time ago.</li>
            <li>When I put in the new blades and screen it shaves like I just bought the shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my father to replace the old one</li>
            <li>so I had to use the old foil  and</li>
            <li>It definitely give new life to my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no better than the original blades that will not give me a close shave for nothing.</li>
            <li>About the same as my one year old one.</li>
            <li>the shaver is not up to the old standard.</li>
            <li>The original screen on the Panasonic shaver lasted quite long, longer than the Remington shavers I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>The shave is much smoother and takes less time.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is VERY difficult to open but once opened all was good.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just use the new screen on the old blades, thinking that you&#x27;ll be saving a new set of blades, since you&#x27;ll sooner be cutting into the new screen by the dulled and misshapened old blades.</li>

            <li> Its already dull......</li>
            <li> But alas, the screen got little holes on it that began to nip at my face.</li>
            <li> Works at least as well as new...makes sense because it replaces the entire contact and cutting surface.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed?</li>

            <li> exact arrived on monday love it</li>
            <li> Spare parts needed for continuous use of shaver. A must to have!.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement from the two year od blade.</li>
            <li> I used for ~ 2 month. Its already dull...... I do shave once in 3 days, not need to shave every day like other. The 2years+ original blades are still shave well as the new set I got for X-Mas (2014). The replacement blades (inner &amp; out blades) are very poor quality. I have high expectation in quality wise, however, the set I received were poor. Do not buy the blades.</li>
            <li> I use this electric razor to shave my head.  It&#x27;s an amazing electric razor for the cost however the replacement blade/foil cost too much.</li>
            <li> I recommend the replacement part to bring the razor up to original working order. I do not recommend the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Easy fix for my razor and shave likes new again. A bit spendy but worth it.</li>
            <li> Good product; good price</li>
            <li> I buy new/blades foil for my husband&#x27;s Panasonic Arc 3 every year. Keeps giving him a close shave this way. It&#x27;s actually cheaper to buy the set rather than foil or blade separately.</li>
            <li> no better than the original blades that will not give me a close shave for nothing. that interceptor does give me some really good irritation though....</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace the one I lost. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Everything was easy to replace, fit perfectly and works like a charm.  Like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> excellent product and speedy delivery</li>

            <li> Arrived as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Job</li>
            <li> Good product.  It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> My shaver cuts like new again. Item was exactly as described. Service was very fast.</li>
            <li> My original blades needed to be replaced and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement part in any stores in my area.  These blades work extremely well and my shaver works just as good as it did two years ago when I bought it.  Also, I somehow ended up losing the plastic cover that goes around the blades and foil.  I was concerned the foil wouldn&#x27;t attach properly, but it works just fine!</li>
            <li> Needed to use both blades to get fairly good shave.  Expected to replace only outer blade.  Not as good shave as with original blades. Razor bought one year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using both blades for several weeks, am getting as good a shave as originals.</li>
            <li> good price~&lt;br /&gt;when i buy  Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver with this.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade and foil combo arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed to refresh my sons electric razor.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Replace 4 to 6 months. clean often to insure a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Panasonic razor for 15 years and I will not use any other razor . Gives me a close shave and is quicker than any thing else I have used. My skin doctor recommended me to buy the Panasonic razor because I can use it as a wet shave and better for my skin. Now I don&#x27;t break out with pimples!</li>
            <li> The refill does the job - no issues with quality and shipping was fast. There isn&#x27;t much to say about a shaver refill. No complaints but i&#x27;m not going to fall in love with a maintenance item :-)</li>
            <li> I have replaced my shaver blades several times now. Amazon is the place to get exactly the replaceable parts you need without buying a new shaver. The price of these replacement blades is always a sting, but each time I see it&#x27;s still better than replacing the entire razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a walk in the park to replace the blades. The packaging is TERRIBLE and takes four times as long to open as replacing the actual shaver blades. You will need heavy duty scissors and patience to this get this package open without hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Fast shipment....I bought it for my father to replace the old one and he loves it...I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The packaging is VERY difficult to open but once opened all was good.  The foil dropped right in as well as the new blades.  I was amazed at how easy it was to install. The razor is much more quiet.  The shave is much smoother and takes less time.  I&#x27;m happy with the product.  It did exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Panasonic electric razor online which had used and dull blades,I then separately bought the Blade/foil combo which restrored the action</li>
            <li> Works at least as well as new...makes sense because it replaces the entire contact and cutting surface.  Worth doing at least once.in the razor&#x27;s lifetime.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, Fit razor exactly and I have been using it for some time.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The blades and head were super easy to install.  My razor probably works better than it did when it was brand new!</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift for my brother. Was exactly what he needed and shipping was much quicker than estimated despite the snow. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Electric razor was brand new again, I should have purchased this combo along time ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good when you can get the blades and foils you need before they stop making them.  And these parts last a year or two.  The Panasonic brand sure is better than any disposable blades!</li>
            <li> This kit is a face-saver. The original screen on the Panasonic shaver lasted quite long, longer than the Remington shavers I purchased in the past. But alas, the screen got little holes on it that began to nip at my face. When I put in the new blades and screen it shaves like I just bought the shaver. Don&#x27;t just use the new screen on the old blades, thinking that you&#x27;ll be saving a new set of blades, since you&#x27;ll sooner be cutting into the new screen by the dulled and misshapened old blades. Change out both every time the screen gets worn.</li>
            <li> Works great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the blades and works well. Glad not to have to buy a new razor.Very satisfied with the replacements</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Good to have a sharp blade again!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, very sharp. I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to replace these</li>
            <li> Recycled?  About the same as my one year old one. Disappointed? You bet.</li>
            <li> I renewed my razor with this in about a year. Can&#x27;t believe the difference. I shaves much closer again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic ES8103S for years and have always pleased with the shaves it delivers.  However, the blades &amp; foil need to be replaced about once a year.  Whenever I replace them I am always amazed at the improvement in the quality of my shaves.  It definitely give new life to my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I think these parts are way overpriced.  The cost is more than a third of what I paid for the shaver!  This is the only reason i&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> blade worked great but the catch on the foil broke when i pushed it in so I had to use the old foil  and the shaver is not up to the old standard. A PS to this review, I,ve had this shaver for 4 years ans love it.</li>
            <li> OK, but foil seems a bit thicker than original and blades not as sharp. Does not do a better job than used one I replaced.</li>
            <li> Like I just bought a new razor, easy to install.</li>
