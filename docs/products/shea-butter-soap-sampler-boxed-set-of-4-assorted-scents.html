            <li> I bought these last year as Christmas gifts!  They smell great!  They are well-packaged in a clear box and the soaps inside are wrapped with beautiful colors of the season!  I gave them as a set of four and also broke up another set to give as Secret Santa gifts! I will plan ahead and order more this year, as I ran out of this fun gift last year.</li>
            <li> These little soaps are really very nice. Nicely scented but not overwhelming. Soaps up nicely when washing your hands. I had bought two and tied one package with colored raffia and gave it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate the quality because it was a gift.  But the packaging was pretty and they smelled nice, but they were smaller than I expected.  Just thought they would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I felt the description was misleading.  Just seemed each bar would be larger.  Won&#x27;t purchase again, even though the scents are nice.</li>

It leaves a lasting, pleasant scent on the skin. And all of them smell very wintry without being overbearing.  These would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The only con is that the soaps are very small squares.

            <li> Very small soaps for the price paid.  Not as fragrant as I would have liked but okay.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of all 4 of these! So Christmasy! I have only used the Peppermint Frost but I love it! It also does not dry my skin out. I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
