    <ol>
            <li>It works well though - great sunblock!</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I have found to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>I put it on under my foundation and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The best sun protection I have ever used.</li>
            <li>(I also use it at the top of my forehead at the hairline, another prime burning spot ... works there too!!!)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>happy with prodict and deliver time</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, nice size - good for being outside.&lt;br /&gt;Great protection for lips!</li>
            <li>I heard zinc is good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>So I have used just about every lip sunburn ointment on the market and most of them have not been very effective.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff ...</li>
            <li>This is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and I have tried many</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and feels good on.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and burn easily also break out from most sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s cool to look like a lifeguard muscle wise</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Better yet, there is no metallic zinc after taste</li>
            <li>With the reviews I read, I was hoping for better results.  </li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t seem to cause any adverse reaction.i did think as zinc of more of a block vs sunscreen</li>
            <li>Glad to find it at this company.</li>
            <li>Add to that that I am fair skinned and have red hair and you have huge problem!!!</li>
            <li>though I must say that I am currently giving some thought to buying some stock as their products are that good!</li>
            <li>Now it would be impolite to say that my wife more often than not ignores me, and it might make her appear immodest if I were to say that more often than not she feels that she is right</li>
            <li>so i use this product lightly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, Solar Sense Clear Zinc is far and away the best lip sunburn protection I have ever used!</li>
            <li>it comes on clear but is kind of glossy.</li>
            <li>the clear is much more available.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a few months my skin has improved remarkably.  </li>
            <li>as many wrote it so tough to apply, the texture itself good, but to put it on skin- challenge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not a bad product for blocking the sun, but it certainly is not clear!</li>
            <li>I also felt pretty greasy with it on.  </li>
            <li>Go to Walmart or target or your local drugstore forget ordering this because you will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the latter two sunscreens do not &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; after application, as Solar Sense mostly does, but I think sun protection should be the determining factor for sunscreen selection.</li>
            <li>but this is spf 70, and there are higher spf out there.</li>
            <li>everytime I go for a Beach Vacation, my nose blisters and burns to a clowny crisp</li>
            <li>However, my new dermatologist recommended two other zinc-based sunscreens which he rated as superior to Solar Sense for sun protection, specifically Vanicream and CeraVe.  </li>
            <li>Very oily and needs to be mixed better.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose that turns red very easily in the sun, this products gives me the protection I need.  </li>
            <li>I use for pool and hours long hikes so sheen is ok with me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s much easier to apply and goes on like lotion.</li>
            <li>This product works very well in keeping my nose from burning.  </li>
            <li>Several months ago my lovely wife came home from the drugstore with a product called Solar Sense Clear Zinc.</li>
            <li>other product has given me greater protection and confidence</li>
            <li>Very hard to spread on the face... good coverage though.</li>
            <li>And no, I don&#x27;t own stock in Solar Sense of have any other financial connection with them...</li>
            <li>clear zinc really works.</li>
            <li>There is nothing CLEAR about it!</li>
            <li>I take an antibiotic to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis and to say it makes me sensitive to the sun would be quite an understatement!  </li>
            <li>and Wow!</li>
            <li>Without it I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to run my boat tours this past summer.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face primarily &amp; my hands, a little on my neck &amp; ears - but this really is for face only</li>
            <li>I was looking for something like  Ocean Potion face cream, and thought I&#x27;d try this, because it says &amp;#34;Clear Zinc&amp;#34;, thinking it would be clear.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s clear, so</li>
            <li>I actually really like this product if it wasn&#x27;t such a rip off.</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive to the sun since chemotherapy treatment</li>
            <li>Product is too old and does not spread well on the face.</li>
            <li>the jar was also a lot smaller than I expected and not even full.</li>
            <li>It came fast and new as expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great - about $8-9 for 0.5 oz is too much - especially since I really only used it maybe 2-3 applications &amp; it was gone!</li>
            <li>and although it goes on white like other zinc preparations it quickly fades to invisible.</li>
            <li>My son is a red head and has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Stays on well, takes a little to rub it in, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I use this product on a daily basis instead of moisturizer now instead of rosacia I have perfectly clear skin,</li>
            <li>This product should be called Total Zinc, instead of Clear Zinc.</li>
            <li>And the package is small enough to fit in my purse for when I need it.</li>
            <li>Given that I am a professional charter boat captain who spend 8-10 hours a day in the sun for 6 months of the year this adds up to a big problem.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go on smooth AT ALL and made my skin really white, even with a thin layer and really trying to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>I barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen for my 6 year old daughter for daily facial sunscreen.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 6 year old daughter for daily facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It goes on white, like zinc oxide, not clear, like the name says.</li>
            <li> The lid and seal were all oily looking but the zinc consistency was slightly dry and sticky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and really thick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this sunscreen applies very white and the thick consistency does not blend smoothly over face.</li>
            <li> I spent two week frolicking in the sun with no burn to speak off.  </li>
            <li> The container was very small and when I opened it the actual product was even smaller.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Threw the other sunscreen products for the face away.  </li>
            <li> It does not clog my pores like other sunblocks that claim to be for oily skin.</li>
            <li> And I still have plenty left from this small tub.  </li>
            <li> The product I ordered was so dry you could hardly spreed across face.</li>
            <li> I blend with a little moisturizer to make application smoother.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how little the jar is and at how little product it contains.</li>
            <li> The package that I received, the cream looked dried out (not sure if this is always how it&#x27;s supposed to be).  </li>
            <li> Well no more ...</li>
            <li> , it made the zinc really hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> but they were discontinued (not sure why it let me order it!)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never bought into the white lips bit.  :(   </li>
            <li> Does not spread, I was tired of tugging my skin trying to spread it, so I threw it away</li>
            <li> and I am WRONG.</li>
            <li> My family suffers from skin problems.</li>

            <li> I blend with a little moisturizer to make application smoother.</li>
            <li> Very oily and needs to be mixed better.  the jar was also a lot smaller than I expected and not even full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great - about $8-9 for 0.5 oz is too much - especially since I really only used it maybe 2-3 applications &amp; it was gone! I also felt pretty greasy with it on.  It works well though - great sunblock! I tried to also order it in the stick applicator to give that a try but they were discontinued (not sure why it let me order it!) I used it on my face primarily &amp; my hands, a little on my neck &amp; ears - but this really is for face only &amp; like I said - maybe 2 applications - the 3rd time, I was scraping out of it to just put on my forehead, nose, cheekbones - used it for outdoor sports.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have found to use on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried various Nutragena products to use under my makeup but they always feel greasy.  This is nice.  I put it on under my foundation and have been very happy with the results.  Threw the other sunscreen products for the face away.  A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock. Stays on well, takes a little to rub it in, but its worth it. It does not clog my pores like other sunblocks that claim to be for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Was looking for opaque zinc sunscreen for face and wasn&#x27;t finding it.. Seems like the clear is much more available. This cream goes on opaque and then blends. I use for pool and hours long hikes so sheen is ok with me. Maybe work under make up but haven&#x27;t tried. Good product! No burns and I&#x27;ve put it to test !</li>
            <li> Here in South Florida we use A LOT of sunscreen.  This one is my favorite by far.  We can spend an entire day at the beach or out on the water and don&#x27;t have to reapply.  It&#x27;s clear and really thick.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and burn easily also break out from most sunscreen products.  After using this product for a few months my skin has improved remarkably.  I use this product on a daily basis instead of moisturizer now instead of rosacia I have perfectly clear skin, clear zinc really works.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this as a daily sunscreen before applying makeup.  Unfortunately, this sunscreen applies very white and the thick consistency does not blend smoothly over face.</li>
            <li> I take an antibiotic to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis and to say it makes me sensitive to the sun would be quite an understatement!  Given that I am a professional charter boat captain who spend 8-10 hours a day in the sun for 6 months of the year this adds up to a big problem. Add to that that I am fair skinned and have red hair and you have huge problem!!! So I have used just about every lip sunburn ointment on the market and most of them have not been very effective. Several months ago my lovely wife came home from the drugstore with a product called Solar Sense Clear Zinc. When she showed it to me I said, \\&quot;Take it back hon I can&#x27;t stand the taste of zinc sunscreens, they make my mouth taste like metal.\\&quot;  Now it would be impolite to say that my wife more often than not ignores me, and it might make her appear immodest if I were to say that more often than not she feels that she is right and I am WRONG. So, ever the devoted husband, I won&#x27;t say either of those things. I will, however, say that some weeks later after repeated urging on my wife&#x27;s part I finally did give this stuff a trial run. Drum roll please.... and Wow! does it ever work well! Better yet, there is no metallic zinc after taste and although it goes on white like other zinc preparations it quickly fades to invisible. I know it&#x27;s cool to look like a lifeguard muscle wise but I&#x27;ve never bought into the white lips bit.  :(   Anyway, Solar Sense Clear Zinc is far and away the best lip sunburn protection I have ever used! Without it I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to run my boat tours this past summer. And no, I don&#x27;t own stock in Solar Sense of have any other financial connection with them... though I must say that I am currently giving some thought to buying some stock as their products are that good!</li>
            <li> as many wrote it so tough to apply, the texture itself good, but to put it on skin- challenge.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 6 year old daughter for daily facial sunscreen. It&#x27;s nice and light and feels good on.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product if it wasn&#x27;t such a rip off. I was amazed at how little the jar is and at how little product it contains. You would probably need to buy a case of it to last one summer. I have found this problem with all of the solar sense face products in the jars.</li>
            <li> The package that I received, the cream looked dried out (not sure if this is always how it&#x27;s supposed to be).  The lid and seal were all oily looking but the zinc consistency was slightly dry and sticky, it made the zinc really hard to apply.  It didn&#x27;t go on smooth AT ALL and made my skin really white, even with a thin layer and really trying to rub it in.  With the reviews I read, I was hoping for better results.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
            <li> I should have just gone to drug store and purchased BANANA BOAT SUNSCREEN FOR FACE. The product I ordered was so dry you could hardly spreed across face. The container was very small and when I opened it the actual product was even smaller. I don&#x27;t recommend you purchase stuff. Go to Walmart or target or your local drugstore forget ordering this because you will not be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product should be called Total Zinc, instead of Clear Zinc. There is nothing CLEAR about it! It goes on white, like zinc oxide, not clear, like the name says. I was looking for something like  Ocean Potion face cream, and thought I&#x27;d try this, because it says &amp;#34;Clear Zinc&amp;#34;, thinking it would be clear.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not a bad product for blocking the sun, but it certainly is not clear! I&#x27;ll stick with the Ocean Potion face sunblock. That&#x27;s much easier to apply and goes on like lotion.</li>
            <li> Very hard to spread on the face... good coverage though.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, nice size - good for being outside.&lt;br /&gt;Great protection for lips!</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive to the sun since chemotherapy treatment&lt;br /&gt;No other product has given me greater protection and confidence</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years now.  However, my new dermatologist recommended two other zinc-based sunscreens which he rated as superior to Solar Sense for sun protection, specifically Vanicream and CeraVe.  I&#x27;ve found that the latter two sunscreens do not &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; after application, as Solar Sense mostly does, but I think sun protection should be the determining factor for sunscreen selection.</li>
            <li> The best sun protection I have ever used. It saved my face from burning on a trip to sunny Hawaii!</li>
            <li> I heard zinc is good for acne prone skin. it comes on clear but is kind of glossy. my skin is oily so i use this product lightly.</li>
            <li> I break out just thinking about makeup....this didn&#x27;t seem to cause any adverse reaction.i did think as zinc of more of a block vs sunscreen but this is spf 70, and there are higher spf out there. I like this,though, and it is my second purchase of the same item.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff ... everytime I go for a Beach Vacation, my nose blisters and burns to a clowny crisp no matter what I try! (Hats, sunscreen, shade ...)  Well no more ... this stuff is a nose saver.  I spent two week frolicking in the sun with no burn to speak off.  And it&#x27;s clear, so none of that white-nose stuff either, looking like a fool!  I am a beliver for life!  And I still have plenty left from this small tub.  I barely made a dent in it. (I also use it at the top of my forehead at the hairline, another prime burning spot ... works there too!!!)</li>
            <li> happy with prodict and deliver time</li>
            <li> Product is too old and does not spread well on the face. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is a chemical block whereas zinc is a physical block.  I use this product on my scars to prevent permanent redness.</li>
            <li> Does not spread, I was tired of tugging my skin trying to spread it, so I threw it away</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find it any where.  You have to go online to buy it. Great product.  My family suffers from skin problems.</li>
            <li> My son is a red head and has very sensitive skin. Have used this for a couple years. Glad to find it at this company. It came fast and new as expected. This is a good product and I have tried many</li>
            <li> been a fan for years&lt;br /&gt;prefer stick form as this one is too gooey</li>
            <li> This product works very well in keeping my nose from burning.  I have a very sensitive nose that turns red very easily in the sun, this products gives me the protection I need.  And the package is small enough to fit in my purse for when I need it.</li>
