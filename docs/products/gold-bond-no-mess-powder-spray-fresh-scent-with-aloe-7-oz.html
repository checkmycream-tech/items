            <li> great price --use everyday</li>
            <li> great product for the price as long a you get free shipping</li>
            <li> Use this after every shower. Keeps me dry and stops chafing. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like the spray the only thing that I found so far is button for spray can it hard to push</li>
            <li> Not sure it even works as I still sweat like crazy in my uniform, but what I do know is it gets onto EVERYTHING, just like regular inexpensive powder will - I am constantly having to wipe it off areas it transfers to (my clothes) Not a fan and will not order again</li>
            <li> So convenient when you&#x27;re changing in the handicapped stall of the Men&#x27;s Room after a ride to work and all you can do to clean up is use a baby wipe!  No mess with the canned talc.</li>
            <li> Exaclty what I wanted. Came very fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Easily replaces traditional powders and has no mess.</li>
            <li> Air conditioning in a can.</li>
            <li> A nurse in the hospital introduced this product to me. Great to keep the skin in your &amp;#34;fat folds&amp;#34; dry and free of irritation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the hot summers.  Keeps you cool and not sticky</li>
            <li> Miraculous. I always have chafing problems. Not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just not the same as the powder</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Leaves powder residue. Not great at all</li>
            <li> easy to apply during summer months</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner ... itch gone.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the even spray pattern - however the content volume is laughable. I am going to look for something else that is more cost-effective. If you are going to use this one, buy a dozen at a time - you will need them.</li>
            <li> Works great, prevents swamp-crotch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spray on your anus.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.</li>
