            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with olive oil and makes my skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Hydrates , smells amazing and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>this is the absolute best lotion I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>when I can splurge, this is at the top of my (and her) list.</li>
            <li>The  smell is lovely and it is not sticky.</li>

            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Somewhere sunny and warm and fun.  </li>
            <li>A FABULOUS BODY LOTION.</li>
            <li>It does not have the nice strong scent of orange that my old one has.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, love the soft smell.</li>
            <li>I loved it and just had to get a big bottle!  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I stocked up on a couple of bottles while I was at the hotel since they offered an amazing deal on it ($5.95 for the 8.7 oz bottle), but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more when I run out of my current supply!</li>
            <li>First, I bought this lotion for my wife and not myself.        </li>
            <li>Since it also contains an extract of Sicilian Red Oranges, it smells fantastic, too!  </li>
            <li>Smells and feels great, but the  scent doesn&#x27;t  last  too  long</li>
            <li>It brings back precious memories of discovering blood oranges in Spain.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this product being given to customers at a motel/hotel in New Jetsey.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough to buy it, has a nice moisterizing feel, but a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>They contain the scent of \\&quot;blood oranges\\&quot; and the scent was refreshing and the shampoo, soap and lotion left my hair and skin respectively, feeling clean and shiny and the soap and lotion left my body feeling soft and moisturized, yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any skin type</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone.  </li>
            <li>This product is a favorite of my wife and is one of the few fragrances that I don&#x27;t find overpowering.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have a particularly sensitive nose, and many lotions and moisturizers are so chemical smelling that I have to roll down the car windows when we go anywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It IS expensive... but comparable to other great (non-chemical smelling) lotions like L&#x27;occitane.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it works fine for my dry hands too, although it&#x27;s a little pricey for ME to use!        </li>
            <li>It has a not so faint smell of orange peel, combined with a light fragrance that smells subtly feminine, but not so over the top that you couldn&#x27;t put it on your kids.  </li>

            <li> When I rub some of it into my wife&#x27;s neck or arms, it has a glide to it that stays with you, making your skin feel silky, but not even a little bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> While on vacation, the hotel I stayed in had small bottles of this in our room.  </li>
            <li> This was my only disappointment with the Spa Size of this product.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for my budget, but will always put money a side to buy it!</li>

            <li> First, I bought this lotion for my wife and not myself.

This lotion, on the other hand, smells like like a California orange grove, or a day in Tuscany, or Christmas morning...  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not much of a poet, but it takes you somewhere else.  Somewhere sunny and warm and fun.  It has a not so faint smell of orange peel, combined with a light fragrance that smells subtly feminine, but not so over the top that you couldn&#x27;t put it on your kids.  In fact, it works fine for my dry hands too, although it&#x27;s a little pricey for ME to use!        When I rub some of it into my wife&#x27;s neck or arms, it has a glide to it that stays with you, making your skin feel silky, but not even a little bit greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for massage, since the glidy feeling only lasts a few seconds, but the olive oil in it keeps your skin silky for hours.      Some reviews have mentioned the cost.  It IS expensive... but comparable to other great (non-chemical smelling) lotions like L&#x27;occitane.  I wish she could use only those two, but in Colorado, skin gets dry in a hurry.  I can&#x27;t get her the best ALL the time, but when I can splurge, this is at the top of my (and her) list.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this lotion during a recent stay at the Palace Station Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.  I *love* it!  It&#x27;s made with olive oil and makes my skin feel amazing.  Since it also contains an extract of Sicilian Red Oranges, it smells fantastic, too!  I stocked up on a couple of bottles while I was at the hotel since they offered an amazing deal on it ($5.95 for the 8.7 oz bottle), but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more when I run out of my current supply!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Cali Tarocco Orange Spa Size Nourishing Hand &amp; Body Moisturizer after using it in a Spa and Resort in Illinois.  All of the samples in the room (shampoo, soaps, lotions, etc.) were from the Tarocco Orange line.  They contain the scent of \\&quot;blood oranges\\&quot; and the scent was refreshing and the shampoo, soap and lotion left my hair and skin respectively, feeling clean and shiny and the soap and lotion left my body feeling soft and moisturized, yet not greasy.  I would have given this 5 stars except the samples of the Hand &amp; body Lotion at the Resort just seemed to be a bit less watery.  This was my only disappointment with the Spa Size of this product.</li>
            <li> lotion was great but lacked the scent of smallerbottles</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, love the soft smell. A little expensive for my budget, but will always put money a side to buy it!</li>

            <li> I was given this product by one of the hotels my husband and I stayed in.  I was very impressed with the product, thus the order for two 22.5 oz.</li>
            <li> For the price it is not what I remembered.  It does not have the nice strong scent of orange that my old one has.</li>
