            <li>Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li>I used to buy a nail whitening kit from perfect 10 called white now nails, and it was amazing, but it got discontinued.</li>
            <li>This polish really makes your nails look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it, I also didn&#x27;t like using polish remover more than once a week either.  </li>
            <li>Product is OK ...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>This is a great product it goes on smoothly and does make your nail tips look whiter and the nail beds a beautiful pink.</li>
            <li>It had an amazing top coat with a violet tint that really brightened up my nails, and I have been searching for one like it ever since!!</li>
            <li>It can be used all alone to have nails look healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>And a great top coat for a French Manicure.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed a light blue-ish tint.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice transaction and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for allowing your manicures to last longer.</li>
            <li>This product worked great quickly taking out the yellow.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to use a bottom and top coat on natural nails</li>
            <li>the yellow is gone and my nails are gorgeous again.</li>
            <li>This works well by giving them a little shine and keeping my nails looking great.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and the first coat dries lighting fast!  </li>
            <li>As evidenced by a pointer finger where the tip chipped off, I removed the rest with polish remover, and there was a very distinct line where the nail was much brighter at the bottom where it hadn&#x27;t chipped.  </li>
            <li>It takes that noticeable orangish-yellow tint right out of my acrylic manicure/pedicure.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this product</li>
            <li>This product did make my nails appear whiter at first.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what its name implies.  </li>
            <li>and i am sure i will stick on to it for a long time.</li>
            <li>ONLY thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Sparkling shiney, clean and clear, and looks more professional than the recent manicures I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I use Seche bottom coat and Seche fast dry top coat and my mani is done in minutes.  </li>
            <li>It immediately made my nail bright pink and tip nail to be white.</li>
            <li>NOT LIKING IT MUCH</li>
            <li>Really works.......</li>
            <li>I put it on this afternoon and it really works.</li>
            <li>but I just add another coat of polish and since it dries so fast it is not a problem.  </li>
            <li>so I put a clear top coat of regular nail polish over it and still has not \\&quot;peeled\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning quite a few times since applying the yellow out top coat and my french tips are still bright white!</li>
            <li>It makes nail tips super stand out white</li>
            <li>looked fresh white.</li>
            <li>The first coat doesnt provide much coverage for yellowing or ridge reduction, but once I put on the 2nd coat I thought \\&quot;wow, this stuff is great.\\</li>
            <li>This nail polish is CRAZY good!  </li>
            <li>Also it doesnt not remove with regular nail polish remover you have to purchase pure acetone.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is it dosen&#x27;t stay on very well in water</li>
            <li>I defiantly recommend spending the few dollars that it&#x27;s very much worth!</li>
            <li>Just remove your clear coat of nail polish, buff, put this product on one coat, watch the orange tint instantly be removed, and apply clear polish!</li>
            <li>Also saves money, when its time for me to get a fill in, yellow out is a lil thicker than normal topcoats, but it works as a filler too, saving me 18$ every 1-2wks.</li>
            <li>The first time product shipped, the bottle was broken, but seller sent out a new bottle right away.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, and it really does take the yellow out and the price is reasonable compared to other major labels.  </li>
            <li>It DOES leave an iridescent purple tint on the clear part of my white french manicure ONLY in the natural sunlight is that noticeable but its very natural looking and whitened my white tips.</li>
            <li>Keeps nails from getting gross, old looking stains from wearing regular colors of nail polish.</li>

            <li> THEY ADDED BLUE TO TAKE THE YELLOW EFFECT OUT NOT REALLY TAKING CARE OF THE ISSUE..</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my polish from turning a dull matte color after it has been on a whole.</li>
            <li> I hated that tanning yellowed acrylic nails, happy</li>
            <li> NOT WOW..</li>
            <li> have naturally long nails and wear only clear nail polish, so I&#x27;m desperate to find something that whitens + last several days + shines.</li>
            <li> but the pink part is now lilac colored.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a farce however, because instead of getting rid of yellow, it actually caused my nails to become yellow.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this product prevents yellowing from nail polish, but it DOES NOT REMOVE YELLOW that already occur!</li>
            <li> the other one I used was blue!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> When I sat down at my desk and looked at my hands</li>
            <li> the tips of my nails are a little whiter</li>
            <li> I had to paint my nails everyday because of the chipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the next day the product began to peel off and not just a little, like half of it peeled from each one of my nails.</li>
            <li> By 2nd or 3rd day, it looks so bad I have to go ahead and remove it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it gets any yellowish out of your nails.  </li>
            <li> This takes the yellow out but it chips really bad.</li>
            <li> but the next day it will look bad.  </li>
            <li> I like to put on a different base coat, a ridge filler, then Yello-Out and topcoat.</li>
            <li> and I like the faint neon lavander tint in the sunlight!  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a nail base every time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> They looked horrible.</li>

            <li> I used to buy a nail whitening kit from perfect 10 called white now nails, and it was amazing, but it got discontinued. It had an amazing top coat with a violet tint that really brightened up my nails, and I have been searching for one like it ever since!! THIS is it. I even noticed that when removed with polish remover, the actual nail looks brighter afterward. As evidenced by a pointer finger where the tip chipped off, I removed the rest with polish remover, and there was a very distinct line where the nail was much brighter at the bottom where it hadn&#x27;t chipped.  It also works great as a hardener. I noticed a big difference in my bendy nails after applying.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using bleach on my nails for years, even tho I didn&#x27;t like it, I also didn&#x27;t like using polish remover more than once a week either.  This polish really makes your nails look beautiful.  Sparkling shiney, clean and clear, and looks more professional than the recent manicures I&#x27;ve had.  I will alwaya have this in my nail kit.  Even when this is applied 2 or 3 days after a manicure, it brightens up your nails.</li>
            <li> This takes the yellow out but it chips really bad. I had to paint my nails everyday because of the chipping.</li>
            <li> NOT WOW.. THEY ADDED BLUE TO TAKE THE YELLOW EFFECT OUT NOT REALLY TAKING CARE OF THE ISSUE.. NOT LIKING IT MUCH</li>
            <li> Thank you! This product works great! I have been tanning quite a few times since applying the yellow out top coat and my french tips are still bright white! The first time product shipped, the bottle was broken, but seller sent out a new bottle right away. Great service. Thanks again! :D :D</li>
            <li> I hated that tanning yellowed acrylic nails, happy I found this product to stop that from happening. Great nail polish!</li>
            <li> Really works.......I had this years ago and finally found it here again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and it really does take the yellow out and the price is reasonable compared to other major labels.  And having it shipped to your door is great too.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. It immediately made my nail bright pink and tip nail to be white. My first experience with this product and i am sure i will stick on to it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Product is OK ... Strangely enough it is called yellow OUT!?  However it turns my white acrylic yellow in some areas ...?</li>
            <li> the tips of my nails are a little whiter but the pink part is now lilac colored. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product did make my nails appear whiter at first. Then I noticed a light blue-ish tint.  My biggest beef is that it chips the day after application. By 2nd or 3rd day, it looks so bad I have to go ahead and remove it. I seldom do dishes nor anything else that might cause extra wear and tear on nails, so I don&#x27;t know what the problem was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally long nails and wear only clear nail polish, so I&#x27;m desperate to find something that whitens + last several days + shines. I&#x27;m open to suggestions.  (I did not buy this product through Amazon.)</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my polish from turning a dull matte color after it has been on a whole. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Product great, packaging could have been better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it goes on smoothly and does make your nail tips look whiter and the nail beds a beautiful pink. I have used it as a nail base every time I&#x27;ve used it. It does look gorgeous on its own though. Will stay dedicated to this product!</li>
            <li> This product worked great quickly taking out the yellow.  Would purchase again.  It was a nice transaction and reasonably priced.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product prevents yellowing from nail polish, but it DOES NOT REMOVE YELLOW that already occur!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product.  Not only did it not remove any yellowing from the nail, it actually provided a yellow-tinted shine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  If you need yellow out, soak in clorox for 5 minutes...done.</li>
            <li> I held out great hope for the product. It goes on smoothly and the first coat dries lighting fast!  The first coat doesnt provide much coverage for yellowing or ridge reduction, but once I put on the 2nd coat I thought \\&quot;wow, this stuff is great.\\&quot;  It does have a lavendar tinge to it as well, but I didnt mind that.  Unfortunately the next day the product began to peel off and not just a little, like half of it peeled from each one of my nails. They looked horrible. I thought it was a fluke and tried it again. The same thing happened. So if you are just looking for help for an evening out, it&#x27;s great but the next day it will look bad.  Also it doesnt not remove with regular nail polish remover you have to purchase pure acetone.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> I always have acrylic nails. I just got this product in the mail this morning. I put it on this afternoon and it really works. It takes that noticeable orangish-yellow tint right out of my acrylic manicure/pedicure. I was warned in the reviews that it \\&quot;peels\\&quot; off so I put a clear top coat of regular nail polish over it and still has not \\&quot;peeled\\&quot; off. Just remove your clear coat of nail polish, buff, put this product on one coat, watch the orange tint instantly be removed, and apply clear polish! It DOES leave an iridescent purple tint on the clear part of my white french manicure ONLY in the natural sunlight is that noticeable but its very natural looking and whitened my white tips. I will be ordering more of this when I run out! I defiantly recommend spending the few dollars that it&#x27;s very much worth!</li>
            <li> Maybe I did not use it correcftly, but it did not remove or prevent the yellowness in my nails. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always have my nails done as a french manicure, white tips, and they start to turn yellow.  One coat of this and the yellow is gone and my nails are gorgeous again.</li>
            <li> My toenails are very yellow because I constantly keep polish on them. I&#x27;ve only been using this product and no actual nail polish for a couple of weeks now and there has been no improvement. Maybe it just takes a while. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see what happens. I guess I was expecting more of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I don&#x27;t like polishing my nails because of the upkeep.  This works well by giving them a little shine and keeping my nails looking great.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its name implies.  A barely-noticible coat makes your nails look fresher and your hands look younger.  Gets the yellow out.  I like to put on a different base coat, a ridge filler, then Yello-Out and topcoat.</li>
            <li> This product is great for allowing your manicures to last longer. My manicure lasted for about 1 week (typically only lasts for 3 days). It&#x27;s a bit of a farce however, because instead of getting rid of yellow, it actually caused my nails to become yellow.  Prior to using this polish I never had any issues with yellowing.</li>
            <li> This product makes my nails look wonderful.  Just like I step out of the salon.  The only drawback is it dosen&#x27;t stay on very well in water but I just add another coat of polish and since it dries so fast it is not a problem.  My nails look like I just got an American manicure.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and only had time to paint one hand before running back to work. When I sat down at my desk and looked at my hands I could not believe how yellow the nails looked on the hand I hadn&#x27;t painted because the one&#x27;s I painted looked fresh white. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Yes, it was almost what I wanted! Not exactly!&lt;br /&gt;I knew tris product through blue cross and shields but tris one is  purple and the other one I used was blue!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My fav nail product! Keeps nails from getting gross, old looking stains from wearing regular colors of nail polish. It can be used all alone to have nails look healthy and clean. It can be used under nail polish to prevent stains from nail polish colors. And a great top coat for a French Manicure. Long-time fav product of mine!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it gets any yellowish out of your nails.  Stopped using them.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer of &amp;#34;Yello-Out.&amp;#34;  I wear it even if my nails aren&#x27;t yellow.  It makes nail tips super stand out white and I like the faint neon lavander tint in the sunlight!  I make sure to use a bottom and top coat on natural nails or I have a problem with the &amp;#34;Yello-Out&amp;#34; peeling.  I use Seche bottom coat and Seche fast dry top coat and my mani is done in minutes.  Love the look!</li>
            <li> I smoke, I tan &amp; I wear white tips. This keeps them 110% from yellowing. Also saves money, when its time for me to get a fill in, yellow out is a lil thicker than normal topcoats, but it works as a filler too, saving me 18$ every 1-2wks. Seriously this is THE best ever, def be ordering more :D</li>
            <li> This nail polish is CRAZY good!  Makes your nails look awesome!  Don&#x27;t want to ever be without it!</li>
