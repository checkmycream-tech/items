            <li>Great product delivered efficiently by a good compnay.</li>
            <li>(milk product again) thrown in to look good.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>results were unexpectedly good.</li>
            <li>Been using for years, good product, good price .</li>
            <li>I was very impressed how quickly I received the product from this company.  </li>
            <li>And these patients continue to use BioTears successfully for many months-</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the promptness of receipt of the order!</li>
            <li>Amazing changed my life</li>
            <li>and I honestly can not explain it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Bio tears Oral Gel Caps.  </li>
            <li>Well, I guess I won&#x27;t be able to afford good eye health soon.</li>
            <li>An equally wonderful product and very helpful website that recommends drinking LOTS of water.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel very comfortable and moist, the softgels were recommended to me by my optician.</li>
            <li>I have read the manufacturers publications and believe this is a great scientific breakthrough which most vets will not be familiar with because it is primarily a nutritional therapy.  </li>
            <li>My hair also feels more silky and swear eyelashes have grown</li>
            <li>I will never stop :))</li>
            <li>and I feel better.</li>
            <li>Sooner pay more.</li>
            <li>but I am able to maintain tears and eye moisture with Biotears instead of the drug.</li>
            <li>For me, it is a much better alternative to &#x27;tears&#x27; or a prescription medication</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than glorified Omega 3.\</li>
            <li>Will know more when I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have taken it for 6 weeks and will reorder more.</li>
            <li>They also feel much better.</li>
            <li>P.S. I&#x27;ve also been taking Restasis drops twice a day for a couple years now, and this had more of an effect</li>
            <li>He suggested a humidifier, more drops some sort of goopie oily stuff that went under the eyelid...</li>
            <li>I think my eyes are better</li>
            <li>Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I feel better as well, I no longer have those unbearable moments, when I just wanted to pour a bottle of tears into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Restasis is the best answer for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I have found for severe dry eye.  </li>
            <li>HUGE difference all night and upon waking, much better than not taking Bio Tears every night.  </li>
            <li>He recommended I try this and its been great so far.</li>
            <li>Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product.</li>
            <li>This product has brought relief to my suffering dry eye patients and turned them into happy and enthusiastic patients.    </li>
            <li>I have tried variou other products and bio tears work the best.</li>
            <li>Gels and drops didn&#x27;t work a bag full!</li>
            <li>Have purchased other places , this is best deal I have found</li>
            <li>but my eyes open beautifully now.  </li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine for about a month, then the pain started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know we are each unique and what works for one person does not work for another.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural treatment for anyone with dry eyes.</li>
            <li>My symptoms are still fairly mild, but I can attest that BioTears has measurably helped.</li>
            <li>Even though the pills are large, they are easy to swallow.  </li>
            <li>softgels help my severe dry eyes to actually be able to see better, without them my eye sight is filmy and not as presise as they should be.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give me gross &#x27;fish burps&#x27; or anything too (which is nice -</li>
            <li>I passed last week as a great candidate for Lasik exam, and I am getting rid of my glasses this July, finally after 20 some years with 4 eyes!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>When I was consistent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple eye surgeries and my surgeon recommended this supplement to keep the eyes healthy.</li>
            <li>When I consistently take 2 a day (AM/PM)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m expecting it to stop for much longer periods of time as I continue this beauties and will go away for ever!</li>
            <li>It has made such a great difference in my vision and the pain of dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference..but didn&#x27;t want to get to excited!</li>
            <li>But as a big fan of natural supplements, I was looking for some kind of supplmenets to take.</li>
            <li>I also had driven myself to the appointment; something I had not been able to do for a long time!</li>
            <li>My dry eye problem is mostly just a memory.</li>
            <li>But I need to say this really helps me.  </li>
            <li>I stopped because I did not want to pay so much for vitamins</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t Give me much confidenve</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely saw no improvement in five weeks.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, I cannot really use or review this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks greedy pharmaceuticals.   </li>
            <li>So much easier than drops.</li>
            <li>I did not feel as much relief from this product as I had with Thera Tears.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I have just completed a full bottle, which was enough for one month.</li>
            <li>These were recommended to me by my eye doctor and have been a huge help with my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>The main problem I had with the product was the size of the capsules, which is always a problem for me with generics.</li>
            <li>This formula has a high tech protein binder that I understood has a chemical reaction w/ the tear formation process.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of the type of dry eye that they have, I see a success rate of about 80%!</li>
            <li>Significantly helped my dry eye pain.</li>
            <li>I see many dry eye patients daily and discuss their condition in detail.</li>
            <li>They are new for me.  </li>
            <li>He was amazed when I returned three days later and the ulcers had cleared up considerably and I had slept through the night for the first time in over a month without waking up with my eyelids stuck together</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also doing a couple of other things, e.g., using a special eyelid solution, so I don&#x27;t know how much the improvement is dependent on Bio Tears, but this is the only new thing I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>Bought these after reading all the reviews for my dry eyes, didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>but it is SO dry here in Las Vegas that nothing really helps much.  </li>
            <li>Might be good but had to stop due to excessive bruising (not on a blood thinner).</li>
            <li>I only take 1 to 2 daily and that works even in dry Arizona and with more mature eyes.</li>
            <li>I had tried the frequent eye drops,warm compresses, and eyelid scrubs</li>
            <li>and I was busy, I just forgot about it.  </li>
            <li>Seems as though an easier swallowing pill could be developed.</li>
            <li>I will continue taking the Gel Caps especially in the winter, because winters in Colorado are very drying on my eyes and on my skin.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s cheaper), but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>Works Good but too expensive.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty severe dry eye condition.  </li>
            <li>In other words, I was my own research study: a baseline, treatment, return to baseline, return to treatment clinical subject!</li>
            <li>I used the prescription drug Restasis to get back to normal</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry eye, you absolutely must try this.  </li>
            <li>Bio tears have really helped ease the discomfort of my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>Really helps dry eyes.</li>
            <li>Works very well and would recommend it to anyone who has Dry Eye Syndrome.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the people who are suffering for the dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to give it another two weeks to see if there is even a slight difference.</li>
            <li>She has had multiple severe dry eye complications and I thought she would never regain a normal life.  </li>
            <li>This one bottle should late me a full year if I do the math.</li>
            <li>I live in the Nevada desert where dry eyes are a regular hazard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20-something year old with chronic dry eyes and problems with inflammation.  </li>
            <li>I know it is hard to believe that in only three days these things could work so quickly</li>
            <li>She is now almost normal and still takes a prescription gel on the eyes twice daily, but this Bio Tears is what has reversed the extreme dryness.  </li>

            <li> She is now almost normal and still takes a prescription gel on the eyes twice daily, but this Bio Tears is what has reversed the extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> my eyes are less dry, even with computer work or driving, and my mouth dryness (another symptom of Sjogrens) is much improved.</li>
            <li> My dry eyes have been happily not so dry since using this</li>
            <li> I started my 2nd bottle already, and just 2 weeks ago, l went in for a checkup, my doc told me that my eyes didn&#x27;t look as dry as last time.</li>
            <li> Save your money and by the fish oil on sale from lots of places online for far less than this \\&quot;remedy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> To date, I don&#x27;t see any difference with my dry eyes, however,it has only been just two weeks that I have tried the product.  </li>
            <li> The only supplements that helps with my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this for all dry eye sufferers.  </li>
            <li> I have ocular rosacea and my eyes were so dry that i couldn&#x27;t even open them in the morning.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would be OK for people who just have occasional trouble with dry eyes, but it&#x27;s useless for those of us with diagnosed conditions requiring prescription medicine.</li>
            <li> My sister was also suffering from extreme eye dryness to the point that her eyes were always red and swollen.</li>
            <li> My eyes were so dry</li>
            <li> and it takes a week or so after I run out before my eyes are dry again.  </li>
            <li> My Ophthalmologist recommended BioTears for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> My dry eyes had become so severe that I was making trips to the emergency room.  </li>
            <li> Give these a try if you have severe dry eyes and see what they can do for you.</li>
            <li> I had lasik and ended up with dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I suffered for years with dry eyes, to the point it was affecting my vision.  </li>
            <li> This is a must-have for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes used to be so dry</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended it after Lasik eye surgery to prevent dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my ophthalmologist for my chronic dry eye.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my dry eye.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and prefer to wear contacts.  </li>
            <li> The product may work for some, however, I found it had no impact for my dog with dry eye syndrome.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my eye doctor for my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing an optomologust for years now regarding my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> He ran a test on me to check proteins in the eye, in that if you&#x27;re lacking it may be the cause of my dry eye.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any dry spotson my eyes.</li>
            <li> Specialist for dry eye said he didn&#x27;t see any improvement either.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my dry eyes a lot.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help with my dry eye.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry eye.  </li>
            <li> These were suggested to me by my Ophthalmologist, as she had tried them herself for dry eye.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to work well, I&#x27;m on my 4th  bottle.</li>
            <li> This is an oil based tablet for dry eyes recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> helpful for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> Have been taking for 2 months; dry eye condition has improved.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you suffer from dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this has helped my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> Without Bio Tears, I have to use ointment to prevent the dry, tear-causing pain I&#x27;d have otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in helping my dry eye problems, though it may work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have had chronicle dry eyes for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> Nothing vets did seemed to help much and their recommendations and prognosis for her was not good.  </li>
            <li> I could only wear my contacts for half a day before I had to take them out.  </li>
            <li> so I divide the pill in half and give it twice daily to a 17 lb shiu tzu after her meals.  </li>
            <li> I notice a slight difference, but not enough to continue paying almost 40 bucks a month.</li>
            <li> One eye is back to normal and the other is close behind.</li>
            <li> always what I have expected</li>
            <li> I discovered Biotears 3 years ago after my eyes became very dry due to an usual amount of smoke in the air for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin also felt less dry because of all of the oils in the Gel Caps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning there would be a sharp when I opened my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I can put in eye drops and I was loosing a lot of sleep due to</li>
            <li> I read Bio Tears stories from other people on page</li>
            <li> I take two a day, twice a day, with my other vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I am going to stick with artificial tears, as this supplement doesn&#x27;t make enough difference to spend the money and have to take 4 large capsules every day.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyes felt less dry a few weeks after taking the Gel Caps.  </li>
            <li> and he said there wasn&#x27;t anything else he could really do for me because there was nothing wrong with the cornea itself.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry-eye syndrome and am hoping this is as good as my doctor thinks it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also down to using maybe 3 vials of drops a day.</li>
            <li> and in extreme pain!  </li>
            <li> Other eye vitamins didn&#x27;t work either!</li>
            <li> These pills, hands down, changed the quality of my life in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I notice a difference in as little as 3 days</li>
            <li> I took this medication for months and saw a little result.  </li>
            <li> Then I ran out of BioTears and since it is a bit of trouble to acquire</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it was totally useless, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these nutrients for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I signed up for the monthly mailing plan and was really shocked that the price increased before I got the first automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking four capsules per day as recommended by my opthamologist for the past few months, and I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself, but I have had no infections since I started taking Bio Tears.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use this product but not sure of the results yet.</li>
            <li> I have no more pains</li>
            <li> I am sorry to hear that the price went up recently.</li>
            <li> so that is really scary to think back on!  </li>
            <li> Since this product is expensive (recommendation is 4 capsules a day), I take only 3 a day and take Omega 3 fish oil as well.</li>
            <li> My eyes started having problems with excessive dryness again, so now I am using BioTears again.  </li>
            <li> Also, no more itchy eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on what is wrong with your dry eyes, you might find something else--maybe you have allergies or something.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product as a replacement for the expensive prescription eye drops I had for my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing a lot because I take an allergy med and drops.</li>
            <li> I think Amazon should honor the quoted price for at least one delivery.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t promise it will work for you, but you could at least try it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m attributing the improvement at least in part to Bio Tears.</li>
            <li> And the eye gel I put in at night I only put in because I&#x27;m afraid not to</li>
            <li> After the doctors putting me on Restasis, I was seeing results slowly and gradually.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice the difference when I run out of these vitamins but they are expensive!</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive than prescription drops.  </li>
            <li> I get them here because they are less expensive than the doctor.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the company stands behind the product-</li>
            <li> I notice a dramatic difference when I take this supplement.  </li>
            <li> They may seem expensive but trust my review because a year after I started to take them</li>
            <li> Desperate</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so bad that I cannot get approved for LASIK.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the price of restasis</li>
            <li> I hate that biotears keeps upping it&#x27;s price...</li>
            <li> I hate fish).  </li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t that bad and eyedrops stop it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know we are each unique and what works for one person does not work for another.  But I need to say this really helps me.  My eyes were so dry I could only wear my contacts for half a day before I had to take them out.  I notice a difference in as little as 3 days and it takes a week or so after I run out before my eyes are dry again.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural treatment for anyone with dry eyes. My hair also feels more silky and swear eyelashes have grown people think I use latisse (spell) Mainly it is good for you!!! I highly recommend it!! I will never stop :))</li>
            <li> I tried Biotears for 2 months on the advice of my optometrist.  But I didn&#x27;t notice any relief at all.  Now I&#x27;m using Rx Restasis and I can once again open my eyes in the morning and get through each day just using rewetting drops occasionally.  Restasis is the best answer for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product but not sure of the results yet. AWH</li>
            <li> I took the recommended dosage for one month.  I did not notice any improvement.  What I did notice was that my vitamin B6 blood levels were 2x the recommended limit when I got tested for various vitamin levels.  So keep in mind that this supplement has a ton of vitamin B6.</li>
            <li> My Ophthalmologist recommended BioTears for my dry eyes. I have been using since July 2010. I have no more pains and I feel better. I highly recommend the people who are suffering for the dry eyes.  I am sorry to hear that the price went up recently.</li>
            <li> My dry eyes had become so severe that I was making trips to the emergency room.  Nothing was working and my eyes were developing corneal ulcers.  I could not drive, sleep or function in my daily life.  This went on for two months.  In exasperation my doctor gave me a bottle of these since a Biotears Rep had left them in his office.  I was his \\&quot;guinea pig\\&quot;.  He was amazed when I returned three days later and the ulcers had cleared up considerably and I had slept through the night for the first time in over a month without waking up with my eyelids stuck together and in extreme pain!  I also had driven myself to the appointment; something I had not been able to do for a long time! I know it is hard to believe that in only three days these things could work so quickly and I honestly can not explain it.  All I can say is that they worked for my condition and if I had not tried them I do not know where I would be today.  My doctor was starting to talk about corneal transplants...so that is really scary to think back on!  Give these a try if you have severe dry eyes and see what they can do for you. They may seem expensive but trust my review because a year after I started to take them I stopped because I did not want to pay so much for vitamins and I tried a cheaper competitor...TheraTears.  Within two weeks my eyes started to hurt again.  I will never stop taking these because that was proof to myself that I need these things in my life!!</li>
            <li> All this product is 1000 IU of fish oil, 100 mg of Vitamin C, a tiny bit of vitamin D and E and B6 with some cod liver oil, aloe vera oil, turmeric and lachoferrin (milk product again) thrown in to look good. Save your money and by the fish oil on sale from lots of places online for far less than this \\&quot;remedy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had lasik and ended up with dry eyes.  I was shocked at the price of restasis so wanted to try alternatives.  The key with this product is to take as instructed, consistency with taking it was not my forte.  When I was consistent I noticed some difference but not enough to continue the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple eye surgeries and my surgeon recommended this supplement to keep the eyes healthy.</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with dry eyes, to the point it was affecting my vision.  While working for an eye doctor I found this product, BioTears.  It has made such a great difference in my vision and the pain of dry eyes.  I was very impressed how quickly I received the product from this company.  I will be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by my eye doctor and have been a huge help with my dry eyes.  I only take 1 to 2 daily and that works even in dry Arizona and with more mature eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for my dry eyes. I gave only 4 stars because every bottle in my order arrived in separate shipments, but all came from the same vendor. That&#x27;s just nuts.</li>
            <li> Works Good but too expensive. But please don&#x27;t get in made in CHINA. Sooner pay more. Why do you only stock only to or three bottles? Doesn&#x27;t Give me much confidenve</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry eye, you absolutely must try this.  My eyes used to be so dry I saw halos whenever I looked at lights.  My eyes improved after just 2 weeks of taking it.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel very comfortable and moist, the softgels were recommended to me by my optician. I take 2 daily.</li>
            <li> Just another vitamin package. These vitamins have been selected to affect tear formation.</li>
            <li> Bought these after reading all the reviews for my dry eyes, didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I live in the Nevada desert where dry eyes are a regular hazard. I used the prescription drug Restasis to get back to normal but I am able to maintain tears and eye moisture with Biotears instead of the drug. Since this product is expensive (recommendation is 4 capsules a day), I take only 3 a day and take Omega 3 fish oil as well. You can experiment and see what dosage works for you.     I signed up for the monthly mailing plan and was really shocked that the price increased before I got the first automatic delivery. I think Amazon should honor the quoted price for at least one delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the price. My doctor recommended it after Lasik eye surgery to prevent dry eyes. My sister was also suffering from extreme eye dryness to the point that her eyes were always red and swollen. She started using this and got relief after 2 weeks. She stopped using it for a month and all her symptoms came back. She has been usingit his for 2 years now. As a bonus, it is very good for your skin also.</li>
            <li> To date, I don&#x27;t see any difference with my dry eyes, however,it has only been just two weeks that I have tried the product.  I am willing to give it another two weeks to see if there is even a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I had tried the frequent eye drops,warm compresses, and eyelid scrubs my opthalmologist recommended to no avail.  This product worked so well, I stopped carrying eye drops all the time.  Then I ran out of BioTears and since it is a bit of trouble to acquire and I was busy, I just forgot about it.  My eyes started having problems with excessive dryness again, so now I am using BioTears again.  In other words, I was my own research study: a baseline, treatment, return to baseline, return to treatment clinical subject! And BioTears worked everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what is wrong with your dry eyes, you might find something else--maybe you have allergies or something.  So I can&#x27;t promise it will work for you, but you could at least try it.  I will never be without it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Recommended by my ophthalmologist for my chronic dry eye. For me, it is a much better alternative to &#x27;tears&#x27; or a prescription medication</li>
            <li> I am an optometrist and have been recommending BioTears for several years. I see many dry eye patients daily and discuss their condition in detail. I usually start with BioTears as my first line of treatment. Regardless of the type of dry eye that they have, I see a success rate of about 80%! And these patients continue to use BioTears successfully for many months- and they see the difference!  And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that the company stands behind the product- they offer a money-back guarantee! This product has brought relief to my suffering dry eye patients and turned them into happy and enthusiastic patients.    Thanks Biosyntrx!  Dr. Jeffrey Anshel, OD, FAAO</li>
            <li> I have post lasik surgery eye dryness and this product helps a great deal!</li>
            <li> I have just completed a full bottle, which was enough for one month. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my dry eye. I am going to stick with artificial tears, as this supplement doesn&#x27;t make enough difference to spend the money and have to take 4 large capsules every day.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using it.  I am satisfied with it. I will not rate the rest of the products. They are new for me.  I am satisfied with the promptness of receipt of the order!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it was totally useless, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It&#x27;s nothing more than glorified Omega 3.\</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes and prefer to wear contacts.  This works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I would rather use bio tears than the prescription brand.</li>
            <li> The product may work for some, however, I found it had no impact for my dog with dry eye syndrome.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my eye doctor for my dry eyes.  It is a lot less expensive than prescription drops.  And along with over the counter moisture drops these capsules do a great job.</li>
            <li> Bio tears have really helped ease the discomfort of my dry eyes.  I have tried variou other products and bio tears work the best.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product. Will know more when I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> My dry eye problem is mostly just a memory. I have taken it for 6 weeks and will reorder more.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a replacement for the expensive prescription eye drops I had for my dry eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  Maybe it would be OK for people who just have occasional trouble with dry eyes, but it&#x27;s useless for those of us with diagnosed conditions requiring prescription medicine.</li>
            <li> Bio Tears  softgels help my severe dry eyes to actually be able to see better, without them my eye sight is filmy and not as presise as they should be.  They also feel much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing an optomologust for years now regarding my dry eyes. They&#x27;re so bad that I cannot get approved for LASIK. He ran a test on me to check proteins in the eye, in that if you&#x27;re lacking it may be the cause of my dry eye. He recommended I try this and its been great so far. Took it for about 2 months and went back to the doctor and he said my eye film was very good and I didn&#x27;t have any dry spotson my eyes. I started out with only taking 2 per day and now I&#x27;m taking 3. Hoping the continuation of taking the BioTears will enable to me get LASIK in the fall. P.S. I&#x27;ve also been taking Restasis drops twice a day for a couple years now, and this had more of an effect then they did. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty severe dry eye condition.  I discovered Biotears 3 years ago after my eyes became very dry due to an usual amount of smoke in the air for several weeks.  I was on Restasis already but only the Biotears reduced the pain, dryness and discomfort in my eyes.  They helped immediately.  I use them every day and have not had to go back on daily lubricating drops.</li>
            <li> I purchase this through my eye doctor. When I consistently take 2 a day (AM/PM) my eyes are less dry, even with computer work or driving, and my mouth dryness (another symptom of Sjogrens) is much improved. My symptoms are still fairly mild, but I can attest that BioTears has measurably helped.</li>
            <li> Totally relieves excruciating pain!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing a lot because I take an allergy med and drops.</li>
            <li> About 4 months back I got Lasik (PRK Technically) and my eyes had finally healed. Everything seemed fine for about a month, then the pain started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning there would be a sharp when I opened my eyes. I thought if I used eye drops it would fix the problem but instead the my eyes would wake me up in the middle of the night so I can put in eye drops and I was loosing a lot of sleep due to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my doctor and he said there wasn&#x27;t anything else he could really do for me because there was nothing wrong with the cornea itself. He suggested a humidifier, more drops some sort of goopie oily stuff that went under the eyelid... I decided to try this BioTears stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were unexpectedly good. It might be different from person to person but I only have to take one tablet every 3-4 days. This one bottle should late me a full year if I do the math.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered efficiently by a good compnay.</li>
            <li> I re-ordered this product for a family member.  Obviously, if the user was not satisfied with the results, wouldn&#x27;t have been willing to reorder it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and needed. Was as described. Thanks.  The only supplements that helps with my dry eyes. The product is great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely saw no improvement in five weeks.  Specialist for dry eye said he didn&#x27;t see any improvement either.</li>
            <li> Tried bio tears, but discovered after several days that it was causing digestive problems. Should have reviewed the list of ingredients earlier, since it contains cod liver oil and I am allergic to fish. It was the allergy and cod liver oil that caused my problem. At any rate, I cannot really use or review this product.</li>
            <li> I took this medication for months and saw a little result.  The main problem I had with the product was the size of the capsules, which is always a problem for me with generics. Seems as though an easier swallowing pill could be developed.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my dry eyes a lot.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great GREAT service. Came immediatly.  Too soon to tell if it helps as I have just gotten it but I will let you know. I have terrible dry-eye syndrome and am hoping this is as good as my doctor thinks it is.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with my dry eye.</li>
            <li> Great product. Recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> I liked the Bio tears Oral Gel Caps.  Even though the pills are large, they are easy to swallow.  I noticed my eyes felt less dry a few weeks after taking the Gel Caps.  I also noticed that my skin also felt less dry because of all of the oils in the Gel Caps.  I will continue taking the Gel Caps especially in the winter, because winters in Colorado are very drying on my eyes and on my skin.</li>
            <li> She has had multiple severe dry eye complications and I thought she would never regain a normal life.  This product changed everything.  Nothing vets did seemed to help much and their recommendations and prognosis for her was not good.  She is now almost normal and still takes a prescription gel on the eyes twice daily, but this Bio Tears is what has reversed the extreme dryness.  I totally recommend this for all dry eye sufferers.  it can cause gastric upset so I divide the pill in half and give it twice daily to a 17 lb shiu tzu after her meals.  Just a dab of peanut butter on it, and she thinks it is a treat.  (otherwise the taste is strong-contains cod liver oil )  This formula has a high tech protein binder that I understood has a chemical reaction w/ the tear formation process.  I have read the manufacturers publications and believe this is a great scientific breakthrough which most vets will not be familiar with because it is primarily a nutritional therapy.  Wish I could give this product ten stars.</li>
            <li> I hate that biotears keeps upping it&#x27;s price... I remember when it was $20/month. Now it&#x27;s $50/month... Well, I guess I won&#x27;t be able to afford good eye health soon. Thanks greedy pharmaceuticals.   ---  I&#x27;ve been taking BioTears off and on throughout the years.  I&#x27;m a 20-something year old with chronic dry eyes and problems with inflammation.  I notice a dramatic difference when I take this supplement.  I only ever stop taking it when I can&#x27;t afford it.  I&#x27;ve tried taking krill oil instead (it&#x27;s cheaper), but it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  It also doesn&#x27;t give me gross &#x27;fish burps&#x27; or anything too (which is nice - I hate fish).  Just wish it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> Taken for 40 days now finally a vitamin that works! 2 weeks after taking I felt a difference! Was getting sandy feeling then felt like a rock in my eyes . Happening 3 to 4 days a week. Then lasting longer about 5hrs. Gels and drops didn&#x27;t work a bag full! Other eye vitamins didn&#x27;t work either! Desperate I read Bio Tears stories from other people on page thought what else is left? Order it and hoped for the best!After 2 weeks I noticed a big difference..but didn&#x27;t want to get to excited! Well reordered this vitamin I still get a rock in eye feeling or sandy feeling weekly. But it isn&#x27;t that bad and eyedrops stop it! I&#x27;m expecting it to stop for much longer periods of time as I continue this beauties and will go away for ever! ☺</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry eye.  My doctor had me try BioTears along with drops I was supposed to use three times a day.  With the BioTears, I don&#x27;t have to do anything else.  I get them here because they are less expensive than the doctor.  Can&#x27;t say you will have the same results, but if you do, it is a lot nicer than drops all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these nutrients for quite a few years.  I think my eyes are better but it is SO dry here in Las Vegas that nothing really helps much.  Even tear duct plugs didn&#x27;t work for me because they become infected.</li>
            <li> Had chronic recurring eyelid infections before I started using this product.  I&#x27;ve been taking four capsules per day as recommended by my opthamologist for the past few months, and I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself, but I have had no infections since I started taking Bio Tears.  I&#x27;m also doing a couple of other things, e.g., using a special eyelid solution, so I don&#x27;t know how much the improvement is dependent on Bio Tears, but this is the only new thing I&#x27;m using so I&#x27;m attributing the improvement at least in part to Bio Tears.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Works very well and would recommend it to anyone who has Dry Eye Syndrome.</li>
            <li> always what I have expected</li>
            <li> My dry eyes have been happily not so dry since using this</li>
            <li> Amazing changed my life</li>
            <li> These were suggested to me by my Ophthalmologist, as she had tried them herself for dry eye.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to work well, I&#x27;m on my 4th  bottle.</li>
            <li> I notice a slight difference, but not enough to continue paying almost 40 bucks a month.</li>
            <li> This product has eliminated blurry spots in my vision by keeping my eyes lubricated.  Also, no more itchy eyes.  I take two a day, twice a day, with my other vitamins.  So much easier than drops.</li>
            <li> I did not feel as much relief from this product as I had with Thera Tears. Also, I think it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after my eye doctor told me about it. It really works.</li>
            <li> Significantly helped my dry eye pain.</li>
            <li> This is an oil based tablet for dry eyes recommended by my eye doctor. Might be good but had to stop due to excessive bruising (not on a blood thinner).</li>
            <li> Been using for years, good product, good price . Have purchased other places , this is best deal I have found</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IF YOU HAVE EYE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY WITH DRYNESS THEN YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS A TRY.</li>
            <li> Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product. Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will do it again</li>
            <li> These pills, hands down, changed the quality of my life in less than a week.  I will not be without them.  I have ocular rosacea and my eyes were so dry that i couldn&#x27;t even open them in the morning.  Since taking these, I no longer put in drops four times a day ... I don&#x27;t have to use drops at all!  And the eye gel I put in at night I only put in because I&#x27;m afraid not to but my eyes open beautifully now.  If you have dry eyes, I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.  And if you have ocular rosacea, check out Rosacia-ltd IV.  An equally wonderful product and very helpful website that recommends drinking LOTS of water.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice the difference when I run out of these vitamins but they are expensive!</li>
            <li> These have been life changing for me! I was going through a box of preservative-free drops in 2-3 days and prescriptions... Nothing was helping my severe dry-eye from LASIK. After 2 days I noticed improvement, and now 2 weeks later I can even see at night! One eye is back to normal and the other is close behind. I&#x27;m also down to using maybe 3 vials of drops a day. This had been freedom in a bottle for me!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found for severe dry eye.  None of the eye drops on the market compare to this product.</li>
            <li> helpful for dry eyes.  Much use for a few weeks to see results</li>
            <li> Have been taking for 2 months; dry eye condition has improved.  I recommend this product if you suffer from dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this has helped my dry eyes.  I believe fish oil and flaxseed work as well.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference all night and upon waking, much better than not taking Bio Tears every night.  Without Bio Tears, I have to use ointment to prevent the dry, tear-causing pain I&#x27;d have otherwise.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in helping my dry eye problems, though it may work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have had chronicle dry eyes for about 10 years. After the doctors putting me on Restasis, I was seeing results slowly and gradually. But as a big fan of natural supplements, I was looking for some kind of supplmenets to take. I started my 2nd bottle already, and just 2 weeks ago, l went in for a checkup, my doc told me that my eyes didn&#x27;t look as dry as last time. I feel better as well, I no longer have those unbearable moments, when I just wanted to pour a bottle of tears into my eyes. I passed last week as a great candidate for Lasik exam, and I am getting rid of my glasses this July, finally after 20 some years with 4 eyes!</li>
