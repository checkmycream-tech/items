            <li>All in all, good product.</li>
            <li>Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>For a real stain, the Stila lip &amp; cheek stain in the click pen thingy is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The LipSurgence color line by Tarte is much duped by drugstore brands, but this, the original, is best.</li>
            <li>incredibly vibrant and beautiful for all skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I love tarts lip stains.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the color, but i love the product.</li>
            <li>Am very happy with most Tarte items, especially the foundation, BB primer, and lip stains.</li>
            <li>I wouldnÂ´t buy this product again even though IÂ´m in love with the colour and a Tarte fan.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it will work better for others?</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Love the Tarte lip shade.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, color, etc.</li>
            <li>Love love love love love</li>
            <li>I love this lip pencil , and can&#x27;t wait until I have the full collection.</li>
            <li>It also settled in the fine lines of my lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic color and it stays.  </li>
            <li>overall, the product is great.</li>
            <li>This particular one has a nice scent to it too.</li>
            <li>First Tarte Product and I can not wait to use it :)</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, lasting color.</li>
            <li>Good luck seeing me in public without this lip color on.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too bright but stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>great and long lasting</li>
            <li>First time buying lip stain</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜Šjust be careful when opening and keep it cool because mine was a bit melted other than that good worth it!</li>
            <li>It is also very chalky, not at all soft and moisturizing like the original Tarte lip products.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and lasted 6+ hrs without touch ups.</li>
            <li>If I forget to sharpen it, I can&#x27;t really use it because there&#x27;s no forgiveness.  </li>
            <li>Color was more pink than portrayed on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very matte and very intense, in a lush raspberry.</li>
            <li>Long lasting lipstain, love it.</li>
            <li>This item is a cute hot pink color, however it is dry</li>
            <li>It is called natural matte lip stain, but I had to use my original one over it to tone it down.</li>
            <li>I like to apply chap stick first, then lightly coat with stain since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I think old.</li>
            <li>But the pencil gets dull easily and because the color is so vivid and saturated, you can&#x27;t just gloss it on; you need precision.  </li>
            <li>I just bought my second Tarte Lipsurge matte lip tint in Lively</li>
            <li>I compared it next to my other Tarte lip stains and the tube is longer and thinner than the real ones (bought from Sephora).</li>
            <li>It comes out a little bit redder than one might think, but it&#x27;s a very vibrant magenta shade.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!! AND CHEAPER THAN ORIGINAL PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Color was more pink than portrayed on Amazon. Box bottom was torn.  I would not have minded if it was for me, but it was a gift.  All in all, good product.</li>
            <li> Looveeee it Except mine broke out when I opened it just put it back still works has a minty smell but thats how all of these are! ðŸ˜Šjust be careful when opening and keep it cool because mine was a bit melted other than that good worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the color. It is matt but it doesnot dry my lips</li>
            <li> I just bought my second Tarte Lipsurge matte lip tint in Lively and I have never used an entire lipstick before - I always lose them or they melt in the car or I lose interest. But this is a great product. It just isn&#x27;t a stain. It&#x27;s a matte lipstick comparable to the Nars semi-matte. For a real stain, the Stila lip &amp; cheek stain in the click pen thingy is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too bright but stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> Love the Tarte lip shade. But I ordered the wrong color and had to return it. Will be ordering a different color. The Tarte I had before, same product different color, was the only lipstick I wear. Love the texture, color, etc.</li>
            <li> This item is a cute hot pink color, however it is dry and I think old. I was disappointed after trying it on.</li>
            <li> Nothing but a crayon. I tried it twice and then threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> excellent quality.....</li>
            <li> Good luck seeing me in public without this lip color on. It is absolutely perfect. Love love love love love</li>
            <li> First Tarte Product and I can not wait to use it :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect and it stays on. It doesn&#x27;t feel yucky on either.</li>
