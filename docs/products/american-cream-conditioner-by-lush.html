            <li>But this shampoo bar was awesome!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look/ feel/ smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful!!!!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this product at all.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I &amp;lt;333333 LUSH!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, but my hair was tangly and it felt like I needed a lot.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in Japan, so getting the good stuff that works wonders with my hair involved quite a bit of mail order - and when i was experimenting to find what worked best..</li>
            <li>and it still smelled great, too.</li>
            <li>As for the performance it is great.</li>
            <li>AC is also great as a leave in.</li>
            <li>a great conditioner though, if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it smelled in the bottle, and I loved the way it smelled when I used it!</li>
            <li>I have never smelled a hair product as good as this.  </li>
            <li>Sounded like a good deal.      </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of ordering this based on the raves about how good it smells, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li>However, the performance of the product was quite good.</li>
            <li>Lovely!    </li>
            <li>But for me I LOVE it!    </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I give it 2 stars for the lovely smell!</li>
            <li>stuff smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>For my hair, the conditioner did everything it claimed to do (shine, softness, calmed frizz) and I really liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I passed the bottle along to my mom, who also liked the smell until she used it.</li>
            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the best Lush has to offer.</li>
            <li>LUSH has the best smelly stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells of vanilla, strawberreis and florals, very creamy, sweet and delicious.</li>
            <li>The scent of American Cream is a very nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to add a drop or two of a more detangling conditioner along with it in the shower</li>
            <li>conditioner smells like a field of vanilla (in a good way and not over powerig at all) and leaves my hair in much better condition, but it&#x27;s not as good as Lush&#x27;s Retread conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really love what this does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Still, I love what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>American Cream is one of the most delightfully scented conditioners you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&#x3D;) &lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of them and they don&#x27;t condition as well as salon, or even most drugstore conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>I love most all Lush products, so I was delighted when my best friend passed an American Cream my way.</li>
            <li>I have never smelled such an incredible fragrance, and people wouldnt not stop commenting my hair all day.</li>
            <li>Cream smells AMAZING and will work wonders on any hair type, but is especially great for dry or damaged hair and may be too much for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I advise using the conditioner right away so that when you fall in love with it, you can promptly order more</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a strawberry milkshake to me, more like a sweet perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance, but it sure as heck doesn&#x27;t smell like any milk shake</li>
            <li>$7.95 for a conditioner is fine.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to get the huge bottle</li>
            <li>(I use the light Biolage one) to get a comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair is comprised of dead cells, and the conditioners I buy from Walgreens make my hair happy, so I&#x27;ll keep using those from now on!      </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I am now a Lush fan for life!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner was not at all special.</li>
            <li>The ladies who worked in the store were very very very awesome, helpful, good humored women, and between a newspaper they had of the products translated to english, broken sentenced communication, trials and demonstrations, and in general, a good amount of girlish giggling between all of us -</li>
            <li>I noticed that I get better results when I use one of Lush&#x27;s shampoos vs. a chemical filled store-bought one.   </li>
            <li>The very first time I used it I pestered all around me to \\&quot;smell my hair, smell my hair!\\&quot;   &lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is best described as a sweet vanilla cake with cream cheese frosting, or as Lush and other reviewers have written, like a full-calorie vanilla milkshake - flecks of vanilla bean and all!  </li>
            <li>If you love sweet scents that linger and soft hair, this is the conditioner for you.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has a strong chemical scent that really does stick with you throughout the day.    </li>
            <li>First of all, I do not like the smell of this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I do think this added step is totally worth</li>
            <li>I left the store with a nice bag of goodies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, tangle free hair.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did as my hair no longer looks straw-like on the ends and is extremely soft.     </li>
            <li>And you have to give your hair a couple of weeks to get used to Lush hair products because they don&#x27;t contain any silicones which are used in MANY conditioners as a detangler (Pantene has a ton of silicone).</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, and you only have to use a small amount to get great results.  </li>
            <li>I may not have gotten an excellent bottle because mine smelled only slightly of the Vanilla milk</li>
            <li>At first I was alarmed.</li>
            <li>As a consistent user of all sorts of conditioners, I thought I may as well give this product a try...</li>
            <li>you will LOVE this since it is the same scent!</li>
            <li>While it may smell a tad \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; the overall fragrance is a top note of chemical sweetness.  </li>
            <li>This is my first choice for conditioner.</li>
            <li>think the Lush stuff wouldf be worth it anyway!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend sticking with &#x27;generic&#x27; conditioners like John Frieda...which smells AMAZING, feels rich, is very reasonably priced, and leaves your hair feeling properly conditioned.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla or strawberries to me.  </li>
            <li>This is in large part because it doesn&#x27;t use synthetic silicones to coat your hair.</li>
            <li>But when it dried, my hair was just amazing</li>
            <li>I really, really adore this stuff.</li>
            <li>also found it to be really moisturizing, and I do color my hair</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my hair that way.     </li>
            <li>It is very perfumey.  </li>
            <li>Also it cost way too much for the amount of product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t condition my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go online and order myself another bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incredibly long ramble condensed short.. my hair is amazingly silky and soft again!!!!</li>
            <li>would definetly reccommend first-time Lush buyers to add this to your shopping cart and use it right away when it arrives.  </li>
            <li>It was decent, but certainly nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...)</li>
            <li>The majority of previous reviews claim that American Cream smells good and makes their hair silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I&#x27;d shed that obsession - I decided to start trying other things, and out of convenience, I was using avalon organics (because I can buy it locally at the commissary, and its better than the super chem loaded stuff...)</li>
            <li>It was more than enough to work through my entire head.  </li>
            <li>I would highly suggest using this as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Before I had avoided it because of the very minimal chemicals still used in many of the recipes (when I was on a 100% natural everything kick)...</li>
            <li>(Lush takes a bit to ship)!!</li>
            <li>I do enjoy it, but it&#x27;s not really how the bottle describes.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything natural.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d read mixed reviews and many who didn&#x27;t like the product line on a long hair community forum)..</li>
            <li>Now if the scent makes you drool as you are massaging it into your hair (using quite a bit I may add to get the full SILKY MERMAID HAIR effect), you will continue to drool all day long because this scent lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>American Cream is worth every penny I pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Again, though make sure you enjoy the scent as some either love it or hate it</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super soft, but definitely not detangled.  </li>
            <li>I recently started just using American Cream and have noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I smell a very strong herbal scent, with only a SLIGHT vanilla undertone.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>bought the smallest size bottle Lush offers (don&#x27;t remember what it is) and have used it three times so far, and I&#x27;ve still got more than half the bottle to go.   </li>
            <li>I had a friend tell me he could smell my hair in the middle of a smokey bar--it really stays with you!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey to take a chance on the largest bottle only to end up hating it!</li>
            <li>I decided to make American Cream my first conditioner based solely on the scent.</li>
            <li>This happened to me ,so at first I did not think the product was working properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as slick in the shower as most conditioners.</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals to color it in the past.</li>
            <li>makes a lovely leave-in conditioner too, cutting down static and helping to detangle my hair better than the regular apply and rinse usage.</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time, and my dry damaged hair is silky and soft for the first time in months!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Lush can get away with charging such exorbitant prices for their products, but they consistently do.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a lush addict too, but she reported that the American Cream seemed to smell funny on her.</li>
            <li>I heard the reason why Lush has such high prices is because the donate to PETA(Peolple for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling really soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>After the second time of using it, I already noticed a difference, and now I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been eyeballing the Lush line for awhile - but hadn&#x27;t given it a try till now.</li>
            <li>the fun part with shopping locally for Lush was trying to figure out what was what (everything is written in japanese).</li>
            <li>It is pricy (like the rest of the Lush line)</li>
            <li>(I used this with the Stout shampoo by LUSH), and it&#x27;s frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Lush shampoo (Seanick) for awhile, but had yet to make the switch to a Lush conditioner.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft at all</li>
            <li>again I have to rant about Lush&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let that fool you though, as your hair will still be soft and manageable when it dries.</li>
            <li>WiTh LuSh</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very straight dry hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend though, that a person start off with the small bottle first to see if it&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and they&#x27;re both exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>(I have no other explanation for why this didn&#x27;t work for me!).  </li>
            <li>For those who have not tried any of those products I am not sure how to describe the scent accurately.</li>
            <li>I suspect that some of the other reviewers aren&#x27;t consistent users of conditioners based on the raving reveiews they typed for this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried rinsing after using it and to be honest, it&#x27;s completely useless.  </li>
            <li>In the shower, it really does not feel like it&#x27;s doing anything at all, but when you dry it - you&#x27;ll definitely see the results.</li>
            <li>Unlike drugstore and salon conditioners that just put a slick on your hair, AC rinses clean and you only have to use maybe a quarter-sized dollop for manageable great-smelling hair.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, long hair and have found that LUSH conditioners don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I do have very thick, long, curly hair, but I nevertheless expect more from something that bills itself as an extra-strength conditioner.</li>
            <li>Cream is worth trying (get the small bottle to try before shelling out the money for a big bottle) and recommended.</li>
            <li>though I was a bit worried about if it would be good or bad for me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As a consistent user of all sorts of conditioners, I thought I may as well give this product a try...</li>
            <li> you will LOVE this since it is the same scent!</li>
            <li> While it may smell a tad \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; the overall fragrance is a top note of chemical sweetness.  </li>
            <li> This is my first choice for conditioner.</li>
            <li> think the Lush stuff wouldf be worth it anyway!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend sticking with &#x27;generic&#x27; conditioners like John Frieda...which smells AMAZING, feels rich, is very reasonably priced, and leaves your hair feeling properly conditioned.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla or strawberries to me.  </li>
            <li> This is in large part because it doesn&#x27;t use synthetic silicones to coat your hair.</li>
            <li> But when it dried, my hair was just amazing</li>
            <li> I really, really adore this stuff.</li>
            <li> also found it to be really moisturizing, and I do color my hair</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my hair that way.     </li>
            <li> It is very perfumey.  </li>
            <li> Also it cost way too much for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t condition my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go online and order myself another bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incredibly long ramble condensed short.. my hair is amazingly silky and soft again!!!!</li>
            <li> would definetly reccommend first-time Lush buyers to add this to your shopping cart and use it right away when it arrives.  </li>
            <li> It was decent, but certainly nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...)</li>
            <li> The majority of previous reviews claim that American Cream smells good and makes their hair silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I&#x27;d shed that obsession - I decided to start trying other things, and out of convenience, I was using avalon organics (because I can buy it locally at the commissary, and its better than the super chem loaded stuff...)</li>
            <li> It was more than enough to work through my entire head.  </li>
            <li> I would highly suggest using this as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Before I had avoided it because of the very minimal chemicals still used in many of the recipes (when I was on a 100% natural everything kick)...</li>
            <li> (Lush takes a bit to ship)!!</li>
            <li> I do enjoy it, but it&#x27;s not really how the bottle describes.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything natural.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d read mixed reviews and many who didn&#x27;t like the product line on a long hair community forum)..</li>
            <li> Now if the scent makes you drool as you are massaging it into your hair (using quite a bit I may add to get the full SILKY MERMAID HAIR effect), you will continue to drool all day long because this scent lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> American Cream is worth every penny I pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Again, though make sure you enjoy the scent as some either love it or hate it</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair super soft, but definitely not detangled.  </li>
            <li> I recently started just using American Cream and have noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I smell a very strong herbal scent, with only a SLIGHT vanilla undertone.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> bought the smallest size bottle Lush offers (don&#x27;t remember what it is) and have used it three times so far, and I&#x27;ve still got more than half the bottle to go.   </li>
            <li> I had a friend tell me he could smell my hair in the middle of a smokey bar--it really stays with you!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey to take a chance on the largest bottle only to end up hating it!</li>
            <li> I decided to make American Cream my first conditioner based solely on the scent.</li>
            <li> This happened to me ,so at first I did not think the product was working properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as slick in the shower as most conditioners.</li>
            <li> Too many chemicals to color it in the past.</li>
            <li> makes a lovely leave-in conditioner too, cutting down static and helping to detangle my hair better than the regular apply and rinse usage.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time, and my dry damaged hair is silky and soft for the first time in months!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Lush can get away with charging such exorbitant prices for their products, but they consistently do.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a lush addict too, but she reported that the American Cream seemed to smell funny on her.</li>
            <li> I heard the reason why Lush has such high prices is because the donate to PETA(Peolple for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling really soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> After the second time of using it, I already noticed a difference, and now I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeballing the Lush line for awhile - but hadn&#x27;t given it a try till now.</li>
            <li> the fun part with shopping locally for Lush was trying to figure out what was what (everything is written in japanese).</li>
            <li> It is pricy (like the rest of the Lush line)</li>
            <li> (I used this with the Stout shampoo by LUSH), and it&#x27;s frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Lush shampoo (Seanick) for awhile, but had yet to make the switch to a Lush conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft at all</li>
            <li> again I have to rant about Lush&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let that fool you though, as your hair will still be soft and manageable when it dries.</li>
            <li> WiTh LuSh</li>
            <li> It leaves it feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very straight dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend though, that a person start off with the small bottle first to see if it&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and they&#x27;re both exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> (I have no other explanation for why this didn&#x27;t work for me!).  </li>
            <li> For those who have not tried any of those products I am not sure how to describe the scent accurately.</li>
            <li> I suspect that some of the other reviewers aren&#x27;t consistent users of conditioners based on the raving reveiews they typed for this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rinsing after using it and to be honest, it&#x27;s completely useless.  </li>
            <li> In the shower, it really does not feel like it&#x27;s doing anything at all, but when you dry it - you&#x27;ll definitely see the results.</li>
            <li> Unlike drugstore and salon conditioners that just put a slick on your hair, AC rinses clean and you only have to use maybe a quarter-sized dollop for manageable great-smelling hair.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, long hair and have found that LUSH conditioners don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I do have very thick, long, curly hair, but I nevertheless expect more from something that bills itself as an extra-strength conditioner.</li>
            <li> Cream is worth trying (get the small bottle to try before shelling out the money for a big bottle) and recommended.</li>
            <li> though I was a bit worried about if it would be good or bad for me</li>
            <li> I would ignore Lush&#x27;s claims that their products reveal and treat what other products try to hide.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase again but because the price is so high, I doubt it will be an everyday</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner along with LUSH&#x27;s Big Shampoo about a month and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> It really is a scent that some either love or hate.</li>

            <li> It lathered rather well, and wasn&#x27;t hard to work through my hair at all, and it rinsed out easily without any gross icky residue.</li>

            <li> I have very long hair, and combing through it after using this conditioner was a nightmare,</li>

            <li> It was odd at first b/c the product lacks the slippery feeling that standard conditioners have, so it was sometimes difficult for me to gauge if I had used enough.</li>

            <li> (also something I was worried about because previous shampoo bars left my hair feeling really gross and icky)...</li>

            <li> only complaint is with the scent.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I regret is ordering the small bottle!  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no strawberry, no orange, no strong vanilla.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long and thick, and I used about a quarter sized dollop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not \\&quot;thick\\&quot; or heavy at all, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> A little price though</li>
            <li> It takes a little while for your hair to get used to not having that synthetic coating of goo, so stay with it for a week or two.  </li>
            <li> and that made me a little sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a heavy presence on my hair like some conditioners do.</li>

            <li> and it was hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> giving it 1 star because it was a big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> took 1 star off because the price is yeeeow expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but the 16 ounce bottle lasts me three months because I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  </li>
            <li> It smelled of artificial vanilla.</li>
            <li> Until I realized that... the after-smell was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner along with LUSH&#x27;s Big Shampoo about a month and a half ago.  I love the smell/texture/feel of both products to the point that I find it difficult to stop using them even when I see the havoc they are wreaking on my hair.  I recently started just using American Cream and have noticed a huge improvement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells amazing.  I had a friend tell me he could smell my hair in the middle of a smokey bar--it really stays with you!  It leaves your hair super soft, but definitely not detangled.  I find that I have to add a drop or two of a more detangling conditioner along with it in the shower (I use the light Biolage one) to get a comb through my hair.  I do think this added step is totally worth it based on the softness and delightful smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the best Lush has to offer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This conditioner smells like a field of vanilla (in a good way and not over powerig at all) and leaves my hair in much better condition, but it&#x27;s not as good as Lush&#x27;s Retread conditioner.  American Cream is a double strength conditioner, while the Retread is triple strength, and my hair can tell the difference.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With American Cream, I still need to use a little anti-frizz serum, but overall my hair condition is improved.  For my hair, the conditioner did everything it claimed to do (shine, softness, calmed frizz) and I really liked the smell.  A little price though, so I try to use it only once or twice a week.  I noticed that I get better results when I use one of Lush&#x27;s shampoos vs. a chemical filled store-bought one.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought the smallest size bottle Lush offers (don&#x27;t remember what it is) and have used it three times so far, and I&#x27;ve still got more than half the bottle to go.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;American Cream is worth trying (get the small bottle to try before shelling out the money for a big bottle) and recommended.</li>
            <li> At first I was alarmed. It smells incredible, but my hair was tangly and it felt like I needed a lot. But when it dried, my hair was just amazing and it still smelled great, too. After the second time of using it, I already noticed a difference, and now I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the conditioner. Just know that your hair will have to get used to not having all the silicones and goop on it you get from store-bought conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeballing the Lush line for awhile - but hadn&#x27;t given it a try till now. Before I had avoided it because of the very minimal chemicals still used in many of the recipes (when I was on a 100% natural everything kick)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;d shed that obsession - I decided to start trying other things, and out of convenience, I was using avalon organics (because I can buy it locally at the commissary, and its better than the super chem loaded stuff...) However.. it had been taking a toll on my hair. It was getting very dry and coarse feeling after just a week of using the avalon organics brand shampoos and conditioners...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - I started reading up again on Lush - it seems to have an either completely love or completely hate effect on people... but I wanted to give it a shot - and the bonus was that there&#x27;s a mall nearby that sells it. (I&#x27;m in Japan, so getting the good stuff that works wonders with my hair involved quite a bit of mail order - and when i was experimenting to find what worked best.. it was a lot of hit or miss with brands).. the fun part with shopping locally for Lush was trying to figure out what was what (everything is written in japanese). The ladies who worked in the store were very very very awesome, helpful, good humored women, and between a newspaper they had of the products translated to english, broken sentenced communication, trials and demonstrations, and in general, a good amount of girlish giggling between all of us - I left the store with a nice bag of goodies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair conditioner was one of them... though I was a bit worried about if it would be good or bad for me (I&#x27;d read mixed reviews and many who didn&#x27;t like the product line on a long hair community forum)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly long ramble condensed short.. my hair is amazingly silky and soft again!!!! I used the reincarnate solid shampoo in conjunction with this conditioner (also something I was worried about because previous shampoo bars left my hair feeling really gross and icky)... But this shampoo bar was awesome! It lathered rather well, and wasn&#x27;t hard to work through my hair at all, and it rinsed out easily without any gross icky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah - I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...)gross and icky)... But this shampoo bar was awesome!

            <li> I really, really adore this stuff. It makes your hair look/ feel/ smell wonderful. People in my office are always commenting on the way I smell because of my CONDITIONER. No joke. This is everything you hoped for in hair care.</li>
            <li> Wow! My hair was scented from this all day! It smells of vanilla, strawberreis and florals, very creamy, sweet and delicious. I have never smelled such an incredible fragrance, and people wouldnt not stop commenting my hair all day. I cannot wait to get the huge bottle, I know I will use this daily.  &lt;br /&gt;I find myself walking into the bathroom and opening the bottle, and sniffing it. Lovely!    &lt;br /&gt;I also found it to be really moisturizing, and I do color my hair and it&#x27;s usually long, yet it works.</li>
            <li> I really love what this does for my hair.  My hair is fairly long and thick, and I used about a quarter sized dollop. It was more than enough to work through my entire head.  If you expect to immediately feel that \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, then you won&#x27;t like this.  In the shower, it really does not feel like it&#x27;s doing anything at all, but when you dry it - you&#x27;ll definitely see the results. Smooth, soft, tangle free hair. I would highly suggest using this as a leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried rinsing after using it and to be honest, it&#x27;s completely useless.  It does absolutely nothing for my hair that way.     If you have really dry, damaged, or permed hair, this may not work for you. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;thick\\&quot; or heavy at all, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. The only downside for me was the scent.  I do enjoy it, but it&#x27;s not really how the bottle describes.  I smell a very strong herbal scent, with only a SLIGHT vanilla undertone.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and they&#x27;re both exactly the same.  There is absolutely no strawberry, no orange, no strong vanilla.  Just A LOT of the clary sage.  Still, I love what it does for my hair.  I would recommend though, that a person start off with the small bottle first to see if it&#x27;s right for you.  It&#x27;s pretty pricey to take a chance on the largest bottle only to end up hating it!</li>
            <li> I have never smelled a hair product as good as this.  The fragrance is best described as a sweet vanilla cake with cream cheese frosting, or as Lush and other reviewers have written, like a full-calorie vanilla milkshake - flecks of vanilla bean and all!  Now if the scent makes you drool as you are massaging it into your hair (using quite a bit I may add to get the full SILKY MERMAID HAIR effect), you will continue to drool all day long because this scent lasts and lasts.  The very first time I used it I pestered all around me to \\&quot;smell my hair, smell my hair!\\&quot;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would definetly reccommend first-time Lush buyers to add this to your shopping cart and use it right away when it arrives.  It is pricy (like the rest of the Lush line) but if you&#x27;re unsure, you can get the 3.3 oz bottle to test it out.  I advise using the conditioner right away so that when you fall in love with it, you can promptly order more (Lush takes a bit to ship)!!</li>
            <li> As a consistent user of all sorts of conditioners, I thought I may as well give this product a try...just to add diversity to my cast of product names, if nothing else.   The majority of previous reviews claim that American Cream smells good and makes their hair silky.  Sounded like a good deal.      First of all, I do not like the smell of this conditioner!  It has this weird chemical undertone that sticks to my hair much more than the nicer, creamier overtones.  So now I smell like chemicals. Yum?    I suspect that some of the other reviewers aren&#x27;t consistent users of conditioners based on the raving reveiews they typed for this (I have no other explanation for why this didn&#x27;t work for me!).  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know.  All I know is that my hair is very dry (I used this with the Stout shampoo by LUSH), and it&#x27;s frizzy.  Usually I use department store conditioners (Garnier, Pantene ProV, John Frieda)...which make my hair soft, manageable, shiny!  This didn&#x27;t.       As I said in the Stout shampoo review I wrote...I would ignore Lush&#x27;s claims that their products reveal and treat what other products try to hide.  Hair is comprised of dead cells, and the conditioners I buy from Walgreens make my hair happy, so I&#x27;ll keep using those from now on!      I would highly recommend sticking with &#x27;generic&#x27; conditioners like John Frieda...which smells AMAZING, feels rich, is very reasonably priced, and leaves your hair feeling properly conditioned. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lush shampoo (Seanick) for awhile, but had yet to make the switch to a Lush conditioner. I decided to make American Cream my first conditioner based solely on the scent. It is wonderful!!!!! If you are a fan of the scent of Flosty Gritter, Twinkle , or the Shimmy Shimmy massage bar you will LOVE this since it is the same scent! For those who have not tried any of those products I am not sure how to describe the scent accurately. It does not smell like a strawberry milkshake to me, more like a sweet perfume. It really is a scent that some either love or hate. I have heard this is due to the clary sage in it. But for me I LOVE it!    As for the performance it is great. It was odd at first b/c the product lacks the slippery feeling that standard conditioners have, so it was sometimes difficult for me to gauge if I had used enough. Also, this product does not contain any silicone. All standard conditioners do ,so your hair might go through a transition period to get used to a non-silicone conditioner. This happened to me ,so at first I did not think the product was working properly. However, I stuck with it and I am glad I did as my hair no longer looks straw-like on the ends and is extremely soft.     This product is a home run! Again, though make sure you enjoy the scent as some either love it or hate it and it does tend to have a lasting scent in your hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I used this last night for the first time, and my dry damaged hair is silky and soft for the first time in months!  I had been using Aveda products, but noticed my hair was getting dryer, and the conditioners were not helping.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the scent.  It is very perfumey.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla or strawberries to me.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything natural.  It reminds me of a Body Shop product that was nixed a few years back, in the Brazil Nut line.  While it may smell a tad \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; the overall fragrance is a top note of chemical sweetness.  It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance, but it sure as heck doesn&#x27;t smell like any milk shake I ever ate.</li>
            <li> If you love sweet scents that linger and soft hair, this is the conditioner for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;American Cream smells AMAZING and will work wonders on any hair type, but is especially great for dry or damaged hair and may be too much for fine hair. And you have to give your hair a couple of weeks to get used to Lush hair products because they don&#x27;t contain any silicones which are used in MANY conditioners as a detangler (Pantene has a ton of silicone). AC is also great as a leave in.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was not at all special. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft at all and it was hard to rinse out. Also it cost way too much for the amount of product. Finally fragance not to my liking. It smelled of artificial vanilla.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this product at all. After reading the other reviews I expected the scent to be out of this world. It was decent, but certainly nothing to write home about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t condition my hair very well. I do have very thick, long, curly hair, but I nevertheless expect more from something that bills itself as an extra-strength conditioner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once again I have to rant about Lush&#x27;s prices. $7.95 for a conditioner is fine. $7.95 for a conditioner this size is ludicrous. I don&#x27;t know how Lush can get away with charging such exorbitant prices for their products, but they consistently do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because it was a big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I love most all Lush products, so I was delighted when my best friend passed an American Cream my way. She&#x27;s a lush addict too, but she reported that the American Cream seemed to smell funny on her. I loved the way it smelled in the bottle, and I loved the way it smelled when I used it! I was ready to go online and order myself another bottle. Until I realized that... the after-smell was terrible. It actually made my hair smell like Raid, the pesticide! I passed the bottle along to my mom, who also liked the smell until she used it. Apparently, American Cream does not mingle well with some body chemistries. Pew!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this conditioner.  The scent is amazing, and you only have to use a small amount to get great results.  The only thing I regret is ordering the small bottle!  I am now a Lush fan for life!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of ordering this based on the raves about how good it smells, don&#x27;t bother.  It promises honey, vanilla, strawberry, and orange and delivers none of the above.  Instead, it has a strong chemical scent that really does stick with you throughout the day.    Aside from that, it doesn&#x27;t condition well at all.  I have very long hair, and combing through it after using this conditioner was a nightmare, like I hadn&#x27;t used anything after shampooing at all.</li>
            <li> American Cream is one of the most delightfully scented conditioners you can buy anywhere. Yes, it&#x27;s vanilla and strawberry, but not that icky, thick, overly sweet chemical versions of those scents. It&#x27;s warmer, and there&#x27;s a bit of floral to it too.  &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as slick in the shower as most conditioners. This is in large part because it doesn&#x27;t use synthetic silicones to coat your hair. Don&#x27;t let that fool you though, as your hair will still be soft and manageable when it dries. It takes a little while for your hair to get used to not having that synthetic coating of goo, so stay with it for a week or two.  &lt;br /&gt;I find that just a drop or two (about the size of a pencil eraser) rubbed together in my hands makes a lovely leave-in conditioner too, cutting down static and helping to detangle my hair better than the regular apply and rinse usage.</li>
            <li> The scent of American Cream is a very nice, pleasant scent. I may not have gotten an excellent bottle because mine smelled only slightly of the Vanilla milk shake that everyone raves about. However, the performance of the product was quite good. It didn&#x27;t leave a heavy presence on my hair like some conditioners do. It left my hair feeling really soft and very manageable. I have extremely long, dry hair so I did have to use quite a bit of it though and that made me a little sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took 1 star off because the price is yeeeow expensive. I bought the smallest bottle, just to try it. I will purchase again but because the price is so high, I doubt it will be an everyday conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great conditioner though, if you can afford it. So I definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> I heard the reason why Lush has such high prices is because the donate to PETA(Peolple for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) so when you buy something your helping an animal. &lt;br /&gt;I think the Lush stuff wouldf be worth it anyway! &lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;) &lt;br /&gt;I &amp;lt;333333 LUSH!!!!!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;3ObSeSsEd WiTh LuSh</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.  LUSH has the best smelly stuff.  I have curly, long hair and have found that LUSH conditioners don&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve tried most of them and they don&#x27;t condition as well as salon, or even most drugstore conditioners.  I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t work well, they just don&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I give it 2 stars for the lovely smell!</li>
            <li> American Cream is worth every penny I pay for it.  Unlike drugstore and salon conditioners that just put a slick on your hair, AC rinses clean and you only have to use maybe a quarter-sized dollop for manageable great-smelling hair.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but the 16 ounce bottle lasts me three months because I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  Treat yourself!</li>
            <li> I have very straight dry hair. Too many chemicals to color it in the past. This conditioner is perfect for my hair. It leaves it feeling soft and manageable. I LOVE the scent. It is really nice. This is my first choice for conditioner.</li>
