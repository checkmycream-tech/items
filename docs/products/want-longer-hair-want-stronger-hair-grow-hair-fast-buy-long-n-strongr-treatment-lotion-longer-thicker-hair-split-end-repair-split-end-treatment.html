            <li>Great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again :)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s 100% for sure</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the stuff you can see a difference in my hair</li>
            <li>My split ends are getting better and my hair even seems longer already.  </li>
            <li>you will find out that you need more conditioning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything and it felt that my hair was dryer then before and broke more..</li>
            <li>but if you wash your hair before you get in it is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works</li>
            <li>and my hair didn&#x27;t grow any more than it had already been growing.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good, and it&#x27;s really easy, so</li>
            <li>Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I used up the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li>It will grow more quickly because of this.  </li>
            <li>The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
            <li>I was all excited to receive my package</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t kow this was a product you had to put on and wash out after you originally wash you hair.</li>
            <li>noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>This product is an excellent addition to my hair care routine and the good thing is you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li>I also love how much shine this product has added to my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it can be used only with a good conditioning and moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair is now soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, it leaves my lots of body and a clean light</li>
            <li>Within the first week my hair never felt healthier and it has grown 3 inches in 2 months!</li>
            <li>This purchase is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>like it will pour right out of hour hand.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair right before I started using it</li>
            <li>However, I would like to point out that I believe this product works best on thin, fine, fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a little growth :) but i wish i had more than one bottle because i used that whole bottle in one day.</li>
            <li>I am 100 percent satisfied and have ordered it for the third time.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait for next month to see more growth of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product and must say that what they have promised about growing hair fast is absolutely right...</li>
            <li>It made it super shiny and silky soft.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t rate it for that, but be warned the picture and packaging is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted my hair to be longer.</li>
            <li>Smells like straight baby oil, didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Too much money for something that doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
            <li>so I can tell its growing fast</li>
            <li>It is growing so fast my friends started asking me what I am using</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but maybe see if there is a larger size available somewhere.</li>
            <li>My hair started growing and looking much healthier.</li>
            <li>I got this it made my hair break and really oily</li>
            <li>So my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten much longer.</li>
            <li>I saw fast results.</li>
            <li>The thing I also love about this product, is that you can do your regular styling, or even dye your hair, and it is still soft, glowing, and growing.</li>
            <li>Right before the first time I received this product, I had just bleached out my hair 3 times, and dyed it back.</li>
            <li>My waves seem more sculpted and i have way less frizz.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>this stuff completely reversed the damage and my hair has been growing!!</li>
            <li>I will admit that i probably did not use it long enough to see if there was faster hair growth, but as far as the hair becoming stronger and or healthier, i don&#x27;t really agree!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you leave the treatment in for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>For so many years i have struggled to make my hair healthy and long, and now i found this product, and my hair is way past my back, when it was once to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to manage , less frizz in the humidity and appears longer already.</li>
            <li>If anything it is causing more split ends and actually making my hair shorter due to having the ends trimmed for the split ends.</li>
            <li>it really works my hair felt stronger after the first time i used it.i saw less breakage as i styled my hair.wonderful product my whole family loves it</li>
            <li>Very upset that i spent that much money on something that&#x27;s not even close to the description.</li>
            <li>I used this twice so far</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, manageable and completely stopped breaking.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair soft, I measured it too, nothing.</li>
            <li>Does nothing for my split ends and hair didn&#x27;t get longer any faster than it does naturally.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown 1/2 inch so far</li>
            <li>Takes up times and kind of tedious.</li>
            <li>It had no lather no matter how much i put on, it felt like if i was using water down shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;lotion&#x27; is really like soap run down by water.</li>
            <li>Not great when you have a super busy life and children to look after.</li>
            <li>The liquid is very very very thin and makes your hair super greasy!!</li>

            <li> The liquid is very very very thin and makes your hair super greasy!!</li>
            <li> If you have soft, fine, thin, fragile hair, you will see an increase in strength and less split ends (it absolutely DOES NOT weigh hair down at all either).  </li>
            <li> I want my hair long like to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> If you have coarse or dry hair it will not help detangle it and may make you feel a lack of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It was greasy and messy and I used this product for two months and did nothing as far as it growing my hair.</li>
            <li> so how long plz I have it in my hair now</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want your hair to grow long.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, Pat dry hair, apply and leave on for 2 minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> Tried blow drying my hair and just let it air dry and each time my hair came out brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry brittle and braking.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product for the second time (used it regularly a few years ago).  </li>
            <li> I found that when I used this product it left my hair slightly unsoften</li>
            <li> After using a half a bottle , I can say this product actually works.</li>
            <li> but overall it is making my hair a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> it was a little past my shoulders 2 months ago, my hair is now 2 inches away from the middle of my back!</li>
            <li> So does this really work why so weird feeling in hair like oliy feeling and smells how long do I have to keep it in my hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the lotion is more of an oil than a lotion, was a bit disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Used it every other day.</li>
            <li> It is not worth $20 for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Product texture was extremly water down.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for quite some time and never saw even a slight difference.</li>
            <li> In less than a week I noticed hair growth.</li>
            <li> it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> was a little fustrated by the size of the serum.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a tangled stiff mess.</li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this a few days ago and my hair has shown a lot of improvement.</li>
            <li> been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling worse.</li>
            <li> I have the product for a few weeks and already see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> I could tell that my hair was healthier, it seemed dried out until I put the conditioner in.</li>
            <li> Waste of money completey.</li>
            <li> A moneypit product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product was/ is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is for girls with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; hair who wash their hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I can wash everyday</li>
            <li> Not to mention I use heat tools on it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past couple of months and it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past week or so.</li>
            <li> Over the past month of using this my hair has grown an inch.</li>
            <li> (small)</li>
            <li> Sad to say, but all this product did was make my hair feel dry</li>

            <li> This stuff is magic! my hair was bad damaged because I would dye it from blonde to brown.. this stuff completely reversed the damage and my hair has been growing!! buying the shampoo next!!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good, and it&#x27;s really easy, so I think I&#x27;ll continue using it because it does work over time.</li>
            <li> For so many years i have struggled to make my hair healthy and long, and now i found this product, and my hair is way past my back, when it was once to my shoulders. I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I just bought this a few days ago and my hair has shown a lot of improvement. My waves seem more sculpted and i have way less frizz. I also love how much shine this product has added to my hair. I will be buying this again :) Not enough time has passed for me to see if it has helped my growth, but fingers crossed it will.</li>
            <li> It did work I saw results I&#x27;m am b happy with this product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results .Have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the health of my hair or speed at which it grows. The &#x27;lotion&#x27; is really like soap run down by water. It doesn&#x27;t lather or anything in your hair in fact it&#x27;s so liquid-like it will pour right out of hour hand. I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was all excited to receive my package but I was very disappointed when I got it. It was nothing like I was expecting, nothing like it was pictured. I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I won&#x27;t rate it for that, but be warned the picture and packaging is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using it for the past couple of months and it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair. If anything it is causing more split ends and actually making my hair shorter due to having the ends trimmed for the split ends. I ended up throwing the bottle out. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t kow this was a product you had to put on and wash out after you originally wash you hair. Takes up times and kind of tedious. Not great when you have a super busy life and children to look after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past week or so. And I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I really wanted my hair to be longer. So is there anything else you can send me that&#x27;s 100% for sure that will give me them results. I don&#x27;t want to think that I&#x27;ve been scammed or anything. I just want longer hair.</li>
            <li> I found that when I used this product it left my hair slightly unsoften but the growing process almost tripled.</li>
            <li> I like it, but the lotion is more of an oil than a lotion, was a bit disappointed about this. Hope it works, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> This made my hair oily and it has not done as listed. Product is simply just not what works for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, seems to be helping in healthier hair and growth</li>
            <li> Smells like straight baby oil, didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.</li>
            <li> it really works my hair felt stronger after the first time i used it.i saw less breakage as i styled my hair.wonderful product my whole family loves it</li>
            <li> Sad to say, but all this product did was make my hair feel dry and it did not grow or feel strengthened.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any difference in my hair&lt;br /&gt;It might take a lot longer to see any changes. I hope it works.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed until the bottle was gone, about 2 1/2  months I only wash my hair every 3 days, I saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because I didnt notice any difference in the condition of my hair it left my hair feeling worse.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work at all!!! I cant tell you how disappointed i was in this product..</li>
            <li> I used this twice so far and it make my hair fell like it growing over night</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I bought it 2 times and still no results. I don&#x27;t recommend it. Too much money for something that doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little growth :) but i wish i had more than one bottle because i used that whole bottle in one day. :0 lol</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this product. It was greasy and messy and I used this product for two months and did nothing as far as it growing my hair. This product did not stand up to its name</li>
            <li> After using a half a bottle , I can say this product actually works. My hair is easy to manage , less frizz in the humidity and appears longer already. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the stuff you can see a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I felt this did not work as well as the last one I ordered.  My hair grew 3 inches with the Silicon mix</li>
            <li> The liquid is very very very thin and makes your hair super greasy!! I never noticed any hair improvement either.</li>
            <li> My hair grows very slowly, like and inch every 6 months. Over the past month of using this my hair has grown an inch. I cut it quite short so I can tell its growing fast</li>
            <li> This product works very well, it leaves my lots of body and a clean light feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little fustrated by the size of the serum. (small)</li>
            <li> wonderful way to stimulate your hair to grow faster</li>
            <li> I like what this does for my hair. It made it super shiny and silky soft. The effect lasts for days so I don&#x27;t need to wash it so often. Plus, it helped it grow.</li>
            <li> I have the product for a few weeks and already see a difference in my hair. My split ends are getting better and my hair even seems longer already.  Great product! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  It leaves my hair a tangled stiff mess.</li>
            <li> Of all the hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried, this is the only one that gave solid results. My hair is now soft, manageable and completely stopped breaking. It is growing so fast my friends started asking me what I am using and I am amazed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a significant difference. My hair is shinier, fuller, thicker and it is growing like crazy! This product is an excellent addition to my hair care routine and the good thing is you only need a few drops. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 weeks ago. I can&#x27;t believe the change in my hair, my hair is longer and healthier and people stop me on the street to compliment me.this is the best product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product for the second time (used it regularly a few years ago).  Both times I&#x27;ve had great results.  However, I would like to point out that I believe this product works best on thin, fine, fragile hair.  If you have coarse or dry hair it will not help detangle it and may make you feel a lack of conditioner.  If you have soft, fine, thin, fragile hair, you will see an increase in strength and less split ends (it absolutely DOES NOT weigh hair down at all either).  It will grow more quickly because of this.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and must say that what they have promised about growing hair fast is absolutely right...But it does not moisturize well,after drying out your hair you will find out that you need more conditioning.I think it can be used only with a good conditioning and moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Waste of 20 dollars. Didnt work. My hair is the same as before. Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> So does this really work why so weird feeling in hair like oliy feeling and smells how long do I have to keep it in my hair I want my hair long like to the middle of my back so how long plz I have it in my hair now and it is greasy and I hate that feeling in my hair plz tell me it works thanks</li>
            <li> I could tell that my hair was healthier, it seemed dried out until I put the conditioner in. I have medium length thick hair and I used up the bottle very quickly. I would buy it again, but maybe see if there is a larger size available somewhere.</li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected!!! Very upset that i spent that much money on something that&#x27;s not even close to the description.</li>
            <li> This product makes my split ends GONE! I bleached my ends and the hair dresser cut it so short! it was a little past my shoulders 2 months ago, my hair is now 2 inches away from the middle of my back! SO PLEASED!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks, I use it about 3 times a week and my hair has already grown 2.5 inches!!!!! Unbelievable, will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> My hair is growing and getting thicker</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, its just oil in a bottle litterally its like olive oil. Waste of money completey. I dont recomend it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair soft, I measured it too, nothing.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. Really poor packaging as well.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work thinkin it would... I didn&#x27;t notice anything and it felt that my hair was dryer then before and broke more.. There&#x27;s nothing but sulfate (which are bad for the hair) and there was jojoba oil and tree oil(which are good for the hair) but all the ingredients is sulfate then the two oils. It&#x27;s a bad product don&#x27;t get.. I waisted like 20$ on this😑 invest your money on something else..</li>
            <li> It is not worth $20 for such a small bottle. I used a quarter of the bottle for one application.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work for me. Its just a waist of time putting in my hair. My hair length still the same. I will not recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair product. I saw results within a week. My hair started growing and looking much healthier. Friends have been complimenting me and asking what I am doing differently. Great product and well worth the money. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Still testing it out but overall it is making my hair a little bit thicker. Next I wanna try the shampoo with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried this for couple weeks now and it states see improvements in 5-7 days and i see no change.</li>
            <li> I forget to use it after shampooing</li>
            <li> I finished the bottle, using it every day just like the bottle instructs. Shampoo, Pat dry hair, apply and leave on for 2 minutes and rinse. Used it every other day. Tried blow drying my hair and just let it air dry and each time my hair came out brittle. Does nothing for my split ends and hair didn&#x27;t get longer any faster than it does naturally.  Definitely get any stronger. I dyed my hair right before I started using it and I can&#x27;t even see my roots yet, proving that it didn&#x27;t help it grow. A moneypit product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It make your hair too oily n make ur hair smells very bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and was gross</li>
            <li> I like it but its hard to use because its a liquid.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a difference</li>
            <li> The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price. The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing. The texturizing balm is worthless it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair. Despite all this I still finished all the hair products hoping I would still see growth but of course I didn&#x27;t and the condition of my hair is actually worse. My hair is dry brittle and braking. This product did nothing it promised. It is a gimmick product or scam and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend. I used this product for quite some time and never saw even a slight difference. Purchase something of quality- not this!</li>
            <li> i got nothing after using this product</li>
            <li> hard to do in the shower! but if you wash your hair before you get in it is okay. My hair has allready shown improvement</li>
            <li> I love this product it works</li>
            <li> I got this it made my hair break and really oily it made my scalp itch and the smell was aweful.. no i wouldnt recommend this</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product was/ is a waste of money. I was very disappointed with it! I will admit that i probably did not use it long enough to see if there was faster hair growth, but as far as the hair becoming stronger and or healthier, i don&#x27;t really agree! I would not personally recommend this product to anyone nor would i ever purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Did not get results from this product at all,a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is for girls with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; hair who wash their hair everyday. I have thick hair. I use a relaxer. So my hair is straight. I don&#x27;t have hair I can wash everyday so maybe thats why it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It suck not working at all</li>
            <li> Does support hair growth, though not as big an impact as implied. It provably just varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> Right before the first time I received this product, I had just bleached out my hair 3 times, and dyed it back. I also got an awful haircut from a friend. My hair was in the worst imaginable state. Not to mention I use heat tools on it everyday. I ordered the hair treatment lotion and it is the ONLY thing that has ever has worked for my hair! After one treatment, I noticed the change in texture of my hair. In less than a week I noticed hair growth. Just make sure you leave the treatment in for a few minutes before rinsing. The thing I also love about this product, is that you can do your regular styling, or even dye your hair, and it is still soft, glowing, and growing. This purchase is totally worth it. I am 100 percent satisfied and have ordered it for the third time. My hair has gotten much longer.</li>
            <li> This product is a waist of money. I have thin shirt hair and I wanted it to grow out so I bought this product. Truth be told I used it as directed and my hair didn&#x27;t grow any more than it had already been growing. If I were you I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. It was a waist of money that I could have used to buy me a different hair product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it works!  I love how my hair is now soft, shiny and smooth. I saw fast results. My hair has grown 1/2 inch so far and I can&#x27;t wait for next month to see more growth of my hair. I recommend this product if you want your hair to grow long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  But let me tell you.  Within the first week my hair never felt healthier and it has grown 3 inches in 2 months!</li>
