            <li>If you can get over the cost, these are great soaps.</li>
            <li>I use them to make liquid soap which greatly extends its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also makes a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use tea tree for skin conditions and this is great</li>

            <li>Since I started using the tea tree, my skin has been great.</li>
            <li>I had a 32oz liquid version of this formula and now prefer it in bar form as is easier to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>but I prefer bar soap to liquid, so this was a good find.</li>
            <li>This soap is really good for my grandsons excema</li>
            <li>Had a wonderful clean feel that complemented the tea tree scent.</li>
            <li>Using it in my DIY laundry detergent and love it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice soap for the shower.</li>
            <li>great, great, great, this soap is great for sensitive skin or acne skin great to use on a daily bases</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>There was not one thing that made me come to this opinion, just more of an across the board &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;amazing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>love Dr Bronners soap great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very refreshing in a hot shower&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about this product and overall it was okay.</li>
            <li>The scent is as described, a strong tea tree scent.</li>
            <li>They seem to be too strong or too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as tea tree oil shampoo, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount of tea tree oil used is perfect-- suitable for your face and delicate areas, yet it still has antibiotic properties.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and feels smooth when using it.</li>
            <li>I use this for a facial and perineal wash,works great</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying and lathers good and the smell (which I like) helps clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li>Skin felt super clean, completely striped oil and dirt and thus would recommend a good lotion after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this soap just to try out - I was looking for something that would feel clean and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to purchase fancy shampoos and conditioners that may or may not fully clean them.</li>
            <li>It is very fragrant (a quality I love in a soap).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly though, you can get cheaper, &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;, and better smelling soaps at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>It does dissolve on your wet wash cloth fairly easily, which I see as good.  </li>
            <li>Cleans really well without over drying and we are very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed all Dr Bronners products I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Worth giving a try though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I liked this product a lot, but not enough to make it my main stay.</li>
            <li>This is really helping in my fight with my daughters&#x27; acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>and my mouth really likes what it is doing for it.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and feel of this soap.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>Absolute yes to cleaning and sanitizing makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Used it twice but couldn&#x27;t get past the very strong smell - I equated it to paint thinner.</li>
            <li>Company was quick to deliver (aside from a minor snafu regarding my payment method) and product was packaged well.</li>
            <li>The true test will be in the dry winter months here in PA.  </li>
            <li>And it makes all of them soft!</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin clear from my hockey gear.</li>
            <li>Really has helped his teenage body acne.</li>
            <li>To be blunt, it smells like industrial grease when it gets near your nose.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and years, highly recommend for a daily soap.</li>
            <li>It also tends to dry my skin out, which in winter is an absolute no.</li>
            <li>I use this as a face soap and it is the only product that keeps my skin clear all the time.</li>
            <li>Our local natural store sell it for $4.40 something</li>
            <li>I may not have noticed it in the description, but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived as two giant bars instead of just one bar.</li>
            <li>Each of these bars is quite large and Will last a long time is allowed to dry between uses.</li>
            <li>Wow I mean wow how did I ever live with out this soap</li>
            <li>(If you itch in certain places, it is gentle enough not to be irritating but it will stop the itching).  </li>

            <li> Great soap! Using it in my DIY laundry detergent and love it!</li>
            <li> Wow I mean wow how did I ever live with out this soap I&#x27;m a believer  great smelling too</li>
            <li> Used it twice but couldn&#x27;t get past the very strong smell - I equated it to paint thinner. I guess you either like the scent or not at all.</li>
            <li> I had a 32oz liquid version of this formula and now prefer it in bar form as is easier to get a good lather. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this to polish my teeth. I was told it would help with regrowth of enamel and my mouth really likes what it is doing for it.</li>
            <li> My son loves this!  Really has helped his teenage body acne.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> yummy smell and feel. it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry. it does melt like crazy if it&#x27;s left in the shower stream though.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use in my DIY laundry soap. It is very fragrant (a quality I love in a soap). For my purposes it was a little too moist/soft; however the laundry soap works ok. Can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s function as a hand or body soap.</li>
            <li> This is really helping in my fight with my daughters&#x27; acne prone skin! Cleans really well without over drying and we are very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap for the shower. It contains tea tree oil which has anti-fungal properties. Each of these bars is quite large and Will last a long time is allowed to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Use it for hands, body, and hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> If you can get over the cost, these are great soaps. I use them to make liquid soap which greatly extends its value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, you can get cheaper, &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;, and better smelling soaps at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for some time but I prefer bar soap to liquid, so this was a good find. Company was quick to deliver (aside from a minor snafu regarding my payment method) and product was packaged well. It&#x27;s not the cheapest soap in the world, but the quality is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> These are just as described and came in a timely manner.  I have enjoyed all Dr Bronners products I&#x27;ve tried so far and they will continue to be a daily essentials in our household.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I use this as a face soap and it is the only product that keeps my skin clear all the time. It also makes a great shampoo. I hope this never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes wonderful products. I use tea tree for skin conditions and this is great</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Lathers up well but that comes at a price.  It will dissolve within about 20-25 days.  The scent is refreshing and my skin has never been better.  The true test will be in the dry winter months here in PA.  I use this after my workouts at the gym.  I may try the defence soap but have no problems with using or buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This soap is really good for my grandsons excema</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the liquid</li>
            <li> This is a great soap. It helps keep my skin clear from my hockey gear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I use now.  It isn&#x27;t drying and lathers good and the smell (which I like) helps clear my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and feel of this soap. It lathers well and feels smooth when using it. Our local natural store sell it for $4.40 something so I&#x27;ll avoid buying it here. I really do recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap just to try out - I was looking for something that would feel clean and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Scent] The scent is as described, a strong tea tree scent. Was not too overpowering and did not dwell on my body after use. Very refreshing in a hot shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Clean] Had a wonderful clean feel that complemented the tea tree scent. Skin felt super clean, completely striped oil and dirt and thus would recommend a good lotion after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I liked this product a lot, but not enough to make it my main stay. There was not one thing that made me come to this opinion, just more of an across the board &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;amazing.&amp;#34; Worth giving a try though</li>
            <li> In the past, I have not been a fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  They seem to be too strong or too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big improvement.  Some have said that it melts away in water.  If you keep it dry in a soap dish, that does not happen.  It does dissolve on your wet wash cloth fairly easily, which I see as good.  The amount of tea tree oil used is perfect-- suitable for your face and delicate areas, yet it still has antibiotic properties.  (If you itch in certain places, it is gentle enough not to be irritating but it will stop the itching).  It is not as strong as tea tree oil shampoo, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, their choice of fragrances and oils added need to be reconsidered.  To be blunt, it smells like industrial grease when it gets near your nose.  The smell rapidly dissipates from your body, though.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this product and overall it was okay. I didn&#x27;t hate it but didn&#x27;t love it either. I had heard this product promoted skin healing, which I have NOT noticed it do at all. Overall it smells good but the glycerin separates something awful and the bar doesn&#x27;t last long because of this. It also tends to dry my skin out, which in winter is an absolute no. I will probably use what I have left, but I doubt I will ever reorder.</li>
            <li> great, great, great, this soap is great for sensitive skin or acne skin great to use on a daily bases</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and years, highly recommend for a daily soap. Non drying, lathers nicely, great scent! And you get to feel great about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this for a facial and perineal wash,works great</li>
            <li> Absolute yes to cleaning and sanitizing makeup brushes. No need to purchase fancy shampoos and conditioners that may or may not fully clean them. This soap works well on beauty blenders as well. I may not have noticed it in the description, but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived as two giant bars instead of just one bar. This is the only product that comes close to cleaning the densely packed bristles of my Sigma F80 kabuki brush. And it makes all of them soft!</li>
            <li> Since I started using the tea tree, my skin has been great. Smell is a little strange, but it works.</li>
            <li> love Dr Bronners soap great for sensitive skin</li>
