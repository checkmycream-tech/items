            <li>Good Powder - great to use by cutting off body hair removes the itch.</li>

            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way!</li>

            <li> a razor or electric shaver can leave behind.</li>
            <li> Using with the shavers and trimmer kept me from cutting myself.  </li>

            <li> Great product, am using it with my Cleancut ES412 Personal Saver per the recommendations I read from customers.  It smells great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Gotta have it, but you may have a reaction to the fragrance - I&#x27;ve had the unscented and this, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with either but I was just using it in connection with the T-Shaver for nether region grooming.</li>
            <li> Super FINE - and exactly what you need prior to shaving. Its not baby powder - this is cool and does the job. Use before shaving - when stuble starts to come back on hot days.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the process in which it took to order and receive. And much more happier with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and fresh when it is hot out or I am sweating. Helps clear up chapped areas, and smells good. I recommend buying a jar to put it in, and a powder puff for applying.</li>
            <li> Family who have issues with perspiration, regardless the temperature, will find this powder extremely useful.  Keeps a person dry the entire day with a single application.  I stock up when I buy this item, so that I never run out.</li>
            <li> There are a bunch of body powder formulations out there, but I keep coming back to the Sween (I always called it Fordustin but they have been bought or something.)</li>
            <li> We love the body cream and wanted to try this.  My husband is a mad user of this kind of powder and we like to use ones which are more natural and talc free...this is the one for us!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before and its much better then anything else out there for moisture control or in my case preventing a rash from my fat thighs rubbing together.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works wonderful. I would recommend this product to any and all who need a good powder</li>
            <li> Just powder. Nothing else.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Texture is a nice talcum powder like.</li>
            <li> bought this item to be used with a small personal electric razor (which recommended using a powder).  turns out this stuff is GREAT for general purpose body massage and touch.  odorless, i didn&#x27;t taste it!, but when you put gingerly on skin and gently massage its just wonderful. feels fantastic to the touch. mate now prefers over body oils.  wherever there is a hint of moisture on body, a little sprinkle and massage, its like silk.  why didn&#x27;t i know about this before spending lots of $ on fancy smelly massage oils that make you all sticky and need of a shower afterwards?&lt;br /&gt;you get a lot of mileage out of the container. had it for many months, bought back up just in case.  i dare not run out or mate would be VERY unhappy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, exactly as it is described.  My only issue is that the bottle was small.  I am very pleased with this products capability, only size is the issue.</li>
            <li> Smells great you you feel soft after you use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent powder. No fragrance, non irritating. Long lasting. Great for using with Cleancut shavers.</li>
            <li> Using with the shavers and trimmer kept me from cutting myself.  Easy to use and apply.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and seems to have a very fine texture.  It was recommended for use with a personal shaver, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  Even if it makes no difference with the shaver, it&#x27;s still very nice body powder.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone that occasionally needs something to prevent chaffing. Much better then using a baby powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with the Cleancut Personal Shaver.  i don&#x27;t normally use powder becuase it cakes, but i found this to be very silky, very fine, and perfect.</li>
            <li> This powder works a lot between than the Johnson Baby Powder I have been using and it keeps me dryer.</li>
            <li> as a powder it works well but as to helping with shaver is questionable a best.  Keeps body dry.as advertised.</li>
            <li> great to use with shaver</li>
            <li> I bought this powder to use while shaving, and it did a great job protecting my skin from the nicks, cuts and bumps a razor or electric shaver can leave behind. It&#x27;s got a pleasant, unassuming scent and it can even be used as a mild deodorant. My only issue with this is that is can get a little messy in application - even gently shaking this bottle seemed to get a fine layer of powder everywhere. An applicator would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to assist with bikini trimming. It can also be used for anything you&#x27;d use baby powder on. It&#x27;s silky and smoothing with a very light, non-irritating scent.</li>
            <li> This powder works great with the electric shaver that I bought on Amazon.  The hairs stand up and my skin doesn&#x27;t get a rash from the razor.</li>
            <li> Without sounding weird - I&#x27;m glad I tried this product out.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using J&amp;J baby powder all these years lol this stuff is sooooo much better!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clump, very fine. very effective in controlling moisture pleasantly</li>
            <li> If you are going to use a *personal* shaver of any kind...this is the powder you want to use. A little goes a long way and it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Good Powder - great to use by cutting off body hair removes the itch.</li>
            <li> Works fine but didn&#x27;t prefer the smell. It was more medicated smelling to me. I don&#x27;t regret trying but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great item! I use it for shaving my bikini-line with a batter operated razor. My daughter uses it to prevent chaffing under her arms. It is so smooth, soft feeling &amp; very absorbent. Perfect for keeping moisture away for great lengths of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the sent. like an off brand baby powder.  the previous incarnation did not have much of a sent, this does.  It is smooth and silky, but next time i will just get a box of corn starch so i don&#x27;t have the odd smell of this one. shame I love the &amp;#34;old for dusting&amp;#34; int he white and teal shaker can.</li>
