            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t look good when presenting a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS GOOD</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love this scent!</li>
            <li>I just love the scent!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting to buy this perfume for a while now and was ready to get a tester from ebay as I have discovered this wonderful price for a 3.3 oz full size product, so I am definitely delighted with this deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a fragrance that I loved more than this.  </li>
            <li>I own about twenty fragrances....</li>
            <li>- CK&#x27;s One Summer 2010, with its melon &amp; lime top notes, felt good as well.    </li>
            <li>Its scent is kind of like the Grapefruit cologne from Jo Malone, but richer in layers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming that they liked the perfume to ask for it.</li>
            <li>When I got it in the mail, I sniffed the box and thought it had a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that the smell was not overbearing nor overwhelming and the compliments I received were good ones</li>
            <li>This is by far some of the best  EDT out there considering the longevity is not so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many good citrus scents out there.</li>
            <li>I liked  the scent</li>
            <li>smell is nice</li>
            <li>It is fresh and beautiful fragrance, great for hot weather.</li>
            <li>it is light, smells good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic, because the cap is kind of cheaper finished than I bought before.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted - and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the light delicious smell, so sweet and clean.  </li>
            <li>The fresh summery fragrance is perfect- not too strong, not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light fragrance that just smells...</li>
            <li>It is surprising that they kept this under the women section, as this perfume is unisex (a bold step taken by Hermes).    </li>
            <li>most perfumes give me headaches, this one is very light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Got this one with a large discount, and I&#x27;m a proud owner now.</li>
            <li>I wear it often and am glad that I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I really love it because it&#x27;s a scent with brains.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments as I have with this scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I sampled it at Sephora about two years ago, and fell in love.   </li>
            <li>just love scent.</li>
            <li>OMG...love, love, love this scent...</li>
            <li>I wear it every day, and have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely...</li>
            <li>It is precisely as so many of you described.  </li>
            <li>To make a purchase of a fragrance without having ever experiencing it is quite risky, but NOT when you have so many people taking the time to intricately describe it so well for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I am falling in love with Un Jardin Sur Le Nil.  </li>
            <li>but i totally love it</li>
            <li>I Love Love by Moschino, it did not came as I asked it</li>
            <li>My wife &amp; I, we both love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I may look into the body lotion for some layering and hopefully more staying power.  </li>
            <li>I am not so sure about it&#x27;s staying/lasting power</li>
            <li>:) I love its freshness</li>
            <li>This Hermes scent was written up in the L.A. Times summer before last, as one of best perfume to wear for spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>Just go ahead and buy the 3.3 ounce since it&#x27;s a much better deal.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on it while with friends.  </li>
            <li>But I simply love it, its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with price of item and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>This scent has much more depth, though.</li>
            <li>A bit fruity, but with much more going on underneath.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, just be sure you don&#x27;t spend $100 on something that looks like an opened item.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is the epitome of refreshingly lovely summer scents.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite, also my daughter&#x27;s for whom this order was intended.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fruity or smoky</li>
            <li>I love this scent...</li>
            <li>I wear this for everything, but it is probably most appropriate for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied</li>
            <li>and I ordered two more to give away.</li>
            <li>I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT WHEN I WAS IN CHINA.</li>
            <li>lovely scent all around.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments wearing this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>and I love the scent...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;No need to say more I guess.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I can eliminate the drive time for more constructive activities.</li>
            <li>It is the genuine article!</li>
            <li>#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I love being original in all aspects of life and this EDT places me in a perfume category on my own.</li>
            <li>Very clean and refreshing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>In three years, I haven&#x27;t met another woman who wears Un Jardin sur le Nil, and that makes it kind of special, too.</li>
            <li>it was a Hermes fragrance, I liked the description of the fragrance in the copy and it was offered at a special price.</li>
            <li>It is feminine without being too sweet and has a clean, bright scent.  </li>
            <li>But so worth it!!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really describe the scent but the reaction received from customers was surprising because I was getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li>However, if your taste runs to a very sweet fragrance, this Un Jardin Sur Le Nil may not be the one for you.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is a great light scent for spring - more mature than what you would expect from a summer type scent.</li>
            <li>but I love the light scent.</li>
            <li>It is so light and refreshing</li>
            <li>It is so light, fresh, long-lasting, perfect for any season and so wonderfully sexy smelling that I simply get in a better mood when I catch a trace of this fragrance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the light smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A nice fresh citrus note for summer scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and clean, which I like.</li>
            <li>It smells really unique and many people stop me on the street asking about it.</li>
            <li>Received OK, was pack in the original box, however the fragrance severely diluted.</li>
            <li>Hermes has several great fragrances and is a favorite.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Once I put it and went to my friend&#x27;s house where we had a day-long indoor  cooking party with strong Indian spices.  </li>
            <li>Strong frangrances can give me a headache and while this is initially strong, it lightens.</li>
            <li>After visiting around 5-7 popular stores, I reached Sephora, where I met this scent for the first time.</li>
            <li>far as the scent itself goes, I have to say I am not a fan, and I&#x27;m actually surprised that there are so many people that are so impressed by this.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for 8 years, never failed to get a nice comment.</li>
            <li>It has depth like a fine wine.</li>
            <li>The savings is tremendous and I trust them to be authentic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, elegant, light and it&#x27;s the perfume</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing this perfume.  </li>
            <li>The order was confirmed at 65 Dollars</li>
            <li>Polite, adorable, durable, and fresh.    </li>
            <li>I like the free shipping.</li>
            <li>bought it for my girlfriend and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is light</li>
            <li>much I use it for a light daytime scent and it is not overwelling  just nice light scent</li>
            <li>This is a lovely light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is mild, but super memorable.</li>
            <li>If You love \\&quot; something special \\&quot; - it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clean light citrusy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s signature fragrance because of it&#x27;s light and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>What a lively and lovely scent!</li>
            <li>Its fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Gift recipient was quite excited with gift as it was identical to request on \\&quot;wish list\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change it continues its fresh scent!</li>
            <li>UJSLN for daytime and TDH for nights and special occasions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean and light.  </li>
            <li>It is a great pity</li>
            <li>This cologne has a light, fresh scent with just a hint of floral and of moss.</li>
            <li>I prefer something which is sober but holds its own signature.</li>
            <li>Still, at the end of the day, the perfume still smelled clear and nice, without fading away in the spicy atmosphere.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fresh and light. ...</li>
            <li>Just fabulous, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>This scent doesn&#x27;t come in true perfume.</li>
            <li>One of the best out there, not too strong, doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>its not girly at all and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>If you like clean, fresh and woody scent, you will probably like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, clean, and lite.</li>
            <li>It does seem as if it fades quickly though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my second botle, and I will keep buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>LUCKY</li>
            <li>Jean Claude Ellena, Hermes new inhouse perfumer, has created a simply elegant scent.</li>
            <li>It has a light gentle fragrance that lingers in a goode way.  </li>
            <li>Of free shipping, w/ fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>fresh.</li>
            <li>A LOT OF FUN,</li>
            <li>Brings a smile to my face each time I use it.</li>
            <li>We first bought it at a duty free shop in Greece and this is the first replacement bottle.</li>
            <li>This is innocent, but also leaves the impression of travels to far away places.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>And for a fresh fragrance, that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and was exactly what was described....</li>
            <li>As I am coming to the last drops of this wonderful scent finding a new fragrance has been essential, and I think I&#x27;ve found it!  </li>
            <li>I am very picky, and prefer musk based oils scents rather than overly sweet floral scents..</li>
            <li>have happily  used it for the past 3or 4 years</li>
            <li>this one will be my choice, is sweet but not too much&lt;br /&gt;smell clean and soft...</li>
            <li>The middle notes are also very strong at first</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when wearing this and also so many women stop me in the street to ask and write it down!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if a garden on the Nile River evokes this scent; I certainly hope so!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh, uplifting but sophisticated and feminine at the same time !</li>
            <li>The smell is very gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the typical strong perfumes most people put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exotic yet has some traditional ingredients; it is definitely pretty, but with an edge.</li>
            <li>I have almost exclusively worn this fragrance since I first found it in Paris five years ago.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smell it after 5 minutes even after spray more than enough.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at a duty-free shop in Japan.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We compared the scent strength with the professional perfumer and he confirmed that.</li>
            <li>It comes off pretty citrusy but then settles into a green/woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mediocre citrus at best, IMO.</li>
            <li>The first one I got from an airline duty-free, and I thought I paid a lot w/ their price when I saw Amazon&#x27;s price, bec.</li>
            <li>It starts out slightly fruity with it&#x27;s ripening green mango notes and an undertone of grass but finishes out with a lovely warm wood tone that stays with you for many hours.</li>
            <li>Morning is a special time for me: It&#x27;s the time to start my journey of the day, and it&#x27;s also when I spray the inside of my wrists to remind me that scent is far greater than physical appearance and the lack of genetic beauty canbe tricked by scent.</li>
            <li>Unique and not heavy.</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume because I had purchased a smaller bottle last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was different than I anticipated with some unusual top notes.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of spring - new blooms and fresh grass -</li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear to work.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so light, it could be worn daily.</li>
            <li>I have worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 12 years....</li>
            <li>really.  </li>
            <li>VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
            <li>Does not smell like the real ones in the Dept store.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I wish i added some money and bought the real one.</li>
            <li>it has light notes with lasting power throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li>It is a light, crisp, green apple scent that murmurs of cool summers and enticing meadows.  </li>
            <li>i really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I knew this would be a light scent, knowing that the perfumer who created this, Jean-Claude Ellena, is the same guy who did Eau Parfumée au Thé Vert for Bulgari.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this product and some people around me, sometimes stop and ask what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>This is a very uplifting scent, that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>This perfume is lovely and green and fresh citrus.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price is always better than in stores and the product quality is the same, no less.</li>
            <li>I know that it is green citrus, but the blending of the top notes almost makes some kind of other ontological olfactory entity - it&#x27;s like something out of a 50&#x27;s horror movie.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;ve given up all other colognes since I discovered this one three years ago.</li>
            <li>I spent my childhood at India, where we used to pick green mangoes right from the fruit-laden trees, and the surrounding air would be full with a mesmerizing yet refreshing aroma.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some scents, but it is nice that it is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>and then they die down to a very light scent also.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how you can really rate a perfume as a like or dislike - individual tastes and chemistries are so different - but I am going to say that I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel down, if I wear this perfume, it makes me feel better for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>The bottle sprayed at full volume at the very first press, and there seems to be slight signs of being opened with the box.</li>
            <li>I just wish it were less   money :)</li>
            <li>And one quick note, the Un Jardin line is NOT for women only!</li>
            <li>This EDT was just ok for me, but not enough for such a high end product...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My preference is towards flowery, green, fresh and clean notes.</li>
            <li>I spray some on myself everyday though im on vacation and mostly around the house these days.  </li>
            <li>I get a new one.</li>
            <li>and then I tried this...and its my new go-to scent...</li>
            <li>new looking, boxed in shrink-wrapped plastic.</li>
            <li>Its very  fresh and has a smell of leafs, fruits and other sort of  smells.</li>
            <li>I usually go for more floral scents but wanted to add something new to my collection</li>
            <li>Love the green mango!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I love fragrance and at one point spent a lot of time working with genuine essential oils to learn a little about blending scent.</li>
            <li>To my nose, most modern commercial fragrance is far to heavy and tends to use coal tar derivatives.  </li>
            <li>There is a true burst of grapefruit, only at the initial spray that disappears with in seconds...</li>
            <li>For years my favorite fragrance has been Hermes&#x27; Caleche Eau Delicate which has been discontinued and too cost prohibitive to acquire a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a sophisticated and complex scent...</li>
            <li>This is not your WOW assault the nostrils type of scent.  </li>
            <li>All the notes in it are natural, outdoor fragrances</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a soft hint of sexy.definitely a womans scent.</li>
            <li>It is not strong like SO many of the perfumes are now that leave a smell after you have left the room.</li>
            <li>This one is unique on that it can be worn year round...</li>
            <li>Speaking of durability, this scent really lasts long.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this fragrance for about 10 minutes, until the top notes start to blend and leave one very gigantic unpleasant note that smells like wet pantyhose drying on a shower rod.</li>
            <li>The middle notes are very spicy, lacking any citrus scent (1 hour later).</li>
            <li>brought item into major retailer and Hermes rep</li>
            <li>Generally, I judge all my perfumes by whether or not they give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li>Subtle and light, this is hands down my favorite perfume for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>just very subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it smelled a little like men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li>It is one of the few fragrances that I consistently get compliments on.</li>
            <li>The top notes last very long on me, a few hours before what I perceive to be an abrupt transition to the middle notes.</li>
            <li>Fast transaction - and got the item for much less than I would in the store.  </li>
            <li>I wear this daily and almost everyday someone wants to buy it for themselves!</li>

            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it.</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t look good when presenting a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for day or evening, makes me happy every time I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!</li>
            <li> I just love the scent!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting to buy this perfume for a while now and was ready to get a tester from ebay as I have discovered this wonderful price for a 3.3 oz full size product, so I am definitely delighted with this deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a fragrance that I loved more than this.  </li>
            <li> I own about twenty fragrances....</li>
            <li> - CK&#x27;s One Summer 2010, with its melon &amp; lime top notes, felt good as well.    </li>
            <li> Its scent is kind of like the Grapefruit cologne from Jo Malone, but richer in layers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m assuming that they liked the perfume to ask for it.</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail, I sniffed the box and thought it had a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that the smell was not overbearing nor overwhelming and the compliments I received were good ones</li>
            <li> This is by far some of the best  EDT out there considering the longevity is not so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many good citrus scents out there.</li>
            <li> I liked  the scent</li>
            <li> smell is nice</li>
            <li> It is fresh and beautiful fragrance, great for hot weather.</li>
            <li> it is light, smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic, because the cap is kind of cheaper finished than I bought before.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the light delicious smell, so sweet and clean.  </li>
            <li> The fresh summery fragrance is perfect- not too strong, not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> This is a very light fragrance that just smells...</li>
            <li> It is surprising that they kept this under the women section, as this perfume is unisex (a bold step taken by Hermes).    </li>
            <li> most perfumes give me headaches, this one is very light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Got this one with a large discount, and I&#x27;m a proud owner now.</li>
            <li> I wear it often and am glad that I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I really love it because it&#x27;s a scent with brains.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments as I have with this scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I sampled it at Sephora about two years ago, and fell in love.   </li>
            <li> just love scent.</li>
            <li> OMG...love, love, love this scent...</li>
            <li> I wear it every day, and have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely...</li>
            <li> It is precisely as so many of you described.  </li>
            <li> To make a purchase of a fragrance without having ever experiencing it is quite risky, but NOT when you have so many people taking the time to intricately describe it so well for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I am falling in love with Un Jardin Sur Le Nil.  </li>
            <li> but i totally love it</li>
            <li> I Love Love by Moschino, it did not came as I asked it</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I, we both love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I may look into the body lotion for some layering and hopefully more staying power.  </li>
            <li> I am not so sure about it&#x27;s staying/lasting power</li>
            <li> :) I love its freshness</li>
            <li> This Hermes scent was written up in the L.A. Times summer before last, as one of best perfume to wear for spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> Just go ahead and buy the 3.3 ounce since it&#x27;s a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on it while with friends.  </li>
            <li> But I simply love it, its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with price of item and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This scent has much more depth, though.</li>
            <li> A bit fruity, but with much more going on underneath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, just be sure you don&#x27;t spend $100 on something that looks like an opened item.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the epitome of refreshingly lovely summer scents.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite, also my daughter&#x27;s for whom this order was intended.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fruity or smoky</li>
            <li> I love this scent...</li>
            <li> I wear this for everything, but it is probably most appropriate for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied</li>
            <li> and I ordered two more to give away.</li>
            <li> I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT WHEN I WAS IN CHINA.</li>
            <li> lovely scent all around.  </li>
            <li> I received many compliments wearing this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> and I love the scent...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;No need to say more I guess.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I can eliminate the drive time for more constructive activities.</li>
            <li> It is the genuine article!</li>
            <li> #34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I love being original in all aspects of life and this EDT places me in a perfume category on my own.</li>
            <li> Very clean and refreshing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> In three years, I haven&#x27;t met another woman who wears Un Jardin sur le Nil, and that makes it kind of special, too.</li>
            <li> it was a Hermes fragrance, I liked the description of the fragrance in the copy and it was offered at a special price.</li>
            <li> It is feminine without being too sweet and has a clean, bright scent.  </li>
            <li> But so worth it!!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really describe the scent but the reaction received from customers was surprising because I was getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li> However, if your taste runs to a very sweet fragrance, this Un Jardin Sur Le Nil may not be the one for you.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is a great light scent for spring - more mature than what you would expect from a summer type scent.</li>
            <li> but I love the light scent.</li>
            <li> It is so light and refreshing</li>
            <li> It is so light, fresh, long-lasting, perfect for any season and so wonderfully sexy smelling that I simply get in a better mood when I catch a trace of this fragrance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the light smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> A nice fresh citrus note for summer scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and clean, which I like.</li>
            <li> It smells really unique and many people stop me on the street asking about it.</li>
            <li> Received OK, was pack in the original box, however the fragrance severely diluted.</li>
            <li> Hermes has several great fragrances and is a favorite.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Once I put it and went to my friend&#x27;s house where we had a day-long indoor  cooking party with strong Indian spices.  </li>
            <li> Strong frangrances can give me a headache and while this is initially strong, it lightens.</li>
            <li> After visiting around 5-7 popular stores, I reached Sephora, where I met this scent for the first time.</li>
            <li> far as the scent itself goes, I have to say I am not a fan, and I&#x27;m actually surprised that there are so many people that are so impressed by this.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for 8 years, never failed to get a nice comment.</li>
            <li> It has depth like a fine wine.</li>
            <li> The savings is tremendous and I trust them to be authentic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, elegant, light and it&#x27;s the perfume</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this perfume.  </li>
            <li> The order was confirmed at 65 Dollars</li>
            <li> Polite, adorable, durable, and fresh.    </li>
            <li> I like the free shipping.</li>
            <li> bought it for my girlfriend and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is light</li>
            <li> much I use it for a light daytime scent and it is not overwelling  just nice light scent</li>
            <li> This is a lovely light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is mild, but super memorable.</li>
            <li> If You love \\&quot; something special \\&quot; - it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a clean light citrusy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature fragrance because of it&#x27;s light and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> What a lively and lovely scent!</li>
            <li> Its fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Gift recipient was quite excited with gift as it was identical to request on \\&quot;wish list\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change it continues its fresh scent!</li>
            <li> UJSLN for daytime and TDH for nights and special occasions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and clean and light.  </li>
            <li> It is a great pity</li>
            <li> This cologne has a light, fresh scent with just a hint of floral and of moss.</li>
            <li> I prefer something which is sober but holds its own signature.</li>
            <li> Still, at the end of the day, the perfume still smelled clear and nice, without fading away in the spicy atmosphere.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fresh and light. ...</li>
            <li> Just fabulous, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> This scent doesn&#x27;t come in true perfume.</li>
            <li> One of the best out there, not too strong, doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> its not girly at all and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> If you like clean, fresh and woody scent, you will probably like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, clean, and lite.</li>
            <li> It does seem as if it fades quickly though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my second botle, and I will keep buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> LUCKY</li>
            <li> Jean Claude Ellena, Hermes new inhouse perfumer, has created a simply elegant scent.</li>
            <li> It has a light gentle fragrance that lingers in a goode way.  </li>
            <li> Of free shipping, w/ fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> fresh.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF FUN,</li>
            <li> Brings a smile to my face each time I use it.</li>
            <li> We first bought it at a duty free shop in Greece and this is the first replacement bottle.</li>
            <li> This is innocent, but also leaves the impression of travels to far away places.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> And for a fresh fragrance, that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and was exactly what was described....</li>
            <li> As I am coming to the last drops of this wonderful scent finding a new fragrance has been essential, and I think I&#x27;ve found it!  </li>
            <li> I am very picky, and prefer musk based oils scents rather than overly sweet floral scents..</li>
            <li> have happily  used it for the past 3or 4 years</li>
            <li> this one will be my choice, is sweet but not too much&lt;br /&gt;smell clean and soft...</li>
            <li> The middle notes are also very strong at first</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when wearing this and also so many women stop me in the street to ask and write it down!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a garden on the Nile River evokes this scent; I certainly hope so!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh, uplifting but sophisticated and feminine at the same time !</li>
            <li> The smell is very gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the typical strong perfumes most people put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exotic yet has some traditional ingredients; it is definitely pretty, but with an edge.</li>
            <li> I have almost exclusively worn this fragrance since I first found it in Paris five years ago.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell it after 5 minutes even after spray more than enough.</li>
            <li> I first bought it at a duty-free shop in Japan.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We compared the scent strength with the professional perfumer and he confirmed that.</li>
            <li> It comes off pretty citrusy but then settles into a green/woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre citrus at best, IMO.</li>
            <li> The first one I got from an airline duty-free, and I thought I paid a lot w/ their price when I saw Amazon&#x27;s price, bec.</li>
            <li> It starts out slightly fruity with it&#x27;s ripening green mango notes and an undertone of grass but finishes out with a lovely warm wood tone that stays with you for many hours.</li>
            <li> Morning is a special time for me: It&#x27;s the time to start my journey of the day, and it&#x27;s also when I spray the inside of my wrists to remind me that scent is far greater than physical appearance and the lack of genetic beauty canbe tricked by scent.</li>
            <li> Unique and not heavy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume because I had purchased a smaller bottle last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance was different than I anticipated with some unusual top notes.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of spring - new blooms and fresh grass -</li>
            <li> It is light enough to wear to work.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so light, it could be worn daily.</li>
            <li> I have worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 12 years....</li>
            <li> really.  </li>
            <li> VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the real ones in the Dept store.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I wish i added some money and bought the real one.</li>
            <li> it has light notes with lasting power throughout the day and night.</li>
            <li> It is a light, crisp, green apple scent that murmurs of cool summers and enticing meadows.  </li>
            <li> i really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I knew this would be a light scent, knowing that the perfumer who created this, Jean-Claude Ellena, is the same guy who did Eau Parfumée au Thé Vert for Bulgari.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product and some people around me, sometimes stop and ask what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> This is a very uplifting scent, that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This perfume is lovely and green and fresh citrus.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon price is always better than in stores and the product quality is the same, no less.</li>
            <li> I know that it is green citrus, but the blending of the top notes almost makes some kind of other ontological olfactory entity - it&#x27;s like something out of a 50&#x27;s horror movie.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;ve given up all other colognes since I discovered this one three years ago.</li>
            <li> I spent my childhood at India, where we used to pick green mangoes right from the fruit-laden trees, and the surrounding air would be full with a mesmerizing yet refreshing aroma.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some scents, but it is nice that it is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> and then they die down to a very light scent also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can really rate a perfume as a like or dislike - individual tastes and chemistries are so different - but I am going to say that I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel down, if I wear this perfume, it makes me feel better for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> The bottle sprayed at full volume at the very first press, and there seems to be slight signs of being opened with the box.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were less   money :)</li>
            <li> And one quick note, the Un Jardin line is NOT for women only!</li>
            <li> This EDT was just ok for me, but not enough for such a high end product...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My preference is towards flowery, green, fresh and clean notes.</li>
            <li> I spray some on myself everyday though im on vacation and mostly around the house these days.  </li>
            <li> I get a new one.</li>
            <li> and then I tried this...and its my new go-to scent...</li>
            <li> new looking, boxed in shrink-wrapped plastic.</li>
            <li> Its very  fresh and has a smell of leafs, fruits and other sort of  smells.</li>
            <li> I usually go for more floral scents but wanted to add something new to my collection</li>
            <li> Love the green mango!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I love fragrance and at one point spent a lot of time working with genuine essential oils to learn a little about blending scent.</li>
            <li> To my nose, most modern commercial fragrance is far to heavy and tends to use coal tar derivatives.  </li>
            <li> There is a true burst of grapefruit, only at the initial spray that disappears with in seconds...</li>
            <li> For years my favorite fragrance has been Hermes&#x27; Caleche Eau Delicate which has been discontinued and too cost prohibitive to acquire a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated and complex scent...</li>
            <li> This is not your WOW assault the nostrils type of scent.  </li>
            <li> All the notes in it are natural, outdoor fragrances</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a soft hint of sexy.definitely a womans scent.</li>
            <li> It is not strong like SO many of the perfumes are now that leave a smell after you have left the room.</li>
            <li> This one is unique on that it can be worn year round...</li>
            <li> Speaking of durability, this scent really lasts long.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance for about 10 minutes, until the top notes start to blend and leave one very gigantic unpleasant note that smells like wet pantyhose drying on a shower rod.</li>
            <li> The middle notes are very spicy, lacking any citrus scent (1 hour later).</li>
            <li> brought item into major retailer and Hermes rep</li>
            <li> Generally, I judge all my perfumes by whether or not they give me a migraine.  </li>
            <li> Subtle and light, this is hands down my favorite perfume for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> just very subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it smelled a little like men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> It is one of the few fragrances that I consistently get compliments on.</li>
            <li> The top notes last very long on me, a few hours before what I perceive to be an abrupt transition to the middle notes.</li>
            <li> Fast transaction - and got the item for much less than I would in the store.  </li>
            <li> I wear this daily and almost everyday someone wants to buy it for themselves!</li>
            <li> Sophisticated and subtle, to be worn by women who can make a statement without smelling like one!!</li>
            <li> Only thing to remember when you choose a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent, it won&#x27;t last as long as others.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I adore the fragrance, fresh, not overpowering, subtle and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It is different,  but just did not live up to the hype for me personally, so</li>
            <li> Others have noted that it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Even Issey Miyake l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey does not even last that long on my skin.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s subtle from the time you first spray it, you can use it even in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li> After wearing it a few times, I really like this fragrance for summer; it is not sweet, but dry, light and airy with a subtle preence.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s normal or defected product.</li>
            <li> And lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> long lastiing scent,it&#x27;s not loud and lingering</li>
            <li> It also seems to last longer than other Eau De Toilette brands.</li>
            <li> Before this, I used White Linen, but Sur le Nil has it beat hands down.</li>
            <li> so I had the excuse to spritz a few hours later !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much distinction from the middle notes, perhaps a faint</li>
            <li> it is not too heavy for summer and is robust enough to wear in winter.   </li>
            <li> Not very long-lasting though</li>
            <li> The product arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li> the grapefruit portion is so short lived, it would have been a lovely overlay for the base notes..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pretty woman, but when I wear this I feel it.</li>
            <li> Was worried about the longevity complaints from other reviews, but I lotion up, and</li>
            <li> so when I was checking out the fragrances at the mens fragrance counter they had un jardin sur la nil tester along with the other hermes fragrances</li>
            <li> Later I came to know how hard the team of Jean-Claude Ellena hunted, along the banks of the Nile, to get this tone.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but check out The Perfumed Court for a decanted sample at a reasonable price, and Now Smell This for opinions.</li>
            <li> I am subject to migraines by aromas and if a fragrance gives me a migrane</li>
            <li> Not cool man, not cool.</li>
            <li> The shelf price at Sephora was around $125, so I decided for a little internet-hunting.</li>
            <li> The base notes are very woodsy, and the spice element lightens only slightly (after 2 hrs).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t explain it, but out of 30 bottles of designer colognes that I have, this is one of the few that lasts the longest on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not overpower and can be reapplied without a heavy cumulative effect.</li>
            <li> There is nothing heavy or oppressive about this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay about half of the retail price for the 3.3 oz.</li>
            <li> It was unfortunate when Sephora stopped carrying it, because it was the only place I could get it and even then, a three hour round trip by car.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not authentic.</li>
            <li> smalls like different , its fake.</li>
            <li> Un Jardin Sur Le Nil plainly does not do that!</li>
            <li> And I get this weird scent for a long time.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in department stores.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this after the reviews, but feel there is just something lacking in the base notes...</li>
            <li> Never get tired of this.</li>
            <li> WRONG</li>
            <li> Its a fake perfume.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BOTTLE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems so weird.  </li>
            <li> Smells expensive and truly evocative of a garden on the banks of the River Nile.</li>
            <li> Some people have gone raving mad in their reviews.</li>
            <li> IT IN CHINA IS SOOO EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I&amp;#34;m spraying some very expensive water.  </li>
            <li> I started laughing when i heard it was for women, i said; are you crazy!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Repeat order, my wife likes this perfume.</li>
            <li> Sumptuous dazzling and evocative.The only perfume for me.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing this perfume.  It has a light gentle fragrance that lingers in a goode way.  Generally, I judge all my perfumes by whether or not they give me a migraine.  I am subject to migraines by aromas and if a fragrance gives me a migrane then I know it is not for me.  Un Jardin Sur Le Nil plainly does not do that! In fact, it makes me feel goode when I wear it. I wear it often and am glad that I purchased it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great scent!!! At first I thought it smelled a little like men&#x27;s cologne but I love the light scent. It does seem as if it fades quickly though.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - and at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated and complex scent... There is a true burst of grapefruit, only at the initial spray that disappears with in seconds...The middle notes are very spicy, lacking any citrus scent (1 hour later). The base notes are very woodsy, and the spice element lightens only slightly (after 2 hrs). It is a great pity the grapefruit portion is so short lived, it would have been a lovely overlay for the base notes.. I am very picky, and prefer musk based oils scents rather than overly sweet floral scents.. I had high hope for this after the reviews, but feel there is just something lacking in the base notes...This EDT was just ok for me, but not enough for such a high end product...It is different,  but just did not live up to the hype for me personally, so I must recommend that you go into Sephora etc. and try this before purchasing...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Received from my husband for xmas.  I spray some on myself everyday though im on vacation and mostly around the house these days.  Even wrote a post about how much i loved it on Facebook.</li>
            <li> Great price for my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your regular girly perfume. I really love it because it&#x27;s a scent with brains.  Not just floral or spice, but a scent that makes you wonder: It&#x27;s exotic yet has some traditional ingredients; it is definitely pretty, but with an edge.</li>
            <li> I have almost exclusively worn this fragrance since I first found it in Paris five years ago.  It is so light and refreshing and I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments as I have with this scent.  It reminds me of spring - new blooms and fresh grass - it&#x27;s lovely!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a fragrance that I loved more than this.  Before this, I used White Linen, but Sur le Nil has it beat hands down.</li>
            <li> The order was confirmed at 65 Dollars and I was billed 125 dollars. Why? I would like to know. Ken</li>
            <li> Smells good but it doesn&#x27;t stay at all.  I can&#x27;t smell it after 5 minutes even after spray more than enough. Not sure if it&#x27;s normal or defected product.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a light, fresh scent with just a hint of floral and of moss. I love it so much that I&#x27;ve given up all other colognes since I discovered this one three years ago. I get compliments on it all of the time-from both men and women. It is light enough to wear to work. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some scents, but it is nice that it is not at all overpowering. In three years, I haven&#x27;t met another woman who wears Un Jardin sur le Nil, and that makes it kind of special, too. It can be hard to find in department stores. I first bought it at a duty-free shop in Japan. I usually pay about half of the retail price for the 3.3 oz. bottle at Amazon. Just about any woman who likes to wear perfume would appreciate this as a gift.</li>
            <li> Like the annoucement. Very good.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller !!!</li>
            <li> Every since I started wearing this cologne, people everywhere  ask what is it? I don&#x27;t tell them and is just great. Its very  fresh and has a smell of leafs, fruits and other sort of  smells. The box said is for unisex use and people think  is just a women&#x27;s perfume.WRONG</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. I sampled it at Sephora about two years ago, and fell in love.   I own about twenty fragrances.... just love scent. This one is unique on that it can be worn year round... it is not too heavy for summer and is robust enough to wear in winter.   It is one of the few fragrances that I consistently get compliments on. I just wish it were less   money :)</li>
            <li> I went perfume-hunting this summer along Boston&#x27;s fashion path - Newbury street. After visiting around 5-7 popular stores, I reached Sephora, where I met this scent for the first time. It is surprising that they kept this under the women section, as this perfume is unisex (a bold step taken by Hermes).    My preference is towards flowery, green, fresh and clean notes. On that day though, I seemed to like fruity notes too - CK&#x27;s One Summer 2010, with its melon &amp; lime top notes, felt good as well.    But this one, with its instant green mango notes, really carried me away. I spent my childhood at India, where we used to pick green mangoes right from the fruit-laden trees, and the surrounding air would be full with a mesmerizing yet refreshing aroma. This perfume instantly took me back to those days. And all this without looking at the composition. Later I came to know how hard the team of Jean-Claude Ellena hunted, along the banks of the Nile, to get this tone. Read at[...], it&#x27;s fascinating.    I don&#x27;t like the typical strong perfumes most people put on. I prefer something which is sober but holds its own signature. This perfume is just that. Polite, adorable, durable, and fresh.    Speaking of durability, this scent really lasts long. Once I put it and went to my friend&#x27;s house where we had a day-long indoor  cooking party with strong Indian spices.  Still, at the end of the day, the perfume still smelled clear and nice, without fading away in the spicy atmosphere.    The shelf price at Sephora was around $125, so I decided for a little internet-hunting. Got this one with a large discount, and I&#x27;m a proud owner now. My parents have similar tastes, and I&#x27;m planning to gift this to them too!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Get compliments on the fragrance. Will continue to purchase item.  Wish the fragrance would last longer. I like the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service.  Fast transaction - and got the item for much less than I would in the store.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie. I wasnt expecticg it bur it was really good. My aunt really loved it. It had a very good smell quality for the price!. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can really rate a perfume as a like or dislike - individual tastes and chemistries are so different - but I am going to say that I absolutely love this perfume. It is so light, fresh, long-lasting, perfect for any season and so wonderfully sexy smelling that I simply get in a better mood when I catch a trace of this fragrance!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Amazon&#x27;s handling and prices - it was a top-notch delivery and the best price on the Internet. I&#x27;ve been hunting to buy this perfume for a while now and was ready to get a tester from ebay as I have discovered this wonderful price for a 3.3 oz full size product, so I am definitely delighted with this deal!</li>
            <li> This perfume is lovely and green and fresh citrus.  I get so many compliments when wearing this and also so many women stop me in the street to ask and write it down! It&#x27;s very light and clean, which I like. And lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually go for more floral scents but wanted to add something new to my collection (I will skimp on lots of things but never on perfume). This is a very light fragrance that just smells...fresh. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it&#x27;s like a garden, citrus, and the beach. Because it&#x27;s so light, it could be worn daily. I always get compliments or people asking what I&#x27;m wearing. I want to try Mediterranee, too.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;est l&#x27;une des eaux de toilettes d&#x27;Hermes que j&#x27;aime beaucoup.  L&#x27;aromat dure toute une journée et très léger.  Je le recommande à toutes les femmes qui aiment une fraicheure constante. Et aussi, avec l&#x27;Amazone, on ne pait pas de frais de transport.</li>
            <li> People approach me all the time complimenting me on how good this scent is. I LOVE it! When I&#x27;m out it&#x27;s a no brainer- I get a new one.</li>
            <li> OMG...love, love, love this scent...I have worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 12 years....and then I tried this...and its my new go-to scent...it&#x27;s so fresh and light. ...it&#x27;s only wish that I would&#x27;ve found it sooner...already bought a second bottle as a back up.</li>
            <li> Garden (just like the name)is on my mind when I use this perfume. It is fresh and beautiful fragrance, great for hot weather.</li>
            <li> I wear this daily and almost everyday someone wants to buy it for themselves! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and when received It was scented water!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with Amazon thru sophiasbeauty.com - the item was not actual product.&lt;br /&gt;I brought item into major retailer and Hermes rep indicated this was a phony fragrance - it was scented water.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for best price and I got ripped off!&lt;br /&gt;Do not order from sophiasbeauty.com!</li>
            <li> I love the light smell of this perfume. I wear it every day, and have gotten many compliments on it. I recently smelled the ocean version, and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous, fresh scent.  Only thing to remember when you choose a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent, it won&#x27;t last as long as others.  This scent doesn&#x27;t come in true perfume.</li>
            <li> For years my favorite fragrance has been Hermes&#x27; Caleche Eau Delicate which has been discontinued and too cost prohibitive to acquire a new bottle.  As I am coming to the last drops of this wonderful scent finding a new fragrance has been essential, and I think I&#x27;ve found it!  I want to thank everyone that left favorable, and even unfavorable, reviews because it helped me make up my mind to give this a try.  It just arrived and I spritzed it onto the inside of each wrist.  It&#x27;s lovely...really.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean and light.  It is precisely as so many of you described.  I took it all on faith!  To make a purchase of a fragrance without having ever experiencing it is quite risky, but NOT when you have so many people taking the time to intricately describe it so well for everyone.  So, as I sit here writing this review...continually sniffing my wrist, I might add...I am falling in love with Un Jardin Sur Le Nil.  I don&#x27;t know if a garden on the Nile River evokes this scent; I certainly hope so!</li>
            <li> GOOD ，I LIKE It VERY MUCH！IT HAD GIVEN Me A LOT OF FUN,I&#x27;LL RECOMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS!NICE NICE GREAT</li>
            <li> The greatest fragrance ever !!!, January 2, 2008   By  Kuddel Daddel \\&quot;kuddel10\\&quot; (San Diego, CA USA) - See all my reviews     A must try ! My favourite cologne !!! Getting compliments from everyone.   If You love \\&quot; something special \\&quot; - it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Jean Claude Ellena, Hermes new inhouse perfumer, has created a simply elegant scent. It starts out slightly fruity with it&#x27;s ripening green mango notes and an undertone of grass but finishes out with a lovely warm wood tone that stays with you for many hours. Not overpowering but a great all around fragrance. Indulge yourself...</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the real ones in the Dept store. It&#x27;s not authentic.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! The fresh summery fragrance is perfect- not too strong, not too sweet.  Brings a smile to my face each time I use it. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just love the scent! Unique and not heavy. It also seems to last longer than other Eau De Toilette brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume because I had purchased a smaller bottle last year and loved it.  The price was greatly discounted, and it came promptly and in perfect condition!!</li>
            <li> Its scent is kind of like the Grapefruit cologne from Jo Malone, but richer in layers. Not very long-lasting though</li>
            <li> Its a fake perfume. I am very dissapointed. I wish i added some money and bought the real one.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product he smelled in a shop in paris. I started laughing when i heard it was for women, i said; are you crazy!! so i went on youtube and started reading and watching some reviews about it of guys using this product. I decided to buy it and give it a try if i didn&#x27;t like it i would give it to my girlfriend but i totally love it and so does she. it is a product that in my opinion totally fits either gender. it is light, smells good. sticks to your clothes, i got a lot of complements about it. its not girly at all and smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I Love Love by Moschino, it did not came as I asked it, I asked for 3.4 Oz and it came in 1.7 Oz the botle.</li>
            <li> I love fragrance and at one point spent a lot of time working with genuine essential oils to learn a little about blending scent. To my nose, most modern commercial fragrance is far to heavy and tends to use coal tar derivatives.  The fragrances I wear are mostly French created prior to 1960. However, I bought Un Jardin Sur Le Nil becuse it was a Hermes fragrance, I liked the description of the fragrance in the copy and it was offered at a special price. The fragrance was different than I anticipated with some unusual top notes.  After wearing it a few times, I really like this fragrance for summer; it is not sweet, but dry, light and airy with a subtle preence.  It is a wonderful fragrance to wear and to spritz on your bedding for a touch of luxery.  I look forward to buying this fragrance again. However, if your taste runs to a very sweet fragrance, this Un Jardin Sur Le Nil may not be the one for you.[[ASIN:B000P22VS2 Un Jardin Sur Le Nil By Hermes For Women.

            <li> My wife &amp; I, we both love it.  The smell is very gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It smells really unique and many people stop me on the street asking about it. Love it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume! We first bought it at a duty free shop in Greece and this is the first replacement bottle. I didn&#x27;t shop locally because Amazon is such a convenient way to get just about everything. The perfume arrived within a couple of days and in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific summer scent.  The only drawback is that it does not last long at all.  I may look into the body lotion for some layering and hopefully more staying power.  The package arrived in about 2 days. new looking, boxed in shrink-wrapped plastic.</li>
            <li> If I had a unlimited monies I would go to France to buy my perfumes, although this is alternative saves both time and money. I especially love this fragrance for summer it has light notes with lasting power throughout the day and night. Hermes has several great fragrances and is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Received OK, was pack in the original box, however the fragrance severely diluted. I brought  the bottle in Newman Marcus. We compared the scent strength with the professional perfumer and he confirmed that.</li>
            <li> What a lively and lovely scent! Appropriate for day or evening, makes me happy every time I put it on.  Lots of compliments received.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a Kris Kringle Gift, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because this is what the person wanted and I&#x27;m assuming that they liked the perfume to ask for it. When I got it in the mail, I sniffed the box and thought it had a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> This is innocent, but also leaves the impression of travels to far away places. It is not a one-note fragrance. It has depth like a fine wine.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments while using this fragrance. I am not so sure about it&#x27;s staying/lasting power but I can tell you that the smell was not overbearing nor overwhelming and the compliments I received were good ones :) I love its freshness</li>
            <li> This Hermes scent was written up in the L.A. Times summer before last, as one of best perfume to wear for spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;I  have happily  used it for the past 3or 4 years</li>
            <li> Never get tired of this. Someone always asks me what it is. Just ordered my 2nd bottle since I used up the 1st. Just go ahead and buy the 3.3 ounce since it&#x27;s a much better deal.</li>
            <li> most perfumes give me headaches, this one is very light and not overpowering.  I have received many compliments on it while with friends.  It is not strong like SO many of the perfumes are now that leave a smell after you have left the room.</li>
            <li> One of the best out there, not too strong, doesn&#x27;t last that long. But I simply love it, its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it. It is a great light scent for spring - more mature than what you would expect from a summer type scent. It comes off pretty citrusy but then settles into a green/woodsy scent. Strong frangrances can give me a headache and while this is initially strong, it lightens. Others have noted that it doesn&#x27;t last long. However, for me, it lingers for around six hours.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume and this was the best rate!</li>
            <li> Gift recipient was quite excited with gift as it was identical to request on \\&quot;wish list\\&quot;. I was pleased with price of item and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is not your WOW assault the nostrils type of scent.  You will not stink out the elevator or turn heads as you waft by.  It is a light, crisp, green apple scent that murmurs of cool summers and enticing meadows.  Sophisticated and subtle, to be worn by women who can make a statement without smelling like one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it before, perfect!</li>
            <li> bought it for my girlfriend and it is fantastic. i really recommend it. it&#x27;s a clean light citrusy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> I gave this juice five stars for it&#x27;s originality! This is by far some of the best  EDT out there considering the longevity is not so good. I wonder how this house (Hermes) can sell EDT at perfume prices? All I get is turning heads from both sexes asking &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I love being original in all aspects of life and this EDT places me in a perfume category on my own. I highly recommend it to anyone. And one quick note, the Un Jardin line is NOT for women only! It&#x27;s a unisex fragrance. Don&#x27;t take my word for it go to Hermes website and see for yourself and it&#x27;s also noted in the packaging of each Un Jardin EDT.</li>
            <li> I knew this would be a light scent, knowing that the perfumer who created this, Jean-Claude Ellena, is the same guy who did Eau Parfumée au Thé Vert for Bulgari. This scent has much more depth, though. A bit fruity, but with much more going on underneath. I can&#x27;t stop smelling it on myself! I would say it has moderate staying power. And it&#x27;s subtle from the time you first spray it, you can use it even in the middle of summer. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!  A nice fresh citrus note for summer scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites! Its fresh and clean! It doesn&#x27;t change it continues its fresh scent! Great price for this Hermes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pretty woman, but when I wear this I feel it. Morning is a special time for me: It&#x27;s the time to start my journey of the day, and it&#x27;s also when I spray the inside of my wrists to remind me that scent is far greater than physical appearance and the lack of genetic beauty canbe tricked by scent.</li>
            <li> An excellent scent.  Everyone I&#x27;ve spritzed with it seems to like it.  Expensive, but check out The Perfumed Court for a decanted sample at a reasonable price, and Now Smell This for opinions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a couple different note schemes for this, so I&#x27;m going to stick with what I know. I get quite a bit of unripe citrus on the opening. The mango seems the dominant note to me, and the grapefruit is always lurking in the background. The top notes last very long on me, a few hours before what I perceive to be an abrupt transition to the middle notes. The middle notes are also very strong at first and then they die down to a very light scent also. I don&#x27;t get much distinction from the middle notes, perhaps a faint floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far as the scent itself goes, I have to say I am not a fan, and I&#x27;m actually surprised that there are so many people that are so impressed by this. Some people have gone raving mad in their reviews. It&#x27;s a mediocre citrus at best, IMO. I enjoy this fragrance for about 10 minutes, until the top notes start to blend and leave one very gigantic unpleasant note that smells like wet pantyhose drying on a shower rod. And I get this weird scent for a long time. I know that it is green citrus, but the blending of the top notes almost makes some kind of other ontological olfactory entity - it&#x27;s like something out of a 50&#x27;s horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many good citrus scents out there. I do not find this to be one of them.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loves the perfume. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it looked like was opened already. WTF? there was no plastic wrapping around the product box and the perfume seems to have been used before. The bottle sprayed at full volume at the very first press, and there seems to be slight signs of being opened with the box. Not cool man, not cool. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just a Hermes quirk but it just doesn&#x27;t look good when presenting a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to get this.... I don&#x27;t know, just be sure you don&#x27;t spend $100 on something that looks like an opened item.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the epitome of refreshingly lovely summer scents.  It is my favorite, also my daughter&#x27;s for whom this order was intended.  Pricey, yes.  But so worth it!!  Shipment, delivery, and product were 100% satisfactory</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent scent. Love the green mango! Was worried about the longevity complaints from other reviews, but I lotion up, and wow! I get almost 10-12 hrs. Unbelievable! Can&#x27;t explain it, but out of 30 bottles of designer colognes that I have, this is one of the few that lasts the longest on my skin. And for a fresh fragrance, that&#x27;s saying a lot. Even Issey Miyake l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey does not even last that long on my skin. Highly, highly recommend. If you&#x27;ve never tried any Hermes fragrances, this and Terre d&#x27;hermes are the ones to consider. UJSLN for daytime and TDH for nights and special occasions. Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I work in retail so when I was checking out the fragrances at the mens fragrance counter they had un jardin sur la nil tester along with the other hermes fragrances and I immediately took a liking to its scent. I couldn&#x27;t really describe the scent but the reaction received from customers was surprising because I was getting so many compliments. It is light so I had the excuse to spritz a few hours later !</li>
            <li> I liked  the scent much I use it for a light daytime scent and it is not overwelling  just nice light scent</li>
            <li> smalls like different , its fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of this perfume since my mom gave it to me 4 years ago. It&#x27;s fresh, elegant, light and it&#x27;s the perfume I keep coming back to. Whenever I feel down, if I wear this perfume, it makes me feel better for the rest of the day. I&#x27;ve never had anyone tell me that they don&#x27;t like this scent. If you like clean, fresh and woody scent, you will probably like this.</li>
            <li> Subtle and light, this is hands down my favorite perfume for everyday wear. All the notes in it are natural, outdoor fragrances so it&#x27;s not an overwhelming fruity or smoky scent- just very subtle and lovely.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s signature fragrance because of it&#x27;s light and clean fragrance. The Amazon price is always better than in stores and the product quality is the same, no less.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...it&#x27;s fresh, uplifting but sophisticated and feminine at the same time ! I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it already....from both men and women! I was also very pleased with the service of this seller - 100% authentic, great bargain, and on time delivery!</li>
            <li> If I have to use just one perfume for the rest of&lt;br /&gt;my life this one will be my choice, is sweet but not too much&lt;br /&gt;smell clean and soft...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my second botle, and I will keep buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance since last summer 2014. I love it!!! Very clean and refreshing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance! It is mild, but super memorable. I have been wearing it for 8 years, never failed to get a nice comment. I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic, because the cap is kind of cheaper finished than I bought before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light fragrance.  It is feminine without being too sweet and has a clean, bright scent.  I wear this for everything, but it is probably most appropriate for daytime wear.  It does not overpower and can be reapplied without a heavy cumulative effect.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely light and fresh fragrance. I discovered this because of a compliment from someone on another cologne I was wearing. This was recommended to me and I love it! A substantial savings ordering on amazon.com. I order all my perfume/cologne through Amazon. The savings is tremendous and I trust them to be authentic.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product and some people around me, sometimes stop and ask what I am wearing. The first one I got from an airline duty-free, and I thought I paid a lot w/ their price when I saw Amazon&#x27;s price, bec. Of free shipping, w/ fast delivery. I was satisfied w/ my order from Amazon ( Beauty Encounter) and I ordered two more to give away. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS GOOD BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BOTTLE.&lt;br /&gt;WHATEVER, i SHOULD GIVE 5 STARS. I FEEL IN LOVE WITH IT WHEN I WAS IN CHINA. IT IN CHINA IS SOOO EXPENSIVE! LUCKY I HAVE IT NOW, IN USA.</li>
            <li> beautiful perfume...  lovely scent all around.  I received many compliments wearing this perfume.  I&#x27;ve been a fan for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a great daytime smell. It&#x27;s fresh, clean, and lite. This is a very uplifting scent, that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a scent I just cant seem to get enough of - I always have a bottle as back up so am never out of this scent</li>
            <li> For flower fragrance lovers this is the perfume to buy. I love it and it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores. It inspires my days</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and was exactly what was described....my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! Been wearing it for a 6 years. It&#x27;s my signature fragrance and I always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my granddaughter wears it and I love the scent... but it&#x27;s the oddest thing in the world!  I cannot smell it on myself and nobody comments on it when I do wear it.  It seems so weird.  It&#x27;s like I&amp;#34;m spraying some very expensive water.  So yeah.. it&#x27;s okay but I want to smell it on myself!</li>
            <li> whelll....&lt;br /&gt;the smell is nice</li>
            <li> I love This perfume it goes with my chemistry!!! I will order again</li>
            <li> I am so often asked:  &amp;#34;what perfume are you wearing?  It smells so good&amp;#34;.....&lt;br /&gt;No need to say more I guess.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for several years.  I love the light delicious smell, so sweet and clean.  There is nothing heavy or oppressive about this fragrance.  It was unfortunate when Sephora stopped carrying it, because it was the only place I could get it and even then, a three hour round trip by car.  But thank you, Sephora, because now I can order it on Amazon and I can eliminate the drive time for more constructive activities.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before the expected date. It is the genuine article! I adore the fragrance, fresh, not overpowering, subtle and long lasting. Smells expensive and truly evocative of a garden on the banks of the River Nile. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> long lastiing scent,it&#x27;s not loud and lingering it&#x27;s a soft hint of sexy.definitely a womans scent. will order lotion soon</li>
