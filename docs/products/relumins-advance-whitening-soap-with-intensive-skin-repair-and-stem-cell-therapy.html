            <li>but what im sure of is that it makes the skin very soft!</li>
            <li>so i had to rinse my body right away</li>
            <li>flawlessbeautyandskin.com/ and other sites are trying to sell this exact same product for $103.55 and more!!!!</li>

            <li>I used this product  with the Authentic Relumins Advance white Stem Cell Therapy,and together they did the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned but still have an uneven tone.</li>
            <li>I truly think one would have to use the whole kit to get any type of results.......</li>

            <li> Really like this soap, rather than plain glutathione soap.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the soap was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> And it last long as long as u put it in a dry container soap.</li>
            <li> Though, if you keep it on for too long (or tend to use this soap too often) it does have a tendency to sting -- minimize the time or usage amount, if this</li>
            <li> but it also dry my skin</li>
            <li> dry dry dry is all it does!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase to get my dark areas</li>
            <li> It just takes time to see results (with nothing to compare it to), especially if your dark marks (or shaded rusty areas) are as stubborn as mine are.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days , so I can&#x27;t tell if it works yet....</li>
            <li> This has now replaced the other glutathione soap I had been using.  </li>
            <li> This soap worked wonders for my niece who was struggling with dark spots.</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, it&#x27;s also been less expensive than my other dark spot remover</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> im not sure if it whiten the skin</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but the soap was not positive for me, a skin reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> of the problem areas that it helped reduced has been tanned areas on my body (though, I did end up using it ALL over) that made my skin look dark &amp; dull, somewhat rusty (or dirty)</li>
            <li> They must think people are complete idiots.</li>
            <li> and  I was a little desperate to have a whiter skin</li>
            <li> it dried my face so bad that I start seeing some wrinkles on my forehead.</li>

            <li> I truly think one would have to use the whole kit to get any type of results.......</li>

            <li> Really like this soap, rather than plain glutathione soap.  This soap is as described.&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping, and handling.  Nice suds, and mild fragrance.  Does what is says.&lt;br /&gt;Will be sure to buy again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! I&#x27;m fair skinned but still have an uneven tone. This soap worked to even out my skin very quickly! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so and already see an improvement! I would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> btw kojic is better! dry dry dry is all it does! will not waste one more penny on this soap, will stay  with original kojic soap!</li>
            <li> i bought this soap to whiten/lighten my skin because I am Asian and  I was a little desperate to have a whiter skin and it worked but it also dry my skin so i had to put lotion several times a day. Seems strong ingredients on it so i had to rinse my body right away or else it will irritate your skin. I only had it once. It is a bit pricey as well.</li>
            <li> So far , so good.  I will reorder two more of this soap. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I notice the difference on my first use, after some days it was visible for others.

            <li> I like the way glutathione soap makes my skin feel, and this soap has a stellar ingredients list.  This has now replaced the other glutathione soap I had been using.  I bought one for myself and one as a gift.  In south Texas the sun is relentless, and even when using sunblock it is a good idea to do damage control.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> flawlessbeautyandskin.com/ and other sites are trying to sell this exact same product for $103.55 and more!!!! WTH? They must think people are complete idiots. SMH Can&#x27;t wait to get this to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and my complexion is approximately 5 different shades from head to foot. LOL At my darkest (my face) I&#x27;d probably be close to a light chestnut color or if anyone uses Dior Airflash foundation, I am a 600 Mocha. Maybe that&#x27;d help you visualize. My arms though are much lighter and my legs or a mix of yellow and white. :/</li>
            <li> Noticed immediate results. My skin was not only whiter, brighter but firmer and taught Many comments about the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap , instantly you can see results . I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but the soap was not positive for me, a skin reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> I think this is working to lighten my hyper-pigmentation A LOT faster. I ordered only one due to the price, let&#x27;s see how much difference after I complete this bar!!!</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the Kojic Acid, Placenta, &amp; Glutathione Triple I just got better results with the Relumins Advance than the other one.</li>
            <li> Used it before...! Great! Pierrette</li>
            <li> this soap burn my skin..my skin turns red especially in my arms area after bath &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP IS REALLLY GOOD. I LOVE IT AND IT TOOK AWAY ALL THE DARK SPOTS AND ROUGH SKIN:)</li>
            <li> Love this product and have given to my friend ,she appreciate this and I will let you know after 10 days .</li>
            <li> This soap is great and I. Will order more</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the soap was too strong for my skin. it dried my face so bad that I start seeing some wrinkles on my forehead. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t whiten as fast as some whitening bar soap formulas it does moisturize, and repair skin blemishes last pretty long about 2-3 months depending on you keeping it dry after each use.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased great difference seen after using this soap will definitely order again to complete my underarms</li>
            <li> This soap irritated my eyes, I had to throw it away.  I would NEVER order this item again!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no any effect to my skin</li>
            <li> This soap worked wonders for my niece who was struggling with dark spots.</li>
            <li> This a great soap. As a guy who&#x27;s trying to get rid of my hyper pigmentation, I see that this soap helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Used two bars of this soap and I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results yet.</li>
            <li> im not sure if it whiten the skin but what im sure of is that it makes the skin very soft!</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, it&#x27;s also been less expensive than my other dark spot remover that&#x27;s much more pricey to use, that I could use all over my body. This is my second purchase to get my dark areas even lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon complete usage of my first bar, I did notice a big difference for the price that I paid, that (I knew), I wasn&#x27;t going to get &amp;#34;a lot of coverage with&amp;#34;, with any other small bottle creams (that cost more than twice, this amount).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the problem areas that it helped reduced has been tanned areas on my body (though, I did end up using it ALL over) that made my skin look dark &amp; dull, somewhat rusty (or dirty) looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I notice that my skin looks much brighter &amp; cleaner, with most of the dark shaded (tan) areas diminished (underneath my arms, back, and inner crease areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one ever really reads the what it says on the package itself before usage, but it says, when applying, to keep it on for 1 to 3 minutes for before rinsing it for better results. Though, if you keep it on for too long (or tend to use this soap too often) it does have a tendency to sting -- minimize the time or usage amount, if this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, it did what I was hoping that it would do. It just takes time to see results (with nothing to compare it to), especially if your dark marks (or shaded rusty areas) are as stubborn as mine are.</li>
            <li> I like it but results only last for around an hour after using it</li>
            <li> I used this product  with the Authentic Relumins Advance white Stem Cell Therapy,and together they did the job.I will order again.</li>
            <li> Nice soap.  Clean rinsing</li>
            <li> This soap is very nice better than others use at night..</li>
            <li> I think this is working faster. I ordered only one due to the price, let&#x27;s see how much difference after I complete this bar.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I think it will work on everyone&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I am loving this soap and it gives my skin a glow.</li>
            <li> Works good, but not my first choice.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my blemishes. And it last long as long as u put it in a dry container soap. I just cut it coz its very xpensive and it last for 8 mos.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my face along with a lightening cream. My skin is almost flawless!!</li>
