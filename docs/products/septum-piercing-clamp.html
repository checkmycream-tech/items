            <li>I got them on time and they were perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved it!!</li>
            <li>still using the item to this day works awesome</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Made the piercing lopsided which isn&#x27;t very good for business</li>
            <li>It worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Everything else was great.</li>
            <li>:) SOOOOOO recommend!!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all they are good for.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>but their still good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great but have not used it yet.</li>
            <li>And I needed the kind of clamp that has the extended sides.</li>
            <li>But that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>product came in well packet , clean and easily movable which is good and would order this product when needed for sure!</li>
            <li>It has everything that it said it was gonna have :)</li>
            <li>overall its a great product! :)</li>
            <li>The ear was a preliminary for the Septum piercing, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Works really good and exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>These clamps really came into to good use</li>
            <li>These septum forceps are good, I do recommend them to anyone who wants to pierce their septum</li>
            <li>&quot; but it was perfect for my average sized nose.</li>
            <li>Also, the part that&#x27;s attached to the tube is huge.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my small nose (the clamps that came with my piercing kit were huge, triangular, plastic monstrosities) and easy to sterilize.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be better tho if they came in exact gauge sizes</li>
            <li>The clamps I received were not the ones in the original picture.  </li>
            <li>piercings free handed (something i am not happy about having to do even though they were still a clean perfect piercing).</li>
            <li>The septum clamp came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Never got the courage to use it but seems perfect to me.&lt;br /&gt;Feels very sturdy, and there is very little room for it to come out</li>
            <li>Worked very well and made piercing quite easy.</li>
            <li>and it is exactly what it said it&#x27;d be !</li>
            <li>But when I was going to pierce my own, I guess my nose is shaped differently?</li>
            <li>It worked just right</li>
            <li>Its exactly as it is in photos.</li>
            <li>so I decided to pierce my septum without the forceps because my needles had came to my house first</li>
            <li>I used this clamp for piercing my friend&#x27;s septum, the piercing turned out perfectly straight and right where I wanted it.</li>
            <li>they did exactly what they were superposed to do and helped give a straight piercing.</li>
            <li>and it got here pretty fast</li>
            <li>It made the entire process easy and gave me a lot of confidence.</li>
            <li>Came fast even before it was supposed too.</li>
            <li>It works really well too</li>
            <li>and I have a wonderfully straight piercing.</li>
            <li>It has sharp pieces of whatever cheap metal was used to make them.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that it is difficult to be sure if you are right on the \\&quot;sweet spot\\</li>
            <li>This is a pretty standard tool so I would assume it would work.</li>
            <li>I got it very promptly before the estimated delivery date and it was exactly like the picture which I noticed people had an issue with in the other reviews.</li>
            <li>They work for amature work, but not for anything professional.</li>
            <li>The piercing went in straight and parallel.</li>
            <li>How on earth is this even remotely supposed to be useful for piercing the septum?  </li>
            <li>i am a firm believer in using clamps to get a clean piercing.</li>
            <li>However, what I received is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These clamps go completely flush together in the middle</li>
            <li>Because they were only $3, not worth my time to return them, just wanted to make sure nobody else had to waste their time with these.  </li>
            <li>(see the pictures I submitted) so that they are no more useful than pennington forceps for the septum.  </li>

            <li> I was worried because of the other reviews talked about the product being different from the picture.</li>
            <li> They were pretty much broken.</li>
            <li> I suspect this would have been a lot harder without the clamp.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it would be for someone with a larger nose though.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like the picture, one side is just a little hole and the other side resembles the picture but is closed so a needle couldn&#x27;t be pushed through.</li>
            <li> so theres absolutely no room to mess up.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> This clamp works wonders for how little it costs.  </li>
            <li> The ones I received are a little bulkier at the tips.</li>
            <li> It even came with a little baggy with temporary scorpion tattoos.</li>
            <li> I used these once and the edges started to rust a little</li>
            <li> Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am really impatient</li>
            <li> I always refused to do septums because of the vein in your nose, but these clamps make it so much easier and less painful</li>
            <li> They were SO cheaply made and just clamping my septum with them was painful because of the terrible soldering job.</li>
            <li> needless to say i had to do my clients</li>
            <li> Must have been bad luck.</li>
            <li> Completely worthless.  </li>
            <li> These are the WORST clamps I have ever used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product. It wasn&#x27;t sealed in the package so I&#x27;m gonna have to sanitize it myself. It has everything that it said it was gonna have :)</li>
            <li> These clamps really came into to good use</li>
            <li> Never got the courage to use it but seems perfect to me.&lt;br /&gt;Feels very sturdy, and there is very little room for it to come out crooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be better tho if they came in exact gauge sizes so theres absolutely no room to mess up.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I was worried because of the other reviews talked about the product being different from the picture. However, what I received is exactly what I expected. Perfect for my small nose (the clamps that came with my piercing kit were huge, triangular, plastic monstrosities) and easy to sterilize.</li>
            <li> Its exactly as it is in photos. metal septum clamp. I&#x27;m sure it works great but have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> I got them on time and they were perfect. Worked very well and made piercing quite easy. I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> product came in well packet , clean and easily movable which is good and would order this product when needed for sure! overall its a great product! :)</li>
            <li> i am a piercist and and i was looking for clamps for septum piercings. i am a firm believer in using clamps to get a clean piercing. i ordered these expecting the clamps that were in the picture, but what i recieved were your generic sponge hemostat forceps. nothing at all like the septum clamps i were needing. needless to say i had to do my clients piercings free handed (something i am not happy about having to do even though they were still a clean perfect piercing). when i tried returning them i was told i would have to pay return shipping and was not guaranteed that i would even be given a refund or exchange. i will never buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> They work for amature work, but not for anything professional. But I give it 3 stars cause it got the job done!</li>
            <li> i needed clamps so i got these.  they did exactly what they were superposed to do and helped give a straight piercing.</li>
            <li> These septum forceps are good, I do recommend them to anyone who wants to pierce their septum but that&#x27;s all they are good for. I am really impatient so I decided to pierce my septum without the forceps because my needles had came to my house first but thats just me. I couldn&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> I used this clamp for piercing my friend&#x27;s septum, the piercing turned out perfectly straight and right where I wanted it. It worked great.  But when I was going to pierce my own, I guess my nose is shaped differently? And I needed the kind of clamp that has the extended sides. But that was my own fault. But just as a warning, this may not work on all noses.  This clamp works wonders for how little it costs.  Great buy. (:</li>
            <li> Although I did receive a set of septum forceps, they are not as pictured in the posting. The ones I received are a little bulkier at the tips. Almost like they soldered tubes into a regular set of forceps. Not very pleased.</li>
            <li> Came fast even before it was supposed too. Works really good and exactly what i wanted. I&#x27;ve already made some money off of it so i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got my septum clamp and it is exactly what it said it&#x27;d be ! It works really well too (:</li>
            <li> I could see the copper underneath of the coating of silver paint. They didn&#x27;t even cover the entire thing in the silver paint. Was scared to use them. They were SO cheaply made and just clamping my septum with them was painful because of the terrible soldering job. It has sharp pieces of whatever cheap metal was used to make them. Would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. The pair I received doesn&#x27;t have the locking mechanism like the one pictured. Everything else was great.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could pierce my septum. It worked just right and I have a wonderfully straight piercing. The only problem I had was that it is difficult to be sure if you are right on the \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; but it was perfect for my average sized nose. I am not sure how it would be for someone with a larger nose though. This is a pretty standard tool so I would assume it would work. I got it very promptly before the estimated delivery date and it was exactly like the picture which I noticed people had an issue with in the other reviews. Must have been bad luck.</li>

            <li> The clamps I received were not the ones in the original picture.  These clamps go completely flush together in the middle (see the pictures I submitted) so that they are no more useful than pennington forceps for the septum.  Also, the part that&#x27;s attached to the tube is huge.  How on earth is this even remotely supposed to be useful for piercing the septum?  Because they were only $3, not worth my time to return them, just wanted to make sure nobody else had to waste their time with these.  Don&#x27;t buy.  Completely worthless.  Wish I could give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> These are the WORST clamps I have ever used. They looked like they sat out in rain because the metal was discolored. They were pretty much broken. Etc. Its not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> The septum clamp came quickly in the mail. I loved it!! I recommend this product to everyone. It even came with a little baggy with temporary scorpion tattoos. I would buy this again any time.</li>
            <li> still using the item to this day works awesome</li>
            <li> I always refused to do septums because of the vein in your nose, but these clamps make it so much easier and less painful :) SOOOOOO recommend!!</li>
            <li> So I order this and it got here pretty fast but once I opened it and went to use it IT WAS CROOKED!!! Made the piercing lopsided which isn&#x27;t very good for business</li>
            <li> I used this for an ear and septum piercing. The ear was a preliminary for the Septum piercing, and am glad I did. It made the entire process easy and gave me a lot of confidence. The piercing went in straight and parallel. I suspect this would have been a lot harder without the clamp.</li>
            <li> I used these once and the edges started to rust a little but their still good I guess.</li>
