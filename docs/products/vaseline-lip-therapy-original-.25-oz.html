            <li>but that&#x27;s the best part about it</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in yur makeup pouch or just thrown in your purse.</li>
            <li>this one works great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for eyelashes/lips</li>
            <li>Very impressed w/</li>
            <li>Very good lip therapy.</li>
            <li>great product, great seller!</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cute product and gets rid of chapped lips in no time</li>
            <li>But I still gave this 5 stars because it is fantastic on the kids lips in the winter, and is good for my son&#x27;s allergies.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love wearing lipstick, and we all know lipstick with chapped lips looks HORRID.</li>
            <li>I do not have any more to say,</li>
            <li>Vaseline has always been my favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Yes, the jar is adorable.  </li>
            <li>Anyway it works great on chapped hands but nearly 8 bucks for a \\&quot;jar?\\</li>
            <li>and I wake up with smooth lips.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly because it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
            <li>i was so excited</li>
            <li>Keeps your lips very welll moisturized! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>For this I could have gotten 2 LARGE ONES to serve better purpose.  </li>
            <li>I use the Vaseline for men skin cream and they did a special and I ended up with a couple of the lip therapys.</li>
            <li>With the extra $2 you have to pay for shipping, it&#x27;s definitely not the best bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>I apply it right before my lipstick, and it leaves my lips feeling absolutely fresh and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it runs out I can add more Vas from my larger container.</li>
            <li>Really, is that worth</li>
            <li>It really works on my lips!</li>
            <li>My lips feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love these tiny containners of Vaseline&#x27;s Lip Therapy.</li>
            <li>I love that this is tiny enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>No worries on this product, I won&#x27;t order from this particular company EVER and just go to the store to purchase.</li>
            <li>The only drawback for me is the adorable little jar.  </li>
            <li>The product listing CLEARLY states that the jar is 0.25 ounces.</li>
            <li>The vaseline isn&#x27;t hard, it is easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This little container of Vas is a useful size.</li>
            <li>My lips were so soft the next morning!  </li>
            <li>Again, if you would have read the listing and product info, you would have avoided spending $8 on something you could have gotten at your local drugstore for a whole lot less.</li>

            <li> I live in Alaska and the cold weather certainly does not help the situation.</li>
            <li> It helps dry lips!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what you were expecting, but it IS a tiny little jar.</li>
            <li> This overpriced product is in a tiny little jar about the size of my thumb.  </li>
            <li> My lips chap very easily, mostly due to weather.</li>
            <li> Love the product, Hate the deliver.  </li>
            <li> i realized how ridiculous that price was when i received a jar that was smaller than a quarter...</li>
            <li> No need to repurchase these little things.</li>
            <li> Very lubricating and tasteless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who needs chap stick everyday.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> There are small containers of lip exfoliant that can be purchased for around 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> I use it usually at night before I go sleep</li>
            <li> I must not have paid attention to the size - this tub is SMALL.</li>
            <li> I have long nails, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get any out without getting some under my nails.  </li>
            <li> I take ownership on my part, reading the the size wrong and of course the price should have raised a flag.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who needs chap stick everyday. I live in Alaska and the cold weather certainly does not help the situation. I used to use the brand Chapstick, now that I found this stuff I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly because it&#x27;s so cute! Yes, it&#x27;s small but that&#x27;s the best part about it (besides it moisturizing your lips)! It fits perfectly in yur makeup pouch or just thrown in your purse. I like trying different kinds of chap sticks/balms &amp; this one works great! I would recommend purchasing this online though. Buy it at Walgreens for $2.00!</li>
            <li> i saw this product in a magazine and i looked everywhere for it. Once i found it on amazon i was so excited but it cost almost $8. i realized how ridiculous that price was when i received a jar that was smaller than a quarter... it&#x27;s ssooo tiny!</li>
            <li> This little container of Vas is a useful size. I added sugar to mine and made it premade lip exfoliant. When it runs out I can add more Vas from my larger container. No need to repurchase these little things. There are small containers of lip exfoliant that can be purchased for around 30 dollars. You do the math.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! My lips chap very easily, mostly due to weather. I love wearing lipstick, and we all know lipstick with chapped lips looks HORRID. I have tried many expensive li moisturizers, and not one has done the trick as this one has. I apply it right before my lipstick, and it leaves my lips feeling absolutely fresh and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to the two star review above- The product listing CLEARLY states that the jar is 0.25 ounces. I don&#x27;t know what you were expecting, but it IS a tiny little jar. It&#x27;s NOT smaller than a quarter, though, I would say that it is a smidge bigger. As for it being \\&quot;overpriced\\&quot; - I got it for $1.99 at Walgreens. Again, if you would have read the listing and product info, you would have avoided spending $8 on something you could have gotten at your local drugstore for a whole lot less.</li>
            <li> Very lubricating and tasteless. I use it usually at night before I go sleep and I wake up with smooth lips.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute product and gets rid of chapped lips in no time</li>
            <li> Love the product, Hate the deliver.  These things are priced at .22 cents, yet you pay $6.00 to have them delivered. Really, is that worth it NOT. For this I could have gotten 2 LARGE ONES to serve better purpose.  I take ownership on my part, reading the the size wrong and of course the price should have raised a flag. No worries on this product, I won&#x27;t order from this particular company EVER and just go to the store to purchase.</li>
            <li> I must not have paid attention to the size - this tub is SMALL. But I still gave this 5 stars because it is fantastic on the kids lips in the winter, and is good for my son&#x27;s allergies.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyelashes/lips</li>
            <li> Very impressed w/ this product! I will continue to use in the future! Keeps your lips very welll moisturized! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> great product, great seller!</li>
            <li> I use the Vaseline for men skin cream and they did a special and I ended up with a couple of the lip therapys. Anyway it works great on chapped hands but nearly 8 bucks for a \\&quot;jar?\\&quot; Nah, I&#x27;ll get by</li>
            <li> It really works on my lips! My lips feel so smooth and soft. The vaseline isn&#x27;t hard, it is easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It helped my chapped lips just the article I read said it would.  I do not have any more to say,</li>
            <li> This overpriced product is in a tiny little jar about the size of my thumb.  I would never have paid $3 for this if I&#x27;ve seen it firsthand at a drugstore. With the extra $2 you have to pay for shipping, it&#x27;s definitely not the best bang for your buck.  Lesson learned - next time I&#x27;ll just get my lip balm from a grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li> I love that this is tiny enough to fit in my purse. Vaseline has always been my favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Very good lip therapy. It helps dry lips!</li>
            <li> I love these tiny containners of Vaseline&#x27;s Lip Therapy. I keep them everywhere - car, pocket, bedside, work,  purse, make-up kit, everwhere! The consistency seems thicker than standard Vaseline, adheres to my lips. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens for $1.69.  Yes, the jar is adorable.  I put chapstick on every night before I go to bed.  My lips were so soft the next morning!  Great stuff.  The only drawback for me is the adorable little jar.  I have long nails, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get any out without getting some under my nails.  If they ever put this in a tube, they&#x27;ll have a customer for life!</li>
