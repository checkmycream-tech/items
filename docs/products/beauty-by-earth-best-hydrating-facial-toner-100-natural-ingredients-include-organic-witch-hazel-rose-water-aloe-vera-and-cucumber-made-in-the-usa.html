            <li>have caused burning, flaking redness like many others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>In love with this toner.</li>
            <li>I threw it in at the last minute and I am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li>I love to use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li>I love all their products &amp; this one is lovely as well.</li>
            <li>Love the spray bottle.</li>
            <li>My best friend and I both use it daily</li>
            <li>I have used many types of toners , most of them alcohol-based, but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>Firstly it smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the spray bottle size.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love the spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li>Lovely face toner.</li>
            <li>I used to buy Vichy&#x27;s Thermal water spray, but after this not any more.</li>
            <li>I know that may not matter to some, but to me it speaks about the professionalism of the company and it gives me even more pleasure to use something that is so aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I love using it after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Its best to use this immediately after using your facial cleanser</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous too!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and works.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel.  </li>

            <li>This is a nice, light spray that is refreshing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this toner -</li>
            <li>refreshing after a work out...</li>
            <li>Love thiss, it&#x27;s non greasy yet hydrating to the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why it has taken so many years for women to realize that noxious chemicals have no place in skin care and, indeed, make-up.  </li>
            <li>but I thought I would give this product a try since I  don&#x27;t own a toner and really enjoy Beauty by Earth products.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many witch hazel toners</li>
            <li>Love the ability to spritz and run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love supporting small companies and if they continue to make wonderful products, they will be hugely successful!</li>
            <li>This toner is really nice and fresh!</li>
            <li>It is so calming, refreshing and makes my skin feel so soft &amp; beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I used this as a Christmas gift and it was VERY well liked!</li>
            <li>Took me so long to write a review, but this stuff is Awesome!  </li>
            <li>Who knew cucumber &amp; rose would make such a great combo?  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a quick, easy and safe way to correct their skin tone and texture!</li>
            <li>The rose water gives it such a light beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The 4oz bottle comes with a spray top that delivers a very fine mist that leaves my skin feeling pleasantly moist and supple, not wet.</li>
            <li>It is a very good idea to have the option of a spray, instead of the traditional bottles.</li>
            <li>Great product and made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>First, the rose water is fragrant and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, all natural, very refreshing feel on the skin</li>
            <li>I love to use it to set my make-up and works great for refreshing my face later in the day.  </li>
            <li>I thought I loved it so much on my face</li>
            <li>However my partner said that he loved the smell and found it to be very relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this toner, quick and easy spriz on face, feels and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin takes my makeup right off and has a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>This brand  face mask is good!, but this facial toner scent is too strong for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m totally loving this!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I welcome the “natural” revolution and all the wonderful products that are now available like this one, free of parabens, GMO, gluten, soy,  artificial additives and (especially important with toners) alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The bottle sprays in a light mist, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your shooting yourself in the face...</li>
            <li>This product is so gentle on my skin and smells like you&#x27;re in a rose orchard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li>cause it just makes my skin feel so hydrated, smooth and</li>
            <li>I wash my face and spritz this wonderful smelling toner on and wipe with a cotton round</li>
            <li>am one happy customer, and will only purchase this product to use as a toner.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with my Beauty by Earth Argan oil for my bed time facial routine and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started to use this on my arm pits and it&#x27;s making them look so smooth and</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the effects when using this as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and makes everything smoother.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried really cheap ones and that never panned out either.</li>
            <li>I am glad I took a chance because this toner leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and the scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful.</li>
            <li>good results and definitely have sent many of my friends over to buy their products.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far I have loved everything I have gotten from Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE using this right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smells strongly of roses upon application, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients have no weird junk in them and</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is organic and natural and feels light and airy, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and  so refreshed, an the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the toner for a couple days, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Great for hydrating a bit dry face skin like mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a moisturizing effect and it feels super light on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is clean and refreshed after I use it.  </li>
            <li>but this one was by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Amazing, my skin feels fresh, clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li>was really excited to try this due to all the great ratings and reviews however it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also it hasnt irritated my face which is amazing because nearly everything does.  </li>
            <li>And lastly, it is really making me get in a regimen of taking care of my skin as I love all of these products</li>
            <li>This toner feels fresh and light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Waited six months to write my review to really test the toner, love the smell and the moisture skin feeling after using it each morning.</li>
            <li>Started using it from winter to summer, in the winter when my skin is the driest my skin feels really fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using this for nearly a week I found that it was effective in use</li>
            <li>Beauty by Earth is a new entry in the fast-growing sector of natural skin care and I was happy to receive a substantially discounted sample of this toner for evaluation.  </li>
            <li>product itself has a pleasant scent and admittedly I could not accurately identify any of the separate ingredients as there are so many of them.</li>
            <li>It has a soft smell that is clean and fresh from the cucumber and rose water ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Liked that it was such a fine mist</li>
            <li>Great company, I want to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and fresh after I spray it on.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This product is so soft and fresh on my skin and smells like a rose water</li>
            <li>Smells like roses, but scent fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>is probably the best hydrating facial toner I have ever used, and believe me I have used several.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and every now &amp; then for a quick pick-me-up and because the smell is intoxicating.  </li>
            <li>I feel more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>The natural ingredients make it perfect for mature, sensitive skin like mine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with facial toners but this one is very refreshing and works just as listed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it occasionally and we both agree that it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will for sure reorder and I am looking forward to trying new products from Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin felt smooth, calm, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The facial toner does great when slightly chilled on a warm day, but also as a quick refresher.</li>
            <li>I love that it contains all natural ingredients as well!  </li>
            <li>This facial toner is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it actually makes my skin feel amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite toner I have used.</li>
            <li>Such a nice toner has a relaxing scent to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feel- is far more hydrating than water</li>
            <li>We need more organic and natural skin care products in the beauty industry.</li>
            <li>This is a beauty product worth buying and knowing the ingredients are organic fits right into my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on right after I get out of the shower each morning and it makes my face feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love this toner for a few reasons, the ingredients are completely pure, it makes my skin feel great, and it doesn&#x27;t strip any of my natural oils or vise-versa</li>
            <li>At first I questioned if it was worth taking with because my suitcase was already packed to overflowing.  </li>
            <li>The real pleasure is using it throughout the day to refresh and cool my face.  </li>
            <li>I really use it frequently because it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li>First of all, I really love how it it&#x27;s in a cute little spray bottle, very user friendly.</li>
            <li>I am not normally a fan of rose</li>
            <li>I only wish I could give them more stars.</li>
            <li>This toner is refreshing and perks up my face, especially in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of times but love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Facial Toner.</li>
            <li>so it is comfortable to spray directly at my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>well actually anything by this company as everything is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The argan oil is helpful but my skin still needed something more to combat drynes; so I started using hydrating facial toner.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this facial toner and how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>I have used this a couple times and it is the first toner in I</li>
            <li>Lovely facial mist...</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing very soon!</li>
            <li>I keep it right next to my bed on my nightstand and swipe my eyes with it prior to falling asleep, to remove makeup and dirt, and also just to feel so good before bed.  </li>
            <li>the 120ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a well labelled modern plastic bottle with a pump action nozzle delivering an accurate and consistent &#x27;shot&#x27; each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slight rose scent when you first spray it.</li>
            <li>Love this product, keep me not greasy all day long.</li>
            <li>Sent to me for review this facial toner and make up remover is made of a significant amount of natural ingredients and is available in a 120ml or 240ml size.</li>
            <li>Because this is alcohol free, it will not dry out your face.</li>
            <li>I tend to refrain from using certain products during the winter</li>
            <li>The weather has been challenging:  very hot and sweaty, followed by a week of much cooler temperatures and even a few summer thunder showers.  </li>
            <li>Second, the aloe vera feels smooth and moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I also suffer from ance and this helps rejuvenate my skin and make it feel much softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the toner for a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been that way my whole life.  </li>
            <li>This spray, however, is so convenient that I spritz my face three or times per day, making essential moisture available for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making tihs product.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>cause my skin gets so dry and easily irritated.</li>
            <li>Spray it all over your face or squirt some on a cotton ball to deep clean around blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily to clean my face at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>This will continue to be a main staple in my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li>It has a pump dispenser so you can spritz this deliciously-scented liquid all over your face and neck for a quick freshen-up, or soak a cotton pad for make-up removal and deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I would highly recommend, would be to sell this in a 1 or 2 oz spray bottle, so it can be carried in a purse.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on the high ratings.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li>The product is made of high quality ingredients and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that I can spray this over my made-up face without causing a melt-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After regular daily use for the last month, I am delighted with its skin clearing and hydrating properties.  </li>
            <li>Gentle to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really wakes you up, the slight smell of rosewater lightly falls on your face.</li>
            <li>I have used many toners that all left my skin feeling dry, but not this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also arrived quickly, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long before I could mist my way into a blissful refreshed state!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>toner has fantastic ingredients (natural and organic), and is gentle enough to use as part of your daily skincare and cleansing routines.</li>
            <li>And they are coming up with new product soon</li>
            <li>A larger bottle is also available, with double the contents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slowly reaching my confidence back because of this spray, as well as feeling good about using something this nature on my skin.</li>
            <li>I do not fault the makers of this as the ingredient are a high quality and seemed to all be natural.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft after using and the scent is soothing</li>
            <li>rarely apply argan oil during a busy day, it takes a little time for it to be completely absorbed by my hands</li>
            <li>I could tell right away that my redness was going down even after a first use.</li>
            <li>The is my second Beauty by Earth product,my first was the Chapstick..love,love it..</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky feeling, like toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>The air where I live is notoriously dry, especially indoors during winter months when heating systems tend to remove every naturally occurring moisture molecule available.</li>
            <li>Skin so soft and clear!</li>
            <li>I recommend it without reservation, especially as the ingredients are pure.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, t-zone skin and none of their products</li>
            <li>Wow is that not the case with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this facial toner for anyone who wants to brighten and wake their face anytime of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my face and then apply this once in the morning and once at night and my skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this toner</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the age where I need hydration, and when I apply this with my Trinity trio, I feel like I am young again.  </li>
            <li>All natural and works for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Does not strip my skin and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>All ingredients listed are natural.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are natural, no chemicals or alcohol!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But even after an hour my skin is still soft.</li>
            <li>And all natural.</li>
            <li>This is a good thing for chips and crackers because they don&#x27;t get stale.</li>
            <li>I love that it does not dry out my face which past toners had been doing.</li>
            <li>yet I can still use this toner without getting the tight, dry feeling most toners give me.</li>
            <li>My face looks fantastic, it is soft, less wrinkles, and I am showing a great-great difference on my forehead, upper eyelids, eye bags and neck line.  </li>
            <li>use argan oil each morning to soften my skin and on the ends of my long hair to tame the effects of static electricity.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry/ tight like a lot of toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li>But, as with so many other products, I was not able to use it as my skin reacted to it.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight fragrance I could detect the few times I used it, very mild and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely it would cause a stinging sensation when applying serums over it.</li>
            <li>This is helped clear up some dry, flaky patches on my nose and cheeks too!</li>
            <li>I really like this toner now, but it did take a little time for my face to adjust to it.  </li>
            <li>I can use this in good conscience knowing I&#x27;m not using bad chemicals on my face.</li>

            <li> have caused burning, flaking redness like many others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> In love with this toner.</li>
            <li> I threw it in at the last minute and I am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li> I love to use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I love all their products &amp; this one is lovely as well.</li>
            <li> Love the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> My best friend and I both use it daily</li>
            <li> I have used many types of toners , most of them alcohol-based, but this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Firstly it smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the spray bottle size.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love the spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Lovely face toner.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Vichy&#x27;s Thermal water spray, but after this not any more.</li>
            <li> I know that may not matter to some, but to me it speaks about the professionalism of the company and it gives me even more pleasure to use something that is so aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I love using it after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Its best to use this immediately after using your facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It smells fabulous too!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and works.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel.  </li>
            <li> Love using over makeup, after using the mask or just throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light spray that is refreshing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this toner -</li>
            <li> refreshing after a work out...</li>
            <li> Love thiss, it&#x27;s non greasy yet hydrating to the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why it has taken so many years for women to realize that noxious chemicals have no place in skin care and, indeed, make-up.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I would give this product a try since I  don&#x27;t own a toner and really enjoy Beauty by Earth products.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many witch hazel toners</li>
            <li> Love the ability to spritz and run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love supporting small companies and if they continue to make wonderful products, they will be hugely successful!</li>
            <li> This toner is really nice and fresh!</li>
            <li> It is so calming, refreshing and makes my skin feel so soft &amp; beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I used this as a Christmas gift and it was VERY well liked!</li>
            <li> Took me so long to write a review, but this stuff is Awesome!  </li>
            <li> Who knew cucumber &amp; rose would make such a great combo?  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a quick, easy and safe way to correct their skin tone and texture!</li>
            <li> The rose water gives it such a light beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The 4oz bottle comes with a spray top that delivers a very fine mist that leaves my skin feeling pleasantly moist and supple, not wet.</li>
            <li> It is a very good idea to have the option of a spray, instead of the traditional bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product and made from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> First, the rose water is fragrant and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, all natural, very refreshing feel on the skin</li>
            <li> I love to use it to set my make-up and works great for refreshing my face later in the day.  </li>
            <li> I thought I loved it so much on my face</li>
            <li> However my partner said that he loved the smell and found it to be very relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this toner, quick and easy spriz on face, feels and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin takes my makeup right off and has a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> This brand  face mask is good!, but this facial toner scent is too strong for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m totally loving this!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I welcome the “natural” revolution and all the wonderful products that are now available like this one, free of parabens, GMO, gluten, soy,  artificial additives and (especially important with toners) alcohol.  </li>
            <li> The bottle sprays in a light mist, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your shooting yourself in the face...</li>
            <li> This product is so gentle on my skin and smells like you&#x27;re in a rose orchard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li> cause it just makes my skin feel so hydrated, smooth and</li>
            <li> I wash my face and spritz this wonderful smelling toner on and wipe with a cotton round</li>
            <li> am one happy customer, and will only purchase this product to use as a toner.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with my Beauty by Earth Argan oil for my bed time facial routine and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started to use this on my arm pits and it&#x27;s making them look so smooth and</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the effects when using this as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and makes everything smoother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried really cheap ones and that never panned out either.</li>
            <li> I am glad I took a chance because this toner leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and the scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful.</li>
            <li> good results and definitely have sent many of my friends over to buy their products.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I have loved everything I have gotten from Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE using this right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smells strongly of roses upon application, but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients have no weird junk in them and</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is organic and natural and feels light and airy, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and  so refreshed, an the smell is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the toner for a couple days, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Great for hydrating a bit dry face skin like mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a moisturizing effect and it feels super light on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is clean and refreshed after I use it.  </li>
            <li> but this one was by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Amazing, my skin feels fresh, clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li> was really excited to try this due to all the great ratings and reviews however it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also it hasnt irritated my face which is amazing because nearly everything does.  </li>
            <li> And lastly, it is really making me get in a regimen of taking care of my skin as I love all of these products</li>
            <li> This toner feels fresh and light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Waited six months to write my review to really test the toner, love the smell and the moisture skin feeling after using it each morning.</li>
            <li> Started using it from winter to summer, in the winter when my skin is the driest my skin feels really fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> After using this for nearly a week I found that it was effective in use</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth is a new entry in the fast-growing sector of natural skin care and I was happy to receive a substantially discounted sample of this toner for evaluation.  </li>
            <li> product itself has a pleasant scent and admittedly I could not accurately identify any of the separate ingredients as there are so many of them.</li>
            <li> It has a soft smell that is clean and fresh from the cucumber and rose water ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Liked that it was such a fine mist</li>
            <li> Great company, I want to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and fresh after I spray it on.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This product is so soft and fresh on my skin and smells like a rose water</li>
            <li> Smells like roses, but scent fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> is probably the best hydrating facial toner I have ever used, and believe me I have used several.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and every now &amp; then for a quick pick-me-up and because the smell is intoxicating.  </li>
            <li> I feel more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> The natural ingredients make it perfect for mature, sensitive skin like mine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with facial toners but this one is very refreshing and works just as listed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it occasionally and we both agree that it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I will for sure reorder and I am looking forward to trying new products from Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin felt smooth, calm, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The facial toner does great when slightly chilled on a warm day, but also as a quick refresher.</li>
            <li> I love that it contains all natural ingredients as well!  </li>
            <li> This facial toner is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it actually makes my skin feel amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite toner I have used.</li>
            <li> Such a nice toner has a relaxing scent to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feel- is far more hydrating than water</li>
            <li> We need more organic and natural skin care products in the beauty industry.</li>
            <li> This is a beauty product worth buying and knowing the ingredients are organic fits right into my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on right after I get out of the shower each morning and it makes my face feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this toner for a few reasons, the ingredients are completely pure, it makes my skin feel great, and it doesn&#x27;t strip any of my natural oils or vise-versa</li>
            <li> At first I questioned if it was worth taking with because my suitcase was already packed to overflowing.  </li>
            <li> The real pleasure is using it throughout the day to refresh and cool my face.  </li>
            <li> I really use it frequently because it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> First of all, I really love how it it&#x27;s in a cute little spray bottle, very user friendly.</li>
            <li> I am not normally a fan of rose</li>
            <li> I only wish I could give them more stars.</li>
            <li> This toner is refreshing and perks up my face, especially in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times but love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> so it is comfortable to spray directly at my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> well actually anything by this company as everything is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The argan oil is helpful but my skin still needed something more to combat drynes; so I started using hydrating facial toner.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this facial toner and how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times and it is the first toner in I</li>
            <li> Lovely facial mist...</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing very soon!</li>
            <li> I keep it right next to my bed on my nightstand and swipe my eyes with it prior to falling asleep, to remove makeup and dirt, and also just to feel so good before bed.  </li>
            <li> the 120ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a well labelled modern plastic bottle with a pump action nozzle delivering an accurate and consistent &#x27;shot&#x27; each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight rose scent when you first spray it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keep me not greasy all day long.</li>
            <li> Sent to me for review this facial toner and make up remover is made of a significant amount of natural ingredients and is available in a 120ml or 240ml size.</li>
            <li> Because this is alcohol free, it will not dry out your face.</li>
            <li> I tend to refrain from using certain products during the winter</li>
            <li> The weather has been challenging:  very hot and sweaty, followed by a week of much cooler temperatures and even a few summer thunder showers.  </li>
            <li> Second, the aloe vera feels smooth and moisturizing on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I also suffer from ance and this helps rejuvenate my skin and make it feel much softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the toner for a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very refreshing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been that way my whole life.  </li>
            <li> This spray, however, is so convenient that I spritz my face three or times per day, making essential moisture available for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making tihs product.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> cause my skin gets so dry and easily irritated.</li>
            <li> Spray it all over your face or squirt some on a cotton ball to deep clean around blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily to clean my face at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> This will continue to be a main staple in my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li> It has a pump dispenser so you can spritz this deliciously-scented liquid all over your face and neck for a quick freshen-up, or soak a cotton pad for make-up removal and deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I would highly recommend, would be to sell this in a 1 or 2 oz spray bottle, so it can be carried in a purse.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the high ratings.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product,</li>
            <li> The product is made of high quality ingredients and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that I can spray this over my made-up face without causing a melt-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After regular daily use for the last month, I am delighted with its skin clearing and hydrating properties.  </li>
            <li> Gentle to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really wakes you up, the slight smell of rosewater lightly falls on your face.</li>
            <li> I have used many toners that all left my skin feeling dry, but not this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also arrived quickly, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long before I could mist my way into a blissful refreshed state!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> toner has fantastic ingredients (natural and organic), and is gentle enough to use as part of your daily skincare and cleansing routines.</li>
            <li> And they are coming up with new product soon</li>
            <li> A larger bottle is also available, with double the contents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly reaching my confidence back because of this spray, as well as feeling good about using something this nature on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do not fault the makers of this as the ingredient are a high quality and seemed to all be natural.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft after using and the scent is soothing</li>
            <li> rarely apply argan oil during a busy day, it takes a little time for it to be completely absorbed by my hands</li>
            <li> I could tell right away that my redness was going down even after a first use.</li>
            <li> The is my second Beauty by Earth product,my first was the Chapstick..love,love it..</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky feeling, like toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The air where I live is notoriously dry, especially indoors during winter months when heating systems tend to remove every naturally occurring moisture molecule available.</li>
            <li> Skin so soft and clear!</li>
            <li> I recommend it without reservation, especially as the ingredients are pure.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, t-zone skin and none of their products</li>
            <li> Wow is that not the case with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this facial toner for anyone who wants to brighten and wake their face anytime of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my face and then apply this once in the morning and once at night and my skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this toner</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the age where I need hydration, and when I apply this with my Trinity trio, I feel like I am young again.  </li>
            <li> All natural and works for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Does not strip my skin and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> All ingredients listed are natural.</li>
            <li> the ingredients are natural, no chemicals or alcohol!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even after an hour my skin is still soft.</li>
            <li> And all natural.</li>
            <li> This is a good thing for chips and crackers because they don&#x27;t get stale.</li>
            <li> I love that it does not dry out my face which past toners had been doing.</li>
            <li> yet I can still use this toner without getting the tight, dry feeling most toners give me.</li>
            <li> My face looks fantastic, it is soft, less wrinkles, and I am showing a great-great difference on my forehead, upper eyelids, eye bags and neck line.  </li>
            <li> use argan oil each morning to soften my skin and on the ends of my long hair to tame the effects of static electricity.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry/ tight like a lot of toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> But, as with so many other products, I was not able to use it as my skin reacted to it.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight fragrance I could detect the few times I used it, very mild and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> I also found that if I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely it would cause a stinging sensation when applying serums over it.</li>
            <li> This is helped clear up some dry, flaky patches on my nose and cheeks too!</li>
            <li> I really like this toner now, but it did take a little time for my face to adjust to it.  </li>
            <li> I can use this in good conscience knowing I&#x27;m not using bad chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> applied this only 3 times and it makes my face incredibly dry in some patches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter, and this toner helps to keep my skin from feeling parched by mid-afternoon.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be extra dry during the winter months</li>
            <li> but it may not be directly related to this toner, just the dry weather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent some money on some really expensive toners and just not been satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about rose-based skin care and find the scent captivating.  </li>
            <li> and my routine is not complete without it.  </li>
            <li> It definitely works as advertised and leaves my skin feeling softer, noticeably brighter, and less red.</li>
            <li> dont know how long that I like!  </li>
            <li> Really though, I am being serious...</li>
            <li> skin is dry</li>
            <li> It may just be because it is winter and dry</li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days I can already tell a difference, especially in the pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dark plastic bottle holds 120 ml, enough for a couple of months, unless you bathe in it.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone and dry skin!  </li>
            <li> It has an aroma of roses that dissipates quickly, and is unlikely to interfere with another scent you might want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find there is a lot of waste with the traditional bottles.</li>
            <li> manufacturer suggests that this should be applied with a &#x27;cotton round&#x27;, over the entire face, neck and decollete.</li>
            <li> It made my rosacea/extremely sensitive skin worse, skin got red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Usually that spells disaster, with my  tanned and dry skin suddenly breaking out when deprived of sun.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and subtle after using it.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to cover your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I will not purchase any other toner for my face other than this</li>
            <li> I have been using this with their argan oil for skin and hair and mint lip balm for those rough winters here in Northern California!</li>
            <li> Much less drying than other alcohol based toners I am used to.</li>
            <li> In the morning I mist a few pumps on my face after cleansing and it immediately relieves the tight feeling in my skin (even using an oil cleanser leaves my skin dry).</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice daily after cleansing and before using serums, and also during the day as a refresher.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half and no longer have any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to wear less make up but always felt too self-conscious about the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> So I have to admit I am pretty horrible about taking care of my skin and face, but I am a sucker for all natural products that don&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that can give you different problems.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed to see makeup I left behind.  </li>
            <li> Its not too harsh</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming and I find it pleasent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne in the past</li>
            <li> so I can handle delicate materials.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not good for spritzing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not good for a person&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did make my skin worse anyway.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel a tightening though and was slightly confused by the &#x27;clease&#x27; part of the description.</li>
            <li> Prudence and the others (sorry, don&#x27;t remember all the names)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my face breaks out when I use ANY product on it (besides a powder).  </li>
            <li> Does not contain any artificial fragrance or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product smells very good. The bottle sprays in a light mist, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your shooting yourself in the face...</li>
            <li> Love this toner and will recommend to my friends.  I will definitely reorder!!</li>
            <li> It has taken me a bit to write a review on this product, as I like to use things before I give a review. I LOVE this product. I spray it on right after I get out of the shower each morning and it makes my face feel so refreshed. The rose smell is wonderful and not overpowering. I do believe my face has cleared up since I&#x27;ve been using it. If nothing else, my skin appears healthier. The one thing I would highly recommend, would be to sell this in a 1 or 2 oz spray bottle, so it can be carried in a purse. Not only is this product great, this company is amazing! Their follow-through is second to none. I love supporting small companies and if they continue to make wonderful products, they will be hugely successful!</li>
            <li> It is a very good idea to have the option of a spray, instead of the traditional bottles. I find there is a lot of waste with the traditional bottles. Also since this is a spray, it can be used as mid day freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner has fantastic ingredients (natural and organic), and is gentle enough to use as part of your daily skincare and cleansing routines. It definitely works as advertised and leaves my skin feeling softer, noticeably brighter, and less red. Because this is alcohol free, it will not dry out your face.</li>
            <li> Love this toner... So refreshing, smells great...</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! Skin so soft and clear!</li>
            <li> Posting this review for my wife since I bought this for here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoyed this product. Love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients and smells fantastic.  Leaves my skin looking and feeling very nice.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  This product is so gentle on my skin and smells like you&#x27;re in a rose orchard.  Really though, I am being serious...I have sensitive, t-zone skin and none of their products have caused burning, flaking redness like many others I have tried.  Prudence and the others (sorry, don&#x27;t remember all the names) always write back when I have a question. That, in of itself, shows me they are a five star company and they truly do make wonderful products that are good for our skin and do just as they describe.  And they are coming up with new product soon I can&#x27;t wait to try!!!!!! I only wish I could give them more stars.</li>
            <li> I tend to refrain from using certain products during the winter cause my skin gets so dry and easily irritated. Wow is that not the case with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly so picky when it comes what products I use on my skin. In love with this toner. It&#x27;s ridiculously smooth. It smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to take off makeup and at the same time add some moisture back into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the larger bottle so that I can use it on swabs but I&#x27;m gonna also order the spray so I can use it throughout the day cause it just makes my skin feel so hydrated, smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love what you guys are doing at Beauty by Earth. Been a customer of you guys for awhile now and I always know when I order something it&#x27;s gonna be the highest quality.</li>
            <li> Great product and made from all natural ingredients.  I used this as a Christmas gift and it was VERY well liked!</li>
            <li> i have combination skin  and have never used toner before and nor do i use any makeup - this one feels really great on my skin - it moisturizes and makes me feel fresh with out making it feel oily and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this due to all the great ratings and reviews however it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this only 3 times and it makes my face incredibly dry in some patches.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this any longers. And no I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This toner is refreshing and perks up my face, especially in the morning.  As with all Beauty by Earth products, I love not having to worry about putting toxins on my skin!  After some weeks of using, I find I look forward to it, morning and night and my routine is not complete without it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing, my skin feels fresh, clean and vibrant. And I love the ingredients here, all good stuff for my face. I can use this in good conscience knowing I&#x27;m not using bad chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> This product does decrease the appearance of pores and reduces redness. It has a slight rose scent when you first spray it. It is not overwhelming and I find it pleasent. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I happened to receive this wonderful toner the day before departing on a two week trip to the Riviera Maya.  At first I questioned if it was worth taking with because my suitcase was already packed to overflowing.  I threw it in at the last minute and I am so happy I did!  It is an amazing toner that I use after washing my face morning and night.  The real pleasure is using it throughout the day to refresh and cool my face.  The rose water gives it such a light beautiful fragrance.  The aloe and cucumber soothes my face after exposure to sun.  This is a beauty product worth buying and knowing the ingredients are organic fits right into my lifestyle.  Thank you Beauty by Earth for bringing us a wonderful line of beauty products we can all enjoy and trust to treat us, and the earth, gently and with respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try more of your products!</li>
            <li> It smells really good! I love to use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li> This facial toner is an amazing product. First of all, I really love how it it&#x27;s in a cute little spray bottle, very user friendly. You know when you wake up, you&#x27;re walking into the bathroom, you glance into that mirror, well this is the best thing I have ever found. This amazing toner, lightweight and refreshing. It really wakes you up, the slight smell of rosewater lightly falls on your face. I spray this toner on my face before and after the shower. After the shower, I spray and then apply moisturizer. I really use it frequently because it&#x27;s very light weight. I recommend this facial toner for anyone who wants to brighten and wake their face anytime of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for a friend!</li>
            <li> Another great product by Beauty by Earth.  I wash my face and spritz this wonderful smelling toner on and wipe with a cotton round and I am amazed to see makeup I left behind.  My face feels clean and  so refreshed, an the smell is heavenly.  This will continue to be a main staple in my beauty regimen.  Look forward to trying all their wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I love all their products &amp; this one is lovely as well. It has a nice &amp; refreshing feel &amp; smell. My only suggestion is a larger size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with facial toners but this one is very refreshing and works just as listed.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for fragrance! Jury&#x27;s still out on what it&#x27;ll do for my complexion. ☺</li>
            <li> Best toner ever!!!!  You only need a small amount to cover your face and neck.  There is no greasy residue and it blends nicely.  The smell is good, too.  I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Refreshing, moisturizing toner!  Really helps with dry flaky skin. Love the spray bottle. Smells strongly of roses upon application, but dissipates quickly. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Feels beautiful on my face and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This toner is a winner.  First, the rose water is fragrant and refreshing.  Second, the aloe vera feels smooth and moisturizing on the skin.  I have dry skin, especially in the winter, and this toner helps to keep my skin from feeling parched by mid-afternoon.  I recommend it without reservation, especially as the ingredients are pure.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, all natural, very refreshing feel on the skin</li>
            <li> let me start by saying I never write reviews for Amazon. But I had to write one for this toner. My best friend and I both use it daily and it is amazing. My skin feels so soft and subtle after using it. I wash my face and then apply this once in the morning and once at night and my skin feels soft all day. I have used many types of toners , most of them alcohol-based, but this one tops them all. I also suffer from ance and this helps rejuvenate my skin and make it feel much softer. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite toner I have used. It smells great and really hydrates my skin. I use it about 4 times a day. I got hooked onto the product after my friends acne cleaned up from using the toner multiple times a day. I guess it sorted out her PH Balance. I use it before I moisturize.</li>
            <li> Great product, by a great company! I love this toner for a few reasons, the ingredients are completely pure, it makes my skin feel great, and it doesn&#x27;t strip any of my natural oils or vise-versa leave my skin too oily. It does the job of a toner. Definitely will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product is so soft and fresh on my skin and smells like a rose water</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times but love how it makes my skin feel. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this toner</li>
            <li> So I have to admit I am pretty horrible about taking care of my skin and face, but I am a sucker for all natural products that don&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that can give you different problems. So I decided to try this. Firstly it smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very refreshing. That alone made me want to use it all the time.  Secondly, it actually makes my skin feel amazing and fresh. And lastly, it is really making me get in a regimen of taking care of my skin as I love all of these products (Argen oil and konjac sponge) and it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> Such a nice toner has a relaxing scent to it.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my face after a shower or in the morning to start my day. I purchased the smaller size and when it runs out I&#x27;ll be purchasing the larger bottle.  Smells like roses, but scent fades fairly quickly.  Spray it all over your face or squirt some on a cotton ball to deep clean around blemishes.  Cotton ball shows that there was obviously some dirt and or oil afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and I don&#x27;t wash my face.  I like to moisturize using Cetaphil cream (in the jar) or the Argan oil put out by Beauty by Earth after using the toner.  I have not noticed if it diminishes the redness of my skin or not; I just don&#x27;t pay enough attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;ll be very nice to use during the lovely heat and humidity of summer in Virginia.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Facial Toner. It smells amazing! The rose is awesome. I love the fact that it is organic and natural and feels light and airy, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Hello all you beautiful women out there:&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best hydrating facial toner I have ever used, and believe me I have used several.  I will not purchase any other toner for my face other than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the age where I need hydration, and when I apply this with my Trinity trio, I feel like I am young again.  My face looks fantastic, it is soft, less wrinkles, and I am showing a great-great difference on my forehead, upper eyelids, eye bags and neck line.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how this toner works so well with the skin care products that I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one happy customer, and will only purchase this product to use as a toner.  I don&#x27;t know if they carry a cleanser.  They carry a mask and that is my next purchase.  Thank you Beauty by Earth for making such a terrific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle</li>
            <li> I love the spray bottle size. Great for removing mascara two sprays on a cotton ball works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  My skin tends to be extra dry during the winter months yet I can still use this toner without getting the tight, dry feeling most toners give me. I use this along with my Beauty by Earth Argan oil for my bed time facial routine and my skin feels great. It also smells amazing!!  I would defiantly recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is so calming, refreshing and makes my skin feel so soft &amp; beautiful.  I use it morning and night and every now &amp; then for a quick pick-me-up and because the smell is intoxicating.  Who knew cucumber &amp; rose would make such a great combo?  I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of this.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner now, but it did take a little time for my face to adjust to it.  I also found that if I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely it would cause a stinging sensation when applying serums over it. I have been using it for about a month and a half and no longer have any issues with it.  I use it at least twice daily after cleansing and before using serums, and also during the day as a refresher.  It has a nice smell and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  It also seems to help to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the toner for a week now and really like it. Love the smell! It&#x27;s very smooth, doesn&#x27;t sting, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. It does seem to reduce the size of the pores. I love the spray nozzle.  The is my second Beauty by Earth product,my first was the Chapstick..love,love it..have one in my purse, in my car, in my desk drawer at work..fantastic products!</li>
            <li> How does one describe the sensation of this stuff. It&#x27;s like laying in a cloud of rose petals underneath the mist of a waterfall.&lt;br /&gt;Smell- is like Shakespeare&lt;br /&gt;Feel- is far more hydrating than water ever could be&lt;br /&gt;Performance- I noticed tighter skin seconds after apllying.</li>
            <li> Love it!  A must have in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the toner for a couple days, but so far I&#x27;m impressed. It smells very nice and has a soothing, cooling effect when sprayed on the skin.</li>
            <li> All natural and works for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the high ratings.  It made my rosacea/extremely sensitive skin worse, skin got red and blotchy. I think I might react to the glyserine, so perhaps it is not this products fault, but  it did make my skin worse anyway.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves me refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Lovely face toner. I think this is just great ofr the summer. I used to buy Vichy&#x27;s Thermal water spray, but after this not any more. This toner is inexpensive and smells really nice .. flowery. Great for hydrating a bit dry face skin like mine. Bottle is quite big, so i guess its gonna last me for a while.</li>
            <li> This toner is really nice and fresh! Feels great on my face.  I love that its vegan and not tested on animals! Great company, I want to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Your face feels great after you put it on.  It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been wasting my time on anything else. I&#x27;ve used this product twice a day for 5-6 days now and my face is completely different. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne in the past which has resulted in some scarring and discoloration. Well, 6 days ago I got my order in the mail and I look like a different person. I&#x27;ve always wanted to wear less make up but always felt too self-conscious about the tone and texture of my skin. I&#x27;m slowly reaching my confidence back because of this spray, as well as feeling good about using something this nature on my skin. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a quick, easy and safe way to correct their skin tone and texture! I&#x27;ve even started to use this on my arm pits and it&#x27;s making them look so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, amazing product. Why have I been wasting my time and money on anything else?</li>
            <li> This toner feels fresh and light on my skin.  I love that the ingredients have no weird junk in them and nothing that can damage my skin rather than helping it.  The packaging is so beautiful too.  I know that may not matter to some, but to me it speaks about the professionalism of the company and it gives me even more pleasure to use something that is so aesthetically pleasing.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Does not strip my skin and makes it so soft. It has a soft smell that is clean and fresh from the cucumber and rose water ingredients.  Does not contain any artificial fragrance or chemicals.  All ingredients listed are natural. I love to use it to set my make-up and works great for refreshing my face later in the day.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the effects when using this as a makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. Already I can tell a big difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li> i have bought several products from Beauty by Earth. they hold up to their name. i&#x27;ll &#x27;keep buying their brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I love using it after I wash my face. It makes it feel super clean and it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Love this toner, quick and easy spriz on face, feels and smells lovely. I am now using it as my deodorant too (not a sweater).  I thought I loved it so much on my face why not use it everywhere, and like the oil has lasted a while.  And I repeat the smell is heavenly, in fact I&#x27;m considering using my own rose petals to infuse into some oil this summer....</li>
            <li> I feel my skin feel moistened after immediate apply of the toner.  It is truly the goodness to my skin and smells really good ^^</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I use this product twice a day to relive redness and oil on my neck and face. I also used it on a pimple and the redness went away while I slept. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve gotten the bigger one.</li>
            <li> Waited six months to write my review to really test the toner, love the smell and the moisture skin feeling after using it each morning. Started using it from winter to summer, in the winter when my skin is the driest my skin feels really fresh and smooth. Now on summer time my skin is glowing. This is a keeper and what a beautiful smell!</li>
            <li> Took me so long to write a review, but this stuff is Awesome!  It smells so good and refreshing that occasionally I have been tempted to taste it, but I don&#x27;t.  I keep it right next to my bed on my nightstand and swipe my eyes with it prior to falling asleep, to remove makeup and dirt, and also just to feel so good before bed.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful but it does leave a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; texture so it&#x27;s not good for spritzing throughout the day. Wonderful under your face cream though....</li>
            <li> This toner doe the job so well. Its not too harsh but I can get a clean refreshed feel every time I use it and its a perfect pick me up as well.</li>
            <li> Sent to me for review this facial toner and make up remover is made of a significant amount of natural ingredients and is available in a 120ml or 240ml size. The sample that I received was the 120ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s presented in a well labelled modern plastic bottle with a pump action nozzle delivering an accurate and consistent &#x27;shot&#x27; each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a pleasant scent and admittedly I could not accurately identify any of the separate ingredients as there are so many of them. These include organic witch hazel, organic rose petal water, organic aloe vera and organic cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer suggests that this should be applied with a &#x27;cotton round&#x27;, over the entire face, neck and decollete. Its best to use this immediately after using your facial cleanser and this can be done twice a day; morning and night. After using this for nearly a week I found that it was effective in use and I was happy to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> GREAT product!  This facial mist smells AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients are natural, no chemicals or alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;The mist is very fine so it is comfortable to spray directly at my face.&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a moisturizing effect and it feels super light on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived quickly, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long before I could mist my way into a blissful refreshed state!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU BEAUTY BY EARTH!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff. I have noticed a difference in my skin. I love this company&#x27;s products. Everything I have gotten from them has turned out to be very nice. Good smells, good results and definitely have sent many of my friends over to buy their products.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keep me not greasy all day long.</li>
            <li> This brand  face mask is good!, but this facial toner scent is too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I feels vomiting, I should return.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m totally loving this! I use it at night and in the morning. After using it for only a few days I can already tell a difference, especially in the pores around my nose. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  I have acne prone and dry skin!  This toner has not only helped with my acne, but it also keeps is moisturized all day!  It smells fabulous too!  I love that it contains all natural ingredients as well!  I highly recommend this product, well actually anything by this company as everything is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I feel more vibrant.  This is the perfect finishing touch for your make up.  Goes on light and makes everything smoother.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> The product is made of high quality ingredients and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try it. Unfortunately my face breaks out when I use ANY product on it (besides a powder).  It has been that way my whole life.  So I bought this in the hopes that it may help my skin look brighter etc.  But, as with so many other products, I was not able to use it as my skin reacted to it.  I do not fault the makers of this as the ingredient are a high quality and seemed to all be natural. There was a slight fragrance I could detect the few times I used it, very mild and not at all overpowering. I gave it to my sister to try as she doesn&#x27;t have the same difficulties as I do.</li>
            <li> I received the Toner within 2 days. Sprayed it on after a Infared Sauna session and shower. Liked that it was such a fine mist and it did feel good on the skin. Didn&#x27;t feel a tightening though and was slightly confused by the &#x27;clease&#x27; part of the description. But even after an hour my skin is still soft.</li>
            <li> I LOVE using this right out of the shower. It feels so very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Refreshing and works. I use all three products - the sponge, toner and then oil and they work great together.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with Beauty by Earth Best Hydrating Facial Toner.  Love the smell and the feel.  My face is clean and refreshed after I use it.  So far, every Beauty by Earth product I&#x27;ve used has been the best in it&#x27;s category.  So grateful for this company!</li>
            <li> The air where I live is notoriously dry, especially indoors during winter months when heating systems tend to remove every naturally occurring moisture molecule available. This is a good thing for chips and crackers because they don&#x27;t get stale. However, it&#x27;s not good for a person&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use argan oil each morning to soften my skin and on the ends of my long hair to tame the effects of static electricity. The argan oil is helpful but my skin still needed something more to combat drynes; so I started using hydrating facial toner. The 4oz bottle comes with a spray top that delivers a very fine mist that leaves my skin feeling pleasantly moist and supple, not wet. It has an aroma of roses that dissipates quickly, and is unlikely to interfere with another scent you might want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely apply argan oil during a busy day, it takes a little time for it to be completely absorbed by my hands so I can handle delicate materials. This spray, however, is so convenient that I spritz my face three or times per day, making essential moisture available for my skin to absorb. It&#x27;s easy and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> Feels great.  No problem with allergic reaction as I sometimes have with facial products.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love using over makeup, after using the mask or just throughout the day. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light spray that is refreshing on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used toners before this but decided to try.  It may just be because it is winter and dry but I have been needing extra moisturizer since using this but it may not be directly related to this toner, just the dry weather.  Overall, I like it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!! I have used many toners that all left my skin feeling dry, but not this product. After the first use my skin felt smooth, calm, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I have loved everything I have gotten from Beauty by Earth. GREAT line of products. I love the scent of this facial toner and how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> My husband has taken over using this product and it&#x27;s now become his. I&#x27;ve used it occasionally and we both agree that it&#x27;s very refreshing. Nice pleasant scent. We&#x27;re very happy with Beauty by Earth products. This is the third item I&#x27;ve purchased from their line and I&#x27;ll continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toner! Not only does it smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry/ tight like a lot of toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Also, I love that it comes in a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times and it is the first toner in I dont know how long that I like!  I cant wait to keep using it.  Also it hasnt irritated my face which is amazing because nearly everything does.  I am so happy to have found this company.  I will for sure reorder and I am looking forward to trying new products from Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> Love this toner - I use it daily to clean my face at the end of the night. I love that it does not dry out my face which past toners had been doing. Also its very light and refreshing to use on my face. I have noticed my looking clearer as well which was an added bonus for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing toner!  My skin feels clean and fresh after I spray it on.</li>
            <li> Best natural toner I could find.</li>
            <li> In love with this toner! I&#x27;ve spent some money on some really expensive toners and just not been satisfied. I&#x27;ve also tried really cheap ones and that never panned out either. This toner is awesome! My skin loves it and it smells great. So happy!!</li>
            <li> Lovely facial mist...refreshing after a work out...like rose petals on your skin!  Gentle to sensitive skin. Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Love thiss, it&#x27;s non greasy yet hydrating to the skin. The smell is okay</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth is a new entry in the fast-growing sector of natural skin care and I was happy to receive a substantially discounted sample of this toner for evaluation.  I&#x27;m not quite sure why it has taken so many years for women to realize that noxious chemicals have no place in skin care and, indeed, make-up.  In any case, I welcome the “natural” revolution and all the wonderful products that are now available like this one, free of parabens, GMO, gluten, soy,  artificial additives and (especially important with toners) alcohol.  Also of great importance to me, it&#x27;s not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This delightful toner adopts the time-honoured recipe of Witch Hazel and Rose Water, classic astringent and cleansing ingredients used by women for centuries to refresh their complexions, tighten pores and tone the skin.  I am crazy about rose-based skin care and find the scent captivating.  Also present are Aloe Vera and Cucumber extract, adding decongestant and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark plastic bottle holds 120 ml, enough for a couple of months, unless you bathe in it.  A larger bottle is also available, with double the contents. It has a pump dispenser so you can spritz this deliciously-scented liquid all over your face and neck for a quick freshen-up, or soak a cotton pad for make-up removal and deep cleansing.  I was surprised to see that I can spray this over my made-up face without causing a melt-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After regular daily use for the last month, I am delighted with its skin clearing and hydrating properties.  The weather has been challenging:  very hot and sweaty, followed by a week of much cooler temperatures and even a few summer thunder showers.  Usually that spells disaster, with my  tanned and dry skin suddenly breaking out when deprived of sun.  Not this time though, and I attribute the welcome change to using this lovely product.  The natural ingredients make it perfect for mature, sensitive skin like mine but I could see men and teens using it, too, especially if dealing with acne or allergy-prone skin.cially if dealing with acne or allergy-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am not normally a fan of rose but I thought I would give this product a try since I  don&#x27;t own a toner and really enjoy Beauty by Earth products. I am glad I took a chance because this toner leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and the scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky feeling, like toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I have bought the Argan oil and the facial toner and I&#x27;m very happy about both product. I use the Argan oil on my face before going to bed and also to moisturizery hair. The facial toner does great when slightly chilled on a warm day, but also as a quick refresher. I higy recommend both!!</li>
            <li> This products smells good. I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product was way more than my expectation! I have used many witch hazel toners but this one was by far my favorite! Much less drying than other alcohol based toners I am used to. I didn&#x27;t experience any tightening or dryness. I could tell right away that my redness was going down even after a first use.I only have two aspects that I don&#x27;t like, the fact that the product was in a plastic bottle, not a glass one. I loved the rose smell but it could be overpowering at time. However my partner said that he loved the smell and found it to be very relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So wonderful! I have been using this with their argan oil for skin and hair and mint lip balm for those rough winters here in Northern California! Will be purchasing very soon!</li>
            <li> This was soothing after doing a Skin Peel.  Love the ability to spritz and run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you, please click on the YES button below.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Feels great on my skin. And all natural. Thank you so much for making tihs product. We need more organic and natural skin care products in the beauty industry. Everyone should try this.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin takes my makeup right off and has a fresh clean smell. I love this toner!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice daily for two weeks. In the morning I mist a few pumps on my face after cleansing and it immediately relieves the tight feeling in my skin (even using an oil cleanser leaves my skin dry). At night I use the toner on a cotton pad to remove lest traces of makeup. This is helped clear up some dry, flaky patches on my nose and cheeks too! I follow up by moisturizing with the same brand&#x27;s Argan oil. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the smell, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like florals. It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> great toner. my skin is very soft after using and the scent is soothing</li>
