    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works with the Luminess system!! Saved me over 100 bucks! Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Others said it was the same as the brush that came with their make-up kit, I don&#x27;t think it is. Since the kit(Luminess) doesn&#x27;t list their needle diameter, I can&#x27;t tell if this is the problem. It seems like the make-up won&#x27;t go through it as well. Otherwise, it appears identical in make. It took about 3 weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> Worth it!!! Had this baby almost a year!!!! Still works awesome and does not clog!!!</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle gets clogged a lot</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed. I spend more time cleaning the airbrush than applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.  I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 Belloccio spray guns and this one works great for less than half the price!</li>
            <li> Update Jan 2015: This thing is still working!!! I don&#x27;t clean it as often as I did initially. It works SO much better than the Dinair one. If I ever need another one, I will reorder this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Dinair package with everything and 1.5 years later the airbrush stopped working correctly. Dinair airbrush replacements cost too much (and they wouldn&#x27;t replace it) so I wanted to find a cheaper option. Bought this one and I am very, VERY happy I did. It comes in a hard plastic box/case and it has COMPLETE instructions on how to break this thing down. It also comes with the tool to remove the tip part so you don&#x27;t have to use pliers. This is just like the Dinair airbrush only it is a different color. Also, I am not keeping it in a wet dock anymore. I put distilled water in bottle (bought a cleaning kit to try and fix the Dinair initially) and use that to clean it out. Then I run a few drops of alcohol through it then just set it on the counter. Every three times I take the needle out and run a cotton swab soaked in alcohol over it to clean it. So far, no problems. I absolutely do not mind having to clean the needle every third use. I would gladly order this one again. I was about to give up airbrush makeup until I found this. This thing is awesome. Even if you have to spend $20 each year, totally worth it if you like airbrush makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would almost pay the $20 just to have a nice set of instructions. Shame on Dinair for not providing instructions for their airbrushes. I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**it is important to note that this is the airbrush only. The air compressor is something else entirely.</li>
            <li> I have the Dinair system but the airbrush itself keeps breaking and they are expensive, $80.00.  Decided to try this one at $19.99.  Not worth it.  The makeup flies out of the brush even on the lowest setting and your makeup looks like it&#x27;s caked on your face.  It&#x27;s just not a fine mist.  It&#x27;s very cheaply made, hence $19.99.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace one that had broke. I can&#x27;t seem to get the hose off the one I had broke to try this yet....</li>
            <li> what size hose do I need to order for this specific airbrush? I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything on what size I need or anything or what abut the compresser?</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative, and doesn&#x27;t cost you a first born child. Honestly, the other high priced ones are the exact same. Make sure you clean almost daily. Yes product will build up in it, it will in any spray gun. If it broke on you in a week, that&#x27;s because you ARE A SLOB AND NEED TO CLEAN!!!!!!!! SLOB!</li>
            <li> I use this as a backup however it works equally as well as the original product. I maintain the cleanliness and care of my airbushes so they perform exactly as I expect them too.</li>
            <li> JUST like it... the parts are interchangeable.  Great backup when my nozzle bent on the dinair one. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not work and comes out in little dots instead of an even spray :( very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Recieved it Quickly!!!</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my Luminess gun which was $99. They had it on sale for $49 but this one for $20 still beats the price. I think I killed my first one because I wasn&#x27;t cleaning it properly. Even though I ran alcohol through it, it still clogged. I didn&#x27;t know you could hold your finger to the tip and press the trigger and it would all bubble out. Now that I do that daily, it works great. $20 well worth it!</li>
            <li> The product is sturdy and comes with a plastic protective case and a cleaning syringe. It works with multiple air brush makeup pumps which is perfect for me as I only needed to replace the gun. Also the price and quick shipping was perfect for me!</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of garbage. I got it out of the box and started to use it. The makeup doesn&#x27;t even spray out. It sprays a tiny bit and in chunks/blobs. I hardly write reviews, but when a product is this terrible, I have to say something. Save your money and do not buy this air gun. Spend a little more on the Bellocio brand. It works better. I have a Bellocio one, it works, just makes sure to clean it out really well each time you use it.</li>
            <li> Worked ok.  Gums up quickly even when maintaining the recommended way.</li>
            <li> Love this gun! Works really well with evenly dispersing airbrush makeup. Would definitely order more as well as recommend to others!!!</li>
            <li> if you have ever used DINAIR this spray gun is almost identical to theirs which cost 80 dollars on the dinair website.&lt;br /&gt;i would def recomend getting one of these even if its just for a backup. :)</li>
            <li> This is such the perfect gun for foundation.  and the price is unbeatable. compared to the $45-$135 for the name brand make up guns.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my Dinair brush which had clogged and was hopeless to clean no matter how much I soaked it and took the thing apart. Dinair was terrible to deal with and wanted to charge me more than this brush cost to just look at the darn thing! So I bought this figuring what the heck, and this works exactly the same as the Dinair which costs close to $100 to replace! I recommended this to a friend who had the same thing happen to her Dinair brush, she loves this just as much as I do and I use this for professional make up applications.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a dinar airbrush which became clogged- would cost 80 bucks to replace- I use this instead- it&#x27;s essentially the same thing</li>
            <li> Works like a dream!!!!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my airbrush makeup sprayer instead if buying the whole thing  It works just as good as what came with the compressor.  Very pleased tempted to buy another as a backup</li>
            <li> I use this for my airbrush makeup.  While it&#x27;s great for putting on the makeup...it is finicky and can clog easy.  Be sure to watch the video on how to clean it.  I had my last one for almost a year but it finally died.  I bought 3 of these for the price...because I love the airbrush makeup and I don&#x27;t want to be without it if another one decides to fail.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and like so much I bought a second for a backup! Would rather have the spare just incase .would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have the Luminess air airbrush system, I have always tried to keep my sprayer clean, but it did clog and wasn&#x27;t able to be used any longer. I purchased one of these, &amp; I am NOT disappointed. It works perfectly. I will be ordering another one to keep it in spare just in case. You can&#x27;t beat the price. And its very nice looking too.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clogged after 4 uses, and I was cleaning it properly each and every time. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as including a compressor and hose. When it arrived, both were missing. I called the company and they said it was &amp;#34; an error in the listing&amp;#34;- I did NOT get to use the air gun OR THE GREEN AIRBRUSH MAKEUP I PURCHASED FOR IT, my costume did NOT turn out as planned because I didnt have time to locate another in time for our event. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> couldent be happer with how well its working, and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was trying to use it for my temptu makeup and it does not work.  It plugs into the machine the liquid just splashes</li>
            <li> it workis very nice to airbrushh makeup its good fo only 20 bucks i love it i use it every day</li>
