            <li>The smell is amazing on this one.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing</li>
            <li>Works nice.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of MB Coal, as it was cost effective, and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nicely designed which will help save losing any oil to spillage.</li>
            <li>Very Nice and gives a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply smells pleasant and</li>
            <li>(in a good way) and smell the delightful scent the next day.</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like it at all (which won&#x27;t work because that sort of defeats one purpose of the beard, ya know?), and I found the very strong scent gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to rub my beard and feel my beard hairs feel nice and smooth and relaxed compared to the bristly wires that they used to feel like.</li>
            <li>The piney, woody scent pairs perfectly with your favorite flannel and will have all of the ladies clamoring to feel your soft and shiny face-sweater.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>great woodsy sent when you first apply it to your beard.  </li>
            <li>The Peppermint is very light.    </li>
            <li>The coal is my favorite and my girl loves it too.</li>
            <li>(note: be sure to work the oil into your skin covered by hair, not just the hair.)  </li>
            <li>It keeps my beard nice and soft while smelling great.</li>
            <li>There are many that are way over priced.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of it</li>
            <li>Most of the beard oils I use are $25 plus shipping for 1oz.</li>
            <li>think that I will stay with the unscented Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Gloss and Conditioner until I come across a better product</li>
            <li>The consistency is on par with most.</li>
            <li>His beard is nice and tidy and smooth so it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Men love it...</li>
            <li>&amp; I have a nice, full beard.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more easy going smell, maybe not for you.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy some beard oil to keep it looking good, feeling soft &amp; smelling nice.</li>
            <li>This beard oil is a great product for the budding beard enthusiast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it smells like a light pine scent, not horrible not great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my beard is considerably softer and I love the minty/ wintergreen scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering yet lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>The coal smell is strong when you put it on</li>
            <li>However, it was EXTREMELY strong, and it had a sort of metallic scent along with it.</li>
            <li>This beard oil is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my beard look more full and feel smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li>This smells so good and makes my husbands beard soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>light shine</li>
            <li>When I received my purchase I was happy to see that the bottle was not only sealed to prevent spillage but that it was also sealed inside a bubble wrap bag inside of the package.</li>
            <li>Although I do enjoy the smell of patchouli so that is a bonus.</li>
            <li>At first I did not like the fragrence of the oil, but over time I&#x27;ve grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>Although not horrible it is a pine like scent which I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>I do not find to be true at all.</li>
            <li>I love it, keeps my beard soft and easy to control.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and tangle free, more groomed look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly unpleasant</li>
            <li>This alone is worth the price for the oil.</li>
            <li>I work in a professional office environment with many people, so I didn&#x27;t want to stink up the place with an offensive fragrance (I&#x27;m looking at you Patchouli)... or offend my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>Great oil - very similar to the Perfectly Natural Soap&#x27;s Tranquil Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again but will be buying a nice Incredibeard oil to use on date nights.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes his beard so soft.</li>
            <li>I use after shower and it certainly keeps my beard soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with the quality/amount/price of this product, and will buy another bottle when I get low.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love this brand in general, but I really like the WV Coal scent.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product in October 2014 during the Berkeley Springs WV, Apple Butter Festival.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many non-beard specific products such as skin and hair lotions (with exotic vitamins, extracts, etc) to no avail.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is that all itching, dryness, and flaking disappeared within the first couple of days of use.  </li>
            <li>First beard.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This was my first beard oil product, and I just could not handle the scent of it.</li>
            <li>First time beard oil user and I am hook on Mountaineer Brand products.</li>
            <li>Plus at that price and double what most companies offer for size.</li>
            <li>The product from the first time I used it made quite an impression on me as I could tell a difference immediately.</li>
            <li>and I will most definitely be purchasing more once I start to run low.</li>
            <li>A few drops on your palm rub it on the skin under your beard and through your beard and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>The WV coal has a light patchouli scent that is very subtle but a very nice scent that is manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first beard oil although I&#x27;ve used many other bearding products.</li>
            <li>Really smooths out the beard and softens.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend can smell it during normal conversation distance for the first 20/30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(Like really cheap)&lt;br /&gt;-Softens</li>
            <li>women not so much.</li>
            <li>this product is inferior or superior to other similar oils.  </li>
            <li>(I use 5 drops, sometimes more), you can really smell the fragrance due to the fact it is rightunder your nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Van Dyke for many years, and had to deal with flaky skin and dryness, sometimes shaving it down to nothing until it clears up.  </li>
            <li>My beard pretty much always looks like I&#x27;ve spent years perfecting it, and it feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>really like what it&#x27;s been doing for my beard which is over 6 inches long and full</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the oily feel</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others that were okay</li>
            <li>Overall I must say this oil is worth the price.</li>
            <li>You get twice as much for most other oils for half the price.</li>
            <li>The smell is very manly and I am getting that aforementioned face-nuzzling action every day.</li>
            <li>This beard oil makes my beard soft , conditions my skin and completely rids my face of &amp;#34;growing beard itch&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but so far this stuff is</li>
            <li>This oil is made from all natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe I talked with the owner, Mr. Young about beard products at his tent.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this, but it wasn&#x27;t happening, and I finally tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li>But definitely a recommended product for someone with a real man&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li>So far it has been softening my beard, adding shine and luster.</li>
            <li>Bottle is plastic though, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>and I love the subtle scent &amp;#34;I purchased the WV coal scent&amp;#34; I have seen reviews saying that it was off putting our over powering which</li>
            <li>This product has toned down the Patchouli to a light pine fragrance, and mixed it with Sage, which gives it a musky scent.  </li>
            <li>unlike other tonics is not flammable or toxic made right here in West Virginia.</li>
            <li>But all that washing strips out all the natural oils from your skin and your beard starts getting all splitty and rough feeling and plus you just want a little bit more, you know?</li>
            <li>But I immediately noticed other benefits to over my first few weeks of use, such as significantly softer and shinier beard hair, and that it laid nicer.    </li>
            <li>I would like to see other scents introduced in time, and will most likely buy other MB products to test out shortly.</li>
            <li>The sage part seemed odd, but it works very well with the mint scents of the peppermint and patchouli.</li>
            <li>I finally decided on this oil because for the price, it offers double the oil (2 ounces) of what every other beard oil company offers (1 ounce) for the same price ($14).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> But I immediately noticed other benefits to over my first few weeks of use, such as significantly softer and shinier beard hair, and that it laid nicer.    </li>
            <li> I would like to see other scents introduced in time, and will most likely buy other MB products to test out shortly.</li>

            <li> I finally decided on this oil because for the price, it offers double the oil (2 ounces) of what every other beard oil company offers (1 ounce) for the same price ($14).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t leave my beard as soft and manageable as other brands.</li>

            <li> I have very course facial hair and was skeptical, but as long as I use a little of this before I go to bed, it&#x27;s tame and soft.</li>

            <li> After that, it really dissipates, and becomes unlikely that anyone can smell it unless they are only a few inches away from the beard.  </li>

            <li> The thing about Patchouli is that it is a very powerful piney fragrance, and gets it&#x27;s bad rap from an overuse of raw Patchouli oil by people who want to cover up body odor due to poor hygiene.</li>

            <li> Amazing product at an amazing price. This beard oil makes my beard soft , conditions my skin and completely rids my face of &amp;#34;growing beard itch&amp;#34;. A must have if you are going to &amp;#34;wolf it up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just got it today, beard feels and smells great</li>
            <li> Double the size plus it smells great soo great that my wife keeps burying her nose into my beard I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Mountaineer brand is average.</li>
            <li> On Nov 15, 2014 I shaved my entire face &amp; decided to not shave again for 1 year. It&#x27;s now Feb 12, 2015 &amp; I have a nice, full beard. I decided to buy some beard oil to keep it looking good, feeling soft &amp; smelling nice. I&#x27;ve tried a few others that were okay but so far this stuff is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my beard is considerably softer and I love the minty/ wintergreen scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering yet lasts a good while. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> my lady couldn&#x27;t stand it and neither could I. Bought Morrocan Oil instead... http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003JKFEL8/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_4/181-7112478-9102550?qid&#x3D;1423791459&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&amp;keywords&#x3D;moroccan+oil&amp;dpPl&#x3D;1&amp;dpID&#x3D;41ozKTCoXzL&amp;ref&#x3D;plSrch</li>
            <li> This beard oil is a great product for the budding beard enthusiast. I began with this oil and even passed the second bottle to my brother in law. The coal smell is strong when you put it on but it diminishes throughout the day. You can still catch whiffs of it when you go home at night.&lt;br /&gt;I began using this by itself, but have since added a conditioner. The smell of this oil is just enough to overpower the conditioner, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands of beard oil. This is by far the best! The coal is my favorite and my girl loves it too. Really smooths out the beard and softens. The smell is amazing on this one. I will not use any other brand of oil or balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for beard oil for some time. I finally decided on this oil because for the price, it offers double the oil (2 ounces) of what every other beard oil company offers (1 ounce) for the same price ($14).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some of the cheapest (in price) beard oil you can find out there on the market yet it is a very good beard oil. It&#x27;s great for the skin and most importanly your beard. A few drops on your palm rub it on the skin under your beard and through your beard and you&#x27;re good to go. This oil made the unmanageable mangey hairs on my face relax and stop sticking up. It&#x27;s made my beard look more full and feel smooth and relaxed. It&#x27;s nice to rub my beard and feel my beard hairs feel nice and smooth and relaxed compared to the bristly wires that they used to feel like. This oil is made from all natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually applied this product one day and I could still feel it in my beard (in a good way) and smell the delightful scent the next day. So applying every day isn&#x27;t a need with this oil in my opinion. Yet another way it saves you money. The WV coal has a light patchouli scent that is very subtle but a very nice scent that is manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with this beard oil. It does it&#x27;s job well and you get double the amount of oil compared to the other brands. It uses the same oils and products that more expensive oils do and for a lot less in price.</li>
            <li> At first I did not like the fragrence of the oil, but over time I&#x27;ve grown to love it.  Keeps my beard soft and tangle free, more groomed look.  Excellent and would buy again.  I did have an issue with oil leaking in shipment, but the seller contacted me immediatly and provided a replacement product at no charge.  Excellent customer service. Bravo.</li>
            <li> Love this brand in general, but I really like the WV Coal scent. Don&#x27;t let the name fool you. I had passed this one up several times simply because of the odd name. WV Coal is not the best name for the scent, IMO. It has a great scent though. It&#x27;s scented with sage, peppermint and patchouli. The sage part seemed odd, but it works very well with the mint scents of the peppermint and patchouli.</li>
            <li> Works nice. Gives a good scent and shine. I was afraid it was going to smell too much like patchouli but it doesn&#x27;t.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product in October 2014 during the Berkeley Springs WV, Apple Butter Festival.  I believe I talked with the owner, Mr. Young about beard products at his tent.  I&#x27;ve had a Van Dyke for many years, and had to deal with flaky skin and dryness, sometimes shaving it down to nothing until it clears up.  I&#x27;ve tried many non-beard specific products such as skin and hair lotions (with exotic vitamins, extracts, etc) to no avail.  Dandruff shampoos did little or sometimes made it worse.  The vendor recommended the WV Coal, as it would help with the dryness and flaking.     I didn&#x27;t buy any beard products that day, as I wanted to research the various beard oils online.  I bought a bottle of MB Coal, as it was cost effective, and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wasn&#x27;t out a lot of money.  Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve never used a beard oil prior to MB, so I can&#x27;t say weather this product is inferior or superior to other similar oils.  What I can say is that all itching, dryness, and flaking disappeared within the first couple of days of use.  This alone is worth the price for the oil. But I immediately noticed other benefits to over my first few weeks of use, such as significantly softer and shinier beard hair, and that it laid nicer.    My biggest reservation about this product was, of course, the smell.  I work in a professional office environment with many people, so I didn&#x27;t want to stink up the place with an offensive fragrance (I&#x27;m looking at you Patchouli)... or offend my girlfriend.  The thing about Patchouli is that it is a very powerful piney fragrance, and gets it&#x27;s bad rap from an overuse of raw Patchouli oil by people who want to cover up body odor due to poor hygiene. This product has toned down the Patchouli to a light pine fragrance, and mixed it with Sage, which gives it a musky scent.  The Peppermint is very light.    When you work it into your beard (I use 5 drops, sometimes more), you can really smell the fragrance due to the fact it is rightunder your nose. (note: be sure to work the oil into your skin covered by hair, not just the hair.)  My girlfriend can smell it during normal conversation distance for the first 20/30 minutes.  After that, it really dissipates, and becomes unlikely that anyone can smell it unless they are only a few inches away from the beard.  My girlfriend likes the smell, and I&#x27;ve asked a few co-workers if it is offensive.  They either like the smell, or can&#x27;t smell it at all.  I haven&#x27;t had anyone dislike it yet.    Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with the quality/amount/price of this product, and will buy another bottle when I get low.  I would like to see other scents introduced in time, and will most likely buy other MB products to test out shortly.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Very happy with the results. #manlymusk</li>
            <li> There is nothing manlier than applying this beauty to your beard every morning. The piney, woody scent pairs perfectly with your favorite flannel and will have all of the ladies clamoring to feel your soft and shiny face-sweater.</li>
            <li> First beard. This was a life saver. Excellent value</li>
            <li> Truly manly smell and makes beard feel great!</li>
            <li> This beard oil is pretty amazing. It keeps my beard nice and soft while smelling great. The price is also well within the target range for a beard oil. There are many that are way over priced.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This smells so good and makes my husbands beard soft and manageable! I will be buying more of it</li>
            <li> Most of the beard oils I use are $25 plus shipping for 1oz. This is 2oz for 14.. no shipping with Amazon Prime. It leaves my beard soft and shiny. I will definitely purchase this again..</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. I have very course facial hair and was skeptical, but as long as I use a little of this before I go to bed, it&#x27;s tame and soft. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard oil product, and I just could not handle the scent of it. I had read the reviews talking about the patchouli smell, and I didn&#x27;t think it would be an issue since I&#x27;m sort of partial to that fragrance. However, it was EXTREMELY strong, and it had a sort of metallic scent along with it. My wife didn&#x27;t like it at all (which won&#x27;t work because that sort of defeats one purpose of the beard, ya know?), and I found the very strong scent gave me a headache. I really tried to like this, but it wasn&#x27;t happening, and I finally tossed it in the trash. I&#x27;ll be trying a different beard oil, but this one was a &amp;#34;no-go&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the worst beard maintenance products that I have every used.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Noxious odor – your significant other will HATE it guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;2. Messy/Oily – rubs off on everything&lt;br /&gt;3. Bottle size/product amount&lt;br /&gt;I think that I will stay with the unscented Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Gloss and Conditioner until I come across a better product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a shag rug on your face like I do, you know what it&#x27;s like. You drool in it while you sleep, soup and cereal milk dribble in, plus all the crumbs, gobs of sauce, ever try eating a bagel slathered with cream cheese shmear or god forbid an ice cream cone? YOU KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT. Napkins are a way of life, but clearly if you aren&#x27;t shampooing all that nasty out every day, your wife ain&#x27;t nuzzling her face in your chin and making you feel like a king, now is she? But all that washing strips out all the natural oils from your skin and your beard starts getting all splitty and rough feeling and plus you just want a little bit more, you know? Like let&#x27;s get a head start on this stink by smelling awesome IN THE FIRST PLACE. So that&#x27;s where your beard oil comes in. This one feels great, I drop about a nickel-to-quarter sized puddle into my hand after I get out of the shower, rub my hands together, and then massage them through my beard, chin and cheeks for a minute or so to work it in. Then I comb out my beard until I look like a Norse prince. The smell is very manly and I am getting that aforementioned face-nuzzling action every day. My beard pretty much always looks like I&#x27;ve spent years perfecting it, and it feels so soft and smooth even I want to touch it all the time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> First time beard oil user and I am hook on Mountaineer Brand products. Great size for the price and it does smell really good, it is non greasy and moisturizes my beard all day.</li>
            <li> Just like the conditioner the oil works on all types of facial hair even sideburns.  Easy to apply smells pleasant and unlike other tonics is not flammable or toxic made right here in West Virginia.</li>
            <li> Great oil - very similar to the Perfectly Natural Soap&#x27;s Tranquil Sandalwood. The consistency is on par with most. The scent is a little... Hard to describe. It&#x27;s certainly a masculine scent, but at times can be a bit harsh. I use after shower and it certainly keeps my beard soft and healthy. If you&#x27;re looking for a more easy going smell, maybe not for you. But definitely a recommended product for someone with a real man&#x27;s beard. Plus at that price and double what most companies offer for size.</li>
            <li> great woodsy sent when you first apply it to your beard.  The pine scent is over powering and disappears after time.  I love it, keeps my beard soft and easy to control.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard oil although I&#x27;ve used many other bearding products. The bottle is nicely designed which will help save losing any oil to spillage. So far it has been softening my beard, adding shine and luster. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for about this oil is the scent. It&#x27;s not exactly unpleasant I just wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;Date Night&amp;#34; beard oil. It gets its scent from the patchouli oil which it contains. I&#x27;d say it smells like a light pine scent, not horrible not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap (Like really cheap)&lt;br /&gt;-Softens Beard&lt;br /&gt;-Adds light shine&lt;br /&gt;-More for less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap Smell (Resembling Pine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Remarks: Overall I must say this oil is worth the price. You get twice as much for most other oils for half the price. Unfortunately since its cheap it does have a drawback, the scent. Although not horrible it is a pine like scent which I didn&#x27;t really care for. I will definitely buy this again but will be buying a nice Incredibeard oil to use on date nights.</li>
            <li> Very Nice and gives a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Great value and a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Smells amazing and he says that it feels luxurious. Bottle is plastic though, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t leave my beard as soft and manageable as other brands.</li>
            <li> order some beard oil and shampoo about a month ago... really like what it&#x27;s been doing for my beard which is over 6 inches long and full... will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> When I received my purchase I was happy to see that the bottle was not only sealed to prevent spillage but that it was also sealed inside a bubble wrap bag inside of the package. The product itself is amazing and I love the subtle scent &amp;#34;I purchased the WV coal scent&amp;#34; I have seen reviews saying that it was off putting our over powering which I do not find to be true at all. Although I do enjoy the smell of patchouli so that is a bonus. The product from the first time I used it made quite an impression on me as I could tell a difference immediately. On the second day of use I was already getting questions about what I was using from my friends. All in all I think this is a great product at a very reasonable price and I will most definitely be purchasing more once I start to run low.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after his beard started getting dry and unruly as it grew longer and longer. I thought it was the best value and ordered it. I love the smell and the way it makes his beard so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this as a 4 star review instead of 5 stars because as a wife who kisses her husband I don&#x27;t particularly like the oily feel (but it&#x27;s beard oil so duh). The smell isn&#x27;t bad but I wish it didn&#x27;t have a smell. His beard is nice and tidy and smooth so it works fantastic. Men love it... women not so much.</li>
