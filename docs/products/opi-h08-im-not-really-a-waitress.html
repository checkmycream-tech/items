            <li>I love OPI nail polish and this one is my absolute favorite.  </li>

            <li>Not too bright, and not too dark, this is a really nice color.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty - I love it.  </li>

            <li>This is by far my most favorite color</li>

            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>A good color if you like red.</li>
            <li>I have been getting a mani/pedi for years and have so many colors I&#x27;ve liked, then one day I had &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&amp;#34; put on.  </li>
            <li>the picture makes the polish look almost burgundy, but actually it is the Perfect Christmas red.  </li>
            <li>The color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>So beautiful, without being a clear red.  </li>
            <li>Too much fun.</li>
            <li>so I bought a fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>and it was worth the wait!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was ust the right shade of candy-apple-red</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the top was damaged somehow but honestly it&#x27;s not a big deal color is still nice.</li>
            <li>Very wearable for all skin types, this red has maroon and warm glitter</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable also.</li>
            <li>This is probably my all time favorite shade of red.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I asked for when I asked for it.</li>
            <li>Sexy shade of red ;)</li>
            <li>I love this garnet- red color.</li>
            <li>is pretty</li>
            <li>The color is more red than it is in the picture.</li>
            <li>This is was my first OPI polish purchase my freshman year in college</li>
            <li>My favorite color for the last two years.</li>
            <li>Favorite red</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>A beautiful dark red with some sparkle.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a must have.</li>
            <li>I love the name &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&amp;#34; I love this hue of red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain</li>
            <li>A great year round red &amp;</li>
            <li>someone is always telling me how much they like my nail color.</li>
            <li>My wife states it is very durable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really remember when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I feel very luxe when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Better than expected color</li>
            <li>It is a rich, shiny, red.</li>
            <li>A really unique shade of red</li>
            <li>This color actually had a very happily married man at my office drooling, he had to get the color for his wife to wear!</li>
            <li>I had a dark red color like this before, but this polish is much shinier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted for my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It looks very classy on.</li>
            <li>then she went &amp; bought a new car the exact same color she has since stolen this shade from me</li>
            <li>Not too dark, not too light.</li>
            <li>Many compliments on this color - hard to find in store presently - older color.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty red.</li>
            <li>Favorite color, hard to find</li>
            <li>Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!  </li>
            <li>Again it was purchased as a present for a friend who can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I love the name but the color is a rich dark red that can be used for any occassion espcially with that little black dress.</li>
            <li>and you want to add a little extra something special to your manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the actual color matched the picture of the bottle so well.</li>

            <li> It was exactly what I asked for when I asked for it.</li>
            <li> Sexy shade of red ;)</li>
            <li> I love this garnet- red color.</li>
            <li> is pretty</li>
            <li> The color is more red than it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is was my first OPI polish purchase my freshman year in college</li>
            <li> My favorite color for the last two years.</li>
            <li> Favorite red</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> A beautiful dark red with some sparkle.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a must have.</li>
            <li> I love the name &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&amp;#34; I love this hue of red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain</li>
            <li> A great year round red &amp;</li>
            <li> someone is always telling me how much they like my nail color.</li>
            <li> My wife states it is very durable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really remember when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I feel very luxe when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Better than expected color</li>
            <li> It is a rich, shiny, red.</li>
            <li> A really unique shade of red</li>
            <li> This color actually had a very happily married man at my office drooling, he had to get the color for his wife to wear!</li>
            <li> I had a dark red color like this before, but this polish is much shinier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted for my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It looks very classy on.</li>
            <li> then she went &amp; bought a new car the exact same color she has since stolen this shade from me</li>
            <li> Not too dark, not too light.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on this color - hard to find in store presently - older color.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty red.</li>
            <li> Favorite color, hard to find</li>
            <li> Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!  </li>
            <li> Again it was purchased as a present for a friend who can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I love the name but the color is a rich dark red that can be used for any occassion espcially with that little black dress.</li>
            <li> and you want to add a little extra something special to your manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the actual color matched the picture of the bottle so well.</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting and admired color.</li>
            <li> this color has been around  for a long time.</li>
            <li> You can wear this color all year long.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn it in a long time.</li>
            <li> A dark, wine colored red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress for a long time</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a red with a dark pink tone or a dark pink raspberry with a hint of red in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not Really</li>
            <li> This discontinued color was old and almost too thick to use.  </li>
            <li> It is a dark burgundy color with a hint of sparkle.  </li>
            <li> Then, the shoe dropped, I lost the bottle and my manicurist said it was not available to order from their order listing.  </li>
            <li> My go to color year round.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> A lot of my coworkers and customers ask me what the color I&#x27;m wearing on my nails, and I normally at least get a giggle when I tell them the nail polish&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> This is way less pink in person, and it stained my nails orange even through a base coat.</li>
            <li> I do wish they wouldn&#x27;t always be changing the colors, so hard to find my favorites!</li>
            <li> Enough said, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When u take off this nail polish it leaves yr nails looking really yellow and nasty.</li>
            <li> I just think that the shipping cost was outrageous.</li>

            <li> Item delivered as described and on time</li>
            <li> One of my favorite reds! Very wearable for all skin types, this red has maroon and warm glitter - I will wear this winter, spring, summer and fall.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I just think that the shipping cost was outrageous.</li>
            <li> A beautiful dark red with some sparkle. This is the perfect shade to wear when the holiday season comes up and you want to add a little extra something special to your manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors  from Opi... this color has been around  for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Arrived quickly and just used it yesterday at my favorite nail salon. Great OPI quality.</li>
            <li> My favorite, classic OPI color - always get compliments when it is worn!!! I wear this color about 75% of my nail polishing time. Love it, love the name!</li>
            <li> This is probably my all time favorite shade of red. The picture is very accurate as to what the color looks like in person. Not too dark, not too light. I would reccommend this color to anyone! Great buy!</li>
            <li> A lot of my coworkers and customers ask me what the color I&#x27;m wearing on my nails, and I normally at least get a giggle when I tell them the nail polish&#x27;s name. I had a dark red color like this before, but this polish is much shinier and more vibrant. My nails have been this color since I bought the polish.</li>
            <li> The sender took great care to protect and send a breakable item through the mail. It was exactly what I asked for when I asked for it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Again it was purchased as a present for a friend who can&#x27;t live without it. It is a rich, shiny, red. Just right!</li>
            <li> My favorite color of all time. Waited tables for years and got many compliments on the color. I&#x27;m nursing now, and still get noticed. OPI is the best.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful color!</li>
            <li> My husband was really excited to see this color! Sexy shade of red ;)</li>
            <li> I love this garnet- red color. It is so bright and pretty on toes!</li>
            <li> Absolutely classic color and excellent formula. Pretty much a must have.</li>
            <li> Love the color!!  Love OPI!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the top was damaged somehow but honestly it&#x27;s not a big deal color is still nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this color for around 3 years now....I hope they never stop making this....someone is always telling me how much they like my nail color.</li>
            <li> I have been getting a mani/pedi for years and have so many colors I&#x27;ve liked, then one day I had &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&amp;#34; put on.  Well, it was like finding the pot of gold.  So beautiful, without being a clear red.  For some reason it stays longer than others.  I was in the hospital and the staff commented on it all the time.  Then, the shoe dropped, I lost the bottle and my manicurist said it was not available to order from their order listing.  What to do, what to do, what to do?!  Then I found it on line and I was saved.  I always take my own polish to the shop, then I would have it at home for touch-ups.  Now my manicurist/shop owner asked me to order it and &amp;#34;Aphrodites Night Gown&amp;#34;, a lovely shade of pink, for her, as these have both been very popular.  It tickled me I could buy them, when she couldn&#x27;t.  Too much fun.</li>
            <li> Everyone likes this polish / color is pretty I would recommend this polish</li>
            <li> Great material and color. My wife states it is very durable. I recommend, will order more from this vendor and this type, and I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting and admired color. Love the way it stays true to color without fading..constantly getting compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful. .OPI doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> My go to color year round.  OPI is always awesome with their formulas.  It goes on without streaks and it looks as beautiful.  Love it forever!</li>
            <li> The color is more red than it is in the picture. This is was my first OPI polish purchase my freshman year in college and I always go back to it for the holidays. It&#x27;s such a great holiday color!</li>
            <li> This is way less pink in person, and it stained my nails orange even through a base coat. Garbage.</li>
            <li> This has been my number one color for so many years I can&#x27;t really remember when I started using it. In a recent poll, this color was the number one bestseller internationally. It is easy to see why. A dark, wine colored red. And, the name alone puts me in a good mood!</li>
            <li> When u take off this nail polish it leaves yr nails looking really yellow and nasty. Ive used a similar red from Opi  before and it never did that</li>
            <li> the picture makes the polish look almost burgundy, but actually it is the Perfect Christmas red.  I wear it all throughout advent.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this nail color, never goes out of style.  I was very happy with the quick delivery, would buy again</li>
            <li> Love this color! I&#x27;m not a red person but I do wear it on occasion. I love the name &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress.&amp;#34; I love this hue of red it&#x27;s rich with beautiful metallic. I feel very luxe when I wear it. I love the formula easy on no streaks &amp; wears like a dream for weeks. A great year round red &amp; I love how it looks in the sunlight. I ordered it didn&#x27;t show my mama then she went &amp; bought a new car the exact same color she has since stolen this shade from me guess I&#x27;ll have to order another for myself!</li>
            <li> This one has been around for years, and it&#x27;s obvious why.  It&#x27;s a great iridescent red with a touch of berry to it -- good on all skin tones and good for any time of year.</li>
            <li> Favorite color, hard to find</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty - I love it.  Plus with free shipping, how can you pass it up?  And the color lasts.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and this one is my absolute favorite.  I think they discontinued it because they didn&#x27;t even have it at the nail salon anymore.</li>
            <li> My favorite color for the last two years. Doesn&#x27;t chip as easily as some polishes and goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores so I was thrilled I could buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty polish, better looking once you get it on. And many of my clients ask for it by name so I bought a fresh bottle. Very high quality and easy to use. Glides on beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It is a rich burgundy red--perfect for fall.</li>
            <li> Love, love this color!</li>
            <li> Many compliments on this color - hard to find in store presently - older color.</li>
            <li> This color actually had a very happily married man at my office drooling, he had to get the color for his wife to wear! More compliments on this color by men than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Better than expected color</li>
            <li> This was ust the right shade of candy-apple-red I was looking for. For optimal color quality I would recommend two coats.</li>
            <li> I have been having my nails done since 1991 and this is my favorite color of all colors. I was told at one time it was OPI&#x27;s most popular color and I would agree. I love the name but the color is a rich dark red that can be used for any occassion espcially with that little black dress. Christmas, Valentines day, that special day, whatever. I&#x27;m Not Really a Waitress is the Queen of OPI&#x27;s color collections.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color.  Love the name.  You can wear this color all year long.  OPI makes a really good product.</li>
            <li> This color goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> Best red that OPI has ever made. I always get tons of compliments on this color.</li>
            <li> This discontinued color was old and almost too thick to use.  I&#x27;m fairly certain I will only get the one time use of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this color! It has a nice consistancy and it stays on my nails longer than most polishes.</li>
            <li> A really unique shade of red and I love the way it looks.  Exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted for my fingers.  I even love the name :)</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite color and I have been wearing it for years! I have given it as gifts, strangers stop to ask me what color I&#x27;m wearing, my nail salon has a problem with people lifting this color, and it wears beautifully. It is especially wonderful to wear around the holidays. Enough said, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this color. The price was very reasonable also. I fell in love with this color when I was a  waitress eight years ago.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING color.  It is a dark burgundy color with a hint of sparkle.  It&#x27;s become my go-to winter/ holiday color!</li>
            <li> This color is very beautiful. I like it. If you are looking for a red with a dark pink tone or a dark pink raspberry with a hint of red in it then this is for you.</li>
            <li> LOVE OPI.  Good color choices.  Good price point.  Goes on smooth and easy and lasts longer than others i have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress for a long time and it was worth the wait!!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and gives a sleek finish.</li>
            <li> I love OPI products.  I have used them for over 20 years.  This is my very favorite color and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Favorite red that&#x27;s not too red for 15 years and it&#x27;s still available for a reason. I get daily complements on the color</li>
            <li> love this color. I use it at the nail salon and then bought one to touch up at home it works well as it coats easily. A good color if you like red.</li>
            <li> to bright for my taste, to tick when you put to coats</li>
            <li> the price is good  and I like the color which looks like the photo</li>
            <li> Color is amazing, and Opi are the best</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty. It looks very classy on.</li>
            <li> When I saw this color on Amazon I had to get it!. This has been a favorite of mine for years, now that I do my nails at home I hadn&#x27;t worn it in a long time. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The color was amazing!!</li>
            <li> The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one and they say it has already passed the test, best brand out there!  Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!  Best color red ever!</li>
            <li> love OPI polish...it wears like iron and such wonderful colors to pick from. I do wish they wouldn&#x27;t always be changing the colors, so hard to find my favorites!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> As described. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> Very sexy ... great on all skin tones</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty red. I was surprised that the actual color matched the picture of the bottle so well. Not too bright, and not too dark, this is a really nice color.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best polish &#x27;hands down&#x27; (in my opinion, of course). It&#x27;s beautiful and durable...that&#x27;s coming from someone who does not go easy on her finger/toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;This color is absolutely gorgeous, it has always been my favorite.</li>
