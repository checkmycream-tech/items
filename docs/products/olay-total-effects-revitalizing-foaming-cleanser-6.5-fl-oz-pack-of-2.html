            <li>The price is great and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I only use OLAY products for the most part - this one workd well, felt great, but aggravated my condition.</li>
            <li>This has a 7 in 1 process - it does more than clean and is part of the 7 in 1 group of products which Olay makes for skin care.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the Olay Total effects helps me with the signs of aging and comes at a great price.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my face feels quite smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth when applying and makes my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using now for 2 weeks, still waiting to see if it reduces pores significantly....</li>
            <li>I use this foaming cleanser to clean my face when I take a shower.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so clean, and I Iove the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Takes make up off well and makes my skin look good overall</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s economical too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was a product that worth signing up for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>really needs lot of water to clean after use.</li>
            <li>I have used cleansers I liked better, but they are more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I struggle with very dry skin and this cleanser keeps my skin nice and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have minor fine lines (smiling) which I have not seen a huge reduction in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the entire line of Olay products for many years now</li>
            <li>thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>Its  more even amd not so red.  </li>
            <li>read a dermatologist&#x27;s comment that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of $$$ on cleansers because large companies like Olay do a lot of research and provide quality products.  </li>
            <li>I certainly haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;anit-aging\\&quot; effects, but didn&#x27;t really expect to.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my somewhat maturing, acne  prone skin - and found it very drying.  </li>
            <li>Paid too much, but I wanted it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented &amp; has just enough foam.</li>
            <li>As a African American moisturizing is very important.</li>
            <li>It is SO tight I have to take a towel and wrap it around the top and give it a lot of strength and force it off -- what a pain.  </li>
            <li>i love alot of the olay products &amp; use them everyday...</li>
            <li>Probably my fault - I have rosacea and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Even with my prone to dryness skin, I prefer the clean feeling that only comes from washing my face with water and not using cleansing milk and tonic combo, especially in the summer months with all the subblock that I put</li>
            <li>I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s non-drying as many foaming cleansers tend to be...and I had to stop using multiple OTC cleansers after a few days for that reason.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For one thing I like facial cleansers that foam (even though I have dry skin).</li>

            <li> I purchased this with lot of expectation but actually see no difference after use.&lt;br /&gt;I also find it too sticky hard to wash</li>
            <li> My skin feels very tight after using it.  </li>
            <li> It also smells heavenly and you I just use very little of it.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and have a hard time picking up the tube.  </li>
            <li> It also tastes horrible</li>

            <li> I Love this product!  I use this foaming cleanser to clean my face when I take a shower. It makes my face feel so clean, and I Iove the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have arthritis and find it easier to use this product in the shower.  At the sink it is easier for me to use the Olay Wet Cleansing Cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it&#x27;s non-drying as many foaming cleansers tend to be...and I had to stop using multiple OTC cleansers after a few days for that reason.&lt;br /&gt; Even with my prone to dryness skin, I prefer the clean feeling that only comes from washing my face with water and not using cleansing milk and tonic combo, especially in the summer months with all the subblock that I put on.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and it&#x27;s economical too.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy only department store brand, and now there is no need to do so. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the entire line of Olay products for many years now and I can honestly say that they have protected my face from both the elements, as well as many signs of aging. I get comments all of the time referring to my not looking the age I am...thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Great gentle face wash for cleansing skin without drying the face. Prices on Amazon can not be beat in stores, even with using a coupon.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cleanser for a while now and like it. Takes make up off well and makes my skin look good overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this cleanser. For one, I thought it would foam, but I guess the \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; in the title is misleading. No foam. It&#x27;s a creamy cleanser. It also dries my acne-prone skin out.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I struggle with very dry skin and this cleanser keeps my skin nice and moisturized.  My face is clean without that tight feeling from being too dried out.  This was a product that worth signing up for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Olay seems to be A good Product</li>
            <li> This cleanser does take off your makeup quite well and leaves your face feeling great.  BUT it&#x27;s a struggle to open the cap!  It is SO tight I have to take a towel and wrap it around the top and give it a lot of strength and force it off -- what a pain.  It also tastes horrible should you accidentally get a tiny bit around your lips -- I&#x27;ve never noticed this with other cleansers.  I certainly haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;anit-aging\\&quot; effects, but didn&#x27;t really expect to.</li>
            <li> Probably my fault - I have rosacea and my skin is very sensitive. I only use OLAY products for the most part - this one workd well, felt great, but aggravated my condition. I went back to the Age-defying cleanser</li>
            <li> Love Olay products, good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it foams as it cleanses so it removes your eye and face makeup.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the cream cleansers that don&#x27;t foam, so if you&#x27;re like me, this is a great product for you.  It has a nice light scent and my face feels clean and moisturized afterwards.  I have the total effects daily moisturizer that I put on after and I def see the difference in my skin tone.  Its  more even amd not so red.  I&#x27;ve been using now for 2 weeks, still waiting to see if it reduces pores significantly.... but def improves firmness and skin tone.  I have minor fine lines (smiling) which I have not seen a huge reduction in but I&#x27;m gonna wait it out for another 8 weeks to see if it makes a difference</li>
            <li> Cleans without drying.  Smells great. Removes eye makeup while cleansing my face. The only thing is I wish it came in a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I love love the clean feeling that comes from washing my face with this Olay foaming cleanser. It also smells heavenly and you I just use very little of it. The price is great and shipping was super fast. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is so smooth when applying and makes my face feel so clean. I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great cleanser. I use it every morning. I use the foaming cleansing  clothes in the evening.. My skin has actually improved in appearance since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with lot of expectation but actually see no difference after use.&lt;br /&gt;I also find it too sticky hard to wash really needs lot of water to clean after use.</li>
            <li> Olay is the only product I can use on my face and body. Other product make me break out or my skin is dry. As a African American moisturizing is very important. It  also does not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my somewhat maturing, acne  prone skin - and found it very drying.  My skin feels very tight after using it.  I am  going back to cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now but couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Paid too much, but I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Like the way it cleans without leaving an oily feel.  Like the foam and it is really lasting.  We reorder as need.  The price was good and shipping fast.  Over all great product.  Love Oil of Olay anyway.</li>
            <li> i love alot of the olay products &amp; use them everyday...body wash, face wash. this product i just recently started using. love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the cleanser, only the container.  I have arthritis in my hands and have a hard time picking up the tube.  I usually drop it at least once before being able to grasp it.  For most people this would not be a problem.  I have used cleansers I liked better, but they are more expensive.  I would purchase it again simply for the price.  I use Olay Regenerist moisturizers and prefer the cleansers that go with those products.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cleanser that cleans your face effectively, removes make-up, isn&#x27;t drying, and has a pleasant scent, you may want to try this foaming cleanser by Olay.  You only need a little bit as it is concentrated. You put a squirt of it in your hands you have washed in water and make a foam to wash your face.  I also put it on a wash cloth.  You feel you are getting a deep cleansing and it is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a dermatologist&#x27;s comment that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of $$$ on cleansers because large companies like Olay do a lot of research and provide quality products.  This has a 7 in 1 process - it does more than clean and is part of the 7 in 1 group of products which Olay makes for skin care.  I feel good using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and I feel it&#x27;s getting a quality cleansing.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Hi, I am actually Tom&#x27;s wife. He would never use a facial cleanser. LOL For one thing I like facial cleansers that foam (even though I have dry skin). It&#x27;s lightly scented &amp; has just enough foam. It does not foam up like a dish washing liquid. After cleansing my face feels quite smooth. I purchased my 2nd tube w/a coupon. I am very loyal to a product if I am pleased with it. Amazon offers a good price for a package of 2!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the Olay Total effects helps me with the signs of aging and comes at a great price.</li>
