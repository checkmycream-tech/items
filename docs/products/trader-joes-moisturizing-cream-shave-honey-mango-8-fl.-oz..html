            <li>However, this product has generally good reviews (why?) and is from TRADER JOE&#x27;S!!!</li>

            <li>and it works really good for me!</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff and the best part is that it&#x27;s on three dollars and forty-nine cents at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This shave cream smells great and works great.  </li>
            <li>Smell is not that great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most perfect shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The GOOD about this product</li>
            <li>not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Good price for the quality.</li>
            <li>If the scent is too fruity, there&#x27;s always Every Man Jack Cream Shave; also a good value.  </li>
            <li>Clean, wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shaving cream!</li>
            <li>Trust me, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is truly the best shaving cream you can get for your money, really hydrating!  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is really nice for the legs</li>
            <li>And the best part is that it really does moisturize your skin while you shave.  </li>
            <li>and it foams up nicely, making shaving hassle-free.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and seems to work as desired.</li>
            <li>I found this product to have an amazing smell and do very nice things for my legs, however it didn&#x27;t do anything fantastic for my lady parts.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, slightly sweet, and gender-neutral.  </li>
            <li>Even better than the coveted Zirh Shave Gel.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan/paraben free, which is always nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The biggest proof of how much I love this</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells more like coconut than honey or mango.</li>
            <li>While it smells lovely</li>
            <li>I also love that Trader Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>I got more razor burns</li>
            <li>No irritation or anything, I love this.</li>
            <li>softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There used to be an unscented version of TJ Cream Shave, but the Honey Mango is something men and women can share without losing their sexual identities.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s paraben free and it goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>This cream is great for getting a fast, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This would be ideal for travel as you don&#x27;t need a brush and bowl/mug for lather - aside from TSA restrictions on creams to 3.5 oz total.</li>
            <li>It really is that good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse off easily, which means it tends to build up between the blades of multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>I would give this one star but it is my own fault for purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave and hands down the best shave cream ever.</li>
            <li>, I can never feel comfortable.    </li>
            <li>Not too sweet--leaves skin smooth, moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for a few weeks now and am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth like a baby butt.</li>
            <li>This product allows the razor to glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>It lubricates very well - better than any canned foam or most gels, and you don&#x27;t need to take the time to work up a lather as you would with soap and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even though it is clean and smooth and the vitamin E helps, I do not think it helps with the bumps.    </li>
            <li>You can see the cream on your face when you use this product, and has a very refreshing smell, which is better than most of the other brands.</li>
            <li>The smooth skin and pleasant odor make this my only shaving product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would work amazing for regular skin types, I recommend not buying it if your skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Leave skin feeling super smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>You will be able to find it much cheaper on Ebay or a Trader Joe&#x27;s store (even cheaper than ebay).  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the other reviews and I have to say that if you want to shave your legs with this, you have a very clean shave and smooth legs, I really liked it.    </li>
            <li>mango scent is actually fairly mild and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li>I just started to wet shave using a DE razor and am just on my 10th or so shave and read this was good stuff.</li>
            <li>For people with fair/irritable skin, always use a pre-shave oil and relatively fresh blades.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fast, feels good, and if you can pick it up at your local TJ&#x27;s, it&#x27;s inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li>Same goes for TJ&#x27;s other hygiene products, they are all cheaper in the store and all that I&#x27;ve tried have been awesome (check out the Coco butter)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Really great for a slick face for shaving.</li>
            <li>nice smell and been using this item for a long time</li>
            <li>its so very gentle and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>does it contain SLS in the first place?</li>
            <li>I had to wait an entire week before being able to shave again so they could recover.</li>
            <li>With this Trader Joe&#x27;s shaving cream, it leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth and I never feel any hair tugging as I shave or discomfort of any sort.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving so much easier!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>No weird scents.</li>
            <li>My razor seems to glide more smoothly over my skin, which results in less skin irritation and fewer nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing, has a soft fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I am only aware that this is available at Trader Joe&#x27;s at an economical price, but if you do not have access to one of these stores, then i suggest purchasing at the higher price on amazon.</li>
            <li>More moisturizers than canned foam, a bit harder to rinse the blades, but worth the trade-off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but very subtle, unlike most shaving creams I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>With a single blade, rinsing the razor still requires more and hotter water than do foams.  </li>
            <li>this was my HG shaving product for a long long time because it&#x27;s cheap like 2.99 and causes no irritation for me, but sadly no trader joe&#x27;s around me carries it any more from what I can tell.</li>
            <li>Little to no razor burn and nicely moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product, as it seems to last longer than shaving foam (doesn&#x27;t require much to get the job done).</li>
            <li>This stuff is on the shelf at your local TJs and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t clog up your razor as fast as some shaving creams do.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; cream.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam, but you don&#x27;t need it to.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>But if you are a man who wants to smell like an evergreen tree, you need something else...</li>
            <li>It is significantly cheaper to pick this up in your local Trader Joe&#x27;s however.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After my doctor noticed my razor burn (which I always had thanks to my sensitive skin), he told me I needed to find another solution.</li>
            <li>Provides an incredibly close shave, without any of the mess of shaving cream or gross stickiness of other brands.</li>
            <li>and I normally search for the ingredients for every new skincare product I purchase.</li>
            <li>: I live in Holland, and when I visit a city in the states with a TJ, I BRING IT HOME WITH ME.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s no Trader Joe&#x27;s where you live, give this a try.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it NEVER irritates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>No cuts, no razor burn, and no negative reaction from my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used to have terribly dry, cracked, flaky skin after showering, and had to slather lotion all over my legs to keep from looking like a reptile, but now I rarely bother with post-shower lotion at all.  </li>
            <li>It as slicker than my other shave cream which was Lucky Tiger.</li>
            <li>, so I stock up on this moisturizing shave cream every time I visit someone who lives near one.</li>
            <li>I have extraordinarily sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, the price on Amazon is way more expensive than from TJ&#x27;s directly, if you have one close by it&#x27;s definitely worth it to go yourself.</li>
            <li>Prefer the Neutrogena shave cream for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, moisturized, and no razor burn whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and smells natural.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t have any problem decently rinsing my double edge safety</li>
            <li>It feels like a silky, creamy lotion when you apply it to your wet skin (it should really be called \\&quot;shave lotion,\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Tried it several times so far.</li>
            <li>Accept no substitutes -- I&#x27;ve tried other brands with similar packaging, but they absolutely don&#x27;t compare to this product!</li>
            <li>I have also noticed the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back nearly as quickly nor as coarse as with other gels/creams while using the same razors.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam like crazy (a sure sign of less chemicals than the average) and makes my skin feel AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Better to shave twice lightly than once bloody.  </li>
            <li>Regular shaving creams rip my skin off and leave my legs with major burns</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every shave cream on the market for my tough beard and sensitive skin, and Trader Joe gets it right!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry legs and no shaving cream has ever agreed with my skin.</li>
            <li>I also do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s (Trader Joe&#x27;s:</li>
            <li>Not a thick cream like other brands.  </li>
            <li>(Seriously, I have 6 tubes in my linen closet right now!)  </li>

            <li> I am only aware that this is available at Trader Joe&#x27;s at an economical price, but if you do not have access to one of these stores, then i suggest purchasing at the higher price on amazon.</li>
            <li> More moisturizers than canned foam, a bit harder to rinse the blades, but worth the trade-off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but very subtle, unlike most shaving creams I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> With a single blade, rinsing the razor still requires more and hotter water than do foams.  </li>
            <li> this was my HG shaving product for a long long time because it&#x27;s cheap like 2.99 and causes no irritation for me, but sadly no trader joe&#x27;s around me carries it any more from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> Little to no razor burn and nicely moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, as it seems to last longer than shaving foam (doesn&#x27;t require much to get the job done).</li>
            <li> This stuff is on the shelf at your local TJs and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t clog up your razor as fast as some shaving creams do.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; cream.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really foam, but you don&#x27;t need it to.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> But if you are a man who wants to smell like an evergreen tree, you need something else...</li>
            <li> It is significantly cheaper to pick this up in your local Trader Joe&#x27;s however.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After my doctor noticed my razor burn (which I always had thanks to my sensitive skin), he told me I needed to find another solution.</li>
            <li> Provides an incredibly close shave, without any of the mess of shaving cream or gross stickiness of other brands.</li>
            <li> and I normally search for the ingredients for every new skincare product I purchase.</li>
            <li> : I live in Holland, and when I visit a city in the states with a TJ, I BRING IT HOME WITH ME.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s no Trader Joe&#x27;s where you live, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it NEVER irritates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> No cuts, no razor burn, and no negative reaction from my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have terribly dry, cracked, flaky skin after showering, and had to slather lotion all over my legs to keep from looking like a reptile, but now I rarely bother with post-shower lotion at all.  </li>
            <li> It as slicker than my other shave cream which was Lucky Tiger.</li>
            <li> , so I stock up on this moisturizing shave cream every time I visit someone who lives near one.</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , the price on Amazon is way more expensive than from TJ&#x27;s directly, if you have one close by it&#x27;s definitely worth it to go yourself.</li>
            <li> Prefer the Neutrogena shave cream for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, moisturized, and no razor burn whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and smells natural.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have any problem decently rinsing my double edge safety</li>
            <li> It feels like a silky, creamy lotion when you apply it to your wet skin (it should really be called \\&quot;shave lotion,\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Tried it several times so far.</li>
            <li> Accept no substitutes -- I&#x27;ve tried other brands with similar packaging, but they absolutely don&#x27;t compare to this product!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back nearly as quickly nor as coarse as with other gels/creams while using the same razors.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam like crazy (a sure sign of less chemicals than the average) and makes my skin feel AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Better to shave twice lightly than once bloody.  </li>
            <li> Regular shaving creams rip my skin off and leave my legs with major burns</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shave cream on the market for my tough beard and sensitive skin, and Trader Joe gets it right!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry legs and no shaving cream has ever agreed with my skin.</li>
            <li> I also do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s (Trader Joe&#x27;s:</li>
            <li> Not a thick cream like other brands.  </li>
            <li> (Seriously, I have 6 tubes in my linen closet right now!)  </li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive creams for a face that&#x27;s easily shredded from shave to shave.  </li>
            <li> I make 3 passes and there is only enough lather for 1 and a half.</li>
            <li> You only need a thin layer, so the tube lasts a long time, and it smells really yummy.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;d shave my skin felt itchy and dry, and it would cut myself a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very thick stubble, and this allows me to eliminate it, without discomfort or mess, quickly.</li>
            <li> And please, you don&#x27;t have to press down so hard or try to shave fast.  </li>
            <li> And you only need maybe a half teaspoon to cover your face.</li>
            <li> it may start to dry out, but just wet your fingers on your other hand and remoisten your face.</li>
            <li> I was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> than I EVER have, and not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no rush.</li>
            <li> It may be 100% vegetarian and paraben free, but it&#x27;s the only shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever tried that makes my legs itch like crazy for at least 2 days after shaving them.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other products that would never try again in my life</li>
            <li> Although I hadn&#x27;t had any luck with other shaving creams, I bought this one on a lark and was amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> While at Trader Joe&#x27;s the other day I got tempted with this product.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> There are other creams to be tried, not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it necessary to splash a bit of water on your skin a few times, a few minutes apart in order to soften the hair up.</li>
            <li> my area down there is even smoother.</li>
            <li> I just wish we had a Trader Joe&#x27;s in this little town.  </li>
            <li> I thought that since it was vegetarian it might not be so harsh on my legs</li>
            <li> Also leaves a film on the face that requires a few minutes of rinsing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also difficult to completely rinse off your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this is the smoothest shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Hard to shave without it.</li>
            <li> Rub it in generously and slowly for maximum softening.  </li>
            <li> no more issues!  </li>
            <li> I thought I needed to go to an allergist because my legs were in such awful shape after shaving with the constant razor bumps and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut down on shaving them to once a week because of the painful bumps I&#x27;d get shaving.  </li>
            <li> The time you think you save is spent trying to stop the bloody spots.</li>
            <li> so I wrongly assumed it would not have any type of sulfate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this shave cream.</li>
            <li> It is very thin but still clogs the razor.</li>
            <li> Yet the price here on Amazon is ridiculous!!  </li>
            <li> Honestly I am a chicken</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> and I would never do laser or anything that would hurt me bad.</li>
            <li> sadness :(</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate it!!</li>
            <li> I Hate nubs!  </li>
            <li> Outrageous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is absolutey the best shaving cream I have tried to date.  Even better than the coveted Zirh Shave Gel.  Yet the price here on Amazon is ridiculous!!  You will be able to find it much cheaper on Ebay or a Trader Joe&#x27;s store (even cheaper than ebay).  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shaving cream! It&#x27;s vegan/paraben free, which is always nice. The scent is perfect... It&#x27;s nice, but very subtle, unlike most shaving creams I&#x27;ve come across. It doesn&#x27;t foam like crazy (a sure sign of less chemicals than the average) and makes my skin feel AMAZING. I have very sensitive skin, and it NEVER irritates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest proof of how much I love this: I live in Holland, and when I visit a city in the states with a TJ, I BRING IT HOME WITH ME. When I move to Austin, TX at the end of year, where there is still no Trader Joe&#x27;s, I&#x27;m going to order it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using any of the standard stuff now that I&#x27;ve tried this!</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff and the best part is that it&#x27;s on three dollars and forty-nine cents at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Men shave. It&#x27;s the one thing we do on a regular basis grooming-wise. Therefore, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Razors, creams, soaps, brushes, etc. This stuff is on the shelf at your local TJs and it&#x27;s cheap. Picked it up and give it a try. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used, it lasts forever and it&#x27;s not glitzy. It just works. If there&#x27;s no Trader Joe&#x27;s where you live, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews and I have to say that if you want to shave your legs with this, you have a very clean shave and smooth legs, I really liked it.    I also read in some reviews it was perfect for the bikini area and helped with bumps. Honestly I am a chicken and I would never do laser or anything that would hurt me bad. I tried the strips and I couldn&#x27;t deal with the pain and I have tried other products that would never try again in my life but I suffer from bikini bumps every time I shave and I hate it!! It itches and the bumps hurt at the same time, I can never feel comfortable.    I wanted to try this cream in the bikini area and even though it is clean and smooth and the vitamin E helps, I do not think it helps with the bumps.    I gave it 4 stars because it is really nice for the legs but if you are looking to buy this product for the bikini area to avoid bumps, then this is not the product for that area.</li>
            <li> I was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Listen up you ladies. This is THE shaving cream for your legs and... whatever else you choose to shave. I always try a different brand here and there and keep going back to this one. Try it. It really is that good.</li>
            <li> I also do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s (Trader Joe&#x27;s: Why oh why won&#x27;t you come to Colorado???), so I stock up on this moisturizing shave cream every time I visit someone who lives near one. (Seriously, I have 6 tubes in my linen closet right now!)  I will not shave with anything else, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a million different products!  This stuff is the BEST!  It feels like a silky, creamy lotion when you apply it to your wet skin (it should really be called \\&quot;shave lotion,\\&quot;) and it doesn&#x27;t clog up your razor as fast as some shaving creams do.  My razor seems to glide more smoothly over my skin, which results in less skin irritation and fewer nicks and cuts.  You only need a thin layer, so the tube lasts a long time, and it smells really yummy.  And the best part is that it really does moisturize your skin while you shave.  I used to have terribly dry, cracked, flaky skin after showering, and had to slather lotion all over my legs to keep from looking like a reptile, but now I rarely bother with post-shower lotion at all.  With Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizing shave cream, I get softer, smoother skin, a closer shave, and no flakes!  Accept no substitutes -- I&#x27;ve tried other brands with similar packaging, but they absolutely don&#x27;t compare to this product!</li>
            <li> After my doctor noticed my razor burn (which I always had thanks to my sensitive skin), he told me I needed to find another solution. Although I hadn&#x27;t had any luck with other shaving creams, I bought this one on a lark and was amazed at the results. Little to no razor burn and nicely moisturized skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would give this one star but it is my own fault for purchasing it in the first place. I have extraordinarily sensitive skin and I normally search for the ingredients for every new skincare product I purchase. However, this product has generally good reviews (why?) and is from TRADER JOE&#x27;S!!! so I wrongly assumed it would not have any type of sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does it contain SLS in the first place? The product does not foam or lather in the slightest (sulfates are put in products to create that \\&quot;lather\\&quot; consumers are so used to).  The product goes on quite like if you were to use a hair conditioner to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells more like coconut than honey or mango. ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD about this product - it works well. I would continue using it if it didn&#x27;t cause an itchy itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I used this and another product that was similar, and I like the Trader Joe&#x27;s cream shave the best. You can see the cream on your face when you use this product, and has a very refreshing smell, which is better than most of the other brands.</li>
            <li> Regular shaving creams rip my skin off and leave my legs with major burns so I&#x27;ve settled with using conditioner and sugar scrubs. While at Trader Joe&#x27;s the other day I got tempted with this product. I thought that since it was vegetarian it might not be so harsh on my legs but boy was I wrong! I had to wait an entire week before being able to shave again so they could recover. While it smells lovely and I&#x27;m sure it would work amazing for regular skin types, I recommend not buying it if your skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price on Amazon is way more expensive than from TJ&#x27;s directly, if you have one close by it&#x27;s definitely worth it to go yourself.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shave cream on the market for my tough beard and sensitive skin, and Trader Joe gets it right! Highly recommended for a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried! I have very thick stubble, and this allows me to eliminate it, without discomfort or mess, quickly. My neck doesn&#x27;t get irritated and breakout after either. The smooth skin and pleasant odor make this my only shaving product. No aftershave or conditioner and my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t wake up to the ol whisker burn when I come home after night shift anymore, because I don&#x27;t mind shaving every morning now. Which also means my annual winter beard appearance probably won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry legs and no shaving cream has ever agreed with my skin. Anytime I&#x27;d shave my skin felt itchy and dry, and it would cut myself a lot. With this Trader Joe&#x27;s shaving cream, it leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth and I never feel any hair tugging as I shave or discomfort of any sort. It&#x27;s the most perfect shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> this was my HG shaving product for a long long time because it&#x27;s cheap like 2.99 and causes no irritation for me, but sadly no trader joe&#x27;s around me carries it any more from what I can tell. sadness :( its so very gentle and lasts forever. I won&#x27;t buy it on amazon because it&#x27;s overpriced,</li>
            <li> Great shave cream!  Clean, wonderful fragrance.  Not too sweet--leaves skin smooth, moisturized.  The cream protects legs from shaving rashes-yet allows a close shave--I Hate nubs!  This is one of the best shave creams I have tried--and I have tried them all.  I just wish we had a Trader Joe&#x27;s in this little town.  Thank goodness for Amazon :-0</li>
            <li> nice smell and been using this item for a long time</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, as it seems to last longer than shaving foam (doesn&#x27;t require much to get the job done). It doesn&#x27;t seem to moisten hair as well, though. I&#x27;ve found it necessary to splash a bit of water on your skin a few times, a few minutes apart in order to soften the hair up.</li>
            <li> It is closest to a foamy cream I have used. Bought it b/c thought was be easier to travel with. Prefer the Neutrogena shave cream for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> Makes shaving so much easier!  My husband will never use regular shaving cream again.  It&#x27;s super moisturizing, has a soft fresh scent.  Trust me, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market and I always get razor burn....until I found this shave cream! I LOVE it! It smells amazing and works wonderfully. I highly recommended it! I also love that Trader Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t test on animals. This is a winner!</li>
            <li> WOW!  I thought I needed to go to an allergist because my legs were in such awful shape after shaving with the constant razor bumps and razor burn.  I had to cut down on shaving them to once a week because of the painful bumps I&#x27;d get shaving.  After about a year of suffering I found this stuff and no more issues!  It&#x27;s a miracle product for me!  My skin is soft, moisturized, and no razor burn whatsoever.  SOLD!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this is the smoothest shaving cream I have ever used. No cuts, no razor burn, and no negative reaction from my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shave cream smells great and works great.  Leaves my skin soft and smooth. Follow the directions - a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream you can buy. Provides an incredibly close shave, without any of the mess of shaving cream or gross stickiness of other brands. Hard to shave without it.</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; cream.  Not a thick cream like other brands.  I would not buy again.  I wound not recommend it</li>
            <li> Will not lather up on brush. I make 3 passes and there is only enough lather for 1 and a half. Smell is not that great. It does not provide the smoothest shave. There are other creams to be tried, not this one.</li>
            <li> probably some of the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. No weird scents. Doesn&#x27;t lather much but I don&#x27;t think thats really necessary. Leave skin feeling super smooth and moisturized. I have also noticed the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back nearly as quickly nor as coarse as with other gels/creams while using the same razors. It is significantly cheaper to pick this up in your local Trader Joe&#x27;s however. I don&#x27;t understand why they gauge the price on Amazon just go to the store. Same goes for TJ&#x27;s other hygiene products, they are all cheaper in the store and all that I&#x27;ve tried have been awesome (check out the Coco butter)</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is awesome! i will not use anything else. It provides a close shave and hands down the best shave cream ever. I am only aware that this is available at Trader Joe&#x27;s at an economical price, but if you do not have access to one of these stores, then i suggest purchasing at the higher price on amazon. you will not be disappointed. my husband loves it b/c it does not irritate his skin when shaving! it is a staple in our house now!</li>
            <li> It may be 100% vegetarian and paraben free, but it&#x27;s the only shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever tried that makes my legs itch like crazy for at least 2 days after shaving them. However, I like the smell and it foams up nicely, making shaving hassle-free. I would recommend it to others, but cautiously.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few weeks now and am not overly impressed.  It is very thin but still clogs the razor.</li>
            <li> not as good as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s paraben free and it goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly the best shaving cream you can get for your money, really hydrating!  I recommend for any woman who has to shave her legs often.</li>
            <li> Unless you rinse the razor after each swipe, you will need a hose to unclog the razor.  Also leaves a film on the face that requires a few minutes of rinsing.</li>
            <li> I found this product to have an amazing smell and do very nice things for my legs, however it didn&#x27;t do anything fantastic for my lady parts.  I got more razor burns than I EVER have, and not a very close shave.  I do recommend it for the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> Really great for a slick face for shaving. It as slicker than my other shave cream which was Lucky Tiger. I just started to wet shave using a DE razor and am just on my 10th or so shave and read this was good stuff. It&#x27;s cheap and simple to use. If I had found this before buying my 37.00 badger brush I would have skipped the brush. You don&#x27;t need it with this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t really foam, but you don&#x27;t need it to. And you only need maybe a half teaspoon to cover your face. This would be ideal for travel as you don&#x27;t need a brush and bowl/mug for lather - aside from TSA restrictions on creams to 3.5 oz total. I guess you could mail some to yourself in a ziploc if you are travelling by air domestically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you shave parts of your face it may start to dry out, but just wet your fingers on your other hand and remoisten your face. Use that hand to spread it around again to re-lubricate for additional passes with the razor and to find areas you missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mango scent is actually fairly mild and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Tried it several times so far. Nice smell and seems to work as desired. Fast shipping as well. Good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever. My skin feels smooth like a baby butt. N my area down there is even smoother. No irritation or anything, I love this. I will definitely recommend. N buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a revelation, tubed shave cream, but so is having access to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store.  More moisturizers than canned foam, a bit harder to rinse the blades, but worth the trade-off.  Rub it in generously and slowly for maximum softening.  There&#x27;s really no rush. This goes for all body regions.  Shave in the shower if you can, so the hair is macerated and softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There used to be an unscented version of TJ Cream Shave, but the Honey Mango is something men and women can share without losing their sexual identities.  If the scent is too fruity, there&#x27;s always Every Man Jack Cream Shave; also a good value.  For people with fair/irritable skin, always use a pre-shave oil and relatively fresh blades.  And please, you don&#x27;t have to press down so hard or try to shave fast.  Better to shave twice lightly than once bloody.  The time you think you save is spent trying to stop the bloody spots.</li>
            <li> Great product although don&#x27;t buy it online! I buy it at Trader Joe&#x27;s for 3.99 a tube! Not 8.99! Outrageous.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Use it exclusively!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this shave cream. It is moisturizing and smells natural. No need to worry about razor bumps. This product allows the razor to glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve purchased expensive creams for a face that&#x27;s easily shredded from shave to shave.  On a recommendation, I&#x27;ve found Trader Joe&#x27;s shave cream the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll never use another shave cream again.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and it works really good for me! THE GREATEST SHAVES EVER</li>
            <li> This cream is great for getting a fast, comfortable shave.  It lubricates very well - better than any canned foam or most gels, and you don&#x27;t need to take the time to work up a lather as you would with soap and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse off easily, which means it tends to build up between the blades of multi-blade razors.  With a single blade, rinsing the razor still requires more and hotter water than do foams.  But I don&#x27;t have any problem decently rinsing my double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also difficult to completely rinse off your skin.  But that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be!  It needs to stay on to moisturize.  The scent is pleasant, slightly sweet, and gender-neutral.  But if you are a man who wants to smell like an evergreen tree, you need something else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I&#x27;d say this cream is not for shaving aficionados.  But it&#x27;s fast, feels good, and if you can pick it up at your local TJ&#x27;s, it&#x27;s inexpensive, too.</li>
