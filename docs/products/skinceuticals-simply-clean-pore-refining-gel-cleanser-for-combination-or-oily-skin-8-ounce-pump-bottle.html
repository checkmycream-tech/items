            <li>It is great for people with acne-prone and oil skin.</li>
            <li>It works great to cleanse and remove make-up and also controls oil production.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would probably work great with the clarisonic fash brush.</li>

            <li>need more!</li>

            <li>This is great cleanser, non foamy but gets the makeup off and makes the skin feel smooth, almost finshed with the bottle.</li>
            <li>so glad to see we are off to a good start.</li>

            <li>I use all and only Skinceuticals products, they are the best for my skin  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>which is about $10 more than what you can get it for on amazon</li>
            <li>This does not work any better than a $4 cleanser from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have probably had more breakouts since using this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cleansers out there.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many many years and have always loved how well it takes off all my makeup and really makes my skin feel clean without any dryness.</li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li>I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January along with the Simply Clean cleanser (my favorite products</li>
            <li>It doesnt make foam, and is to strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty runny and will get in your eyes and when it does it will burn!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think as I was expecting a soapy, thicker texture.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Simply Clean since 3years, my dermatologist recommended me this product as mine is oily skin.</li>
            <li>I used it as make-up removal and to clean skin.</li>
            <li>I also noticed my skin not feeling as clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>It does do a good job of not drying out your face too much or leaving too much oil.  </li>
            <li>Great for over active oily skin.</li>
            <li>cleanses okay but have used many other much cheaper cleaners that were better.  </li>
            <li>I always find good deal on amazon for the simply clean than the other sites like dermstore.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; this is gentle, yet effectively cleans impurities without drying my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing though, wish other cleansers from Skinceuticals had such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Has great ingredients to fight oiliness, and exfoliates dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the pain to wash my face with it.  </li>
            <li>and I continue to use it because it works so well and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This cleaner is mild enough to not dry out my skin and strong enough to make my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Great basic facial cleaner</li>
            <li>Very surprising since only one other person mentions this in the review.  </li>
            <li>but I rather get the real thing that works!</li>
            <li>I love these products and this site was cheaper than my Hair Salon/Spa charges for the same items.  </li>
            <li>But this cleanser and CE Ferrulic have made the most immediate and obvious</li>
            <li>My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic</li>
            <li>Just like the name; clean, simple fresh!</li>
            <li>Ordered 3 from amazon due to amazing price but noticed it stinging</li>
            <li>My 16 year old is using this to help keep her skin clean.</li>
            <li>I finally got through the 3 bottles I ordered from amazon (still wasn&#x27;t sure on falseness/spent so much) and ordered from a distributor that was authorized by skinceuticals to sell legitimate product.</li>
            <li>Whenever i wash my face with takes off the oil on the face and makes it look dry but its ok for me as mine is an oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and large pores  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing dirt and makeup with only one wash and a half of a pump.  </li>
            <li>but I feel the seer of it was not selling the real thing</li>
            <li>If its a bit pricey I recommend cetaphil, it&#x27;s really comparable to this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it is looking overall better with the recent additions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I may return to skinceutical gentle cleanser which leaves your face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Skinceutical Gentle Cleanser leaves my skin soft with no need to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I am 51 with oily T-zone, normal rest.</li>
            <li>, I have normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>only used a few times, but honestly, I may need to pitch it.  </li>
            <li>cleanser makes my skin clean and soft without making it dry.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for acne, congested, even sensitive, oily skin types.</li>
            <li>I first bought this cleanser at my only visit to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;only need to use HALF a pump to clean my face, one bottle could last me a whole year</li>
            <li>Recently discovered this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on skin at all.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased some new bottles recently and this product now burns my eyes like bar soap.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really cleans and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my face.  </li>
            <li>Takes makeup off completely and does not dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it does burn if you get in any where near your eyes.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear, which I really have trouble with.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice balance, but I have not noticed any other positives and there are certainly less expensive cleansers that can do this much as well.</li>

            <li> enough so that my skin does not feel dry after use</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other products that are suggested with it, but I would definitely consider it.</li>
            <li> For dry skin becareful.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin oily and dry.</li>
            <li> So this removes makeup, keeps my skin control, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, and keeps blemishes out too.</li>
            <li> It removes my makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and your face feels cleaner!</li>
            <li> I got black heads, white heads and broke out just days after using it.</li>
            <li> This cleans my face and removes makeup with little left for the toner step.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long because i need only a small amount.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Showed up on time, well packaged, and what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that works for her because she has very mixed skin</li>
            <li> The average price for this is 27-30 dollars.</li>
            <li> Have a weird complexion .... sensitive, over oily, and dry as well.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why the price is so much less than certified sellers of this product online elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Previously, I washed my face in the showerand</li>
            <li> This cleanser left me a little dry, but not that uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and this product burned my eyes (even though they were tightly shut during washing) and I had severe breakouts a few days after using it.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this for me a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is also quite drying and hard to apply, not exactly a gel texture.</li>
            <li> Usually after washing, I have to moisturize ASAP.  </li>
            <li> the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and</li>
            <li> It was the Skinceutical new purifying cleansing gel, but I couldn&#x27;t find it and I was out, so I ordered this one...not the same at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one leaves your face feeling a little dry, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wash for 6 years and never experienced a problem.</li>
            <li> So, this goes on thinly.</li>
            <li> Lord knows what&#x27;s in the fake...</li>
            <li> Very irritating.</li>
            <li> Disappointing purchase (seller was fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product from a plastic surgeon several times and never a problem. I purchased it from one of amazon&#x27;s sellers, still no problem. I purchased again from one of amazon&#x27;s sellers by the name of qskinZone and this product burned my eyes (even though they were tightly shut during washing) and I had severe breakouts a few days after using it. I like this product but I feel the seer of it was not selling the real thing so beware of this seller.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this for me a few years ago. I decided to buy it for my teenage daughter. it helped kept her acne at bay and cleared the redness.</li>
            <li> This cleanser was recommended by my aesthetist, and it has been a lifesaver. It&#x27;s wonderful for comnination skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser was recommended to me by a friend.  I like it okay but I may not purchase it again.  It does do a good job of not drying out your face too much or leaving too much oil.  There is a nice balance, but I have not noticed any other positives and there are certainly less expensive cleansers that can do this much as well.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. Leaves skin feeling very clean and has a nice smell. The average price for this is 27-30 dollars. I have not tried the other products that are suggested with it, but I would definitely consider it.</li>
            <li> I love this and it works for me. If I have a within 2 days its gone without popping it and making a scar</li>
            <li> Just like the name; clean, simple fresh!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8+ years and love it. I purchased some new bottles recently and this product now burns my eyes like bar soap. Anyone else with this problem?</li>
            <li> I have been using the Simply Clean since 3years, my dermatologist recommended me this product as mine is oily skin. Whenever i wash my face with takes off the oil on the face and makes it look dry but its ok for me as mine is an oily skin. For dry skin becareful. I always find good deal on amazon for the simply clean than the other sites like dermstore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great face wash. I have combination skin oily and dry. So this removes makeup, keeps my skin control, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, and keeps blemishes out too. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, about 6 years, and the results are the same. It lasts long because i need only a small amount. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I used it as make-up removal and to clean skin. It is great for people with acne-prone and oil skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and have been using it almost a year.  Takes makeup off completely and does not dry out the skin.  I use all and only Skinceuticals products, they are the best for my skin  I am 51 with oily T-zone, normal rest.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It removes my makeup well and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too dry. It&#x27;s pretty runny and will get in your eyes and when it does it will burn!!</li>
            <li> only used a few times, but honestly, I may need to pitch it.  The product burns my eyes and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the pain to wash my face with it.  Very surprising since only one other person mentions this in the review.  I may return to skinceutical gentle cleanser which leaves your face feeling soft.  This one leaves your face feeling a little dry, but not too bad.  Disappointing purchase (seller was fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fyi, I have normal to oily skin.  Usually after washing, I have to moisturize ASAP.  This cleanser left me a little dry, but not that uncomfortable.  Skinceutical Gentle Cleanser leaves my skin soft with no need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have combination-oily skin and have been using this product for two years. It works great to cleanse and remove make-up and also controls oil production. I am a Licensed Esthetician and we used this product in school and I continue to use it because it works so well and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;gentle enough so that my skin does not feel dry after use&lt;br /&gt;strong enough to take off eye makeup&lt;br /&gt;only need to use HALF a pump to clean my face, one bottle could last me a whole year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably work great with the clarisonic fash brush.</li>
            <li> Recently discovered this is not the real product. That&#x27;s why the price is so much less than certified sellers of this product online elsewhere. I&#x27;ve used this wash for 6 years and never experienced a problem. Ordered 3 from amazon due to amazing price but noticed it stinging/burning my eyes which had never been an issue. I thought maybe they changed their formula but found nothing on product website or internet. I also noticed my skin not feeling as clean. I finally got through the 3 bottles I ordered from amazon (still wasn&#x27;t sure on falseness/spent so much) and ordered from a distributor that was authorized by skinceuticals to sell legitimate product. I got it yesterday and no stinging!!!! It was the price I used to pay which is about $10 more than what you can get it for on amazon but I rather get the real thing that works! Lord knows what&#x27;s in the fake... I just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not sure it was the real product or not. Smelled like it but something was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I move around a lot when it comes to products, but this is a mainstay. Consistently my go to facial wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many many years and have always loved how well it takes off all my makeup and really makes my skin feel clean without any dryness.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old is using this to help keep her skin clean. So far so good! It&#x27;s hard to find a product that works for her because she has very mixed skin (oily/normal/dry) so glad to see we are off to a good start.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear, which I really have trouble with.  Stings if it gets in your eyes,  though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, price and delivery time.  I have very sensitive skin; this is gentle, yet effectively cleans impurities without drying my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Nice foaming gel type cleanser. Great for over active oily skin. I alternate between cleansers. Has great ingredients to fight oiliness, and exfoliates dead skin cells. Helps control oil and fight acne. Not harsh on skin at all. Won&#x27;t overdry your skin. Leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean. I would highly recommend for acne, congested, even sensitive, oily skin types.</li>
            <li> This does not work any better than a $4 cleanser from the grocery store. In fact, I have probably had more breakouts since using this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have no problems with blemishes or skin irritations. I have been using this product for more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> As expected. Showed up on time, well packaged, and what I expected.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has improved my skin from pores to acne to cleanliness to overall refreshed and renewed skin. I love it and use it twice a day. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I switched my cleanser to this skinceuticals one almost a year ago and I just love this stuff! I have problem skin that is prone to break outs/dry/oily/difficult. This cleaner is mild enough to not dry out my skin and strong enough to make my skin feel great. I use this along with my clarisonic and have not had a break out ever since, its amazing. If its a bit pricey I recommend cetaphil, it&#x27;s really comparable to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for a daily face wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and your face feels cleaner! The price is good too!</li>
            <li> I got black heads, white heads and broke out just days after using it. I have combination skin, and this product does not help. It is also quite drying and hard to apply, not exactly a gel texture. It smells amazing though, wish other cleansers from Skinceuticals had such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is great cleanser, non foamy but gets the makeup off and makes the skin feel smooth, almost finshed with the bottle. need more!</li>
            <li> Already in a weeks time I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin!  It does a great job of removing dirt and makeup with only one wash and a half of a pump.  Worth every penny!  The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c it does burn if you get in any where near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cleansers out there. This is truly the best for my combination skin. Every time I think I my skin needs a change ,I always end up back with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. Foams nicely, feels wonderful on my face, washes off well and leaves skin soft and clean. Terrific!</li>
            <li> cleanses okay but have used many other much cheaper cleaners that were better.  I am not that impressed as I  prefer Purpose any day of the week.</li>
            <li> Have a weird complexion .... sensitive, over oily, and dry as well.  Tried everything under the sun to help reduce redness and breakouts (thank you to pre-menopausal hormones). This cleans my face and removes makeup with little left for the toner step.  Love the clean feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals is a wonderful product line.  I love these products and this site was cheaper than my Hair Salon/Spa charges for the same items.  Excellent service getting these to me.</li>
            <li> It stings my eyes when I wash my face in the shower, even after I have rinsed it off well.  The skinceuticals product I used before did not hurt my eyes .  It was the Skinceutical new purifying cleansing gel, but I couldn&#x27;t find it and I was out, so I ordered this one...not the same at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January along with the Simply Clean cleanser (my favorite products so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser makes my skin clean and soft without making it dry. Previously, I washed my face in the showerand now I wash morning and night, followed by various skinceutical products. But this cleanser and CE Ferrulic have made the most immediate and obvious difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye fel at night, Phyto corrective cream in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions. People have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; without solicitation.</li>
            <li> Didnt like this cleanser. It doesnt make foam, and is to strong. If it get in to your eyes its like acid. The sking doesnt feel nice after washing it .. Wont buy it again</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and large pores  This cleanser really cleans and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Amazon&#x27;s prices made it possible to purchase it.  I spend $42.00 on a facial, using these same products.  I wanted to use them every day not just once a month.  Seemed to tighten my pores.</li>
            <li> I first bought this cleanser at my only visit to a dermatologist. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think as I was expecting a soapy, thicker texture. So, this goes on thinly. However, it is exceptional. The best cleanser I have tried before and since. The best description is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great basic facial cleaner</li>
            <li> Very irritating. Not for sensitive skin.</li>
