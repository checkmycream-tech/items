            <li> Love it! I bought one for myself, and one as a gift. It holds my glitter very well all day. No complaining on this end.</li>
            <li> It goes on like water and drys on smooth.. Glitter sticks on very nice, stays on for hours, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase..</li>
            <li> This product dose not work well with fine powder glitter eye shadow. It works great with pure glitter. Place a napkins or some thing to cover under the eye so you can&lt;br /&gt;catch the fall out. If you want a stronger&lt;br /&gt;glue or cream. I have a large selection of&lt;br /&gt;eye shadow and this particular hard candy&lt;br /&gt; glue glitter works well on my (eyes) and my glitter sparkles.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping glitter on!</li>
            <li> It came fast and well packaged. It did it&#x27;s job perfectly when I used it in st. Patricks day. My glitter stayed put. Well, I had a little bit of fall out but that is to be expected with glitter. It was very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and item was just as described. I love this product it&#x27;s easy to use and was affordable</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it all day but I tested it on my skin and it works good to hold glitter. For a really heavy glitter look be sure to prime first and use a matte finishing spray. I use both even without glitter but it sure helps</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is easy to work with and keeps glitter in place all day. It is also really easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I never could get it to do/work how it was suppose to. I bought it instead of too faced cause it was WAY cheaper I just assumed at the time they all worked the same. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> Very good  my glitter sticks to my eyes very quickly and it takes seconds to dry</li>
            <li> Genius!! I love this Show Girl&#x27;s Secret glitter glue and brush. Until I saw this, I had no idea anything like this even existed!! It helps the glitter easily stick to the glue without making your eyes feel heavy or sticky. It holds all day and simply feels like baby oil almost putting it on (very light). I highly, highly, highly recommend this to anyone who likes to wear glitter and uses loose glitter on your eyes. A must have!</li>
            <li> I attempted to use this for glitter tattoos at an educational fair.....and it did not work AT ALL.  Very disappointed...$ down the drain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like how this product work. My glitters on my eyes would fall off. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan if this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I got it. It worked great. I just bought some loose glitter and it looked great. Was easy to use. I only did 4 stars cause I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
