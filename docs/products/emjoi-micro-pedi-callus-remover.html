            <li>I was watching  a home shopping network where they also sale this product and lucked up finding a better deal here on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Love, love</li>
            <li>Priced right and a good value.</li>
            <li>Flat out phenomenal, use this for the bottom of my feet and works perfect.</li>
            <li>This was the most excited I have seen my wife about a Callus remover!  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>but pretty good</li>
            <li>Did a good job the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re patient and rely on this product as it&#x27;s designed to work, it&#x27;s the perfect product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it for my wife and paid for 2 day shipping!</li>
            <li>These will definitely come in handy!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use  &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use this product for twenty minutes and feel a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve made hundreds of foot care buys and I have to say this has to be the best spent of all.</li>
            <li>n more comfortable to use then a ped egg for example.</li>
            <li>i have light calluses mostly acquired during summer months because of the friction of the sandals with the dust and stepping.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much</li>
            <li>i loved mine so much i bought one for my dad and for a friend at work.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy clean up, and works!</li>
            <li>Believe it, because it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Other than that I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li>wife loves this, makes it easy to reach her toes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>It is a strong sturdy device and does not weaken when pressure is applied to it.</li>
            <li>This little tool is super handy and best of all, it does it quickly!  </li>
            <li>It has plenty of power and the the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; is extremely fine.  </li>
            <li>I was told Ben Gay may soothe them a bit</li>
            <li>this is so easy and makes my feet so smooth</li>
            <li>With summer coming up, I&#x27;m glad I bought this to help keep my feet sandal worthy.</li>
            <li>The batteries hold up pretty good, but you still have to replace them fairly often to keep enough power.</li>
            <li>This little gem is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>but they liked it and said it worked really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my feet all day and after one treatment my feet look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>feet are smooth after two uses</li>
            <li>but it does really smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic , I will replace it in a couple of months with the electric one.</li>
            <li>So it may not be a good idea to pay more for a specific color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is really the best, simple to use and efficient tool!  </li>
            <li>This device took them off quickly and easily and keeps them off.</li>
            <li>Great for feet and runs a long time on batteries.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>does a great job of getting rid of dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but am impressed so far.</li>
            <li>Not painful and removes callouses as promised.  </li>
            <li>Really works like magic.</li>
            <li>worked very well just wish it came with more rollers.</li>
            <li>the essence of full disclosure</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s so happy with it that he wants to come back home...</li>
            <li>Ordered the super course rollers for even faster results.  </li>
            <li>After testing other pedicure tools, this is my best purchase so far.  </li>
            <li>The roller can be replaced with new more abrasive rollers.  </li>
            <li>Why pay $50 when this one works just as great for half the price</li>
            <li>works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really makes a difference in your feet.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves my feet so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product works great, just wish the batteries lasted a little longer,  Seem to have to change them about every 2-3 times I use it.</li>
            <li>Great for removing dead skin painlessly.</li>
            <li>Does a great job removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product, however do not use if you are in chemo treatment - might be to harsh for the tenderness some get on their skin.  </li>
            <li>well worth the  price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why the picture shows this as purple though because the one we received was just the normal one not this pretty purple one.</li>
            <li>This is so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The reviews are FAR better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun product to use too.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but could have a little more power to it!!</li>
            <li>What a great little gizmo !  </li>
            <li>His foot was gross (love you babe), crusty and flaky; now it&#x27;s soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This little item makes it very easy to keep my feet looking as good as possible.</li>
            <li>SUPER ITEM - FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves my feet soft as baby skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps your feet so soft so easy.</li>
            <li>I have so much dead skin on the heels of my feet that it&#x27;s going to take multiple uses to get it all, but it works great!</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected, a huge improvement the first use.  </li>
            <li>Powerful yet gentle - you see results right away.</li>
            <li>: burn through batteries very fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t have too hard calluse.</li>
            <li>Used this on my hubby&#x27;s foot that had been in an air cast for the last 5 weeks, looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was wanting and expecting</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is literally exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It made my feet soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>and I love the instant results.</li>
            <li>this set at Costco on sale and my cracked heels from wearing sandals all year long became smooth after 3 days of light but consistent use.  </li>
            <li>and it really does the job!</li>
            <li>this product really works!</li>
            <li>It is the first thing that has ever worked on my calluses.</li>
            <li>I first saw the Amope product on TV one night and was looking into it.</li>
            <li>Very displeased!</li>
            <li>This product worked on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly as described</li>
            <li>(Shipping was also really fast!)</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it will do..</li>
            <li>This Pedi is much quieter and smoother than the PedEgg and just works better overall.</li>
            <li>but I overdid it the first couple of times and my feet were very sore.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, comes with batteries and extra buffing rollers.</li>
            <li>It is gentle if used properly and can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li>if you have dry , icky feet.. this item is awesome!</li>
            <li>As I grow older, i&#x27;ve got lots of excess skin - HA!  </li>
            <li>or you might come away with a nice little abrasion.  </li>
            <li>Fast service, appears to work well</li>
            <li>It really.</li>
            <li>it does the job goes through batteries fast would recommend the corded one.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and uses batteries.  </li>
            <li>Item was as advertised and reasonable delivery time.</li>
            <li>It was more than i expected...</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have the time to care for them as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>Does the job and works really well.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt AT ALL and is very efficient.  </li>
            <li>I expected more of the machine</li>
            <li>I bought this for a gift, because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li>I have been using the callus remover as needed for 3 months and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i guess.battery is still working so its doesnt drain it fast...</li>
            <li>not enough power to smooth heels</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>So much easier</li>
            <li>is just too much</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t get much off my heels,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>but, the smell is too much at 3am.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>works very well,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with cracking or peeling so much</li>
            <li>Basically a sandpaper for your tootsies, but it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>my heels do feel much softer.  </li>
            <li>I was so skeptical since I&#x27;ve never been able to find any effective cream or lotions and the idea of a pumice stone</li>
            <li>The roller is simple to remove and clean.</li>
            <li>This left my feets very smooth but the rollers are not for really coarse calluses.</li>
            <li>It came with the blue roller which I think is the Super</li>
            <li>Soo much better than the metal graters and removes the dead skin so fast you won&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I think these rollers are more for those who have already done a deep scrub, and want to do daily upkeep.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and makes your feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The action takes place very quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it in one spot too long</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is even better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I got this unit for my girlfriend and so far she loves it!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper for the same exact thing!</li>
            <li>I have very thick and scaly feet and this powered through both of them in about 15 minutes and left them softer than most pedicures I&#x27;ve paid much more for.</li>
            <li>So satisfying seeing the dead skin off your feet with soaking and scrubbing.</li>
            <li>works as designed but could use  little more power, easy to bog down.  </li>
            <li>just make sure you go outside to use, lots of dust if you have really dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li>One use with my new Emjoi and my heals look like they do when I go in for a pedicure.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, cleans in a snap and when your feet are soft and pink again you will never be without it!</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft again!</li>
            <li>I had to get a second one of these because the first one broke.</li>
            <li>My feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li>But I wanted something that would quickly remove the rough patches from my heels, which is not this.  </li>
            <li>for many years I have had a rough and dry callused feet.</li>
            <li>I ordered the refill Rollers (Extra, Super, Coarse)  but haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li>I had a large callous on the side of my big toe</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous little device.</li>
            <li>I love this, it works great on my awful heels.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the quickest and gives five star results.  </li>
            <li>As far as working...</li>
            <li>No pain, no problems, just glorious soft feet.  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently</li>
            <li>My feet feel baby feet soft.</li>
            <li>and my heels are so soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by how well this worked</li>
            <li>Still will use - only very sparingly.</li>
            <li>My heels are so soft..</li>
            <li>I use it directly after my shower while the skin is still soft.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>From what I assume, I think the layers of skin on my feet are no longer shedding skin as they used to (as I don&#x27;t have any illness that has dry, hot feet as a symptom)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will have battery issues or if it breaks down quickly.  </li>
            <li>The coarse ones did a decent job.</li>
            <li>small grains, takes a while to get a smooth foot bottom..</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;ve never felt so comfortable walking past someone or standing in front of someone until I purchased the Emjoi</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s manages to capture a lot of the dead skin in the little ridge so it doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere like the other device.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the super or even extreme coarse to have just in case.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my hypothyroid condition, I have unusually dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Quickly removed my callous and tickled a bit while removing the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been suffering from super dry and hot feet at night for the last few months.</li>
            <li>The person I bought this for has only used it once so far</li>
            <li>Today is my second day using it and my feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Works very well, scrapes of the rough heels and smoothes them well.</li>
            <li>Gently buffs rough spots.</li>
            <li>I have tried those handheld tools and never accomplished much.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing a plug in one in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no pain involved, but be ready to vacuum when you&#x27;re done because it really takes off all the dead skim.</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time, I should have gotten the electric one because it slows down and almost stops when I&#x27;m pressing it against my foot.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and what I expected !!!</li>
            <li>You see similar products at other stores for twice as much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on a higher priced brand.</li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve had dry feet when wearing sandals I would have to apply Vaseline to aid with covering up the my dry heels, the Vaseline caused my feet to slide in my sandals not to mention how much dirt would stick to my feet.</li>
            <li>Rough, dried skin and callous almost completely gone with first use.</li>

            <li> It works well and leaves the heels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I was watching  a home shopping network where they also sale this product and lucked up finding a better deal here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Way better than than shaving the calloused skin.</li>
            <li> this product is great and  more gentle than i thought even though id would still use it with caution.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Have tried many others with lil results.</li>
            <li> Would be better if the rollers were combined</li>
            <li> Works waaaaaay better than the pumice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Love, love</li>
            <li> Priced right and a good value.</li>
            <li> Flat out phenomenal, use this for the bottom of my feet and works perfect.</li>
            <li> This was the most excited I have seen my wife about a Callus remover!  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> but pretty good</li>
            <li> Did a good job the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re patient and rely on this product as it&#x27;s designed to work, it&#x27;s the perfect product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it for my wife and paid for 2 day shipping!</li>
            <li> These will definitely come in handy!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use  &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use this product for twenty minutes and feel a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve made hundreds of foot care buys and I have to say this has to be the best spent of all.</li>
            <li> n more comfortable to use then a ped egg for example.</li>
            <li> i have light calluses mostly acquired during summer months because of the friction of the sandals with the dust and stepping.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much</li>
            <li> i loved mine so much i bought one for my dad and for a friend at work.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy clean up, and works!</li>
            <li> Believe it, because it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Other than that I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> wife loves this, makes it easy to reach her toes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> It is a strong sturdy device and does not weaken when pressure is applied to it.</li>
            <li> This little tool is super handy and best of all, it does it quickly!  </li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and the the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; is extremely fine.  </li>
            <li> I was told Ben Gay may soothe them a bit</li>
            <li> this is so easy and makes my feet so smooth</li>
            <li> With summer coming up, I&#x27;m glad I bought this to help keep my feet sandal worthy.</li>
            <li> The batteries hold up pretty good, but you still have to replace them fairly often to keep enough power.</li>
            <li> This little gem is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> but they liked it and said it worked really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet all day and after one treatment my feet look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> feet are smooth after two uses</li>
            <li> but it does really smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic , I will replace it in a couple of months with the electric one.</li>
            <li> So it may not be a good idea to pay more for a specific color.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>

            <li> This device took them off quickly and easily and keeps them off.</li>
            <li> Great for feet and runs a long time on batteries.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> does a great job of getting rid of dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but am impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Not painful and removes callouses as promised.  </li>
            <li> Really works like magic.</li>
            <li> worked very well just wish it came with more rollers.</li>
            <li> the essence of full disclosure</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s so happy with it that he wants to come back home...</li>
            <li> Ordered the super course rollers for even faster results.  </li>
            <li> After testing other pedicure tools, this is my best purchase so far.  </li>
            <li> The roller can be replaced with new more abrasive rollers.  </li>
            <li> Why pay $50 when this one works just as great for half the price</li>
            <li> works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really makes a difference in your feet.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves my feet so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This product works great, just wish the batteries lasted a little longer,  Seem to have to change them about every 2-3 times I use it.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dead skin painlessly.</li>
            <li> Does a great job removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Great product, however do not use if you are in chemo treatment - might be to harsh for the tenderness some get on their skin.  </li>
            <li> well worth the  price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why the picture shows this as purple though because the one we received was just the normal one not this pretty purple one.</li>
            <li> This is so much fun to use.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The reviews are FAR better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun product to use too.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but could have a little more power to it!!</li>
            <li> What a great little gizmo !  </li>

            <li> Easy to use and leaves my feet soft as baby skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps your feet so soft so easy.</li>
            <li> I have so much dead skin on the heels of my feet that it&#x27;s going to take multiple uses to get it all, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected, a huge improvement the first use.  </li>
            <li> Powerful yet gentle - you see results right away.</li>
            <li> : burn through batteries very fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t have too hard calluse.</li>
            <li> Used this on my hubby&#x27;s foot that had been in an air cast for the last 5 weeks, looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was wanting and expecting</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is literally exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It made my feet soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> and I love the instant results.</li>
            <li> this set at Costco on sale and my cracked heels from wearing sandals all year long became smooth after 3 days of light but consistent use.  </li>
            <li> and it really does the job!</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> It is the first thing that has ever worked on my calluses.</li>
            <li> I first saw the Amope product on TV one night and was looking into it.</li>
            <li> Very displeased!</li>
            <li> This product worked on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described</li>
            <li> (Shipping was also really fast!)</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it will do..</li>
            <li> This Pedi is much quieter and smoother than the PedEgg and just works better overall.</li>
            <li> but I overdid it the first couple of times and my feet were very sore.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, comes with batteries and extra buffing rollers.</li>
            <li> It is gentle if used properly and can be cleaned easily.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry , icky feet.. this item is awesome!</li>
            <li> As I grow older, i&#x27;ve got lots of excess skin - HA!  </li>
            <li> or you might come away with a nice little abrasion.  </li>
            <li> Fast service, appears to work well</li>
            <li> It really.</li>
            <li> it does the job goes through batteries fast would recommend the corded one.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and uses batteries.  </li>
            <li> Item was as advertised and reasonable delivery time.</li>
            <li> It was more than i expected...</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the time to care for them as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> Does the job and works really well.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt AT ALL and is very efficient.  </li>
            <li> I expected more of the machine</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift, because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using the callus remover as needed for 3 months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i guess.battery is still working so its doesnt drain it fast...</li>
            <li> not enough power to smooth heels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> So much easier</li>
            <li> is just too much</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t get much off my heels,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> but, the smell is too much at 3am.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> works very well,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with cracking or peeling so much</li>
            <li> Basically a sandpaper for your tootsies, but it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> my heels do feel much softer.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical since I&#x27;ve never been able to find any effective cream or lotions and the idea of a pumice stone</li>
            <li> The roller is simple to remove and clean.</li>
            <li> This left my feets very smooth but the rollers are not for really coarse calluses.</li>
            <li> It came with the blue roller which I think is the Super</li>
            <li> Soo much better than the metal graters and removes the dead skin so fast you won&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> I think these rollers are more for those who have already done a deep scrub, and want to do daily upkeep.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and makes your feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The action takes place very quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it in one spot too long</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is even better than I thought.</li>
            <li> I got this unit for my girlfriend and so far she loves it!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper for the same exact thing!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and scaly feet and this powered through both of them in about 15 minutes and left them softer than most pedicures I&#x27;ve paid much more for.</li>
            <li> So satisfying seeing the dead skin off your feet with soaking and scrubbing.</li>
            <li> works as designed but could use  little more power, easy to bog down.  </li>
            <li> just make sure you go outside to use, lots of dust if you have really dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li> One use with my new Emjoi and my heals look like they do when I go in for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, cleans in a snap and when your feet are soft and pink again you will never be without it!</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft again!</li>
            <li> I had to get a second one of these because the first one broke.</li>
            <li> My feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li> But I wanted something that would quickly remove the rough patches from my heels, which is not this.  </li>
            <li> for many years I have had a rough and dry callused feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered the refill Rollers (Extra, Super, Coarse)  but haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li> I had a large callous on the side of my big toe</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little device.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works great on my awful heels.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far the quickest and gives five star results.  </li>
            <li> As far as working...</li>
            <li> No pain, no problems, just glorious soft feet.  </li>
            <li> I use it frequently</li>
            <li> My feet feel baby feet soft.</li>
            <li> and my heels are so soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how well this worked</li>
            <li> Still will use - only very sparingly.</li>
            <li> My heels are so soft..</li>
            <li> I use it directly after my shower while the skin is still soft.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> From what I assume, I think the layers of skin on my feet are no longer shedding skin as they used to (as I don&#x27;t have any illness that has dry, hot feet as a symptom)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will have battery issues or if it breaks down quickly.  </li>
            <li> The coarse ones did a decent job.</li>
            <li> small grains, takes a while to get a smooth foot bottom..</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;ve never felt so comfortable walking past someone or standing in front of someone until I purchased the Emjoi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manages to capture a lot of the dead skin in the little ridge so it doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere like the other device.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the super or even extreme coarse to have just in case.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hypothyroid condition, I have unusually dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Quickly removed my callous and tickled a bit while removing the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from super dry and hot feet at night for the last few months.</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for has only used it once so far</li>
            <li> Today is my second day using it and my feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Works very well, scrapes of the rough heels and smoothes them well.</li>
            <li> Gently buffs rough spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried those handheld tools and never accomplished much.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing a plug in one in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was no pain involved, but be ready to vacuum when you&#x27;re done because it really takes off all the dead skim.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time, I should have gotten the electric one because it slows down and almost stops when I&#x27;m pressing it against my foot.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and what I expected !!!</li>
            <li> You see similar products at other stores for twice as much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a higher priced brand.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had dry feet when wearing sandals I would have to apply Vaseline to aid with covering up the my dry heels, the Vaseline caused my feet to slide in my sandals not to mention how much dirt would stick to my feet.</li>
            <li> Rough, dried skin and callous almost completely gone with first use.</li>
            <li> This little device does the job quickly with little effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually awaken at night (3-5 times) and have to lotion my feet to get them to cool down.</li>
            <li> Works great, and much less expensive than one in a pharmacy - half the price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> I waited so long to finally try this.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I started out slow and would sand my feet every few hours the first couple of days so that the new skin would have time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use at different angles of same area to optimize removal of very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend for people with calluses, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> You will go for less pedicures with having one of these to gently remove the rough and dry edges of your foot.  </li>
            <li> They are coarser than the blue rollers included in package Use on dry skin per directions.</li>
            <li> She indicated that she wished she had gotten this remover a long time ago.</li>
            <li> They take too long and my hands end up</li>
            <li> If you barely press down the roller stops.</li>
            <li> A must have,for calloused feet,I&#x27;m going to purchase extra rollers for other members of the family.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis of feet and they stay dry and peeling all the time, so they feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Googled and searched the internet for products and treatment to cure my dry feet for years</li>
            <li> so I would check the heel of my feet throughout the day to see if they had that dry look...</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry heels.</li>
            <li> but he used it for his elbows to take his dry skin  and did the job !</li>
            <li> In love with this my bf had really bad dry feet</li>
            <li> This little gem has removed every sad bit of dry old winter from my tired feet and left them smooth and sassy.</li>
            <li> It actually looks like little callus bumps.  </li>
            <li> Got mine today and literally took batteries out of tv remote to use it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than expected</li>
            <li> The only downside is that using it can get rather messy, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, and just did not know why they were so rough.</li>
            <li> She has really no complaints about product.</li>
            <li> Made rough yellow dead skin disappear.</li>
            <li> It takes the dead skin off really well and also files down my thick toenails</li>
            <li> Not sure about the battery life as I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times at about 10-15 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> and my feet are pretty much suffocating.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star review but, as I read in some other reviews</li>
            <li> I just apply a little Aquaphor after rinsing off the dead skin and the sandals are back on.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews say you can&#x27;t press down or the roller stops/strains:</li>
            <li> I have a little rough patches here</li>
            <li> My feet are as soft as a babies behind.</li>
            <li> Also, put down a towel before you use it on your feet.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t press down it does not do the job at all.</li>
            <li> I confirm the experience shared in the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m done in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> It makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions, inserted the battery and began buzzing these little bumps away.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected !!!</li>
            <li> , so I might consider looking into the corded version in a few months.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this!maybe</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t use this on carpet, it can get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, it happens again.</li>
            <li> and this took care of the dead skin</li>
            <li> Buy the green rollers for calluses.</li>
            <li> I used emery boards for years to take the dead skin off my heels.</li>
            <li> It works like a champ and got rid of all of the dead skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that I wished the roller part was a little wider but other than that</li>
            <li> Now, the bumpy skin outline will remain, however, the height of said bumpy skin can be taken down to skin level - at least in my case and experience.</li>
            <li> With the little bit of contact your feet make with the roller, the callouses are sheared away slowly.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find anything that helped until I purchased the Emjoi although it does not cure my dry feet it help to get rid of the thick hard dry heels thus allowing me not to have to use the greasy products.</li>
            <li> no more hand  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting, but this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> No more trying to buff my feet in the shower with pumice stones.  </li>
            <li> Not many visits needed to get a pedicure which is a money saver.</li>
            <li> You hardly need to apply any pressure at all, it just goes.  </li>
            <li> works...but can&#x27;t press to hard.....</li>
            <li> I had some pretty awful callouses and within a couple of nights of working on them, little by little, they GONE!</li>
            <li> I get pedicures regularly but an afraid of the cheese grater and razor thing they use</li>
            <li> I have thick callouses on my heels</li>
            <li> This is just for in between unless you don&#x27;t have thick calluses.</li>
            <li> Very little power to this thing!</li>
            <li> , the rollers that come with seem to be a bit weak for what I want.</li>
            <li> (extra $24.00) so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have the worst callouses you have ever seen and this is finally what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> I would always feel uncomfortable</li>
            <li> and it did a lousy job.</li>
            <li> Sounds silly</li>
            <li> sorry to him</li>
            <li> Very weak!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating!</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have bad eczema on my feet and this helps keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> worked like a charm so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Used for the first time and worked great.</li>
            <li> Fast service, appears to work well</li>
            <li> This little gadget is even better than I thought. I use it longer than just 3 seconds as the directions recommend.  It takes the dead skin off really well and also files down my thick toenails so I can apply polish.</li>
            <li> It has solved my problems between podiatrist visits.</li>
            <li> Does great job for what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> works great....but I didn&#x27;t get the extra roller when it came</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I love it and my feet are saved!  Excellent quality and batteries last, I&#x27;ve used it quite a lot getting my feet in shape and I&#x27;ve yet to replace the batteries. It is easy to use, cleans in a snap and when your feet are soft and pink again you will never be without it!</li>
            <li> Got mine today and literally took batteries out of tv remote to use it. I love it, love it, love it. I suffer from psoriasis of feet and they stay dry and peeling all the time, so they feel like sandpaper. This device had made my feet softer and more tolerable.  Would never send it back.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, I&#x27;ve used about everything else; pumice stones, led-egg, the cheese-grater thing.  This one is by far the quickest and gives five star results.  Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Product met my expectations!</li>
            <li> I love it . Does a great job.</li>
            <li> The creator of this device needs an award of some sort. I will never have to endure the dreaded cheese grater to my feet at the nail salon again!  It doesn&#x27;t tickle...hurt...or insult you!  I can wear flip flops to my hearts content, knowing I can come home and erase the remains of the day myself. Bravo!!</li>
            <li> I love it! It really. My feet are so soft again!</li>
            <li> Used this on my hubby&#x27;s foot that had been in an air cast for the last 5 weeks, looks soooo much better. His foot was gross (love you babe), crusty and flaky; now it&#x27;s soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> i do not know. it for my daughter</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product but the immediate and  excellent customer service on its own deserve ten stars. Hat&#x27;s off to Hillary&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Works excellent  well worth the  price</li>
            <li> it does the job goes through batteries fast would recommend the corded one. Also go with the more course wheel.</li>
            <li> The Emloi -callus remover is great ,I love it ,and it does the job</li>
            <li> SUPER ITEM - FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Great for taking care of callus on the feet.  It is gentle if used properly and can be cleaned easily.  The roller can be replaced with new more abrasive rollers.  Very affordable and uses batteries.  Item was as advertised and reasonable delivery time.</li>
            <li> It seems to work okay but could have a little more power to it!!</li>
            <li> It was more than i expected...Great tool..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was wanting and expecting</li>
            <li> Best foot purchase ever.</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for has only used it once so far but they liked it and said it worked really well. I&#x27;m not quite sure why the picture shows this as purple though because the one we received was just the normal one not this pretty purple one. So it may not be a good idea to pay more for a specific color.</li>
            <li> Great!  gave as a gift my mom liked it</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! But be careful not to overuse it because your heals will get sensitive. Otherwise it is everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Makes even the roughest feet so smooth....suggestion though. Buy extra heads!!!</li>
            <li> This is great,! no more hand  remove callus with pumic!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is exactly what I wanted. It is a strong sturdy device and does not weaken when pressure is applied to it. The roller is simple to remove and clean. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more. It is literally exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, hoping it would be better than a block stone. She has used it often and is so glad she got it. She indicated that she wished she had gotten this remover a long time ago. I would think that the price, the way it works for her, she would recommend it.</li>
            <li> A must have,for calloused feet,I&#x27;m going to purchase extra rollers for other members of the family.</li>
            <li> As I grow older, i&#x27;ve got lots of excess skin - HA!  It actually looks like little callus bumps.  However, they are located on my elbow, upper arms, lower legs, feet - you get the idea.  Asked my dermatologist, who looked at them and told me, yep, you&#x27;ve got extra skin.  Nothing medically can be done.  So, I ordered the EMJOI MICRO-PED. via PRIME.  In no time, it was at my doorstep.  Read the instructions, inserted the battery and began buzzing these little bumps away.  The action takes place very quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it in one spot too long or you might come away with a nice little abrasion.  Now, the bumpy skin outline will remain, however, the height of said bumpy skin can be taken down to skin level - at least in my case and experience.</li>
            <li> I confirm the experience shared in the previous reviews. The thing stops as soon as you even TOUCH the roller to the skin surface! Very weak! I was excited to get it for my wife and paid for 2 day shipping! (extra $24.00) so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition....Easy to use, easy clean up, and works! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product works great, just wish the batteries lasted a little longer,  Seem to have to change them about every 2-3 times I use it.</li>
            <li> Love it !!! It does exactly what it says and what I expected !!! Arrived sooner then expected !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Ped Egg and Perfect Pedi and achieved so-so results. But this.....is the tool I&#x27;ve been waiting for. My feet aren&#x27;t bad. I have a little rough patches here and there but I don&#x27;t have the time to care for them as much as I used to. I achieve salon perfect results using this once or twice a week. With summer coming up, I&#x27;m glad I bought this to help keep my feet sandal worthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when you don&#x27;t have too hard calluse. Next time I would buy the plug in not battery powered.</li>
            <li> works very well and easy to use. Delivery was faster than expected</li>
            <li> It works great! I love it! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Does the job and works really well. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a higher priced brand.</li>
            <li> my mother bought this for her and she&#x27;s very pleased with it. :)</li>
            <li> Very good, does the job!</li>
            <li> Very little power to this thing!</li>
            <li> After testing other pedicure tools, this is my best purchase so far.  It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves my feet so smooth and soft.  I&#x27;ve used it once a week for about a month and have not replaced the roller yet even though I purchased additional rollers.  I have changed the batteries once, so I might consider looking into the corded version in a few months.  Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend or gift to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Great for feet and runs a long time on batteries.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dead skin painlessly.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!! I got one for my mom who has cracked heels and it smoothed her heels amazingly! I just ordered one for myself too.</li>
            <li> Why pay $50 when this one works just as great for half the price</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, one use and my feet look amazing!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting, but this product exceeded my expectations. I have thick callouses on my heels and I was able to use this product for twenty minutes and feel a HUGE difference. There was no pain involved, but be ready to vacuum when you&#x27;re done because it really takes off all the dead skim. Today is my second day using it and my feet feel so soft. I&#x27;m darn impressed.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. It made my feet soft &amp; smooth. Very easy to use  &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this!maybe it will work for some people,but it didn&#x27;t for me.Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I have the worst callouses you have ever seen and this is finally what I have been looking for! Believe it, because it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves my feet soft as baby skin.</li>
            <li> I had to get a second one of these because the first one broke. The roller stopped as soon as it touched anything. Didn&#x27;t last too long so we&#x27;ll see how the second one does. As far as working...I like it</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the search for foot products that get me through between pedicures and this one finally does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my dream product that I have been envisioning in my head and didnt even know it!  ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi works like a mini sander for your feet.  It does not hurt AT ALL and is very efficient.  You hardly need to apply any pressure at all, it just goes.  It has plenty of power and the the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; is extremely fine.  No pain, no problems, just glorious soft feet.  I love it and would buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> I got this unit for my girlfriend and so far she loves it!! Very powerful and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have!!!! Over the years I&#x27;ve made hundreds of foot care buys and I have to say this has to be the best spent of all. I have already recommended it to all my friends and family. ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I expected more of the machine</li>
            <li> I actually regret buying this.  If I had hours to sit and tenderly roll this over my feet,  it would be great.  But I wanted something that would quickly remove the rough patches from my heels, which is not this.  I have used it one time only, and probably won&#x27;t again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift, because I like mine so much. It keeps your feet so soft so easy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I ordered this Pedi and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. I also have the PedEgg and this works much better. It came with the blue roller which I think is the Super and it&#x27;s worked good so far. I ordered the refill Rollers (Extra, Super, Coarse)  but haven&#x27;t used them yet. This Pedi is much quieter and smoother than the PedEgg and just works better overall. If I had one complaint it would be that I wished the roller part was a little wider but other than that no complaints at all. Not sure about the battery life as I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times at about 10-15 minutes each time. So far so good.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I&#x27;m thrilled. Efficient and effective.</li>
            <li> My wife love this. Works great. Paid only $22.95</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, for christmas. She loves it! It works great, and easy to use. The package comes with batteries and an extra roller. The only downside is that using it can get rather messy, so keep that in mind. Totally recommend for people with calluses, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that is battery operated.  The batteries hold up pretty good, but you still have to replace them fairly often to keep enough power.</li>
            <li> I have been using the callus remover as needed for 3 months and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This is so much fun to use. I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before and I love the instant results. I&#x27;m on my feet all day and after one treatment my feet look fabulous.</li>
            <li> This little gem has removed every sad bit of dry old winter from my tired feet and left them smooth and sassy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Not painful and removes callouses as promised.  Easy to use &amp; clean.  Very satisfied with my purchase &amp; will continue to use it and buy refills.</li>
            <li> I love it...it works awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: burn through batteries very fast</li>
            <li> If you cannot get a pedicure, this callus remove is wonderful. I picked up the extra course (Xtreme coarse) rollers and it worked better than those included with the unit. Easy to use and really makes a difference in your feet.</li>
            <li> small grains, takes a while to get a smooth foot bottom..but pretty good i guess.battery is still working so its doesnt drain it fast...kinda surprise about that.</li>
            <li> not enough power to smooth heels</li>
            <li> Work great!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> This was the most excited I have seen my wife about a Callus remover!  She&#x27;s thoroughly enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the Emjoi Xtreme Coarse Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers to go with this tool. The ones that come with it were hardly effective. The coarse ones did a decent job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected. Powerful yet gentle - you see results right away. I just bought one for my mom for mothers&#x27; day. Another plus, the price. You see similar products at other stores for twice as much. I LOVE IT! Great investment.</li>
            <li> This works very well. Would recommend to anyone.It all doesn&#x27;t disappear in one shaving, but what a difference</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember the last time I so eagerly gave 5 stars! So much easier n more comfortable to use then a ped egg for example. Makes me feet so smooth. Finally a perfect tool for my feet :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mangled feet after a friend of mine suggested it. It works beautifully. My feet feel and look better. I noticed a difference after just one day of use. I would definitely recommend this product. Also, put down a towel before you use it on your feet. It makes a mess.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Does what it advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the way my heels and the bottoms of my feet feel.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! I was so skeptical since I&#x27;ve never been able to find any effective cream or lotions and the idea of a pumice stone is just too much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this set at Costco on sale and my cracked heels from wearing sandals all year long became smooth after 3 days of light but consistent use.  I started out slow and would sand my feet every few hours the first couple of days so that the new skin would have time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day 3, no redness or irritation and the heels look great.  I just apply a little Aquaphor after rinsing off the dead skin and the sandals are back on.  This product is great for a no time/no fuss person like me!</li>
            <li> Works great.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> For the price, these things work quite well. I have now bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected, a huge improvement the first use.  Wished I had purchased this item many years ago.</li>
            <li> This is really the best, simple to use and efficient tool!  I use it frequently and it really does the job!</li>
            <li> Did a good job the first time I used it.  It comes with a course grinder.  You can get refills that are even tougher if you need it.</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had dry feet when wearing sandals I would have to apply Vaseline to aid with covering up the my dry heels, the Vaseline caused my feet to slide in my sandals not to mention how much dirt would stick to my feet. I&#x27;ve Googled and searched the internet for products and treatment to cure my dry feet for years I was unable to find anything that helped until I purchased the Emjoi although it does not cure my dry feet it help to get rid of the thick hard dry heels thus allowing me not to have to use the greasy products. I would always feel uncomfortable so I would check the heel of my feet throughout the day to see if they had that dry look...I swear I&#x27;ve never felt so comfortable walking past someone or standing in front of someone until I purchased the Emjoi this product really works! It works so good that I purchased one for my ex-husband for Father&#x27;s Day he&#x27;s so happy with it that he wants to come back home...LOL!!!</li>
            <li> The best!  I have bad eczema on my feet and this helps keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> This thing basically works like a belt sander but doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Word to the wise, don&#x27;t use this on carpet, it can get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Works very well, scrapes of the rough heels and smoothes them well.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry heels.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> Quickly removed my callous and tickled a bit while removing the dead skin.  Love it</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  Smoothes my feet without the risk of slicing them like I have when using a blade.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Exceeds expectations</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Awesome seller!!!</li>
            <li> love it works really good will recommended</li>
            <li> This is wonderful...2 USES and my feet look and feel so much better.  I am even getting one for my mom.</li>
            <li> A friend had one of these so I was able to try it before I bought it and just loved it.  You will go for less pedicures with having one of these to gently remove the rough and dry edges of your foot.  It is perfect for your heels and by your toes; just every place that feels like a callus.  I got mine in the mail then order two more for gifts.</li>
            <li> This item is the BOMB!  I love it!  Works on hands too.  I get pedicures regularly but an afraid of the cheese grater and razor thing they use so they don&#x27;t get much off my heels, etc.  This is the answer.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I used it on my hands too.  Probably good on hang nails too.  Definitely recommend this to everyone (boys too!).</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom as a gift. She loves it. Gently buffs rough spots. Easy to use, comes with batteries and extra buffing rollers.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Soo much better than the metal graters and removes the dead skin so fast you won&#x27;t believe it.  Instead of grating my heels for 15 minutes I grab this and I&#x27;m done in less than a minute.  Ordered the super course rollers for even faster results.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i bought it as a gift; she loves it !</li>
            <li> my wife thinks it&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  I&#x27;ve been using what I affectionately called a &#x27;cheese grater&#x27; - you know, one of those metal callus removers and it did a lousy job. One use with my new Emjoi and my heals look like they do when I go in for a pedicure. Definitely a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> This tool is awesome. Easy and fast to use. My feet feel baby feet soft.</li>
            <li> These were gifts for the hoildays</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and was quite impressed.  However, it stated it came with an extra roller and did NOT!  I would have posted 5 stars, but I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Is there more than 5 stars? Use at different angles of same area to optimize removal of very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!!!  It is the first thing that has ever worked on my calluses.</li>
            <li> wife loves this, makes it easy to reach her toes</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. Bought for my wife and she loves it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought my parents one also!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from super dry and hot feet at night for the last few months. From what I assume, I think the layers of skin on my feet are no longer shedding skin as they used to (as I don&#x27;t have any illness that has dry, hot feet as a symptom) and my feet are pretty much suffocating. Sounds silly but, it&#x27;s my conclusion. I have tried those handheld tools and never accomplished much. They take too long and my hands end up cramping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am usually awaken at night (3-5 times) and have to lotion my feet to get them to cool down. I was told Ben Gay may soothe them a bit but, the smell is too much at 3am. After a few hours, it happens again. It&#x27;s very frustrating! I first saw the Amope product on TV one night and was looking into it. THIS product was under the &amp;#34;people also buy&amp;#34; section and I immediately checked it out. The reviews are FAR better and it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper for the same exact thing! I would have given it a 5 star review but, as I read in some other reviews - I think battery powered is not the way to go. I was torn between the two but wanted to give the one with best reviews a try. I will definitely be purchasing a plug in one in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the rollers that come with seem to be a bit weak for what I want. I think these rollers are more for those who have already done a deep scrub, and want to do daily upkeep. I will be purchasing the super or even extreme coarse to have just in case. Summer is coming I am love to be barefoot. These will definitely come in handy!! I also purchased a beautiful lotion on Amazon to go with my foot scrubber, called &amp;#34;Nu Skin Sole Solution Foot Treatment&amp;#34; It is a 5 star product with more than 200 reviews on it. Add that to your cart if you&#x27;re buying this!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job removing dead skin.  It&#x27;s manages to capture a lot of the dead skin in the little ridge so it doesn&#x27;t fly everywhere like the other device.  I use it about 2x a week and my heels are so soft.  It&#x27;s a fun product to use too.  So satisfying seeing the dead skin off your feet with soaking and scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Just as advertized.  Showed it to my daughter&lt;br /&gt;who will likely be ordering one.</li>
            <li> Bought for her and she loved it.</li>
            <li> his no power.do not buy</li>
            <li> What a great little gizmo !  Really works like magic. One of the neatest grooming items I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> In love with this my bf had really bad dry feet and this took care of the dead skin he wasn&#x27;t suppose to but he used it for his elbows to take his dry skin  and did the job !</li>
            <li> Worked great. Buy the green rollers for calluses. They are coarser than the blue rollers included in package Use on dry skin per directions.</li>
            <li> works as designed but could use  little more power, easy to bog down.  Would not buy another</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  It works well and leaves the heels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This little gem is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> does a great job of getting rid of dry skin</li>
            <li> I waited so long to finally try this. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little device. I had calluses on my heels and tried every thing to get rid of them. Temporary solutions at best that had to be continually applied. This device took them off quickly and easily and keeps them off. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This does not have have enough power to do the job. If you barely press down the roller stops. If you don&#x27;t press down it does not do the job at all. Very displeased!</li>
            <li> for many years I have had a rough and dry callused feet. I have tried everything, and just did not know why they were so rough. This product worked on the first use.  it is the best thing I have ever used on my feet.</li>
            <li> works great on my heals and elbows.</li>
            <li> A great product. Simple to use and makes your feet soft and smooth. I do my own pedis &amp; this makes it easy breezy.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how well this worked</li>
            <li> Flat out phenomenal, use this for the bottom of my feet and works perfect.</li>
            <li> i loved mine so much i bought one for my dad and for a friend at work.  great products.</li>
            <li> I love it ... easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> if you have dry , icky feet.. this item is awesome! just make sure you go outside to use, lots of dust if you have really dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li> A great product. Does what it says it will do. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> They were a gift for my sister and she LOVES IT</li>
            <li> Great product for the barefoot contessa.  Works great</li>
            <li> awesome for removing callus heals</li>
            <li> Love this.  It works great!</li>
            <li> works very well, feet are smooth after two uses</li>
            <li> Love it so far. It doesn&#x27;t help with cracking or peeling so much but it does really smooth the skin. Basically a sandpaper for your tootsies, but it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Great product, however do not use if you are in chemo treatment - might be to harsh for the tenderness some get on their skin.  I&#x27;d hoped it would take the place of my regular pedicures but I overdid it the first couple of times and my feet were very sore.  Still will use - only very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I was watching  a home shopping network where they also sale this product and lucked up finding a better deal here on Amazon.  I love the ease of use and the results are amazing. Great for between pedicure touch ups and perfect to have in the nightstand to buff away the day and apply foot cream before bed. I recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy.  Happy wife equals happy life.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She has really no complaints about product.</li>
            <li> Good product that has performed as advertised.  Priced right and a good value.</li>
            <li> works...but can&#x27;t press to hard.....</li>
            <li> I used emery boards for years to take the dead skin off my heels. This little device does the job quickly with little effort. The batteries last a long time and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Way better than than shaving the calloused skin.</li>
            <li> this product is great and  more gentle than i thought even though id would still use it with caution. i have light calluses mostly acquired during summer months because of the friction of the sandals with the dust and stepping. this is wonderful and straight to the point.</li>
            <li> Works awesome.  Love it</li>
            <li> Have tried many others with lil results.This product is worth the money. My heels are so soft..Summer &amp; Sandals here I come..</li>
            <li> The best thing ever and it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective. Rough, dried skin and callous almost completely gone with first use. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works great. I bought one for my daughter-in-law and she loves it, too. I should probably get some roller replacements for the future.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works great on my awful heels.  Definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Fantastic , I will replace it in a couple of months with the electric one.</li>
            <li> You still need pedi&#x27;s.  This is just for in between unless you don&#x27;t have thick calluses.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I just wish I could use it IN the shower. Probably just a psychological issue for me. I use it directly after my shower while the skin is still soft. It did a really good job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> Works great, and much less expensive than one in a pharmacy - half the price!</li>
            <li> I have so much dead skin on the heels of my feet that it&#x27;s going to take multiple uses to get it all, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Love this product!</li>
            <li> It works well you like it</li>
            <li> Did not think it would be as good as it is.  Wow.  Bought for my hubby as a present.  Made rough yellow dead skin disappear.</li>
            <li> worked very well just wish it came with more rollers. Other than that I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this gadget.  I had a large callous on the side of my big toe and now it is gone.  I can&#x27;t wait for the warm weather so I can wear my sandals with confidence.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described with additional roller. I have very thick and scaly feet and this powered through both of them in about 15 minutes and left them softer than most pedicures I&#x27;ve paid much more for. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! I am a Very happy customerðŸ˜„ this is so easy and makes my feet so smooth I use it 2-3 times a week!&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the mani-pedi for my brother and he s a happy customer too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but am impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Other reviews say you can&#x27;t press down or the roller stops/strains: YOU&#x27;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO! With the little bit of contact your feet make with the roller, the callouses are sheared away slowly. I had some pretty awful callouses and within a couple of nights of working on them, little by little, they GONE! As long as you&#x27;re patient and rely on this product as it&#x27;s designed to work, it&#x27;s the perfect product. Will definitely buy again when I need refills! (Shipping was also really fast!)</li>
            <li> Thanks to my hypothyroid condition, I have unusually dry skin.  This little item makes it very easy to keep my feet looking as good as possible.</li>
            <li> This left my feets very smooth but the rollers are not for really coarse calluses. Would be better if the rollers were combined</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase and trusted all of the good reviews!  This thing works beautifully!!!  It works like a champ and got rid of all of the dead skin on my feet.  My feet are baby soft!  No more trying to buff my feet in the shower with pumice stones.  This little tool is super handy and best of all, it does it quickly!  Works waaaaaay better than the pumice stone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this tool!  I can&#x27;t wait to purchase another one and gift it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the essence of full disclosure, I have only used this tool once because I just received it.  I don&#x27;t know if I will have battery issues or if it breaks down quickly.  I&#x27;m hoping not.  If this handy tool breaks on me, I will update my review.  For now, I am really impressed.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, husbands love this, sorry to him I got him purple..does exactly what it says it will do..</li>
            <li> Just used. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Only have to use  once every two weeks to keep my feet in good shape. Not many visits needed to get a pedicure which is a money saver.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time, I should have gotten the electric one because it slows down and almost stops when I&#x27;m pressing it against my foot.  It took a while but I finally finished and my heels do feel much softer.  Great idea, but regret the battery operated one.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My feet are as soft as a babies behind.</li>
