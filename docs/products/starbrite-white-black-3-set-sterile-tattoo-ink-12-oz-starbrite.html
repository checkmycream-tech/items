            <li>But I still prefer intenze as a better outliner.</li>
            <li>Will buy more soon.</li>
            <li>I figured he meant it showed up better on the skin</li>
            <li>I did buy the color pack also, so I love the ink</li>

            <li>The blacks go in easy and look badass</li>
            <li>The nozzle is really easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t drip anywhere.</li>
            <li>The black heals wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used alot of different ink on the market, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best to be had.</li>
            <li>already can&#x27;t wait to order more colors, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Amazing ink, plus USA made thumbs up, done an entire leg</li>
            <li>But I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>its not staying in the skin as good as other ink i have....</li>
            <li>I hope Im right.</li>
            <li>Comes out dark and nice and clean</li>
            <li>Pigments appear to be nice and rich, have only done one outline so far and seems to hold well after healing.</li>

            <li>The product was exactly what my son wanted and needed.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t think I lost too much ink but enough to be upset with my order and feel like I should get more ink for my troubles.</li>
            <li>This ink is vibrant and doesnt bleed out or ade quickly like most black ink.</li>
            <li>It was weird that the bottles came in a zip lock Baggie and one of the blacks was more full than the other but over all they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li>Really nice for stick n pokes, very dark.</li>
            <li>i was using and goes in the skin very well.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>

            <li>Very dark rich color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new  artist looking to find Ink and this is one I will buy again</li>
            <li>Love this inks for tattoos requiring different tones of dark after diluting with distilled water.</li>
            <li>He said the black was more defined than the other brand....(whatever</li>
            <li>Even the white shows clear as day.</li>

            <li> Based on the ink alone. Very pigmented. Never had to go over a line more than one.&lt;br /&gt;I even got my sleeve tattooed with this. It&#x27;s been so amazing.

But I still prefer intenze as a better outliner. But this does the job amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;As for shipping.  Came lame. Very annoying and even a few days after the expected shipping date.

            <li> Very solid ink and under priced in my opion. I did buy the color pack also, so I love the ink</li>
            <li> It was weird that the bottles came in a zip lock Baggie and one of the blacks was more full than the other but over all they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Honestly, the packaging of this ink is what I like most. The nozzle is really easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t drip anywhere. Really nice for stick n pokes, very dark. Haven&#x27;t tried the white yet, not sure if I&#x27;m going to. Nice for beginners.</li>
