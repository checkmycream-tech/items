            <li>It was good quality for the price</li>
            <li>A sleek exotic piece they were beautiful on my model and</li>
            <li>I hope she will love it!</li>
            <li>Is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways..</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>I kept the ring part because it was cute</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Really cute.</li>
            <li>The quality is ok.</li>
            <li>&amp; I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Even if you want to make someone laugh, or buy for throw away jewelry, don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I purchased this bracelet &amp; ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter, because it&#x27;s so unique.</li>
            <li>Received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>This item was well worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>The ring part broke off from the chain the first time I put it on</li>
            <li>I bought another one of these in silver and they both lose their color after wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather</li>
            <li>Broke first time putting it on</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a joke for my grandmother, knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only $2.00.</li>
            <li>This is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a cute &amp; inexpensive gift to give for no special reason, or to add to her Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive</li>

            <li> This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive</li>
            <li> the chain is to long from the finger to the wrist.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes to long</li>
            <li> Very ill fitting.</li>
            <li> Product as expected, but (although stated it would be slow) was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas; on the same day can a week sooner.</li>
            <li> ring too small, bracelet too big.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it was even too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> Got this item today and it was already broken.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>

            <li> I bought this item as a joke for my grandmother, knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only $2.00. When she received it, the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring, or the bracelet. Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together. Even if you want to make someone laugh, or buy for throw away jewelry, don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive</li>

            <li> Very ill fitting. ring too small, bracelet too big.</li>
            <li> I bought another one of these in silver and they both lose their color after wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather I&#x27;m never buying these again.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Shipping takes to long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay and I like it. However, it is cheaply made.</li>

            <li> This is very flimsy.  I bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior Prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it was even too small for my hands. The quality is ok.</li>
