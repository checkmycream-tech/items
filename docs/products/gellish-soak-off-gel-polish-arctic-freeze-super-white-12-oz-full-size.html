            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this as an all over color, so I cannot testify to how it performs that way, but I use this for french tips and it is a beautiful bright white.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, bright white.  </li>
            <li>If you like bright white, get this color.</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about ACG in Bride as an all over white gel color</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I added the large .50ml size bottle to my Amazon</li>
            <li>Gelish is my favorite and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This was a nice, bright white for my Gelish French Manicure.  </li>
            <li>A true white color that is very nice, if you like white polish then you will enjoy this one. .</li>
            <li>Do love the pure white color and once you top coat</li>
            <li>The product is off good quality and the amount is as expected.</li>
            <li>it looks really nice as a french manicure.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice white.  </li>
            <li>Gellish is a good brand, and I have no problems with any of their nail polishes or other products.  </li>
            <li>I love the bright white color of the Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish Arctic Freeze Super white 1/2 oz full size for my french nail tips.  </li>
            <li>It takes two coats to finish the french manicure properly and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I was able to make smile lines for a French manicure like a pro (which I am not)</li>
            <li>After applying other products [[ASIN:B003VMTZ8C Gelish Light Elegant]]</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is a large size and worth</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>or else it will pocket and bubble on you, which is pretty sucky.</li>
            <li>You do have to use more than one coat to achieve a solid color.</li>
            <li>First time I used Gellish polish.</li>
            <li>My french manicure looks like it was done at a salon :)</li>
            <li>I bought this first in a .25ml size bottle from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Love this color for french tips.</li>
            <li>it took ever ,I&#x27;ve try so many white gels and this is the one .........</li>
            <li>god bless ;))</li>
            <li>After the second coat, the polish wrinkled under the light a bit, but smoothed back out when the Top</li>
            <li>It does not dry under the UV light, it is not sparkly like it appears in the picture and it covers like you were using an office product to cover mistakes.</li>
            <li>i like the bright white option for french manicures and this one certainly is a bold white and fits the bill.</li>
            <li>this polish, while covering the nail in one coat, is really streaky and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Love that I can get full size bottles for half the price!!</li>
            <li>Seemed a little thicker than usual but worked great and cured in 2 minutes with 32 watt UV light</li>
            <li>And if you want optimum results I suggest putting a top coat of Gelish &amp;#34;LED Clear Builder Nail GEL&amp;#34;, it is in a little black container without a brush, so you would need to purchase a brush for it</li>
            <li>Have many other gelish colors and have never had the wrinkling problem that I had with this.</li>
            <li>This is a great white that doesn&#x27;t yellow, but you must be sure to do thin layers or it will wrinkle in the lamp.</li>
            <li>It is good, but for french itÂ´s not that white enough</li>
            <li>It seems that is pretty old.</li>
            <li>if anybody know about a good extra white builder gel that doesnt turn yellow while is curing under the light please let me know, iam trying to do a pink &amp;white full set of gel to one of my clients thxxxxx i would appreciate ...</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find white white</li>
            <li>This white is more opaque than sleek white.</li>
            <li>Arctic Freeze Super White - isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>super white!</li>
            <li>The white is really white and  it stuck on the nail for two weeks and more if you keep your hands away of doing many things or use some gloves doing the house shores it will last long and also your nails will appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this particular bottle sold to me was old or damaged.</li>
            <li>This white is good in that you don&#x27;t have to get it too thick before it&#x27;s opaque and fully covered, without any streaks or being too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worked very nice on my French manicure that I did, very thick and one coat did the trick on my finger nails</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am not sure if it&#x27;s my top coat or this...</li>
            <li>although it didn&#x27;t last as many days as my other Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>i cant do french which is why i originally bought this cuz it ripples, and its to hard to make it clean</li>
            <li>Pure white.  </li>
            <li>So I set out to find a better one and despite some of the negative reviews on the product about it not drying well or cracking</li>
            <li>Product came early.</li>
            <li>No reflection on the seller, this product arrived early and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I would give three stars is due to the thickness it just doesn&#x27;t apply as nice as the other Gelish polishes I have.</li>
            <li>chips too thick loved the black</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it, because, it not only keeps the white polish from cracking or dis-coloring but it gives extra strength to your nails for longer lasting polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried any other gel brands for white, but in the past with regular nail polish the white was always a problem - it would get really thick while still showing streaks and never being perfectly opaque.  </li>
            <li>Had to go and get a new one from Sally beauty supply store and this one (although more expensive) is not sticky or leaves bubbles.</li>
            <li>they looked professional with the clear gel coat and my translucent pink gel.</li>
            <li>It works well enough though and it it hard to find true white</li>
            <li>i am so upet that i bought this, im a huge gelish fan, and all of my other bottles are like normal, thin liquid.</li>

            <li> i am so upet that i bought this, im a huge gelish fan, and all of my other bottles are like normal, thin liquid.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and does not take a lot of polish to have a nice thick white coat.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle, but its not like my other gellish polishes.  </li>
            <li> ,iam being looking for a white gel polish for a long time it seemed like it took foreverrrr</li>
            <li> The polish went on a little thick, but by the time I went back to make the smile line, the polish had run well beyond the point where I&#x27;d brushed it on and thinned out, so it needed a second coat.  </li>
            <li> And i notice something that suprise me i saw no wrinkle when you put it on the light ,just make sure u put first the base very thin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long to get here e either.</li>
            <li> Cracked a few days after applying as if product is old.</li>
            <li> I loveeee it ,if you are looking for a white gel polish that looks like pink &amp;whites</li>
            <li> I wanted this as a base coat to help bring out the richness of the color I&#x27;d apply on top without having to put multiple layers on but the color was too thick and a pure white.</li>
            <li> thats the key and the trick and the first white coat very thin</li>
            <li> , im not sure if its a manufacture thing or seller is selling old items.</li>
            <li> A little easier to use than another white</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very runny to the point that it wrinkles no matter how thin of a coat you use.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> In fairness I bought a different brand of white and it did the same thing, so maybe white is just a difficult one to work with.</li>
            <li> The consistency was like I was putting white out on my nails, it was both thick and streaky at the same time.</li>
            <li> The texture is like old white-out, all stringy and thick.  </li>
            <li> remember thin, thin ,is the trick for a long wear and remember to seal the free edge meaning the tip of the nails........</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little strange, though.  </li>
            <li> I like this product but once it is cured it still seems sticky so you have to be careful on the application to ensure no smudging!</li>
            <li> When applying it, it leaves air bubbles and the Polish is extremely sticky.</li>
            <li> Sometimes streaky, possibly due to the thickness.</li>
            <li> very uneven overall</li>
            <li> It is somewhat runny and you have to apply it very carefully, so that it won&#x27;t run</li>
            <li> the pink of the Light Elegance seemed unnatural and caused me to remove it to apply again without the Arctic Freeze base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Should have heeded the advice of previous reviewer.</li>
            <li> shouldve listened to other reviewers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to apply thinly and use several coats but that doesn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li> because it dried out</li>
            <li> This product is extremely thick unlike my other Gelish polishes I have</li>
            <li> Too bad because the color is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This polish is too thick to use for French tips and it&#x27;s very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little thick.</li>
            <li> the cap came apart from the brush, I&#x27;m not sure if its</li>
            <li> The bottle of polish i got was very thick compared to the other Gelish polishes i used before.</li>
            <li> but I always seemed to be dull to me</li>
            <li> This product wrinkles terribly after setting with the UV light.</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> as well becuz if you put it to thick is going to wrinkle .....</li>
            <li> OH NO, this is like a thick gooey consistancy.</li>
            <li> Superglue wouldn&#x27;t make em stick back together :(</li>
            <li> This color is very hard to manage while applying.</li>
            <li> It wrinkles, even with an extremely thin coat.</li>
            <li> Was thick and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> but if you apply very thin coats you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> it the wrinkles don&#x27;t show as bad.</li>
            <li> it turns yellow-ish after 1 week. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. White is nice and bright. Seemed a little thicker than usual but worked great and cured in 2 minutes with 32 watt UV light</li>
            <li> this polish, while covering the nail in one coat, is really streaky and clumpy.  very uneven overall, so i am NOT a fan.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. You just have to be careful or else it will pocket and bubble on you, which is pretty sucky.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Easy to use with great results. You do have to use more than one coat to achieve a solid color. Doesn&#x27;t smell the best though.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this polish cracks. It&#x27;s also very runny to the point that it wrinkles no matter how thin of a coat you use. Besides all of those issues, it turns yellow after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  Will definitely purchase more in the future.  The product is off good quality and the amount is as expected.</li>
            <li> Worked very nice on my French manicure that I did, very thick and one coat did the trick on my finger nails</li>
            <li> I like this product but once it is cured it still seems sticky so you have to be careful on the application to ensure no smudging!</li>
            <li> This polish is too thick to use for French tips and it&#x27;s very hard to remove. I&#x27;ve tried to apply thinly and use several coats but that doesn&#x27;t work either.  It bubbles after cured for just 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> i like the bright white option for french manicures and this one certainly is a bold white and fits the bill.</li>
            <li> First time I used Gellish polish. I have a set of sensationail at home but I didn&#x27;t have to french white. I bought this and used it with my LED lamp and it worked marvellous. My french manicure looks like it was done at a salon :)</li>
            <li> works great and color is just white. White that you use for french tip.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not sure if it&#x27;s my top coat or this... it turns yellow-ish after 1 week. :(</li>
            <li> I love this gelish color! it looks really nice as a french manicure. I recommend this product to anyone.I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find white white but it&#x27;s a little thick. It works well enough though and it it hard to find true white</li>
            <li> A true white color that is very nice, if you like white polish then you will enjoy this one. .</li>
            <li> Thick. It wrinkles, even with an extremely thin coat. Perhaps this particular bottle sold to me was old or damaged.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, bright white.  Hoping to get a glittery top coat to put over it.  Gelish is my favorite and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The white is really white and  it stuck on the nail for two weeks and more if you keep your hands away of doing many things or use some gloves doing the house shores it will last long and also your nails will appreciate it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a physical store location. The consistency was like I was putting white out on my nails, it was both thick and streaky at the same time. I wanted this as a base coat to help bring out the richness of the color I&#x27;d apply on top without having to put multiple layers on but the color was too thick and a pure white. After applying other products [[ASIN:B003VMTZ8C Gelish Light Elegant]] the pink of the Light Elegance seemed unnatural and caused me to remove it to apply again without the Arctic Freeze base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the cap came apart from the brush, I&#x27;m not sure if its because it dried out (again I bought this in a store) and someone opened and didn&#x27;t close properly. Superglue wouldn&#x27;t make em stick back together :(</li>
            <li> I love the bright white color of the Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish Arctic Freeze Super white 1/2 oz full size for my french nail tips.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is good, but for french itÂ´s not that white enough</li>
            <li> This product is a nice bright white color. It is somewhat runny and you have to apply it very carefully, so that it won&#x27;t run every where. 2 coats is sufficient.</li>
            <li> great for french tips</li>
            <li> This is a really nice white.  Pure white.  Covers well.  I use this for my french manicure all the time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get full size bottles for half the price!! It didn&#x27;t take too long to get here e either.</li>
            <li> I bought this first in a .25ml size bottle from a beauty supply store. I liked it so much that I added the large .50ml size bottle to my Amazon wish list. It takes two coats to finish the french manicure properly and it looks great. I cure it for about 45 seconds in my UV gel light.</li>
            <li> This is a great white that doesn&#x27;t yellow, but you must be sure to do thin layers or it will wrinkle in the lamp.</li>
            <li> Love this color for french tips. It is a white white that does require 2 coats to fully cover but then again just about all gelish (that isn&#x27;t just a glitter/shimmer) does.</li>
            <li> It does not dry under the UV light, it is not sparkly like it appears in the picture and it covers like you were using an office product to cover mistakes.</li>
            <li> chips too thick loved the black it is perfect</li>
            <li> This product wrinkles terribly after setting with the UV light. Don&#x27;t expect a smooth finish with this. Too bad because the color is exactly what I needed. Contacted the seller and they were no help. Should have heeded the advice of previous reviewer.</li>
            <li> Was thick and difficult to work with. Ripples when cured. Cracked a few days after applying as if product is old.</li>
            <li> This was a nice, bright white for my Gelish French Manicure.  A little easier to use than another white I had from Gelish.</li>
            <li> I loveeee it ,if you are looking for a white gel polish that looks like pink &amp;whites a  french look ,omg !! this is the ONE, is reallyyyyyy white ,iam being looking for a white gel polish for a long time it seemed like it took foreverrrr it took ever ,I&#x27;ve try so many white gels and this is the one .........But it, but it, but it !!!!! And i notice something that suprise me i saw no wrinkle when you put it on the light ,just make sure u put first the base very thin thats the key and the trick and the first white coat very thin as well becuz if you put it to thick is going to wrinkle .....remember thin, thin ,is the trick for a long wear and remember to seal the free edge meaning the tip of the nails........please!!  if anybody know about a good extra white builder gel that doesnt turn yellow while is curing under the light please let me know, iam trying to do a pink &amp;white full set of gel to one of my clients thxxxxx i would appreciate ...god bless ;))............. My email deliselopez77@live.com to send me the information thxxx</li>
            <li> If you like bright white, get this color. I love it, it makes a statement but goes on great. If you have tan skin, it pops nicely. One of the comments I received while wearing it was that it looked like white out. This is definitely white.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It is really thick and does not take a lot of polish to have a nice thick white coat.  I added blue glitter with it once and I it looks nice.  Package arrived before time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for French manicure tips.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to go on without puckering...!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use as a gel french. It&#x27;s opaque and and not streaky with makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This white is more opaque than sleek white. I was able to make smile lines for a French manicure like a pro (which I am not) although it didn&#x27;t last as many days as my other Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> It seems that is pretty old. When applying it, it leaves air bubbles and the Polish is extremely sticky. Just like a regular one that has been seating there for years. Had to go and get a new one from Sally beauty supply store and this one (although more expensive) is not sticky or leaves bubbles.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely thick unlike my other Gelish polishes I have but if you apply very thin coats you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I think its perfect for a french manicure, it&#x27;s a beautiful bright white. The only reason why I would give three stars is due to the thickness it just doesn&#x27;t apply as nice as the other Gelish polishes I have.</li>
            <li> Arctic Freeze Super White - isn&#x27;t.  It has a gray cast to it which I don&#x27;t like.  I ordered Sheek White which is perfect.  I thought &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; white would be brilliant but isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as an all over color, so I cannot testify to how it performs that way, but I use this for french tips and it is a beautiful bright white.  I do have to use two coats to even it out, but it is a gorgeous color.  I have heard good things about ACG in Bride as an all over white gel color so maybe try that if this doesn&#x27;t work for you :)</li>
            <li> I use this for my french mani and it looks and works great.  Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with a product.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sheek white polish by Gelish but I always seemed to be dull to me and I did not like that. So I set out to find a better one and despite some of the negative reviews on the product about it not drying well or cracking I still bought it. You must use an LED light to cure the gelish polish to get the best results. And if you want optimum results I suggest putting a top coat of Gelish &amp;#34;LED Clear Builder Nail GEL&amp;#34;, it is in a little black container without a brush, so you would need to purchase a brush for it but it&#x27;s worth it, because, it not only keeps the white polish from cracking or dis-coloring but it gives extra strength to your nails for longer lasting polish.&lt;br /&gt;Overall for French manicured nails this white color is the only way to go!!! A must have!! Also the bottle is a large size and worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Gellish is a good brand, and I have no problems with any of their nail polishes or other products.  This white is good in that you don&#x27;t have to get it too thick before it&#x27;s opaque and fully covered, without any streaks or being too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other gel brands for white, but in the past with regular nail polish the white was always a problem - it would get really thick while still showing streaks and never being perfectly opaque.  This Gellish color does not have any of those problems.</li>
            <li> Product came early. Just as expected. I love this brand of gel polish. If your looking for a good brand of gel polish I recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love the gelish brand gel polish and have been doing my own gel manis for approx. 4 years. Have many other gelish colors and have never had the wrinkling problem that I had with this. I practically had no product on the brush and it still wrinkled. Forget about doing nail designs with it. In fairness I bought a different brand of white and it did the same thing, so maybe white is just a difficult one to work with. I used a uv lamp. Just purchased a LED lamp so maybe that&#x27;ll help. Do love the pure white color and once you top coat it the wrinkles don&#x27;t show as bad. No reflection on the seller, this product arrived early and well packaged.</li>
            <li> did my own nails with a UV light to set them. french style manicure. they looked professional with the clear gel coat and my translucent pink gel.</li>
            <li> Works great for French tips! super white! works great doesn&#x27;t chip either. lasts longer than white plastic tips or wraps</li>
            <li> Goes on great and I love the bright white! If you like white tips this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bright white.  The consistency is a little strange, though.  I used this for the tips in a French Manicure.  The polish went on a little thick, but by the time I went back to make the smile line, the polish had run well beyond the point where I&#x27;d brushed it on and thinned out, so it needed a second coat.  After the second coat, the polish wrinkled under the light a bit, but smoothed back out when the Top It Off was applied.  All in all, the finished product is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle, but its not like my other gellish polishes.  The texture is like old white-out, all stringy and thick.  The color is just a basic white.  Sometimes streaky, possibly due to the thickness.</li>
            <li> The bottle of polish i got was very thick compared to the other Gelish polishes i used before. This color is very hard to manage while applying.</li>
            <li> i am so upet that i bought this, im a huge gelish fan, and all of my other bottles are like normal, thin liquid. OH NO, this is like a thick gooey consistancy. i cant do french which is why i originally bought this cuz it ripples, and its to hard to make it clean ..forget it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i just did white toes, and it works well for that. oh, and i use 2 coats of it and a bright color over it which makes it pop!&lt;br /&gt;but, im not sure if its a manufacture thing or seller is selling old items. because gelish cant be selling a faulty product when everyones complaining about it.. i was just hoping i would skate through and not get an defected bottle!! shouldve listened to other reviewers!! they know best :)</li>
