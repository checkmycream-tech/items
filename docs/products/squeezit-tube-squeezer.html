            <li>I found the squeezit on line and it was just perfect.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly as described.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the best design is the simplest one.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s in a tube, you&#x27;ll be happy with it!</li>
            <li>Most people who see mine want to know where I got them!!!</li>
            <li>Great idea and work great!</li>
            <li>The price for 2 of them was also great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these for years and prefer them greatly to the &amp;#34;roll-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great Idea.</li>
            <li>For me this thing works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at squeezing tubes.</li>
            <li>What good is an assistive device that requires assistance in use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the best inventions I&#x27;ve seen in a while, and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>i bought this product and it works great,  if you buy this product in a store ex. waltmart, make sure is not made in china because they just dont work  the one i got was made in israel and i just love the way it works.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d known how handy they are</li>
            <li>I have to kind of twist &amp; push it against the tube to get it to work.</li>
            <li>kind.  </li>
            <li>This is especially useful for those unfortunates living with &amp;#34;violent tube manglers&amp;#34; who refuse to use the sliders even when installed FOR  them.  </li>
            <li>just do it for your own sanity.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors that matched our bathroom.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, simple to use and very effective at doing what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>I originally bought four tube squeezers, and being so  happy with them, I bought some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have toothpaste completely used up.</li>
            <li>but it still seems like they should be able to handle the kind of stress they were designed for.</li>
            <li>I like these a lot better than the rolling kind.  </li>
            <li>I realize they were very cheap</li>
            <li>These looked better made and the style just had to work, so we ordered them.    </li>
            <li>We are even thinking about buying many more to use as stocking stuffers during the holidays.</li>
            <li>It sure worked for us.</li>
            <li>I do it for her most times, and I love it as well.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d need more, I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li>Though these are marketed for toothpaste, I find they work well for both oil &amp; watercolor paint tubes - better than the ribbed one I bought from the art store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have bought more.</li>
            <li>These really work great for the toothpaste tubes or any tube for that matter.</li>
            <li>Now my G/F doesn&#x27;t yell at me for screaming the toothpaste from the top.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than trying to roll the tube up as you use it.</li>
            <li>I love it, rather we love it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find these on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I struggled significantly to get my toothpaste through these and did have to use tweezers to pry the tube through, but in the end it did effectively work.</li>
            <li>This is an item that everyone in the world should own, and it costs less than a cup of tea, priceless!</li>
            <li>Not quite so effective on the stiffer plastic tubes as it is on more flexible tubes; but still worth the effort.</li>
            <li>These fit the tube perfectly to squeeze every last drop.  </li>
            <li>They both work super great and absolutely pushes the contents of the tube up to the top.     </li>
            <li>Glad they were cheap</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my drawer and became an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on the tube.  </li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s on it works fine.</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>I have another kind of tube squeezer that I much prefer.  </li>
            <li>We are not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Also, when you thread the tube throught the Sqeezit, be sure to place on side of the end of th tube first.</li>
            <li>Gets every drop from the bottom pushed up to the top of the tube with no frustration, no broken nails, so quick &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to buy more toothpaste until it really runs out.</li>
            <li>You cannot make a good tight fitting product accommodate all sizes unless it has moving parts.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how the squeezer itself works - nice and tight on the tube, but easy to insert.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn;t fit well</li>
            <li>Okay, so we had the old key-type before</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.    </li>
            <li>kind next.   </li>
            <li>Fun colors.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective design.  </li>
            <li>I use it on Aqua Fresh, Colgate, and another brand.</li>
            <li>I have also used it for chalking squeeze tubes with success.</li>
            <li>did the &amp;#34;roll up&amp;#34; method on tubes and of course, they unroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got these and now all is right in teh world of toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great solution for the little tube twisters in our house!</li>
            <li>Great little tube squeezer!</li>
            <li>These little gems are just as handy as they say they are in the commercials!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and remain pleased with its ability to eliminate toothpaste waste by allowing you to squeeze as you go.</li>
            <li>But when I went back to get more they were sold out.</li>
            <li>This style is so simple compared to others that have moving parts that are more susceptible to breakage.</li>
            <li>I first tried to use it</li>
            <li>Toothpaste, super glue, antiseptic ointment for cuts &amp; scrapes, hand cream, hair conditioner...all have their own little Squeezit in my home now.</li>
            <li>simple and easy to use</li>
            <li>Certainly does not slide up the tube in any efficient manner.</li>
            <li>These make the toothpaste tube much more socially acceptable, and get every bit of toothpaste out of it, so there is no waste.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to be very patient while you try to place them on the end of a tube.</li>
            <li>We find that it works just pushing it straight up.</li>
            <li>So many squeezable tubes are made of semi-ridged plastic therefore making it almost impossable to completley empty them.</li>
            <li>So many times I&#x27;ve had to throw away a toothpast tube or an ointment tube because I couldn&#x27;t empty it completley, but with these...</li>
            <li>They really squeeze out every bit of toothpaste</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s on it really does work.</li>
            <li>It takes up too much space</li>
            <li>I finally managed to get it to fit over the end of the ointment tube</li>
            <li>When I was a kid the tooth paste tubes were made of some light metal, possibly tin</li>
            <li>Cheap enough and works.</li>
            <li>like the design, with the large portion on one side which one may use as a lever when dispensing toothpaste... or other pastes and pastelike substances contained within tubes of the appropriate size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased an item like this in a local store, but could no longer find it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty complete in how it clears the used part of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It slides up pretty easily and stays tight on the tube.</li>
            <li>I just got two more tonight at my Von&#x27;s store - red &amp; orange - for only $3.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Could be a little better, but for the price it&#x27;s going to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It really helps to use up all of the product in that tube with no waste.  </li>
            <li>The photo with the item on Amazon shows 2 colorful plastic gizmos, although the product description does say that I will receive 2 white ones.</li>
            <li>It did not fit any better on the toothpaste tube I tried --</li>
            <li>The items arrived and look exactly as pictured, one blue one purple.  </li>
            <li>She has a hard time squeezing out the toothpaste normally, but with this she is now able to get her toothpaste out without a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get the tube into the slot to use the device and feels like very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>with this gadget I get quite a bit more than the \\&quot;last little</li>
            <li>One of these tubes is clear and I see just how well this product works.</li>
            <li>Wow, these things truly work.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap and simple imatation of a key squeezer and it is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not about penny-pinching, it&#x27;s about not having to buy another tube of whatsoever so frequently.</li>
            <li>I got these for my grandmother who is 80 years old and suffering from cancer.</li>
            <li>Keeps the tubs neat while extracting nearly all of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The unit keeps the toothpaste at the end of the tube near the opening.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, this will help my 9 year old to stop wasting 30% of the tube.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t that easy to come by at my usual drug store.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple to use, helps get every little bit of toothpaste or lotion out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use it on (lots of jamming&amp; wiggling it into the small slot until it kinda fit in)</li>
            <li>Okay, so it was a tiny bit difficult to put the end of the toothpaste through the Squeezeit at first.</li>
            <li>Then, as the Squeezit needs to be pushed up a bit, try pushing on the left or right side of the Squeezit and then the other side.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;handle&#x27;/&#x27;hanger&#x27; takes up a LOT of room on the shelf though, which is frustrating when one has many tubes to squeeze.</li>
            <li>so useful for so little money!</li>
            <li>I was able to get one of the squeezits on one tube after a lot of trouble; however I could not get the other squeezit on the other tube, and it actually damaged the tube of toothpaste.</li>

            <li> She has a hard time squeezing out the toothpaste normally, but with this she is now able to get her toothpaste out without a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the tube into the slot to use the device and feels like very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> with this gadget I get quite a bit more than the \\&quot;last little</li>
            <li> One of these tubes is clear and I see just how well this product works.</li>
            <li> Wow, these things truly work.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap and simple imatation of a key squeezer and it is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not about penny-pinching, it&#x27;s about not having to buy another tube of whatsoever so frequently.</li>
            <li> I got these for my grandmother who is 80 years old and suffering from cancer.</li>
            <li> Keeps the tubs neat while extracting nearly all of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The unit keeps the toothpaste at the end of the tube near the opening.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this will help my 9 year old to stop wasting 30% of the tube.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t that easy to come by at my usual drug store.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple to use, helps get every little bit of toothpaste or lotion out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it on (lots of jamming&amp; wiggling it into the small slot until it kinda fit in)</li>
            <li> Okay, so it was a tiny bit difficult to put the end of the toothpaste through the Squeezeit at first.</li>
            <li> Then, as the Squeezit needs to be pushed up a bit, try pushing on the left or right side of the Squeezit and then the other side.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;handle&#x27;/&#x27;hanger&#x27; takes up a LOT of room on the shelf though, which is frustrating when one has many tubes to squeeze.</li>
            <li> so useful for so little money!</li>
            <li> I was able to get one of the squeezits on one tube after a lot of trouble; however I could not get the other squeezit on the other tube, and it actually damaged the tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At least they (set of 2) didn;t cost very much --</li>
            <li> Had a hard time getting it through at first</li>
            <li> but for me it was pretty much a failure.</li>
            <li> The picture shows 2 in the package as being purple and blue, but the two sent were purple and pink.</li>
            <li> and I tried pulling the end of it a little harder and it ripped the tooth paste and put a hole in the brand new toothpaste I just purchased.</li>
            <li> it was a total waste of money because I not only wasted money on the product I also ruined a new bottle of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> &quot;... though, I suppose, there is now a new definition of the \\&quot;last little bit\\&quot;, but it is so much less than what it was  before I started using the Squeezit Tube Squeezer...</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those without the strength or on a tight budget,  just use a scissors to cut off the flat part of the tube, leaving about .5&amp;#34;, then fold it double and put in 3 evenly-spaced staples.  </li>
            <li> For those 1-star folks who have trouble with these, you MUST first squeeze at least 1.5&amp;#34; of the product up the tube to have room to apply the squeezer ... i.e., the bottom 1.5&amp;#34; of the tube must be FLAT.  </li>
            <li> A little diffiicult to get on, but once you do, work well to squeeze out every last drop of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> On larger tubes of toothpaste you&#x27;ve got to work a little harder to put it on the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> Nore more being frustrated getting toothpaste out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My two-pack came with one green and one red squeezer.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> Money was well spent to make things easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Once you have the Sqeezit started, then put in the other side of the end of the tube.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work on one side, try the other.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these maybe a month ago and one broke within a week and the other broke yesterday.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;middle squeezin&amp;#34; and trying to get the last out.  </li>
            <li> Hello, So the other day I went to Walmart and purchased the squeeze it.</li>
            <li> 1/4th of an inch on either side some paint does not get squeezed though the center is a tight squeeze.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe how hard it is to find a tube squeezer in our local stores.</li>
            <li> No more rolling the toothpaste rube in hopes of getting that \\&quot;last little bit\\&quot; out...</li>
            <li> These are probably not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have the strength to get the darn thing ON the tube, much less to move it up the tube - had to get my husband to help.</li>
            <li> Less waste and less fustration....</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is a little struggle to put them on the tubes, but, hey...</li>
            <li> these are just one of those little gizmos that make life a bit</li>
            <li> Inexpensive little gadget.</li>
            <li> We had a few tube squeezers but they were all in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> I chose to use the green one, as I am not a harlot.  </li>
            <li> With arthritis in my hands, I have trouble with the squeezing part -</li>
            <li> no more wasted toothpaste or cream.</li>
            <li> This little tool does the trick!</li>
            <li> Bought these because I have to use an Rx cream that comes in a very stiff plastic tube that defies squeezing or rolling and wastes an unconscionable amount of the stuff in the tube.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t waste any money!</li>
            <li> There is always at least one in the family that cannot quit get the concept of push the toothpaste from the bottom......</li>
            <li> I tried it on the brand new toothpaste I purchased ,and  I was highly disappointed to say the least!  </li>
            <li> Two boys and a husband can do serious damage on a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and they are not good at all.</li>
            <li> I never dropped them or treated them poorly</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to get some tubes in it</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> They also help keep me from squeezing the tube from anywhere but the end, which I sometimes do, and it drives my husband crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I had originally purchased an item like this in a local store, but could no longer find it.  I found the squeezit on line and it was just perfect.  I use it for toothpaste, but you could use it for anything that comes in a tube.  It really helps to use up all of the product in that tube with no waste.  The price for 2 of them was also great.  The seller shipped promptly.  What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> The item was delivered today.  The photo with the item on Amazon shows 2 colorful plastic gizmos, although the product description does say that I will receive 2 white ones. Please fix your photo.  Secondly, I received only one plastic gizmo instead of 2.  Thirdly, when I tried to get the gizmo on my tube of Colgate it wouldn&#x27;t go on.  So all around this thing is a bust.  Now, per their instructions, I have to return it to Amazon.  That&#x27;s a lot of hassle for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Nore more being frustrated getting toothpaste out of the tube.  I love these things!</li>
            <li> Wow, these things truly work. Okay, so it was a tiny bit difficult to put the end of the toothpaste through the Squeezeit at first. But once you know how it&#x27;s done, it seems simple after that.    We ordered a package of 2 Squeezits. They both work super great and absolutely pushes the contents of the tube up to the top.     My spouse figured that these things would never work. Okay, so we had the old key-type before and they are not good at all. These looked better made and the style just had to work, so we ordered them.    We are not disappointed at all. In fact, we are ordering another set or two so we can place them on the Ben-Gay tubes and hand lotion tubes as well.    Perhaps there is a little struggle to put them on the tubes, but, hey...it&#x27;s well worth it.    We are even thinking about buying many more to use as stocking stuffers during the holidays. Just remember to be very patient while you try to place them on the end of a tube. Then, as the Squeezit needs to be pushed up a bit, try pushing on the left or right side of the Squeezit and then the other side. Alternate between sides when pushing. We find that it works just pushing it straight up. Also, when you thread the tube throught the Sqeezit, be sure to place on side of the end of th tube first. Once you have the Sqeezit started, then put in the other side of the end of the tube. It sure worked for us.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap and simple imatation of a key squeezer and it is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> Excellent product, simple to use and very effective at doing what it&#x27;s designed to do. So many squeezable tubes are made of semi-ridged plastic therefore making it almost impossable to completley empty them. So many times I&#x27;ve had to throw away a toothpast tube or an ointment tube because I couldn&#x27;t empty it completley, but with these...every last drop is extracted from the tube. It&#x27;s not about penny-pinching, it&#x27;s about not having to buy another tube of whatsoever so frequently. I originally bought four tube squeezers, and being so  happy with them, I bought some more. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got these for my grandmother who is 80 years old and suffering from cancer. She has a hard time squeezing out the toothpaste normally, but with this she is now able to get her toothpaste out without a problem. I do it for her most times, and I love it as well. It gets every last drop of toothpaste out of the container. Great product, will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t believe how hard it is to find a tube squeezer in our local stores. I was very excited to find these on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids had been twisting their toothpaste tubes which drives me nuts. We had a few tube squeezers but they were all in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two in a pack. There is only one side that will work to get it on your tube of toothpaste. If it doesn&#x27;t work on one side, try the other. It slides up pretty easily and stays tight on the tube. It doesn&#x27;t leave anything in the end. It is pretty complete in how it clears the used part of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great solution for the little tube twisters in our house!</li>
            <li> With the prices today, getting \\&quot;every drop\\&quot; out of prescription creams is a necessity. This little tool does the trick!</li>
            <li> The items arrived and look exactly as pictured, one blue one purple.  I had two tubes of toothpaste on hand (both crest).  I was able to get one of the squeezits on one tube after a lot of trouble; however I could not get the other squeezit on the other tube, and it actually damaged the tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The picture shows 2 in the package as being purple and blue, but the two sent were purple and pink.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  It helps get the last drop out.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get the doggoned things on my tube of toothpaste! Glad they were cheap so I didn&#x27;t waste any money!</li>
            <li> Work so well on toothpaste tubes.  Each member of the family has one. A little diffiicult to get on, but once you do, work well to squeeze out every last drop of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> these are just one of those little gizmos that make life a bit eaiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the &amp;#34;roll up&amp;#34; method on tubes and of course, they unroll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got these and now all is right in teh world of toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife started using one of them on a tube of hand cream, so we got another set for her use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it does what the product description says it will do. And for that I appreciate the product. On larger tubes of toothpaste you&#x27;ve got to work a little harder to put it on the end of the tube. But once it&#x27;s on it works fine.</li>
            <li> Two boys and a husband can do serious damage on a tube of toothpaste. Here is the answer to every mother&#x27;s dream.</li>
            <li> i bought this product and it works great,  if you buy this product in a store ex. waltmart, make sure is not made in china because they just dont work  the one i got was made in israel and i just love the way it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before so I bought another set since one wasn&#x27;t enough in my household. They really squeeze out every bit of toothpaste so I don&#x27;t have to buy more toothpaste until it really runs out. If I&#x27;d need more, I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li> Works as it should! No complaints.</li>
            <li> Use this item for my toothpaste. Had a hard time getting it through at first but once it&#x27;s on it really does work.</li>
            <li> every household needs these.  mine were white.</li>
            <li> excellent product. no more wasted toothpaste or cream. wish they made them wider for different tubes.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my drawer and became an inconvenience.  It takes up too much space</li>
            <li> I struggled significantly to get my toothpaste through these and did have to use tweezers to pry the tube through, but in the end it did effectively work. Could be a little better, but for the price it&#x27;s going to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best inventions I&#x27;ve seen in a while, and it was worth every penny! This is an item that everyone in the world should own, and it costs less than a cup of tea, priceless!</li>
            <li> These fit the tube perfectly to squeeze every last drop.  They also help keep me from squeezing the tube from anywhere but the end, which I sometimes do, and it drives my husband crazy.</li>
            <li> Though these are marketed for toothpaste, I find they work well for both oil &amp; watercolor paint tubes - better than the ribbed one I bought from the art store.</li>
            <li> These little gems are just as handy as they say they are in the commercials! Just put them on the bottom of any tube and push forward as needed. Gets every drop from the bottom pushed up to the top of the tube with no frustration, no broken nails, so quick &amp; easy.  I got a set on a sale aisle in a local store. If I&#x27;d known how handy they are I&#x27;d have bought more. But when I went back to get more they were sold out. So I ordered from Amazon. Toothpaste, super glue, antiseptic ointment for cuts &amp; scrapes, hand cream, hair conditioner...all have their own little Squeezit in my home now.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as described. Nothing fancy</li>
            <li> I wish this tube squeezer worked as well as the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews here say it does but for me it was pretty much a failure. I finally managed to get it to fit over the end of the ointment tube I wanted to use it on (lots of jamming&amp; wiggling it into the small slot until it kinda fit in) but it really doesn;t fit well &amp; it doesn;t roll up to get everything out of the tube. I have to kind of twist &amp; push it against the tube to get it to work.Certainly does not slide up the tube in any efficient manner. It did not fit any better on the toothpaste tube I tried -- so really............does not work for me at all. At least they (set of 2) didn;t cost very much --</li>
            <li> I find it a bit award to work with, not having strength in my hands.  I use it for toothpaste tubes but also for the 4 oz Liquitex acrylic paint tubes.  One of these tubes is clear and I see just how well this product works. 1/4th of an inch on either side some paint does not get squeezed though the center is a tight squeeze.  I&#x27;m going to try the crank(key) kind next.   Inexpensive little gadget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these for years and prefer them greatly to the &amp;#34;roll-up&amp;#34; kind.  I just got two more tonight at my Von&#x27;s store - red &amp; orange - for only $3.  For those 1-star folks who have trouble with these, you MUST first squeeze at least 1.5&amp;#34; of the product up the tube to have room to apply the squeezer ... i.e., the bottom 1.5&amp;#34; of the tube must be FLAT.  Then you must slide &amp; WIGGLE the tube onto the squeezer from the BACK side of the squeezer (if you can read &amp;#34;Made in Israel,&amp;#34; you&#x27;re doing it right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those without the strength or on a tight budget,  just use a scissors to cut off the flat part of the tube, leaving about .5&amp;#34;, then fold it double and put in 3 evenly-spaced staples.  This is especially useful for those unfortunates living with &amp;#34;violent tube manglers&amp;#34; who refuse to use the sliders even when installed FOR  them.  I know you&#x27;re out there ... just do it for your own sanity.</li>
            <li> I have another kind of tube squeezer that I much prefer.  It&#x27;s hard to get the tube into the slot to use the device and feels like very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t that easy to come by at my usual drug store. I&#x27;m very happy to have toothpaste completely used up. It fits my larger sized tubes.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these maybe a month ago and one broke within a week and the other broke yesterday. I never dropped them or treated them poorly so I guess they just broke under the stress of squeezing the tube. I realize they were very cheap but it still seems like they should be able to handle the kind of stress they were designed for. These are probably not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Great little tube squeezer!</li>
            <li> Easy and simple to use, helps get every little bit of toothpaste or lotion out of the tube.  Fun colors.</li>
            <li> Great idea and work great!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on the tube.  Keeps the tubs neat while extracting nearly all of the toothpaste.  Not quite so effective on the stiffer plastic tubes as it is on more flexible tubes; but still worth the effort.</li>
            <li> These really work great for the toothpaste tubes or any tube for that matter. I liked the colors that matched our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  Simple, effective design.  No more rolling the toothpaste rube in hopes of getting that \\&quot;last little bit\\&quot; out... with this gadget I get quite a bit more than the \\&quot;last little bit\\&quot;... though, I suppose, there is now a new definition of the \\&quot;last little bit\\&quot;, but it is so much less than what it was  before I started using the Squeezit Tube Squeezer... I am well pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design, with the large portion on one side which one may use as a lever when dispensing toothpaste... or other pastes and pastelike substances contained within tubes of the appropriate size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two-pack came with one green and one red squeezer.  I chose to use the green one, as I am not a harlot.  I shall keep the red one in reserve, in the event I ever start using a cinnamon toothpaste or find a second tube-contained product for my personal grooming needs.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot better than the rolling kind.  Sometimes the best design is the simplest one.</li>
            <li> Squeezit Tube Squeezer was just what I was looking for.  Very simple, no moving parts.  Gets the last of bit of product from any tube. Tooth paste, skin ointment...you name it.  If it&#x27;s in a tube, you&#x27;ll be happy with it!</li>
            <li> Now my G/F doesn&#x27;t yell at me for screaming the toothpaste from the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at squeezing tubes. It works a lot better than trying to roll the tube up as you use it.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid the tooth paste tubes were made of some light metal, possibly tin and you could roll it forward till you got all the paste out.  The switch to plastic or vinyl for the tube will not stay rolled up.  Put this on the tube and you don&#x27;t have to roll it. Great Idea.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;middle squeezin&amp;#34; and trying to get the last out.  Less waste and less fustration.... There is always at least one in the family that cannot quit get the concept of push the toothpaste from the bottom...... This fixes the problem!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how the squeezer itself works - nice and tight on the tube, but easy to insert. The &#x27;handle&#x27;/&#x27;hanger&#x27; takes up a LOT of room on the shelf though, which is frustrating when one has many tubes to squeeze.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to get some tubes in it but nothing a pliers will not fix. You cannot make a good tight fitting product accommodate all sizes unless it has moving parts. For me this thing works great. I use it on Aqua Fresh, Colgate, and another brand. I love it, rather we love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and remain pleased with its ability to eliminate toothpaste waste by allowing you to squeeze as you go. This style is so simple compared to others that have moving parts that are more susceptible to breakage. I have also used it for chalking squeeze tubes with success.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I have to use an Rx cream that comes in a very stiff plastic tube that defies squeezing or rolling and wastes an unconscionable amount of the stuff in the tube. With arthritis in my hands, I have trouble with the squeezing part - so I figured these things would help. Wrong. I don&#x27;t even have the strength to get the darn thing ON the tube, much less to move it up the tube - had to get my husband to help. What good is an assistive device that requires assistance in use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again? Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> These make the toothpaste tube much more socially acceptable, and get every bit of toothpaste out of it, so there is no waste.  Most people who see mine want to know where I got them!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap enough and works. I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
            <li> Received as stated by supplier. Put the squeezers to work immediately. The unit keeps the toothpaste at the end of the tube near the opening. Makes for applying toothpaste to brush a lot easier than without it. Money was well spent to make things easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Hello, So the other day I went to Walmart and purchased the squeeze it. I tried it on the brand new toothpaste I purchased ,and  I was highly disappointed to say the least!  I first tried to use it I read the directions and wouldn&#x27;t slide through and I tried pulling the end of it a little harder and it ripped the tooth paste and put a hole in the brand new toothpaste I just purchased. All in all it was a total waste of money because I not only wasted money on the product I also ruined a new bottle of toothpaste.  Do yourself a favor and save your money do not purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Love these! so useful for so little money!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hopefully, this will help my 9 year old to stop wasting 30% of the tube.</li>
