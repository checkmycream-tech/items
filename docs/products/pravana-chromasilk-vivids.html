    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>As always it works best on pre lightened hair.</li>
            <li>Very bright and beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color!</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>they both are amazing!</li>
            <li>and it smells awesome :)</li>
            <li>great color looks great and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I thought</li>
            <li>and this time it did turn out bright</li>
            <li>It also smells good.  </li>
            <li>My husband dyes my hair at home, and this stuff is as good as any salon job I&#x27;ve ever had done.</li>
            <li>Turned out great :)</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this 4.5 stars because I love this line of color!</li>
            <li>Also this color is amazing and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Awesome fast shipping by seller.</li>
            <li>It did refresh my burgundy lowlights in an interesting way- kind of a darker magenta by about a shade.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I came across Pravana Vivids in magenta and the reviews seemed great, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love pravana colors.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I still recommend this, the color is so amazing and beautiful and it really pairs well with the orange for a fun two-tone effect.</li>
            <li>Color is vibrant and bright.</li>
            <li>but it was easily wash off with just soap and water.</li>
            <li>Amazing color, lasts longer than other brands, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I have dark blond hair that is highlighted and the color shows up nice and bright when freshly done (but I leave it on a lot longer than the box says, about 40 minutes to an hour)</li>
            <li>Loved the color was exactly as shown but as with many pinks and reds it fades if not properly cared for.</li>
            <li>Such a shame, because they were good quality colors before they messed with &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Color is vibrant and lovely.</li>
            <li>Washes out relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>This dye stains very well and doesnt fade easily at all.</li>
            <li>Pravana is the most vivid hair color I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I got more of a pink tint on my roots, although much of my ends, which were a shade lighter, had some pretty bright color on them.</li>
            <li>This stuff just rinsed right off as if it hadn&#x27;t just been soaking in for all that time.</li>
            <li>This color is vibrant but does fade out in about 7-8 weeks as I expected for any bright color product.</li>
            <li>Quality product with quality results, WHEN YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST.</li>
            <li>Great color, last a long time</li>
            <li>Sellers shipped fast!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was done at a salon.</li>
            <li>The color did bleed some during the first two washes.</li>
            <li>It was darker than the pink I usually liked although the swatch looked identical to my hair at the time I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Nice vivid pink color but a pain to clean</li>
            <li>This may cost a bit more than other hair dyes but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought magenta for dark brown hair, not expect it to be magenta by the way, and it turn out really nice.</li>
            <li>This Pink is super super super vibrant.</li>
            <li>I order this online now and do my own processing due to the high costs of the salon.</li>
            <li>It was bright, but then began to dull as I dyed it over and over again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any real staining with the Magenta.</li>
            <li>It looks almost like a fire red with a bit of a light purple sheen.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t bleed so much.</li>
            <li>dunno, it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me.</li>
            <li>After my favorite hot pink hair dye disappeared from the market for a while, I started shopping around for a new brand.</li>
            <li>Pravana (not pravava, as the title says) recently changed all their formulas so the hues are washing out super fast.</li>
            <li>you will need to lift your hair before trying to apply color for vibrant results.</li>
            <li>I do wish it would last a tad bit longer, but pinks/reds wash out quickly.</li>
            <li>I had read that it can be highly staining on your skin</li>
            <li>This color is fun in theory, but doesn&#x27;t really stay long.</li>
            <li>but it even came right off the tiny parts of my scalp that it touched.</li>
            <li>so maybe it will be better on yours, but if I go back to pink, I&#x27;ll stick with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me there are FINALLY bottles of Special Effects Atomic Pink surfacing back on the market.</li>
            <li>but it just fades so quickly, to a baby pink.</li>
            <li>Deep bright vibrant pink in conparison to Pravanas actual &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;, which is a creamy softer pink.</li>
            <li>Wild Orchid is deeper, brighter and last much longer.</li>
            <li>My stylist now has to use the wild orchid, which immediately fades to magenta.</li>
            <li>2 boxes were the magenta color pictured and the 3rd was labeled magenta but was a much much darker shade.</li>
            <li>The color was exactly what I wanted and lasted quite a while on the hair that&#x27;s bleached (only parts of mine were from highlights and such).</li>
            <li>This hair color works very well and stays in for a long time.  </li>
            <li>it claims to be &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; yet it barely lasted a week in my hair when it was done by a professional</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally blonde, so I don&#x27;t normally bleach before I dye.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it was an old box, but it was much darker and my hair turned out much darker.</li>
            <li>I knew before I started that I would likely not get vivid color on my 7BG hair, but I gave it a shot anyway just to see the results.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I received the dye, opened it and discovered that it was a particularly heinous shade of Pepto Bismol pink.</li>
            <li>I tried it out anyway, going as far to leave it in for twice as long as recommended, and it did NOTHING to my hair.</li>
            <li>but it washes out pretty heavily after about a week</li>
            <li>I usually use Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink to revamp my pink hair, and by this</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the color is not long lasting on me.</li>

            <li> My only issue is that the color is not long lasting on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a big down side to it is I noticed that I would sweat pink for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> so the only thing about the pink is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the orange, but maybe thats because I haven&#x27;t been using the pink as long and therefore don&#x27;t have as much saturation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last quiet as long as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Semi permanent pigments will ALWAYS fade and a sulfate free shampoo will slow down this process.</li>
            <li> The tube was old or damaged the dye was weird looking and washed out quickly</li>
            <li> The magenta does not last very long at all, it was almost gone before the week was over.</li>
            <li> I previously have bought the Pravana Vivids Chromasilk colors in Wild Orchid and Violet Gem-</li>
            <li> I had not colored my hair for two years and my hair was partially bleached prior to applying color.</li>
            <li> Even though this pink is a lighter color, it hasnt faded one bit.</li>
            <li> The magenta begins to fade to a lighter pink, then to the color of my lightened ends.</li>
            <li> I wash every other day using sulfate free hair shampoo/conditioner in cold water.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other products that I&#x27;ve used I didn&#x27;t have this issue with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dye did not come off on my pillow case like some other one does.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and when it was time to rinse off I was shocked at how light the colour turned out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has black hair, I bleached it and used this dye</li>
            <li> if you make a mess.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t cheap, either.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of the constant touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I also got hair dye all over my hand for a few minutes</li>
            <li> One week with my hair :/</li>
            <li> I usually use Pravana Vivids Orange</li>
            <li> I left this dye on my hair for 30 minutes and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> If you have thick medium length or longer hair, don&#x27;t buy this.  </li>
            <li> The dye is thick and doesn&#x27;t drip all over the place.</li>
            <li> I mean I did it for seven months.</li>
            <li> The lesson: lift to at least a 9!</li>
            <li> It looked like a bad tube of acrylic paint.</li>
            <li> Did I get a bad batch or something?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not quite disappointed with this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice vivid pink color but a pain to clean if you make a mess.</li>
            <li> I previously have bought the Pravana Vivids Chromasilk colors in Wild Orchid and Violet Gem- they both are amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to see how the Magenta looks!</li>
            <li> This dye stains very well and doesnt fade easily at all. Even though this pink is a lighter color, it hasnt faded one bit.</li>
            <li> Deep bright vibrant pink in conparison to Pravanas actual &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;, which is a creamy softer pink. I MIX this with Pravana Orange to achieve a peach tone. As always it works best on pre lightened hair. Semi permanent pigments will ALWAYS fade and a sulfate free shampoo will slow down this process. I haven&#x27;t had any real staining with the Magenta. Quality product with quality results, WHEN YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST.</li>
            <li> Color is vibrant and lovely. However depending on your hair my not last. One week with my hair :/</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! Washes out relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this! The color was exactly what I wanted and lasted quite a while on the hair that&#x27;s bleached (only parts of mine were from highlights and such). Looking forward to trying it again now that all of my hair has been bleached.</li>
            <li> If you have thick medium length or longer hair, don&#x27;t buy this.  I got the magenta and the consistency was like water.  I covered maybe 1/3 of my head with a tube. Also it smells like mens aftershave...&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The tube was old or damaged the dye was weird looking and washed out quickly</li>
            <li> I got it on time. And i lovee the color. I havent tried it out yet but i cant wait</li>
            <li> My daughter has black hair, I bleached it and used this dye but it only lasted  3 weeks. I saw no different from this and the store bought dye</li>
            <li> This hair color works very well and stays in for a long time.  It also smells good.  This may cost a bit more than other hair dyes but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband dyes my hair at home, and this stuff is as good as any salon job I&#x27;ve ever had done. We can keep my hair dyed for literally a year using this stuff for the price of ONE salon trip.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great color, last a long time and it smells awesome :) Definitely buying again when I need touched up.</li>
            <li> This Pink is super super super vibrant. It looks almost like a fire red with a bit of a light purple sheen.</li>
            <li> I bought magenta for dark brown hair, not expect it to be magenta by the way, and it turn out really nice. The packaging says put in for 20minutes but I did it for over an hour. It&#x27;s been a week and I think it&#x27;s kinda fading, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy dye from this company again</li>
            <li> After my favorite hot pink hair dye disappeared from the market for a while, I started shopping around for a new brand. I was using Manic Panic for a while but it washes out pretty heavily after about a week and I was tired of the constant touch-ups. After doing some research, I came across Pravana Vivids in magenta and the reviews seemed great, exactly what I was looking for. Imagine my surprise when I received the dye, opened it and discovered that it was a particularly heinous shade of Pepto Bismol pink. It looked like a bad tube of acrylic paint. I tried it out anyway, going as far to leave it in for twice as long as recommended, and it did NOTHING to my hair. I had read that it can be highly staining on your skin but it even came right off the tiny parts of my scalp that it touched. What gives? Did I get a bad batch or something? I was highly disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t cheap, either. Lucky for me there are FINALLY bottles of Special Effects Atomic Pink surfacing back on the market. That stuff stays for days and I generally only touch it up once a month. So, yeah, boo to you Pravana.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I thought</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. it claims to be &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; yet it barely lasted a week in my hair when it was done by a professional</li>
            <li> great color looks great and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Awesome fast shipping by seller. Also this color is amazing and didn&#x27;t damage my hair at all. Color is vibrant and bright.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stick to my hair. My hair is naturally blonde, so I don&#x27;t normally bleach before I dye. This stuff just rinsed right off as if it hadn&#x27;t just been soaking in for all that time.</li>
            <li> I love pravana colors. They&#x27;re the only brand of hair dye I use. Sellers shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Amazing color, lasts longer than other brands, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The magenta does not last very long at all, it was almost gone before the week was over. I bleached, washed with non sulfate shampoo and, colored just as directed and it did not take well on my hair. Wild Orchid is deeper, brighter and last much longer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last quiet as long as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Pravana is the most vivid hair color I have ever used. I just wish it didn&#x27;t bleed so much.</li>
            <li> Pravana (not pravava, as the title says) recently changed all their formulas so the hues are washing out super fast. My stylist now has to use the wild orchid, which immediately fades to magenta. Magenta goes a brassy pastel. Such a shame, because they were good quality colors before they messed with &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 4.5 stars because I love this line of color! I usually use Pravana Vivids Orange so the only thing about the pink is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the orange, but maybe thats because I haven&#x27;t been using the pink as long and therefore don&#x27;t have as much saturation. I still recommend this, the color is so amazing and beautiful and it really pairs well with the orange for a fun two-tone effect.</li>
            <li> I love this color. The first time I used it, it was done at a salon. I had not colored my hair for two years and my hair was partially bleached prior to applying color. I wash every other day using sulfate free hair shampoo/conditioner in cold water. The color did bleed some during the first two washes. This color is vibrant but does fade out in about 7-8 weeks as I expected for any bright color product. I order this online now and do my own processing due to the high costs of the salon. If you have darker hair(other than blonde) you will need to lift your hair before trying to apply color for vibrant results. I do wish it would last a tad bit longer, but pinks/reds wash out quickly. The magenta begins to fade to a lighter pink, then to the color of my lightened ends.</li>
            <li> I usually use Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink to revamp my pink hair, and by this I mean I did it for seven months. It was bright, but then began to dull as I dyed it over and over again. So, before I bleached my hair, I decided to try this brand. I dunno, it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me. It was darker than the pink I usually liked although the swatch looked identical to my hair at the time I purchased it. It faded out in a couple of weeks, whereas Manic Panic lasted for almost a month. IN MY EXPERIENCE, AND ON MY HAIR. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so maybe it will be better on yours, but if I go back to pink, I&#x27;ll stick with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> This color is fun in theory, but doesn&#x27;t really stay long. I has gone away after two washes.</li>
            <li> 2 boxes were the magenta color pictured and the 3rd was labeled magenta but was a much much darker shade. I am not sure if it was an old box, but it was much darker and my hair turned out much darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now and I do like it. My only issue is that the color is not long lasting on me. It fades after about a week, and that is with my only washing my hair every 3rd day. I have dark blond hair that is highlighted and the color shows up nice and bright when freshly done (but I leave it on a lot longer than the box says, about 40 minutes to an hour) but it just fades so quickly, to a baby pink. I still will use it, I only just wish the color would stay longer.</li>
            <li> I knew before I started that I would likely not get vivid color on my 7BG hair, but I gave it a shot anyway just to see the results. I got more of a pink tint on my roots, although much of my ends, which were a shade lighter, had some pretty bright color on them. It did refresh my burgundy lowlights in an interesting way- kind of a darker magenta by about a shade. The lesson: lift to at least a 9!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Turned out great :)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I followed the directions and when it was time to rinse off I was shocked at how light the colour turned out. So, I bought another tube and decided to try it again, left it on longer (about 1hr) and this time it did turn out bright magenta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a big down side to it is I noticed that I would sweat pink for the first couple of weeks. Other products that I&#x27;ve used I didn&#x27;t have this issue with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not quite disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The Magenta turn my dyed brown hair into plum color and med blonde into MAGENTA! Very bright and beautiful color! The dye is thick and doesn&#x27;t drip all over the place. I also got hair dye all over my hand for a few minutes but it was easily wash off with just soap and water. I left this dye on my hair for 30 minutes and rinse with cold water. Dye did not come off on my pillow case like some other one does. Here is the before and after picture:</li>
            <li> Loved the color was exactly as shown but as with many pinks and reds it fades if not properly cared for.</li>
