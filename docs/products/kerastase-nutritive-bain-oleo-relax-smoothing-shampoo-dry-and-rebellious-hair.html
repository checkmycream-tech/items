            <li>b/c I heard it was amazing</li>
            <li>Genuine Kerastase product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but instead I have to buy it from Amazon for my own damn self.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice anything spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product highly recommend the brand and its products</li>
            <li>Prices in salons are too high, best to buy on Amazon or eBay.</li>
            <li>It calms the hair, making it very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me especially on high humidity days when the curls tend to get tighter.</li>
            <li>I do NOT get tangles easily!</li>
            <li>After I used the shampoo it felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love this product but can&#x27;t find it anywhere except amazon.</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase.</li>
            <li>I had tried the oleo-relax serum with ok results, so I thought if I got the shampoo I may have better results.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it a three because I would like for it to have offered my hair better control, and more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Here are the cut-and-dry details: It smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase products and have been using them for 20 years.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>You are better off with Organix products..</li>
            <li>and you can find it at any grocery store &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>, it relax my course hair and love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>She complains more about frizzy hair than I do.  </li>
            <li>Mostly because I put my hair up every day in a clip and don&#x27;t bother with my hair for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>It is okay....</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo to-date.</li>
            <li>I use it with the matching conditioner, but I think it&#x27;s more the conditioner that is doing something.</li>
            <li>Keeps the frizz under better control.  </li>
            <li>Love this line of hair products....</li>
            <li>Considering what I paid for it, I was expecting so much more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and works way better on my hair.</li>
            <li>Shop around for something better is my advice.</li>
            <li>They also smell lovely.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo but the one with the gold top</li>
            <li>is better for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>i bought all three parts of the set to make sure it&#x27;d work as advertised and the results were comparable to herbal essence.</li>
            <li>This is the best products I have found for my dry, colored, rebellious hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, I wish more stores carried it on the shelf.</li>
            <li>not exactly the greatest attribute.  </li>
            <li>There are many smoothing products on the market and this one is far from good.</li>
            <li>If Oleo-Relax doesn&#x27;t work up a nice lather the first time you use it, here&#x27;s one case where you have to rinse then repeat.</li>
            <li>It detangles my super curly hair and eliminates frizz!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;A lot smoother, easier to brush and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo to help me straighten and smooth my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It was like I washing my hair with cheap drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really smooth hair</li>
            <li>Right away my hair felt smoother and more cooperative.  </li>
            <li>So now, I&#x27;ll be buying this product instead of the gold oil cleansing shampoo, that I did love and the scent was beautiful, but this shampoo did keep the humidity under control and my hair wasn&#x27;t a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>Easy to rince out with cool water.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference!!!</li>
            <li>It is worth a try!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I ever used for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li>Regret significantly.</li>
            <li>Apparently the price is too good to be true, and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>Works great for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>but Keratase is by far my top favorite.</li>
            <li>My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have tried other top brand (cheaper option) which are also good</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and flat!  </li>
            <li>super cheap, work VERY well</li>
            <li>This shampoo (in combination with Kerastase Masquintense) has had a unique positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was smooth, shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to anything you can get from Target for a far better price.</li>
            <li>But hey, I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been so worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It worth the money.</li>
            <li>I want to see if it&#x27;s worth the inversion.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes my daily hair routine very easy.</li>
            <li>always leave my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>At first, I bought this for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has more than 6 different types of sulfates and that causes my hair to get brittle.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a different fragrance and a lower price, but otherwise love it</li>
            <li>I think the positive reviews on this product may have been planted.</li>
            <li>I tried Kerastase shampoo based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo sounded great in the description but like most other products I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real Keratase.</li>
            <li>I have chemically relaxed hair so I am always looking for the next new product to better strengthen or moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>I only advise to use as a treatment, use every other week while using a regular product for daily shampooing, this is a great product to boost your hair to a healthy look, I have noticed that my hair grows faster, i only need to blow dry and it stays very nice even on humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li>Its a challenge to get it straight and keep it straight.  </li>
            <li>some days it&#x27;s like I used some cheap regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my hair is so straight after blow drying that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much of a difference to my hair; I used the kerastase conditioner both.</li>
            <li>The shipper needs to wrap the product more carefully.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>I expected more of this brand</li>
            <li>The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This is just okay in my opinion and def not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I was even able to attend a brunch down at the beach and my hair did not end up a frizz ball.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays smooth whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li>Great for taming thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I was using Aveda for a long time, then tried a few other brands, but this is the best for my hair (medium length, damaged by color).</li>
            <li>Great brand, but expensive.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>my hair as I would normally.</li>
            <li>my hair is full and managable now and plan to grow it long again.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my mother, who has very dry, brittle, 35 years of dyeing, hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product and very hard to find in the Middle East</li>
            <li>My hair is a little bit curly and this product make it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>When I was washing my hair it felt very soft</li>
            <li>Combined with the hair mask just makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I found it to over-strip hair of oils leaving hair with excessive static electricity:  </li>
            <li>Use in conjunction with the deep conditioner and my hair styled like it is suppose to for the first time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain, but I don&#x27;t think that this is the same as the Kerastase shampoo that I bought at my salon.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and this shampoo works well with my hair type, keeps them soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised about the way it worked with my texture of hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on something closely resembling the result from a cheap clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s suppose to do the absolute opposite.</li>
            <li>Not a fan in which I was surprised</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and the look of my hair has changed.</li>
            <li>I would much rather go back to using the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I straighten at every wash.  </li>
            <li>and/ or those with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Different conditioners and leave-in products didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li>I do not love strong perfume</li>
            <li>made my hair not smoth at all.. when I washed it out, my hair was very tangled.. which is STRANGE for my hair..</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, and I prefer to wear it straight, but when I dry it I get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, thick, wavy hair that I like to wear straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, the combo does leave my hair much silkier than other shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of professional products)</li>
            <li>It left my hair so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has gone from being silky straight to coarse, wavy and completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>Also give Matrix Sleek and Smooth a try, for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>Have used other Kerastase products, and wish they were less expensive, but they ARE good!</li>
            <li>I have always been skeptical about whether higher end hair products are worth the money, but this shampoo made me a believer.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s just a temporary quick fix.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth the high price.</li>

            <li> This is the best products I have found for my dry, colored, rebellious hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I wish more stores carried it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> not exactly the greatest attribute.  </li>
            <li> There are many smoothing products on the market and this one is far from good.</li>
            <li> If Oleo-Relax doesn&#x27;t work up a nice lather the first time you use it, here&#x27;s one case where you have to rinse then repeat.</li>
            <li> It detangles my super curly hair and eliminates frizz!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;A lot smoother, easier to brush and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo to help me straighten and smooth my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It was like I washing my hair with cheap drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really smooth hair</li>
            <li> Right away my hair felt smoother and more cooperative.  </li>
            <li> So now, I&#x27;ll be buying this product instead of the gold oil cleansing shampoo, that I did love and the scent was beautiful, but this shampoo did keep the humidity under control and my hair wasn&#x27;t a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Easy to rince out with cool water.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference!!!</li>
            <li> It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> Regret significantly.</li>
            <li> Apparently the price is too good to be true, and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> but Keratase is by far my top favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have tried other top brand (cheaper option) which are also good</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth and flat!  </li>
            <li> super cheap, work VERY well</li>
            <li> This shampoo (in combination with Kerastase Masquintense) has had a unique positive effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was smooth, shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to anything you can get from Target for a far better price.</li>
            <li> But hey, I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been so worth it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It worth the money.</li>
            <li> I want to see if it&#x27;s worth the inversion.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It makes my daily hair routine very easy.</li>
            <li> always leave my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> At first, I bought this for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has more than 6 different types of sulfates and that causes my hair to get brittle.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a different fragrance and a lower price, but otherwise love it</li>
            <li> I think the positive reviews on this product may have been planted.</li>
            <li> I tried Kerastase shampoo based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo sounded great in the description but like most other products I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real Keratase.</li>
            <li> I have chemically relaxed hair so I am always looking for the next new product to better strengthen or moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> I only advise to use as a treatment, use every other week while using a regular product for daily shampooing, this is a great product to boost your hair to a healthy look, I have noticed that my hair grows faster, i only need to blow dry and it stays very nice even on humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li> Its a challenge to get it straight and keep it straight.  </li>
            <li> some days it&#x27;s like I used some cheap regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my hair is so straight after blow drying that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of a difference to my hair; I used the kerastase conditioner both.</li>
            <li> The shipper needs to wrap the product more carefully.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> I expected more of this brand</li>
            <li> The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works.</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This is just okay in my opinion and def not worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I was even able to attend a brunch down at the beach and my hair did not end up a frizz ball.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays smooth whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li> Great for taming thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I was using Aveda for a long time, then tried a few other brands, but this is the best for my hair (medium length, damaged by color).</li>
            <li> Great brand, but expensive.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> my hair as I would normally.</li>
            <li> my hair is full and managable now and plan to grow it long again.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my mother, who has very dry, brittle, 35 years of dyeing, hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product and very hard to find in the Middle East</li>
            <li> My hair is a little bit curly and this product make it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> When I was washing my hair it felt very soft</li>
            <li> Combined with the hair mask just makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I found it to over-strip hair of oils leaving hair with excessive static electricity:  </li>
            <li> Use in conjunction with the deep conditioner and my hair styled like it is suppose to for the first time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain, but I don&#x27;t think that this is the same as the Kerastase shampoo that I bought at my salon.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this shampoo works well with my hair type, keeps them soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised about the way it worked with my texture of hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something closely resembling the result from a cheap clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s suppose to do the absolute opposite.</li>
            <li> Not a fan in which I was surprised</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and the look of my hair has changed.</li>
            <li> I would much rather go back to using the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten at every wash.  </li>
            <li> and/ or those with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Different conditioners and leave-in products didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li> I do not love strong perfume</li>
            <li> made my hair not smoth at all.. when I washed it out, my hair was very tangled.. which is STRANGE for my hair..</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, and I prefer to wear it straight, but when I dry it I get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy hair that I like to wear straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, the combo does leave my hair much silkier than other shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of professional products)</li>
            <li> It left my hair so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has gone from being silky straight to coarse, wavy and completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> Also give Matrix Sleek and Smooth a try, for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> Have used other Kerastase products, and wish they were less expensive, but they ARE good!</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about whether higher end hair products are worth the money, but this shampoo made me a believer.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s just a temporary quick fix.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the high price.</li>
            <li> It has softened my hair and makes it lie flat, not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have used before, and this product left my hair dry and fryed.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally frizzy with tight curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently shampooing with a lesser expensive brand and adding almond oil on the ends of my hair overnight to condition and it has given me much smoother and sleeker results; my natural curls are as bouncy as ever.</li>
            <li> I have thick, high lighted hair that as I get older it gets a little frizzier.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is exactly the same, but it does not seem to be as thick as the shampoo that I had previously, so it is possibly watered down.</li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> If anything, it made it really frizzy and hard to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo for a long time</li>
            <li> I have long hair and prefer to keep it off my neck.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair and using a flat iron, my hair becomes very dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still more difficult to style than it used to be, but i&#x27;m no longer a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps tame the frizz and keep the hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> But even without other people complimenting me, I can feel that my hair isn&#x27;t as coarse as it used to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy, dry, and has split ends...</li>
            <li> but when I dry it if felt crispy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well with the taming hair mask for dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair dry, and have not noticed any &amp;#34;curl or wave relaxing&amp;#34; capabilities of this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which of the three products makes my hair so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> It has tame it as no other products I have tried (uncountable!).</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this Shampoo and must admit that it is an average Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Overall, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Using some of the other products, I noticed an immediate difference in my hair, and when I switch back to other types, I still do.  </li>
            <li> Not work the super expensive price...</li>
            <li> and you only need a little when using.</li>
            <li> My hair is much, much less frizzy even on rainy days and through workouts, and the volume has reduced without making my hair look flat.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to chemical use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is thick and very heavy and does not lather much, so I find myself using a lot, esp snce</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this shampoo given the other reviews and my experience with other Kerastase products.  </li>
            <li> Another advantage of these products is that they don&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (like John Frieda products) or greasy (like some other hair oils).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m using multiple keratin products so hard to say which had the biggest impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is average, and for the price, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> A British hairdresser prescribed L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s high-end product line for my thick, wavy, Indian hair.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair and these products</li>
            <li> I have long thick curley hair,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly flyaway hair, and this just makes it dull and requires a ton of spray to keep in half way under control.  </li>
            <li> It did not help with the freeze and it does not clean well...</li>
            <li> this is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey..</li>
            <li> so it certainly wasn&#x27;t disappointing.</li>
            <li> My texture is very thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It truly does tame frizzy/unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have slightly course, medium thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as limp and seems fuller!  </li>
            <li> It is a small container like shoe polish but not sure this site carries it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again, I may still keep looking.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair twice for a shiny look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better then $15 shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it would really liven my boring, somewhat frizzy Italian hair.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from the problem of having thick rebellious hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair and after blow drying it..</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair - hard to tame, frizzy, a lot of gray.  </li>
            <li> Very odd - is this a fake maybe?</li>
            <li> Another bad thing was that it took too long to arrived.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of expensive and non expensive shampoos and conditioners...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
            <li> I use this Conditioner, but was not impressed w/ the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so bad after a wash with this product.</li>
            <li> I also found the bottle very inconvenient in the shower as you have to screw it off and find some place for the cap while you pour the shampoo in to your hands and put it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, all my hair is gray, but colored, so the problem got worst until I found these products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this Shampoo and must admit that it is an average Shampoo. It&#x27;s comparable to anything you can get from Target for a far better price.</li>
            <li> Love. My hair is frizzy, dry, and has split ends...I just need to find a conditioner to work with this</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo!  Have used other Kerastase products, and wish they were less expensive, but they ARE good!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product even though it is pricy. I have wavy hair and this shampoo works well with my hair type, keeps them soft and manageable.  The delivery was very prompt.  I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> A British hairdresser prescribed L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s high-end product line for my thick, wavy, Indian hair. He also recommended the Kerastase masque treatment. Both are godsends to someone such as I who&#x27;d previously only ever selected haircare products from club card discounts on supermarket shelves &amp; would&#x27;ve balked at the idea of such an expense. If Oleo-Relax doesn&#x27;t work up a nice lather the first time you use it, here&#x27;s one case where you have to rinse then repeat. Total strangers ask me if they can feel my hair, and I get compliments all the time. But even without other people complimenting me, I can feel that my hair isn&#x27;t as coarse as it used to be. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the 2 years since I began shacking up with the hairdresser, but his salon doesn&#x27;t sell L&#x27;Oreal, which means that he can&#x27;t just steal me some from work but instead I have to buy it from Amazon for my own damn self. But hey, I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t find it anywhere except amazon. It smells like perfume for your hair and is like vitamins for your hair. It tames my curls.</li>
            <li> I had a Kerastase salon treatment a couple of months ago and found the shampoo and condition cheaper on amazon.com.  My hair is naturally frizzy with tight curls. Its a challenge to get it straight and keep it straight.  This shampoo was amazing.  My hair came out just like it did at the salon!  I love Kerastase.</li>
            <li> This is a great line of products, it&#x27;s just the price that kills me.  Also give Matrix Sleek and Smooth a try, for less than half the price.  I did notice a difference after using the Kerastase shampoo, it does work.</li>
            <li> I have chemically relaxed hair so I am always looking for the next new product to better strengthen or moisturize my hair. This product is supposed ot be smoothing but I didn&#x27;t notice anything spectacular about it. Not work the super expensive price...I have tried the L&#x27;Oreal no sulfate sleek shampoo and THAT does what it markets.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair - hard to tame, frizzy, a lot of gray.  This shampoo (in combination with Kerastase Masquintense) has had a unique positive effect on my hair. It&#x27;s softer, fuller and healthier.  I highly recommend giving it a try. It is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of expensive and non expensive shampoos and conditioners...this is not worth the money! It did not help with the freeze and it does not clean well...I am not even going to use the rest of the bottle!</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked as described. I was really surprised about the way it worked with my texture of hair.  My texture is very thick and coarse. After I used the shampoo it felt very smooth. Then I proceeded to blow dry and flat iron my hair as I would normally. Wow! The end result was like I just put a relaxer in my hair! It was smooth, shiny and very manageable. I loved it! This product did make a difference in my hair.  I will continue using Kerastase Nutritive Bain Oleo-Relax shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had tried the oleo-relax serum with ok results, so I thought if I got the shampoo I may have better results.  I have wavy hair, and I prefer to wear it straight, but when I dry it I get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;.  So I thought this would be a help.  My hair is fickle, some days this stuff works great, some days it&#x27;s like I used some cheap regular shampoo.  I am giving it a three because I would like for it to have offered my hair better control, and more moisture.  It is average, and for the price, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would really liven my boring, somewhat frizzy Italian hair. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences with this shampoo. Here are the cut-and-dry details: It smells lovely. The shampoo itself is thick and very heavy and does not lather much, so I find myself using a lot, esp snce I have long hair. Overall, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Every time I have extra money ( I am student), i bought this shampoo! it&#x27;s the best shampoo ever...no freeze, my hair is smooth!!   Really good, it woth, 100% recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best products I have found for my dry, colored, rebellious hair. It has tame it as no other products I have tried (uncountable!). I used to suffer from the problem of having thick rebellious hair. Now, all my hair is gray, but colored, so the problem got worst until I found these products. I&#x27;m using all the line. It&#x27;s quite expensive but it&#x27;s been so worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this Conditioner, but was not impressed w/ the shampoo. I Kiehl&#x27;s shampoo, it is cheaper and loads better!</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products and have been using them for 20 years. I have really long and thick hair and these products always leave my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo for a long time and I still love it. My hair is a little bit curly and this product make it smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and seems to complement the conditioner. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was using Aveda for a long time, then tried a few other brands, but this is the best for my hair (medium length, damaged by color). It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use between appointments. I loved the feel of my hair upon leaving the salon. When I used it at home, my hair was tangled and brittle. Additionally, my hair is so straight after blow drying that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my mother, who has very dry, brittle, 35 years of dyeing, hair.  It wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;strong\\&quot; enough for her.  I have 40ish hair with highlights, no gray, but coarse.  It has softened my hair and makes it lie flat, not frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product. My pocket book does not. I use it every other wash.</li>
            <li> didnt like this product. made my hair not smoth at all.. when I washed it out, my hair was very tangled.. which is STRANGE for my hair.. I do NOT get tangles easily! For the price &amp; the results, I wont buy again. You are better off with Organix products.. super cheap, work VERY well and you can find it at any grocery store &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it relax my course hair and love the smell as well. definitely recommend for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used. I have long thick curley hair,&lt;br /&gt;and this is the best shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has changed the way my hair looks and feels.  I have slightly course, medium thick hair.  I tried this shampoo to help me straighten and smooth my curly hair.  Right away my hair felt smoother and more cooperative.  Believe it or not,  it&#x27;s almost like it has thickened the strands.  My hair isn&#x27;t as limp and seems fuller!  It is worth the price.  You have to try it yourself to believe it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this product.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews said this shampoo is so good, doesn&#x27;t need conditioner after.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe it. I have dry, fine, frizzy hair. My hair has never felt so bad after a wash with this product. I use the Kerastase Elixir which is much better after a wash with a store bought shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It left my hair so soft and shinny. It worth the money. Of course you have to take vitamins and collagen to help from the inside.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain, but I don&#x27;t think that this is the same as the Kerastase shampoo that I bought at my salon. The bottle is exactly the same, but it does not seem to be as thick as the shampoo that I had previously, so it is possibly watered down. Apparently the price is too good to be true, and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps tame the frizz and keep the hair soft and manageable.  Great price and you only need a little when using.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this shampoo given the other reviews and my experience with other Kerastase products.  This is just okay in my opinion and def not worth the $$$. Using some of the other products, I noticed an immediate difference in my hair, and when I switch back to other types, I still do.  I have dry, curly flyaway hair, and this just makes it dull and requires a ton of spray to keep in half way under control.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> At first, I bought this for my daughter.  She complains more about frizzy hair than I do.  Mostly because I put my hair up every day in a clip and don&#x27;t bother with my hair for the rest of the day.  I have long hair and prefer to keep it off my neck.  When I ran out of my bottle of Keratase Gold, I tried this.  I found I liked this product better!  So now, I&#x27;ll be buying this product instead of the gold oil cleansing shampoo, that I did love and the scent was beautiful, but this shampoo did keep the humidity under control and my hair wasn&#x27;t a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. My hair is curly and I don&#x27;t think this shampoo is good for my type of hair. When I was washing my hair it felt very soft but when I dry it if felt crispy. This shampoo has more than 6 different types of sulfates and that causes my hair to get brittle. I did not like it at all. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for people with curly or treated hair. Another bad thing was that it took too long to arrived.</li>
            <li> It is okay....nothing special.</li>
            <li> I also found the bottle very inconvenient in the shower as you have to screw it off and find some place for the cap while you pour the shampoo in to your hands and put it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the straightening did actually work - but I&#x27;m using multiple keratin products so hard to say which had the biggest impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry hair. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well with the taming hair mask for dry frizzy hair.  It is a small container like shoe polish but not sure this site carries it.  I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> Great product and very hard to find in the Middle East</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of a difference to my hair; I used the kerastase conditioner both. If anything, it made it really frizzy and hard to manipulate. I&#x27;m currently shampooing with a lesser expensive brand and adding almond oil on the ends of my hair overnight to condition and it has given me much smoother and sleeker results; my natural curls are as bouncy as ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something closely resembling the result from a cheap clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out and it&#x27;s suppose to do the absolute opposite. Not a fan in which I was surprised b/c I heard it was amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not real Keratase. I have used before, and this product left my hair dry and fryed. It was like I washing my hair with cheap drugstore shampoo. I can&#x27;t use it. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo to-date. It detangles my super curly hair and eliminates frizz! It makes my daily hair routine very easy.</li>
            <li> The shipper needs to wrap the product more carefully. The cap was shattered. I cannot travel with this product because it will spill.</li>
            <li> This shampoo sounded great in the description but like most other products I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m seeing much of a difference. I use it with the matching conditioner, but I think it&#x27;s more the conditioner that is doing something. However, the combo does leave my hair much silkier than other shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of professional products) so it certainly wasn&#x27;t disappointing. Not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again, I may still keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to chemical use. Buy this product just out of curiosity and then I found great use. Leaves hair soft and the look of my hair has changed. I just hope to continue using it to see the extent to which transformed my hair. I&#x27;ve only used in 02 opportunities. I want to see if it&#x27;s worth the inversion.De it will be good buying</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I wish more stores carried it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. Combined with the hair mask just makes my hair very soft. Also smells very nice.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this to me 15 years ago. Since then, I have tried other top brand (cheaper option) which are also good but Keratase is by far my top favorite. It calms the hair, making it very easy to manage. I even use it after color treatment. I would recommend this to people with coarser and frizzy hair. The hair mask is great although a bit pricy. It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! Hair feels so good!</li>
            <li> Genuine Kerastase product for a great price.  Great for my curls and great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz under better control.  I would prefer a different fragrance and a lower price, but otherwise love it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair dry, and have not noticed any &amp;#34;curl or wave relaxing&amp;#34; capabilities of this product. Can with a back lable in CHINESE over another lable. Very odd - is this a fake maybe? I think the positive reviews on this product may have been planted.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair. This is the only shampoo that allows me to NOT use a conditioner. I wash and go. My hair stays smooth whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> Love this line of hair products.... Takes all the frizzies away and cleans well without stripping hair.Its expensive but worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the Kerastase conditioner and Kerastase Paris Resistance Ciment Thermique, not from Amazon, but from a high-end salon. Considering what I paid for it, I was expecting so much more. I have very long, thick, wavy hair that I like to wear straight and smooth. This product made my hair drier and frizzier than before I used it. I don&#x27;t know which of the three products makes my hair so dry and frizzy. I will have to try them individually to see if it&#x27;s just one or all of them. I would much rather go back to using the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and works way better on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I tried it at the salon and it worked really well. I am very happy I found it on the Web.  Will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this shampoo. Definitely not worth the high price. Shop around for something better is my advice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the oleo-relax shampoo, anti-frizz masque (basically conditioner), and serum. They work wonderfully together. My hair is much, much less frizzy even on rainy days and through workouts, and the volume has reduced without making my hair look flat. Another advantage of these products is that they don&#x27;t leave hair feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (like John Frieda products) or greasy (like some other hair oils). My hair just ends up looking smooth and natural and nice. The price is high, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable for how well this line of products works. One last note... I have used some shampoos/conditioners that seem to cause dandruff. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has had that product, if it&#x27;s caused my scalp irritation or what, but I have very sensitive skin, and these Kerastase products haven&#x27;t bothered my scalp or caused breakouts on my face. They also smell lovely. Not too flowery or fruity or anything.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair and after blow drying it.. it is simply beautiful&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey.. but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I expected more of this brand</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t really smooth hair and I found it to over-strip hair of oils leaving hair with excessive static electricity:  not exactly the greatest attribute.  There are many smoothing products on the market and this one is far from good.</li>
            <li> Great for taming thick, coarse hair.  Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
            <li> This product works great for me especially on high humidity days when the curls tend to get tighter. Kerastase Bain Oleo relax adds softness and length to my curls.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to &#x27;poo for keeping my hair in control and wavy but not giant and frizzy.  Kerastase rocks.</li>
            <li> I bought th product of Kerastase before as well. My hair feels good when I use them</li>
            <li> Use in conjunction with the deep conditioner and my hair styled like it is suppose to for the first time. I felt like after I finished that it actually looked like it does when I leave the salon. Nice and smooth and flat!  I have thick, high lighted hair that as I get older it gets a little frizzier.  I was even able to attend a brunch down at the beach and my hair did not end up a frizz ball.  Caution on the sent.  I do not love strong perfume smells so I only use this when I am going to go out.  I prefer a lighter sent for my day to day shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent product highly recommend the brand and its products</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo but the one with the gold top is better for my curly hair.  Great quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> Really good product. I have curly hair and it made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;A lot smoother, easier to brush and blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Bought on recommendation of stylist. Convinced me to stop using &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; stuff! It really does make a difference!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I straighten at every wash.  After blow drying my hair and using a flat iron, my hair becomes very dry.  I tried Kerastase shampoo based on the positive reviews.  I am here to reiterate those accolades.  This shampoo adds extra moisture in my hair which helps to promote it looking healthier.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo for anyone who feels they have extra dryness in their hair and/ or those with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great brand, but expensive. Easy to rince out with cool water. I usually wash my hair twice for a shiny look. Prices in salons are too high, best to buy on Amazon or eBay.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing everyone rave about Kerastase products.  Meh.  It&#x27;s no better then $15 shampoo.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> if you like to have beautiful sleek looking hair, this is the product to have. I only advise to use as a treatment, use every other week while using a regular product for daily shampooing, this is a great product to boost your hair to a healthy look, I have noticed that my hair grows faster, i only need to blow dry and it stays very nice even on humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I came across this product in Italy 3 year ago.</li>
            <li> my hair is full and managable now and plan to grow it long again. Before I cut it shorter because of its condition. No more.thanks</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about whether higher end hair products are worth the money, but this shampoo made me a believer.  As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has gone from being silky straight to coarse, wavy and completely unmanageable.  Different conditioners and leave-in products didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  But Oleo-Relax literally changed my life.  My hair is still more difficult to style than it used to be, but i&#x27;m no longer a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> It truly does tame frizzy/unruly hair. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s just a temporary quick fix. For the price, it would seem that the shampoo should permanently mend all existing split ends.</li>
            <li> Left my hair frizzier than ever. It&#x27;s like the moisture has been sucked out. i bought all three parts of the set to make sure it&#x27;d work as advertised and the results were comparable to herbal essence. Regret significantly.</li>
