            <li>I am very pleased with the Thymes Lotus Santal Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle there along with the soap which is equally as wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This cream smells amazing and comes on smooth not oily.  </li>
            <li>Well, since then, I have ordered four more.  </li>
            <li>and there are samples that smell interesting.  </li>
            <li>I typically love products put out by the thymes company.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, moisturizes well, and lasts for days!  </li>
            <li>I like more:</li>
            <li>One of my favorites, love the feel and smell.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments and am now buying as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves my skin hydrated and silky with an exotic, sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my wife for our honeymoon and love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and ever so lovely.  </li>
            <li>This body lotion smells exotic, putting it on after a bath made me feel like I was indulging in something special and luxurious.</li>
            <li>A friend told me how much she liked this product, however I did not.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all.</li>
            <li>So smooth on the skin, too.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion when it has been diluted with an unscented lotion by more than three-quarters, otherwise it&#x27;s way too intense.</li>
            <li>Lotus Dental or Naia (which smells clean, citusy, and marine).</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell and when applying it the lotion is nice and thick and covers very well.</li>
            <li>This so sweet smelling, it is overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased the whole product line and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The Lotus Santal Body Lotion is a great fragrance but unlike their other lotions it has color...like the label.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy, always a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of floral sweet perfumes, but this also isn&#x27;t musky in the way I think of an \\&quot;old-lady-musky-headache perfume\\&quot; either; like the kind that a woman wears with a ton of make-up and hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and keeps my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>They seem to have healing properties and are well absorbed.</li>
            <li>and I use this right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Also, I usually find that the quality of the actual location is excellent, really rich, but somehow with a light quality at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty funny, but untrue in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Washes out in hot water</li>
            <li>It complements more intense perfumes like Jimmy Choo than the light citrusy ones I usually wear for daytime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Thymes Eucalyptus, which I really like, and Azure.</li>
            <li>But this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product as it really moisturizes well and it does layer well under my perfume.  </li>
            <li>I cannot quite explain what it is about this lotion that I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>I have this entire product line, and the body lotion is by far my favorite formulation of this scent.  </li>
            <li>People are endlessly commenting that I always smell great (weird, but nice</li>
            <li>I found this product at the New York Botanical Gardens during the lotus exhibit.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is just a little off and is not good when worn, it has an old kind of cheap and sort of air freshener type of smell to it.  </li>
            <li>If you want to smell like Old Spice, just go to a drug store and buy some darn Old Spice.</li>
            <li>One reviewer noted that they thought that it smelled like Old Spice aka: old man.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s due to the shared use of sandalwood as the main fragrance note.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This cream smells amazing and comes on smooth not oily.  This is my second bottle. I would definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This so sweet smelling, it is overpowering.  I will not order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Thymes Eucalyptus, which I really like, and Azure.</li>
            <li> I found this product at the New York Botanical Gardens during the lotus exhibit.  I bought my first bottle there along with the soap which is equally as wonderful.  Well, since then, I have ordered four more.  This is not the only body lotion I use.  At times, I switch to Tresor which matches my perfume and will try others if traveling and there are samples that smell interesting.  But this is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product as it really moisturizes well and it does layer well under my perfume.  I find the texture and the aroma to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Thymes Lotus Santal Body Lotion.  It has a very pleasant smell and when applying it the lotion is nice and thick and covers very well.</li>
            <li> A friend told me how much she liked this product, however I did not. I don&#x27;t believe it was with the money.</li>
            <li> I had a sample from a hotel &amp; fell in love with the beautiful scent &amp; wonderful feel of this lotion. Will definitely try other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I cannot quite explain what it is about this lotion that I don&#x27;t really like.  I typically love products put out by the thymes company.  The fragrance is just a little off and is not good when worn, it has an old kind of cheap and sort of air freshener type of smell to it.  Also, I usually find that the quality of the actual location is excellent, really rich, but somehow with a light quality at the same time.  This lotion is not good in quality and does nothing for my skin.  Oh well.  I will probably put it in the break room at work,  and someone will probably like it.  This is the first thymes product I have not been crazy for.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever had. I get compliments wherever I go and it&#x27;s amazing. It might be the best scent ever created. I hope it&#x27;s around forever. That is all.</li>
            <li> I have this entire product line, and the body lotion is by far my favorite formulation of this scent.  It&#x27;s not too thick, nor is it runny.  It goes on smooth, moisturizes well, and lasts for days!  I shower every other day in winter and I use this right out of the shower.

            <li> This body lotion smells exotic, putting it on after a bath made me feel like I was indulging in something special and luxurious. It complements more intense perfumes like Jimmy Choo than the light citrusy ones I usually wear for daytime. It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy, always a plus. I can&#x27;t decide which Thymes lotion scent I like more: Lotus Dental or Naia (which smells clean, citusy, and marine).</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like Old Spice, just go to a drug store and buy some darn Old Spice. This was a waste of money and now I smell of old man. Blech.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion when it has been diluted with an unscented lotion by more than three-quarters, otherwise it&#x27;s way too intense. The lotion smells similar to Nag Champa incense, but softer...and, well, not too \\&quot;incensey\\&quot;. I guess that&#x27;s due to the shared use of sandalwood as the main fragrance note. It also has notes of cocoa orchid, plum wood, patchouli, clove, amber, and of course, sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bottle lasts for over a year when diluted and used daily after a shower. I couldn&#x27;t wear this lotion undiluted due to the intensity of the fragrance, but diluted, it&#x27;s divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One reviewer noted that they thought that it smelled like Old Spice aka: old man. Pretty funny, but untrue in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all. It does have a musky and woodsy scent, but it is quite feminine, excotic and sultry. People are endlessly commenting that I always smell great (weird, but nice I guess). It&#x27;s not something that you can smell when you walk into a place like some perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of floral sweet perfumes, but this also isn&#x27;t musky in the way I think of an \\&quot;old-lady-musky-headache perfume\\&quot; either; like the kind that a woman wears with a ton of make-up and hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found this lotion because I was given a sample at a luxury spa after a massage, and found that I kept smelling my arm all day (weird, I know) in search of the scent, so I knew I had to get some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It absorbs well and keeps my skin soft and smooth! In the winter, I like the way that it makes my sweaters smell when I take them off.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, love the feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I love the wonderful fragrance.  I have gotten so many compliments and am now buying as gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> Thymes body lotions are wonderful.  They seem to have healing properties and are well absorbed. The Lotus Santal Body Lotion is a great fragrance but unlike their other lotions it has color...like the label.  Why?  Don&#x27;t let it come in contact with clothes, towels or bedding as it will stain.  Washes out in hot water but I would prefer no color.</li>
            <li> The lotion leaves my skin hydrated and silky with an exotic, sexy fragrance.  I have received several compliments from people asking \\&quot;what is the wonderful fragrance I&#x27;m wearing?\\&quot;. I have purchased the whole product line and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my wife for our honeymoon and love it. It smells great and she has not stopped using it. It&#x27;s now her everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this lotion.  The scent is light and ever so lovely.  I use it almost every day, and definitely recommend giving it a try.  If you like the scent of lotus, you&#x27;ll like this.  So smooth on the skin, too.</li>
