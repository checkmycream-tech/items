            <li>Because I don&#x27;t, these tweezers have been awesome.</li>
            <li>but these are the BEST!!!!</li>
            <li>it works perfect and has not rusted yet.</li>
            <li>Also the best way to rid of a unibrow is by plucking it out.  </li>
            <li>Works beautifully and gets the job done</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>In fact, if somebody needed a gift, and I knew they used tweezers, if give them 2 of these because it&#x27;s just that great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great grip.</li>
            <li>the price is great for a brand</li>
            <li>It is a great tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Great price for the item.</li>
            <li>great for eyebrows, splinters and stuff...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also great for a splinter.  </li>
            <li>I guess you win some</li>
            <li>Good tweezers, but</li>
            <li>They are almost as good as the originals, hence the four star review.  </li>
            <li>With that being said it&#x27;s always good to have a pair of tweezers on hand.  </li>
            <li>What good are tweezers that can&#x27;t grab anything?  </li>
            <li>Good for anything from popping zits to plucking hairs or removing splinters.</li>
            <li>I had a nice set of tweezers and never could find them again until I saw this one</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!  </li>
            <li>Needing a good tweezer to remove splinters, I thought this would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>These are just ok but after using them fro a while they broke becuase they would not stay apat and had to pull them apart and metal fatigued and broke</li>
            <li>splinters you may want to get a  finer, more pointy tweezer.</li>
            <li>Love the tweezers i have always looked for a pointed pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>just love them</li>
            <li>I tried sissors but these tweezers work better.</li>
            <li>Well, they sure don&#x27;t make things the way they used to.</li>
            <li>I have brought this tweezer many times because I keep losing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had search so many stores looking for a pair like this</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not going to cut it for men and thus a flatter ended tweezer will work better.  </li>
            <li>so I could use them, but I wasn&#x27;t able to.  </li>
            <li>The ability to grip is lacking and would be better if the end had coarser grooves or crosshatch, since they just don&#x27;t grip that well.  </li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>That being said, I have used much better tweezers for the price.</li>
            <li>so I will hopefully find them on Amazon as I have ordered for years from Amazon and they have always been been more then helpful</li>
            <li>, They are Top Rate</li>
            <li>I would expect the tip to come together to be able to pluck an eyebrow</li>
            <li>But using these tweezers I&#x27;ve been able to EASILY pull them out.</li>
            <li>Good basic pair of tweezers for good price.</li>
            <li>These are great tweezers and, as far as I can tell, a discontinued item that you can&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>These are Revlon tweezers great for girls looking to grab a stray eyebrow or a crooked eyelash.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for eyebrows and small hairs.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>After getting these tweezers out of the packaging (I was so excited for them to arrive because I am an eyebrow-plucking fool)</li>
            <li>Good products, works very well on splinters and also makes tweezing my eyebrows much easier.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, just a good, low-priced pair of basic tweezers.</li>
            <li>, that way I can blindy grab at ear hairs and maybe get lucky and get the stubborn one I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>These join together very well and grab the splinter easily.</li>
            <li>Honestly, these are the only tweezers I&#x27;ll ever buy again, which is why I&#x27;m here on Amazon ordering it</li>
            <li>No complaints here and actually enjoy having a new version of tweezers in my collection.</li>
            <li>They grip hairs pretty well, but the tip is a bit wider than my old ones (also Revlon), so precision tweezing is not quite as easy.</li>
            <li>Enough said :)</li>
            <li>Although these tweezers work ok they are not at all the same as the picture.</li>
            <li>I catch the hairs on the first try&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It would be exactly what you would expect in a tweezer.</li>
            <li>One of the nicer pairs I&#x27;ve owned out of more than a dozen different tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li>Cheap tweezers, I have little kids, tweezers disappear and for the price, what more could you want?</li>
            <li>These tweezers are well-made and smooth (no sharp edges or burs).  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying the Revlon pointed tip tweezer and found the real ones I wanted.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>Not too much you can say about a tweezer except that they work.  </li>
            <li>very well aligned&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, very springy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to have something and the last thing you want to do</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very close to the ones I had.</li>
            <li>All the new designs have a long sharp grabbing end instead of coming to a point like these, which I greatly prefer.</li>
            <li>While these are not horrible, I would likely not purchase them again and would instead opt for tweezers with a wider, flatter point that would more readily grip small hairs, splinters, etc.</li>
            <li>Small tweezers, sharp strong point, good quality metal.  </li>
            <li>These do the job alright, and might be decent for removing splinters.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all your brow plucking</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, Revlon&#x27;s old style without the four diamonds embossed were better.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Revlon Splinter Tweezer years ago, but I foolishly used it for something it was not mean for and ended up disfiguring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are great for I.m sorry to say but nose hairs.</li>
            <li>, I can barely do my hair in the morning, but these tweezers work VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>They do not completely fit my needs but for the price they were worth getting unless you find better ones with a flat end for a cheaper or similar price.</li>
            <li>more worries of pinching myself and causing damage to the delicate skin around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>the tip is soft so it wont hurt</li>
            <li>They may have fixed the problem with the picture or inventory by now, I purchased them from Amazon in May 2013.</li>
            <li>I use them on my eyebrows because they get very bushy and long.</li>
            <li>Bought these as a replacement for the rounded point tip ones I love so much yet seem to be unable to find.  </li>
            <li>For women they generally have to worry about a straggler here or there.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised by the amount of grip you need to actually close these to where the tweezers grasp the splinter/hair.  </li>
            <li>Tweezers are ok, just a little small to grip.</li>

            <li> Tweezers are ok, just a little small to grip.</li>
            <li> The contact points are not precise, and due to this don&#x27;t grip small hairs as well, while the old version easily did.</li>
            <li> I like my tweezers to have a teeny tiny flat end</li>
            <li> because I did not see that these tweezers are pointed at the tip when i bought them, I perfer the ones that the tip is flat</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pair rounded point, but flat...</li>
            <li> This says it&#x27;s Revlon but is so cheaply made as to be laughable.</li>
            <li> Overall, product is as expected.  </li>
            <li> Warning: complete waste of a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> As per Product Details I thought I Was Getting Long Tweezers 5.6\\</li>
            <li> &quot; Long  </li>
            <li> I still need some long Tweezers</li>
            <li> I mean, its not like I am a weakling or anything, but these really take effort to close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to cvs and Walgreens and other pharmacies and tried different tweezers</li>
            <li> I would return these and ask for a refund or replacement, but it is too big of a hassle for a little pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> plain and simple tweezers</li>
            <li> I have a unibrow that I used to shave, plus my hair is thick, so it would come back in stubs that were noticeable even though they weren&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, 19 years old, and I&#x27;m not good at beauty things</li>
            <li> It was NOT as sharp as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Revlon tweezer for the past 15 years and was just looking for an extra one to have around.</li>
            <li> Ends are sufficiently pointed without being dangerously sharp.</li>
            <li> I would buy at least 2, so that when 1 goes dull, you have another one ready to take over in his place.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, contact points not as precise and grip pad isn&#x27;t as functional as the older version.</li>
            <li> They are also good with very thin hairs because sometimes I&#x27;ll have thin hairs that grow as well, and I&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s tooooo thin to tweez, but this tweezers is a life saver when it comes to that.</li>
            <li> For guys it&#x27;s all a numbers game, the battle against unwanted hair is to pluck multiple ones at a time.  </li>
            <li> If you are reading this review then you are as picky and meticulous about your purchases as I am, no matter how small.  </li>
            <li> why make them so hard to close?</li>
            <li> agree with another review that complained that the product received is not the one pictured.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I had a thick unibrow,</li>
            <li> Please stop false advertising.</li>
            <li> They are dull and useless!</li>
            <li> Not best for eye brows but a splinter, these are a finger saver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would grip hairs but for splinters, it failed my test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is miserable trying to get the tweezers to actually grasp anything.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> But the heads are so small and rounded that it is very difficult to get whatever it is that you are trying to tweeze!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use them.  </li>
            <li> I pluck the hell out of my eye brows using this bad boy.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This says it&#x27;s Revlon but is so cheaply made as to be laughable. No grip, almost unusable. I ended up buying the Revlon pointed tip tweezer and found the real ones I wanted. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap tweezers, I have little kids, tweezers disappear and for the price, what more could you want? Not best for eye brows but a splinter, these are a finger saver.</li>
            <li> These are just ok but after using them fro a while they broke becuase they would not stay apat and had to pull them apart and metal fatigued and broke</li>
            <li> Overall, product is as expected.  I was a bit surprised by the amount of grip you need to actually close these to where the tweezers grasp the splinter/hair.  I mean, its not like I am a weakling or anything, but these really take effort to close.  Good tweezers, but why make them so hard to close?</li>
            <li> I have a unibrow that I used to shave, plus my hair is thick, so it would come back in stubs that were noticeable even though they weren&#x27;t long. But using these tweezers I&#x27;ve been able to EASILY pull them out. I&#x27;m a guy, 19 years old, and I&#x27;m not good at beauty things, I can barely do my hair in the morning, but these tweezers work VERY WELL. Like I said, I had a thick unibrow, but now it looks like I have obsolutly NOTHING. Because I don&#x27;t, these tweezers have been awesome. I would buy at least 2, so that when 1 goes dull, you have another one ready to take over in his place. They are also good with very thin hairs because sometimes I&#x27;ll have thin hairs that grow as well, and I&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s tooooo thin to tweez, but this tweezers is a life saver when it comes to that. Honestly, these are the only tweezers I&#x27;ll ever buy again, which is why I&#x27;m here on Amazon ordering it lol I&#x27;ve been to cvs and Walgreens and other pharmacies and tried different tweezers but these are the BEST!!!! In fact, if somebody needed a gift, and I knew they used tweezers, if give them 2 of these because it&#x27;s just that great. Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows and small hairs.&lt;br /&gt;for splinters you may want to get a  finer, more pointy tweezer.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers i have always looked for a pointed pair of tweezers. it works perfect and has not rusted yet. just love them</li>
            <li> Bought these as a replacement for the rounded point tip ones I love so much yet seem to be unable to find.  They are almost as good as the originals, hence the four star review.  They grip hairs pretty well, but the tip is a bit wider than my old ones (also Revlon), so precision tweezing is not quite as easy.</li>
            <li> Not too much you can say about a tweezer except that they work.  These join together very well and grab the splinter easily.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Revlon Splinter Tweezer years ago, but I foolishly used it for something it was not mean for and ended up disfiguring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then purchased one of those slant tip tweezers and was always pinching myself.  I got so paranoid that I would rip a piece of my flesh out with them that I relented and purchased this replacement Revlon Splinter Tweezer.  Works beautifully and gets the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more worries of pinching myself and causing damage to the delicate skin around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers and, as far as I can tell, a discontinued item that you can&#x27;t find anywhere else. All the new designs have a long sharp grabbing end instead of coming to a point like these, which I greatly prefer.</li>
            <li> Tweezers... We use them for tweezing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweez effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So uh, they work well. Enough said :)</li>
            <li> It was NOT as sharp as the picture shows. Please stop false advertising. Now I need to buy another pair of tweezers that actually do the job.</li>
            <li> These are great for I.m sorry to say but nose hairs.I tried sissors but these tweezers work better.I use them on my eyebrows because they get very bushy and long.Great product.</li>
            <li> Although these tweezers work ok they are not at all the same as the picture. There are 4 diamonds where the picture has the word Revlon. They don&#x27;t have the indention where your fingers would go as in the picture. They also seem pointier than in the picture.</li>
            <li> plain and simple tweezers, I wanted a simple pair of tweezers and I got what I wanted.  why four stars? because I did not see that these tweezers are pointed at the tip when i bought them, I perfer the ones that the tip is flat but this tweezer still gets the job done. that was my fault but im still sticking with the 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Revlon tweezer for the past 15 years and was just looking for an extra one to have around. Well, they sure don&#x27;t make things the way they used to. Very disappointed, contact points not as precise and grip pad isn&#x27;t as functional as the older version. $3, you get what you pay for??</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Always works. I have brought this tweezer many times because I keep losing them.&lt;br /&gt;2) very well aligned&lt;br /&gt;3) great grip. I catch the hairs on the first try&lt;br /&gt;4) comes with a lifetime warranty. look at the back. if it breaks or doesn&#x27;t work Revlon replaces it.&lt;br /&gt;5) the price is great for a brand name!&lt;br /&gt;6) the tip is soft so it wont hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;no cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;great value.</li>
            <li> It is a great tweezer.  It would be exactly what you would expect in a tweezer. Great price for the item.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very springy. Good basic pair of tweezers for good price. Ends are sufficiently pointed without being dangerously sharp.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of tweezers like this for over 20 years, had them through several moves, never lost them! Someone is my house LOST them, I was aggravated.  I had search so many stores looking for a pair like this and then I finally found them. I was looking for a pair rounded point, but flat...great for eyebrows, splinters and stuff... boy, I missed these!!</li>
            <li> If you are reading this review then you are as picky and meticulous about your purchases as I am, no matter how small.  These are Revlon tweezers great for girls looking to grab a stray eyebrow or a crooked eyelash.  They&#x27;re also great for a splinter.  The problem I have with them is that they are pointy on the end.  I like my tweezers to have a teeny tiny flat end, that way I can blindy grab at ear hairs and maybe get lucky and get the stubborn one I was looking for.  See for gentlemen we have different problems and thus different needs for tweezers.  Also the best way to rid of a unibrow is by plucking it out.  For guys it&#x27;s all a numbers game, the battle against unwanted hair is to pluck multiple ones at a time.  For women they generally have to worry about a straggler here or there.  That&#x27;s not going to cut it for men and thus a flatter ended tweezer will work better.  With that being said it&#x27;s always good to have a pair of tweezers on hand.  I bought two incase I lose one.  In the event you have an out of control nose hair or a sandspur attack at 3am it&#x27;s important to have something and the last thing you want to do is have to run to a drug store and spend $12 on a pair (which I&#x27;ve had to do before).  They do not completely fit my needs but for the price they were worth getting unless you find better ones with a flat end for a cheaper or similar price.</li>
            <li> These do the job for which they&#x27;re intended.  No complaints here and actually enjoy having a new version of tweezers in my collection.</li>
            <li> After getting these tweezers out of the packaging (I was so excited for them to arrive because I am an eyebrow-plucking fool) the tips didn&#x27;t match up. I tried to bend the metal so I could use them, but I wasn&#x27;t able to.  What good are tweezers that can&#x27;t grab anything?  I would return these and ask for a refund or replacement, but it is too big of a hassle for a little pair of tweezers.  I guess you win some and you lose some.</li>
            <li> Needing a good tweezer to remove splinters, I thought this would fit the bill.  The ability to grip is lacking and would be better if the end had coarser grooves or crosshatch, since they just don&#x27;t grip that well.  I don&#x27;t know how well it would grip hairs but for splinters, it failed my test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another review that complained that the product received is not the one pictured.  After all this time, it still has not been corrected.</li>
            <li> Small tweezers, sharp strong point, good quality metal.  One of the nicer pairs I&#x27;ve owned out of more than a dozen different tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.  I would buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers said these weren&#x27;t as pictured.  Mine were just as described.  They may have fixed the problem with the picture or inventory by now, I purchased them from Amazon in May 2013.</li>
            <li> These tweezers have fat, rounded points on the ends and do not grab.  Warning: complete waste of a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> I had a nice set of tweezers and never could find them again until I saw this one it&#x27;s very close to the ones I had. Well worth the money!!!  Love them</li>
            <li> Good products, works very well on splinters and also makes tweezing my eyebrows much easier.  I do recommend this product</li>
            <li> Simply unusable. It is miserable trying to get the tweezers to actually grasp anything. I would not recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are ok, just a little small to grip.</li>
            <li> I needed some tweezers and like this style tip.</li>
            <li> Obviously you shouldn&#x27;t expect a revolutionary product for under $5. That being said, I have used much better tweezers for the price. These do the job alright, and might be decent for removing splinters. But the heads are so small and rounded that it is very difficult to get whatever it is that you are trying to tweeze! While these are not horrible, I would likely not purchase them again and would instead opt for tweezers with a wider, flatter point that would more readily grip small hairs, splinters, etc.</li>
            <li> I pluck the hell out of my eye brows using this bad boy. I highly recommend it for all your brow plucking needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get&#x27;cha pluck on! Jah&#x27;feel?</li>
            <li> These tweezers are well-made and smooth (no sharp edges or burs).  Nothing fancy, just a good, low-priced pair of basic tweezers.</li>
            <li> Tweezers! Good for anything from popping zits to plucking hairs or removing splinters. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  You couldn&#x27;t tweeze anything if your life depended on it.  They are not pointed.. They are dull and useless!</li>
            <li> It removes splinters. What else should it do? I guess it could be used as a tool on occasion also.</li>
            <li> As per Product Details I thought I Was Getting Long Tweezers 5.6\\&quot; Long  they are 3 \\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Details&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 5.6 x 1.8 x 0.5 inches ; 0.5 ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Think those Dimensions are the Package size  Amazon gave me a credit  I still need some long Tweezers so I will hopefully find them on Amazon as I have ordered for years from Amazon and they have always been been more then helpful, They are Top Rate To Deal With.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 5 stars because of their fairness in resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> I try to pluck my eyebrows and the tweezers won&#x27;t grab a hold of them.  It is very difficult to use them.  I would expect the tip to come together to be able to pluck an eyebrow and it can&#x27;t.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, Revlon&#x27;s old style without the four diamonds embossed were better. The contact points are not precise, and due to this don&#x27;t grip small hairs as well, while the old version easily did.</li>
