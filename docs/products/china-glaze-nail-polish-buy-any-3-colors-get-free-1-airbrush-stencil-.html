This is the exact definition of customer service and I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more nail polishes from them because of it. :)</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this nail color every time I wear it. The color is a burgundy/deep plum color. Rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color; quality application. I can&#x27;t speak to how long it stays on because my hands get pretty banged up and the color is gone in 4 days, but I loveee the color and keep repainting!</li>

            <li> I love this color so much! Its very pigmented you would only need 1 coat. It&#x27;s a glossy finish. if you buff and shine your nails with a buffing block apply base coat, nail polish then a top coat (Seche Vite) it lasts for a week or more! I am wearing it right now and its beautiful exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Nice deep color amazing</li>

            <li> This color looks brighter in the picture (as expected) but when applied its a nice deep purple. Definitely a color for the season. Would recommend to anyone who likes to keep up with trends.</li>
            <li> Love the color- no complaints at all</li>
            <li> Pretty color but still wasn&#x27;t the shade I expected. Much darker in person. Still a beautiful fall color!</li>
            <li> I love this color! The formula is not the best I&#x27;ve used because it is very easy to finish with tons of bubbles in the paint. This may be better for the more skilled nail artist.</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing I already had t!his color at home.  I wore it with zoya nova design.  Love them together got a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Color was abit dull but it was cute for $4,99</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of  China Glaze polishes. They&#x27;re beautifully pigmented, and this rich, vibrant plum is no exception. It coats well with 2 coats, no streaking, and no visible nail line. It stands up well to chipping, which I appreciate, having a job that is tough on my nails. All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend! I&#x27;ve passed this on as a gift many a time. :)</li>
