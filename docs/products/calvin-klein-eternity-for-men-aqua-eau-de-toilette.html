            <li>Will not be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>but I think the aqua smell better thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I just love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many complints from this one.</li>
            <li>I love &amp; will buy it again and again...</li>
            <li>Purchased for my boyfriend for Christmas and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I looked everywhere for this cologne (which is his favorite).</li>
            <li>Have really been using it since, great fragrance for men, not too fruity.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments every time I use it.</li>
            <li>price is appropriate.  </li>
            <li>going to buy more.</li>
            <li>It is sold at Macy&#x27;s for much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it for more than 5 years :)</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. :)</li>

            <li>It smelled okay to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly, if you&#x27;re buying this through Amazon check the 6.7oz price because it might be a better deal.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance would be much better if it weren&#x27;t so overpowering.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I love this scent...</li>
            <li>I cant say much more then that :)</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and bought this on Amazon from the FragranceNet.com site.</li>
            <li>This is not the authentic one.</li>
            <li>, the price was way better than buying it at the retailer, way better than waiting in line</li>
            <li>One of the better scents offered by Eternity.</li>
            <li>I was worried that a perfume might not make it safely through the mail but had no problems.</li>
            <li>when someone walks by wearing this, you smell it and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>i bought this product before and love it</li>
            <li>this product is authentic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the orginal eternity</li>
            <li>very nice scent women seem to really like it on me,</li>
            <li>I have to say it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>it has an awesome scent that will stay with you as long as you wear it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and I like how quick and efficient it was on arrival not the smell</li>
            <li>and i can say it&#x27;s easily one of the better colognes they have.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good buy.</li>
            <li>Great cologne for my 20 year old son.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS STRONG AND IT DOES ATTRACT THE LADIES</li>
            <li>my favorite for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Nice, crisp fragrance, water notes</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend, it smells so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>A 3.4 ounce bottle lasted a little over 6 months, which is great, and I got so many compliments on this cologne!</li>
            <li>Great buy, would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it does last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I bought also the deodorant and does not smell like the perfume (deodorant is genuine).</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s loving this colognes also helps use it up fast.</li>
            <li>This smells fabulous as per my expectations.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy the scent of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>CK Eternity Aqua is a light and airy smell that lasts througout the day.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this cologne and so does my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>For reference, some of the perfumes I&#x27;ve had are L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake for Men, Burberry Brit, Hugo by Hugo Boss, Only The Brave by Diesel, Bvlgari Aqua etc.</li>
            <li>Eternity Aqua is up there with all these classic perfumes and is cheaper than most!</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described, thank you!!</li>
            <li>It is very fresh smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>I got this for my father who has worn the classic Eternity for men for many years and he really enjoyed this as a replacement</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved this cologne, thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me want to move in close to my boyfriend!</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, smells really great, but won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>it does not have a unique stamp.</li>
            <li>I have the original eternity</li>
            <li>I want to be unique, so I am not recommending this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit stronger than the original and seems to stick around a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend, was looking for something clean, and not woodsy or musky.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and not too strong,</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>I recomend it if you like fresh and light scents.</li>
            <li>His whole world revolves around the most elusive creature on the planet...</li>
            <li>He was looking for the holy grail of colognes, it had to be a scent girls loved and wanted to snuggle up to while simultaneously smelling manly enough that the guys in the locker room wouldn&#x27;t think he was wearing perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>If you like a cool and sporty smell for your cologne, eternity can be the choice.</li>
            <li>I am in college and recommend this to anyone who wants to impress people. :)</li>
            <li>I really like this, even better than Eternity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It also came very quickly in the mail and was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something clean and fresh without being over board this is for you.</li>
            <li>Quick ordering and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>but it dissipates quickly and after an hour or so</li>
            <li>That was not that impressive because I just sprayed it before I left, and Publix was only two miles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man that&#x27;s tried probably 20 or more different types of cologne, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this scent, especially my wife.</li>
            <li>Its fresh, citrusy, and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>A great fragrance for everyday or special occasions.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Way to much!!</li>
            <li>Only drawback, it doesn&#x27;t lasts for whole day as compared to Burberry Summer (almost 24hrs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good mild fragrance for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering even when fresh</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>It has a scent that reminds of blue skies, but to each his own.</li>
            <li>It really does smell good and last a while.</li>
            <li>wife likes it better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Was a true item, not a fake.</li>
            <li>We love the nice fresh scent and this was much cheaper than it would have been from other merchants too.</li>
            <li>, it was the Eternity Aqua that I loved, not too strong but bold and very different from the regular Eternity.</li>
            <li>perfume does not smell right.</li>
            <li>Got it at the right price.</li>
            <li>right here</li>
            <li>But its nice, fresh and not loud.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts a long time and has a clean, fresh and appealing aroma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of strong aromas that last a long time so this cologne is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure to purchase this online but turned out great.  </li>
            <li>the classic Burberry, Davidoff Cool Waters.</li>
            <li>Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li>My husband has been an Eternity wearer for several years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my first cologne I ever used.</li>
            <li>Woman and, some men, will be irresistable attracted to you and may want to get in reeeaaaaaallll close for a smell or touch... ;)</li>
            <li>Be aware.</li>
            <li>check out ManPossible.com as they wrote a funny piece on this product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully crisp scent and my guy likes it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from the opposite gender.  </li>
            <li>Scored with my wife the first night.</li>
            <li>If you want hot chicks all over you, buy it.</li>
            <li>First day I used AQUA</li>
            <li>Real Juice!</li>
            <li>The one I received wears off pretty soon; lasts just about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this in a magazine; and then I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My husband wears the regular Eternity, and I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>Good scent and stays longer on you and even on your shirt after you takes it off and laying around for few days.</li>
            <li>I put a few sprays and smells good</li>
            <li>And it is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; popular than those other classics.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it looks nice on the shelf</li>
            <li>Great Long lasting scent and wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously, I had bought a smaller bottle not from this site and it smelled much more intense.</li>
            <li>Not Bad for a 75 year old guy.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong yet lasts for almost the entire day.</li>
            <li>It is a little lighter than the original and has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>The good thing about it does not over smell in hot or cold days and is tolerable by most people.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It goes very well with a suit or a dress shirt</li>
            <li>Add to that the challenge of finding a scent that lasts without having to keep reapplying or put on so much</li>
            <li>The smell of the fragrance was light and aromatic; definitely beats smelling like the boys gym</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This was the REAL FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>Also It stays on for a very longtime .I</li>
            <li>I wore it 2 weeks straight for July.</li>
            <li>It is intense when you apply.  </li>
            <li>It is very pleasing and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Aqua.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and this one accomplishes that very well.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable also.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Not a strong lasting smell great price tho</li>
            <li>but then so do many other Aqua cologne products.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the other colognes I purchased through Amazon smell better.</li>
            <li>Also, my other fragrances are more suited for night use.</li>
            <li>It is a different scent than the original Eternity</li>
            <li>If you like new, fresh and want to change that old cologne then get this Eternity Aqua, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>It does last a while, but if you are looking for that cologne that will smell as if you just sprayed it all day long, this one won&#x27;t be for you, because it is a light smell that stays with you most of the day, but after a little while settles on your skin and becomes a light scent...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in Venezuela and hot days makes fragrances goes away early, but this cologne keeps along all day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, brand new.</li>
            <li>I used to use Aqua DI GIO and Fahrenheit summer but think Eternity has nothing less even better.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a cross between Tommy and Polo Blue, with more influence of Polo Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used their products for many years and this one scent only lasts for a short while!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The smell can be a little strong at first</li>
            <li>My grandson just finished high school, and is on his way to college.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with reading the great reviews I read and a lot of people can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, enjoy being lonely in your parents&#x27; basement and dreaming about what it&#x27;s like to be a playa.</li>
            <li>The 3.4 oz bottle normally sells at the mall for about $60-$70.</li>
            <li>first, this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne because the scent not only lasts for a long time, but it also isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I use this every day to work, but wear gucci by gucci at nights which smells far better and more classy, but almost twice as expensive.</li>
            <li>Every year I pick out a new cologne for my fiancee.  </li>
            <li>He wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>a nice subtle mix of citrus, cucumber and sea water.</li>
            <li>gift for my brother as this is his usual and favorite brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first and decided to get a second one</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same cologne many times and will likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>The down fall is it stains light colored clothing.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cologne before but this time it is a little too strong as far as the scenht goes.</li>
            <li>I consider this a professional fragrance that should be worn by guys in the cooperate world.</li>
            <li>I had different people tell me they really like it.</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>I always buy my colognes through Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>So far no problems.</li>
            <li>70.00 on retail stores  got it for 35 worth every penny last till the next day</li>
            <li>Good for casual use.</li>
            <li>the smell becomes subtle and remains that way for most of the day.</li>
            <li>It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li>My obsession with the CK cologne brand begin back in my high school days.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it is not totally useless, but it is not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you are a young man, or if you are looking for something just cool but not sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I have spent months searching for a decent soft fragrance for my guy.  </li>
            <li>Not the real thing it smelled right but very subtle and did not last all day like the real product does.</li>
            <li>Bought this because of the great price turned out to be a bad idea.</li>
            <li>Be careful for spraying too much; I found 2 sprays overbearing.</li>
            <li>and I can barely smell it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Burberry Summer old editions (2007 to 2009).</li>
            <li>Eternity Aqua is similar to my old brand...</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Eternity for him and did not want to stray too far away from that scent for him.</li>
            <li>I received the cologne and right out the box just a few sprays and I was turning heads</li>
            <li>Eternity Aqua on Amazon, was considerably less than the prices I had found on the 1.7 ounce container, when shopping in stores and the the quality was exactly the same!</li>
            <li>So this is pretty much a waste of money for me now.</li>
            <li>quite a few Aqua scents from other high dollar makers and the quality of this CK scent is right up there with them, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Am now trying the Black version and really like it.</li>
            <li>Most scents are too strong or just plain smell bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend for Christmas and we both love it.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I looked everywhere for this cologne (which is his favorite).</li>
            <li> Have really been using it since, great fragrance for men, not too fruity.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments every time I use it.</li>
            <li> price is appropriate.  </li>
            <li> going to buy more.</li>
            <li> It is sold at Macy&#x27;s for much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it for more than 5 years :)</li>

            <li> This fragrance would be much better if it weren&#x27;t so overpowering.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE.</li>

            <li> It is my favorite of Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and bought this on Amazon from the FragranceNet.com site.</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic one.</li>
            <li> , the price was way better than buying it at the retailer, way better than waiting in line</li>
            <li> One of the better scents offered by Eternity.</li>
            <li> I was worried that a perfume might not make it safely through the mail but had no problems.</li>
            <li> when someone walks by wearing this, you smell it and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> i bought this product before and love it</li>
            <li> this product is authentic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the orginal eternity</li>
            <li> very nice scent women seem to really like it on me,</li>
            <li> I have to say it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> it has an awesome scent that will stay with you as long as you wear it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and I like how quick and efficient it was on arrival not the smell</li>
            <li> and i can say it&#x27;s easily one of the better colognes they have.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for my 20 year old son.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS STRONG AND IT DOES ATTRACT THE LADIES</li>
            <li> my favorite for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Nice, crisp fragrance, water notes</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, it smells so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> A 3.4 ounce bottle lasted a little over 6 months, which is great, and I got so many compliments on this cologne!</li>
            <li> Great buy, would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it does last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought also the deodorant and does not smell like the perfume (deodorant is genuine).</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s loving this colognes also helps use it up fast.</li>
            <li> This smells fabulous as per my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy the scent of this cologne.  </li>
            <li> CK Eternity Aqua is a light and airy smell that lasts througout the day.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this cologne and so does my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> For reference, some of the perfumes I&#x27;ve had are L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake for Men, Burberry Brit, Hugo by Hugo Boss, Only The Brave by Diesel, Bvlgari Aqua etc.</li>
            <li> Eternity Aqua is up there with all these classic perfumes and is cheaper than most!</li>
            <li> and it was exactly as described, thank you!!</li>
            <li> It is very fresh smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> I got this for my father who has worn the classic Eternity for men for many years and he really enjoyed this as a replacement</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this cologne, thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me want to move in close to my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, smells really great, but won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> it does not have a unique stamp.</li>
            <li> I have the original eternity</li>
            <li> I want to be unique, so I am not recommending this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit stronger than the original and seems to stick around a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, was looking for something clean, and not woodsy or musky.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and not too strong,</li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> I recomend it if you like fresh and light scents.</li>
            <li> His whole world revolves around the most elusive creature on the planet...</li>
            <li> He was looking for the holy grail of colognes, it had to be a scent girls loved and wanted to snuggle up to while simultaneously smelling manly enough that the guys in the locker room wouldn&#x27;t think he was wearing perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> If you like a cool and sporty smell for your cologne, eternity can be the choice.</li>
            <li> I am in college and recommend this to anyone who wants to impress people. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this, even better than Eternity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It also came very quickly in the mail and was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something clean and fresh without being over board this is for you.</li>
            <li> Quick ordering and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> but it dissipates quickly and after an hour or so</li>
            <li> That was not that impressive because I just sprayed it before I left, and Publix was only two miles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man that&#x27;s tried probably 20 or more different types of cologne, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this scent, especially my wife.</li>
            <li> Its fresh, citrusy, and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> A great fragrance for everyday or special occasions.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Way to much!!</li>
            <li> Only drawback, it doesn&#x27;t lasts for whole day as compared to Burberry Summer (almost 24hrs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good mild fragrance for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering even when fresh</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> It has a scent that reminds of blue skies, but to each his own.</li>
            <li> It really does smell good and last a while.</li>
            <li> wife likes it better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Was a true item, not a fake.</li>
            <li> We love the nice fresh scent and this was much cheaper than it would have been from other merchants too.</li>
            <li> , it was the Eternity Aqua that I loved, not too strong but bold and very different from the regular Eternity.</li>
            <li> perfume does not smell right.</li>
            <li> Got it at the right price.</li>
            <li> right here</li>
            <li> But its nice, fresh and not loud.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts a long time and has a clean, fresh and appealing aroma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not a fan of strong aromas that last a long time so this cologne is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure to purchase this online but turned out great.  </li>
            <li> the classic Burberry, Davidoff Cool Waters.</li>
            <li> Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> My husband has been an Eternity wearer for several years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne I ever used.</li>
            <li> Woman and, some men, will be irresistable attracted to you and may want to get in reeeaaaaaallll close for a smell or touch... ;)</li>
            <li> Be aware.</li>
            <li> check out ManPossible.com as they wrote a funny piece on this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully crisp scent and my guy likes it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments from the opposite gender.  </li>
            <li> Scored with my wife the first night.</li>
            <li> If you want hot chicks all over you, buy it.</li>
            <li> First day I used AQUA</li>
            <li> Real Juice!</li>
            <li> The one I received wears off pretty soon; lasts just about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this in a magazine; and then I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My husband wears the regular Eternity, and I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> Good scent and stays longer on you and even on your shirt after you takes it off and laying around for few days.</li>
            <li> I put a few sprays and smells good</li>
            <li> And it is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; popular than those other classics.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it looks nice on the shelf</li>
            <li> Great Long lasting scent and wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously, I had bought a smaller bottle not from this site and it smelled much more intense.</li>
            <li> Not Bad for a 75 year old guy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong yet lasts for almost the entire day.</li>
            <li> It is a little lighter than the original and has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> The good thing about it does not over smell in hot or cold days and is tolerable by most people.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It goes very well with a suit or a dress shirt</li>
            <li> Add to that the challenge of finding a scent that lasts without having to keep reapplying or put on so much</li>
            <li> The smell of the fragrance was light and aromatic; definitely beats smelling like the boys gym</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This was the REAL FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> Also It stays on for a very longtime .I</li>
            <li> I wore it 2 weeks straight for July.</li>
            <li> It is intense when you apply.  </li>
            <li> It is very pleasing and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Aqua.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and this one accomplishes that very well.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable also.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Not a strong lasting smell great price tho</li>
            <li> but then so do many other Aqua cologne products.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the other colognes I purchased through Amazon smell better.</li>
            <li> Also, my other fragrances are more suited for night use.</li>
            <li> It is a different scent than the original Eternity</li>
            <li> If you like new, fresh and want to change that old cologne then get this Eternity Aqua, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It does last a while, but if you are looking for that cologne that will smell as if you just sprayed it all day long, this one won&#x27;t be for you, because it is a light smell that stays with you most of the day, but after a little while settles on your skin and becomes a light scent...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Venezuela and hot days makes fragrances goes away early, but this cologne keeps along all day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, brand new.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aqua DI GIO and Fahrenheit summer but think Eternity has nothing less even better.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a cross between Tommy and Polo Blue, with more influence of Polo Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used their products for many years and this one scent only lasts for a short while!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The smell can be a little strong at first</li>
            <li> My grandson just finished high school, and is on his way to college.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with reading the great reviews I read and a lot of people can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, enjoy being lonely in your parents&#x27; basement and dreaming about what it&#x27;s like to be a playa.</li>
            <li> The 3.4 oz bottle normally sells at the mall for about $60-$70.</li>
            <li> first, this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne because the scent not only lasts for a long time, but it also isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use this every day to work, but wear gucci by gucci at nights which smells far better and more classy, but almost twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Every year I pick out a new cologne for my fiancee.  </li>
            <li> He wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> a nice subtle mix of citrus, cucumber and sea water.</li>
            <li> gift for my brother as this is his usual and favorite brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first and decided to get a second one</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same cologne many times and will likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> The down fall is it stains light colored clothing.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cologne before but this time it is a little too strong as far as the scenht goes.</li>
            <li> I consider this a professional fragrance that should be worn by guys in the cooperate world.</li>
            <li> I had different people tell me they really like it.</li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> I always buy my colognes through Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> So far no problems.</li>
            <li> 70.00 on retail stores  got it for 35 worth every penny last till the next day</li>
            <li> Good for casual use.</li>
            <li> the smell becomes subtle and remains that way for most of the day.</li>
            <li> It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> My obsession with the CK cologne brand begin back in my high school days.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it is not totally useless, but it is not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you are a young man, or if you are looking for something just cool but not sophisticated.</li>
            <li> I have spent months searching for a decent soft fragrance for my guy.  </li>
            <li> Not the real thing it smelled right but very subtle and did not last all day like the real product does.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the great price turned out to be a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Be careful for spraying too much; I found 2 sprays overbearing.</li>
            <li> and I can barely smell it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burberry Summer old editions (2007 to 2009).</li>
            <li> Eternity Aqua is similar to my old brand...</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Eternity for him and did not want to stray too far away from that scent for him.</li>
            <li> I received the cologne and right out the box just a few sprays and I was turning heads</li>
            <li> Eternity Aqua on Amazon, was considerably less than the prices I had found on the 1.7 ounce container, when shopping in stores and the the quality was exactly the same!</li>
            <li> So this is pretty much a waste of money for me now.</li>
            <li> quite a few Aqua scents from other high dollar makers and the quality of this CK scent is right up there with them, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Am now trying the Black version and really like it.</li>
            <li> Most scents are too strong or just plain smell bad.  </li>
            <li> Does not last too long, probably an hour</li>
            <li> Also when I spray it doesn&#x27;t lasts long unlike the regular one i brought from mall.</li>
            <li> To combat this problem I try to only use half a spritz, or I may use a wet rag to water it down a little so that the odor is not too strong.</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I leave for all my Amazon products this is one I have to give a negative one.</li>
            <li> it has a soft fragrance and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Smell lasts long 6-7 hrs and the smell</li>
            <li> Really not that much different from the ton of Aqua colognes out there.</li>
            <li> It stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I put 2 sparys of my other cologne and that almost last through out the day,Curve which I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> other Eternity products, you can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> This is a cool summery scent better for younger men, but it is a little boring for me, I mean, nothing really especial about it.</li>
            <li> Have gotten multiple compliments in just a short time of use and a few people have even asked what it is.</li>
            <li> The package was loose and it reflects like you are opening the used one.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely have it for years since only a very small amount is necessary for use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the summer, with other colognes such as Bleu De Chanel, Prada Luna Rossa Extreme, Dolce &amp; Gabanna</li>
            <li> I cannot smell this cologne while wearing it sadly, but women around me seem to notice quickly.</li>
            <li> Gift for some one unknown</li>
            <li> Peppery.</li>
            <li> THE ITEM WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS EXPECTED TO BE.</li>
            <li> It came on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Besides, it came with an after-shave lotion that I didn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few scents (Ralph Lauren and Lacoste, to name a few) and this one is one of the cleanest and long lasting that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> there I begin explore other brands of colognes to re-brand myself as a manly man.</li>
            <li> Unlike other colognes or body spray, this cologne doesn&#x27;t not abuse your nose.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to other s</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other day I had a homeless lady tell me that I &amp;#34;Stank pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so wanted to find something that would compliment my fragrance so they would d by compete with each other.</li>
            <li> The only detraction for me is that the spray volume is hard to control.  </li>
            <li> My hubby sometimes puts the cologne on a little heavier than necessary, but with this spray, it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Shopped at Amazon and purchased the 3.4 oz for over $20 less than Macy&#x27;s sale price......</li>
            <li> it is half of the price of the Polo Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it after approximately 6 hours or so.</li>
            <li> All three have the same non-cologne weak smell.</li>
            <li> bottle for $54 After testing a few scents</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, wears it everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few colognes form Amazon &amp; Macys.</li>
            <li> And my co-worker complimented me everyday</li>
            <li> When I received this one, it seems like this is not a genuine one.</li>
            <li> It was half the cost as well as buying it at Kohls!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you want less and it can be hard to control the amount.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;No way to be wrong with Kelvin Klein and Amazon&#x27;s service.&lt;br /&gt;Smell last longer on this Aqua vs.</li>
            <li> Wears it everyday!</li>
            <li> A box was cutted off in some numbers in several places, which immediately made me suspect that it could be a fake product.</li>
            <li> The past couple of days i almost seem to drench my self with it and by an hour or two couldn&#x27;t even tell I had it on.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a genuine Eternity product!</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had 1 complaint either.</li>
            <li> It do not look like a fake perfume as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I would get some for my husband if it didn&#x27;t feel a bit creepy to have my husband smell like my son when I&#x27;m snuggling up to him.</li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying that fake crap.</li>
            <li> Totally fake.</li>
            <li> These are also fake.</li>
            <li> I got a fake one.</li>
            <li> I even thought I got a knock off or a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> This was a knock off very disappointing!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Underwhelming after being used to the regular Eternity. Will not be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> Smell lasts long 6-7 hrs and the smell it&#x27;s really good but not the best one I had.</li>
            <li> My grandson just finished high school, and is on his way to college.  He loves this spray, and so do I.</li>
            <li> Excelent quality. Good price and great service&lt;br /&gt;No way to be wrong with Kelvin Klein and Amazon&#x27;s service.&lt;br /&gt;Smell last longer on this Aqua vs. the regular cologne&lt;br /&gt;I  recomend this product.</li>
            <li> A good value. Quick ordering and speedy delivery. My disappoint is with the product not your service. I have used this cologne before but this time it is a little too strong as far as the scenht goes. Probably would not order this again.</li>
            <li> Gift for some one unknown</li>
            <li> It smells really great!</li>
            <li> Great cologne for my 20 year old son. He loves it. Smells really good. Not nauseating.</li>
            <li> Its very good toilette spray. Thanks</li>
            <li> Really not that much different from the ton of Aqua colognes out there. it does not have a unique stamp. But its nice, fresh and not loud. Does not last too long, probably an hour but then so do many other Aqua cologne products. I would give it a 7 out of 10 - Good.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Bought as a gift for my sons. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I consider this a professional fragrance that should be worn by guys in the cooperate world. It goes very well with a suit or a dress shirt and it is best worn in the morning.</li>
            <li> 70.00 on retail stores  got it for 35 worth every penny last till the next day tons of compliments I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Very great smell and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it..  I have the original eternity but I think the aqua smell better thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Peppery. My girl friend also proceeded to jump my bones shortly after I put it on. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and fresh. Wear this around people and you&#x27;ll get notice and complimented on the smell. The smell lasts only a couple hour(2-3) but stays in your clothes. Good for any age group. Also, a very good gift.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. Wears it everyday! Great buy, would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> my husband always gets a lot of compliments when he uses this fragrance! It smells really good on him and I just love the scent.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the right occasion.</li>
            <li> My husband has been an Eternity wearer for several years, and I love it. For Christmas, I wanted him to try something different. I went to Macy&#x27;s and they had a sale on this size bottle for $54 After testing a few scents, it was the Eternity Aqua that I loved, not too strong but bold and very different from the regular Eternity. Shopped at Amazon and purchased the 3.4 oz for over $20 less than Macy&#x27;s sale price......husband loves it too</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  The down fall is it stains light colored clothing.  I have ruined several shirts.  Otherwise, it is a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many complints from this one. I recomend it if you like fresh and light scents. CK&#x27;s best yet.</li>
            <li> This is my first cologne I ever used. I have to say it is pretty good. It smells great and it does last throughout the day. I do three sprays: one at the neck, one on the chest, and another spray on my wrists. The smell can be a little strong at first but it dissipates quickly and after an hour or so the smell becomes subtle and remains that way for most of the day. I can barely smell it after approximately 6 hours or so. If you want something that lasts longer than that then I would suggest trying something else. I&#x27;m personally not a fan of strong aromas that last a long time so this cologne is perfect for me.  Overall it&#x27;s a good cologne</li>
            <li> I purchased this online and it was good for the price. It do not look like a fake perfume as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great price. Arrived quickly and as described!</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS EXCELLENT I RECEIVED ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS FROM CO WORKERS WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN THE SMELL IS STRONG AND IT DOES ATTRACT THE LADIES</li>
            <li> The aquatic smell of the Eternity Aqua is perfect for the office. It isn&#x27;t too strong yet lasts for almost the entire day. Several people have complimented me and asked which cologne I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;ve tried the Acqua Di Gio, Aqva by Bvlgari, the classic Burberry, Davidoff Cool Waters. They are all classics and smell great, but the Eternity Aqua lasts the longest for me. And it is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; popular than those other classics.</li>
            <li> CK Eternity Aqua has a light and pleasant scent that&#x27;s not over powering as most men&#x27;s cologne are.  I used Eternity and that was very good as well.  I like this and may be using Aqua from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to Aqua di gio. It smells fresh and clean. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I would say BUY it!</li>
            <li> I like the product as is it has a soft fragrance and a little goes a long way.  I recommend the product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> great smell. gets lots of compliments.  wife loves this cologne. will deffinitely buy again once I run out. 100% a+</li>
            <li> THE ITEM WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS EXPECTED TO BE. VERY HAPPY WITH THE ITEM. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS</li>
            <li> This is very nice, not too spicy, not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I am told it smells great on me by more than 1 person.</li>
            <li> I love &amp; will buy it again and again... I also recommend it to friends who always tell me that d perfume I&#x27;m wearing is nice</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! Woman and, some men, will be irresistable attracted to you and may want to get in reeeaaaaaallll close for a smell or touch... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice subtle mix of citrus, cucumber and sea water. It is not overpowering even when fresh sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend for Christmas and we both love it.  It was half the cost as well as buying it at Kohls!</li>
            <li> My husband and I looked everywhere for this cologne (which is his favorite). The 3.4 oz bottle normally sells at the mall for about $60-$70. Way to much!! We bought two because the price was great and they shipped to us in 5 days. We are extremely happy about this purchase. Also, the header reads 3.4 oz and the pic shows 1 oz but it definitely ships a 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and I like how quick and efficient it was on arrival not the smell I was looking for but nice</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing and perfect for the energetic type. It&#x27;s great for a sunny day. Be careful for spraying too much; I found 2 sprays overbearing.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love! Good scent and stays longer on you and even on your shirt after you takes it off and laying around for few days.</li>
            <li> Have really been using it since, great fragrance for men, not too fruity. Am now trying the Black version and really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my son who just turned 16. His whole world revolves around the most elusive creature on the planet...GIRLS!  He was looking for the holy grail of colognes, it had to be a scent girls loved and wanted to snuggle up to while simultaneously smelling manly enough that the guys in the locker room wouldn&#x27;t think he was wearing perfume. Add to that the challenge of finding a scent that lasts without having to keep reapplying or put on so much it smells like you bathed in it. I am happy to say that this cologne meets and even surpasses all the requirements! I would get some for my husband if it didn&#x27;t feel a bit creepy to have my husband smell like my son when I&#x27;m snuggling up to him.</li>
            <li> Was not sure to purchase this online but turned out great.  Fragrance lasts all day.  I get many compliments every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Be aware. Fake product. I received the perfume in a box with alterations. A box was cutted off in some numbers in several places, which immediately made me suspect that it could be a fake product. the box was altered as attached with glue. perfume does not smell right. I bought also the deodorant and does not smell like the perfume (deodorant is genuine). I feel cheated, Dont waste your money buying that fake crap.</li>
            <li> great deodarant but need to make a body wash to go with it.  price is appropriate.  going to buy more.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it and so do I. He smells so good all the time and he purchased the ladies for me. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that beats the smell of this cologne!  Nothing.  I will be ordering another bottle within the next week!  My son&#x27;s loving this colognes also helps use it up fast.One Bottle gone in one month!  But this is a great smell and It is now my favorite without a doubt!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite cologne. My obsession with the CK cologne brand begin back in my high school days. At the time my brother gave me a 0.5oz travel size bottle of CK One Eau De Toilette. The smell of the fragrance was light and aromatic; definitely beats smelling like the boys gym locker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there I begin explore other brands of colognes to re-brand myself as a manly man. However, I kept finding myself going back to the CK Eternity Aqua. This cologne have a settle and welcoming aroma. With each inhaled breath triggering the brain to recall another scent. Unlike other colognes or body spray, this cologne doesn&#x27;t not abuse your nose. The fragrance tends to stay with you throughout the day and will fade in and out. These is definitely a proper cologne that emits class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also check out ManPossible.com as they wrote a funny piece on this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Lets just say I haven&#x27;t sleep on the couch in weeks!! Thank you Mr.C Kllein great fragrance</li>
            <li> Smells like a cross between Tommy and Polo Blue, with more influence of Polo Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is half of the price of the Polo Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extra benefit, the ladies will notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is no exception. It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I have spent months searching for a decent soft fragrance for my guy.  Most scents are too strong or just plain smell bad.  This is a wonderfully crisp scent and my guy likes it.  Ooolaalaa!!!</li>
            <li> gift for my brother as this is his usual and favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Love the cool refreshing smell, a perfect DAY cologne. Like most Calvin Klein perfumes this one doesn&#x27;t fail to impress.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  It is sold at Macy&#x27;s for much more.  I&#x27;m still on my first and decided to get a second one just incase they go out of stock. I wear it and people always give a compliment on how good it smells.  It has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I love it and my girl friend too! I&#x27;m wearing it for more than 5 years :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, wears it everyday. Smells great and its a great deal buying it here for the size.</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I leave for all my Amazon products this is one I have to give a negative one. I put a few sprays and smells good but after an hour can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on. The past couple of days i almost seem to drench my self with it and by an hour or two couldn&#x27;t even tell I had it on. I put 2 sparys of my other cologne and that almost last through out the day,Curve which I bought at the store. Hopefully the other colognes I purchased through Amazon smell better.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven! I love it and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat this deal! I got it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. :)</li>
            <li> Smells so good, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> A wonderful smelling aroma!  I have received many compliments from the opposite gender.  It stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li> Works great! All the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> If you like a cool and sporty smell for your cologne, eternity can be the choice. I used to use Aqua DI GIO and Fahrenheit summer but think Eternity has nothing less even better.  The price is really good and even better than retail stores. So was a good buy.</li>
            <li> great price for the volume.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly! Product in great shape and exactly as pictured! Great smelling cologne! Not too stong, has a very clean smell!</li>
            <li> Great size bottle for the price! Love the smell on my husband and he loves it too! I typed this for him. :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent that is perfect for any guy who prefers a light and fresh smell. I got this for my father who has worn the classic Eternity for men for many years and he really enjoyed this as a replacement</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne, its refreshing and not overpowering.  I I think it has that medium where its not too extravagant, but still classier than deodorant. It has a scent that reminds of blue skies, but to each his own.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent. I will definitely continue to order in the future. Would recommend to other s</li>
            <li> Very nice!  My husband has always worn the &amp;#34;ETERNITY&amp;#34;, but I decided to try the &amp;#34;AQUA&amp;#34; and I love it!  and that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband. I always smell him when we hug and I like this scent on him.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the great price turned out to be a bad idea. Received the Cologne and compared it to the one I bought at Sephora in person, the wording on box doesn&#x27;t match and address is different on each bottle. DO NOT BUY this product.</li>
            <li> This cologne gets  a great reaction from the ladies and that&#x27;s all I can ask for.</li>
            <li> It really does smell good and last a while. I am pretty impressed! I sure got it at a killer deal! I had different people tell me they really like it. I haven&#x27;t had 1 complaint either. It&#x27;s worth it! :P</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> Scored with my wife the first night. Brought passion back into my 13 year marriage....</li>
            <li> wife likes it better than my old one. Now for some filler words to satisfy amazon one two three four</li>
            <li> This was a knock off very disappointing!!! Not the real thing it smelled right but very subtle and did not last all day like the real product does.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance - prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and not too strong, just right! I bought this product with reading the great reviews I read and a lot of people can&#x27;t be wrong. If you like new, fresh and want to change that old cologne then get this Eternity Aqua, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> A great gift for my son in law</li>
            <li> the eternity aqua was almost double the price in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;I Love the fragrance. and the price was amazing along with the free shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; great price. I am a fan of Calvin Klein fragrances, especially men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Eternity. Happy to have found them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you want hot chicks all over you, buy it. This brought me from the basement to the penthouse.  Otherwise, enjoy being lonely in your parents&#x27; basement and dreaming about what it&#x27;s like to be a playa.</li>
            <li> This was the REAL FRAGRANCE AT A REALLY GOOD P</li>
            <li> First day I used AQUA I passed through both LAX and PHX. I was approached by 17 different women who wanted to know what i was wearing? Not Bad for a 75 year old guy.Maybe using the entire bottle at one time was overkill.</li>
            <li> I love CK line of cologne. I bought this one and i can say it&#x27;s easily one of the better colognes they have. it smells good and it is not that strong. it has an awesome scent that will stay with you as long as you wear it.</li>
            <li> Not a strong lasting smell great price tho</li>
            <li> This smells fabulous as per my expectations.Also It stays on for a very longtime .I apply this in the morning and when I come out of the office it is still good.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few colognes form Amazon &amp; Macys. I have been using this in the summer, with other colognes such as Bleu De Chanel, Prada Luna Rossa Extreme, Dolce &amp; Gabanna The One...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this was my least favorite. It smelled okay to me. It is a bit cucumberish.. and I thought it didn&#x27;t last or projected as I couldn&#x27;t smell it in an hour from application. I even thought I got a knock off or a bad bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a summer/day scent. I apply it before I go out in the morning because I wanted to give it a chance. Also, my other fragrances are more suited for night use. I went to Publix, and a woman approached me and said you smell good. That was not that impressive because I just sprayed it before I left, and Publix was only two miles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one time I applied it while I was at home, went out, back home.. after three hours.. I couldn&#x27;t smell it. However, I left my apartment again, and a guy was walking in fornt of my in my building was sniffing the air, and said .. \\&quot;mmm something smells good\\&quot;, I said.. \\&quot;yeah... the lady in this apartment (and I pointed at a neighbor) is probably cooking some steak)\\&quot;.. he said no no.. it&#x27;s a cologne... do you have a cologne on?... I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then today, I was at the library... at around 5pm (I applied this at about 11:30pm).. I walked buy the lady that work the cafeteria and she asked me what did I have on?... I was wondering what she was talking about and the last thing on my mind was the cologne. She said that she could smell it as I walked by, that it was a good smell. Wow.. after 6 hours!! and I can barely smell it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I learn not to judge a cologne by how I smell it, but rather I should give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, if you&#x27;re buying this through Amazon check the 6.7oz price because it might be a better deal.  I always buy my colognes through Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells on my husband!</li>
            <li> This fragrance would be much better if it weren&#x27;t so overpowering. It actually gives me a headache. To combat this problem I try to only use half a spritz, or I may use a wet rag to water it down a little so that the odor is not too strong. I gave it two stars because it is not totally useless, but it is not really what I was hoping for. On the other hand, it looks nice on the shelf and I will definitely have it for years since only a very small amount is necessary for use.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE. great smell....can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I got this online for my dad and my husband has already tried and liked it. Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great and lasts awhile. It is cheaper than at the mall that was even smaller than this one was.</li>
            <li> I wanted something light and fresh and this fit perfect. My wife loves it and it last for 5-7 hours. If you are looking for something clean and fresh without being over board this is for you.</li>
            <li> for some reason the perfume purchased from amazon does not smell or last the same way the same product purchased at the store does. I heard this once before an thought it was hogwash but I will tell you that the fragrance dissipates soon after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Its fresh, citrusy, and not too sweet.  The only detraction for me is that the spray volume is hard to control.  Sometimes, you want less and it can be hard to control the amount.  Other than that, this is a winner!</li>
            <li> Great price nice smell thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. It came on time and as expected. Will buy again and I definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I love this scent...it smells very sexy and manly.  I cant say much more then that :)</li>
            <li> Smells good. I wore it 2 weeks straight for July. Real Juice! And my co-worker complimented me everyday I wore it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this purchase! It also came very quickly in the mail and was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I was initially nervous to purchase this on Amazon because of the reviews I have seen about the quality of the product. This is a good purchase, I have not had any issues with the scent being diluted or short-lived. It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I bought the perfume because i like it.  It is intense when you apply.  The one I received wears off pretty soon; lasts just about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! Totally fake. Looks like Calvin Klein Box &amp; Bottle but has no actual cologne fragrance.  Also purchased Calvin Klein Eternity &amp; Summer from Amazon.  These are also fake. All three have the same non-cologne weak smell. BEWARE!  This is a 0 Star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately got a refund on all 3 bottles with no hassle from Amazon. That, I am thankful for.</li>
            <li> Great scent! My boyfriend wears it all the time!</li>
            <li> Last all day!  One of my wife favorite smell on me!  Great price, excellent and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Venezuela and hot days makes fragrances goes away early, but this cologne keeps along all day. Besides, it came with an after-shave lotion that I didn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> I have brought this product form Amazon last week. When I received this one, it seems like this is not a genuine one. The package was loose and it reflects like you are opening the used one. Also when I spray it doesn&#x27;t lasts long unlike the regular one i brought from mall. I will not prefer to buy it again form this online.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne because the scent not only lasts for a long time, but it also isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have gotten compliments wearing this cologne because of the pleasant smell that it provides. The smell is just enough to be noticeable. It is not like those overpowering ones that you can smell all the way across the room. It is my favorite of Calvin Klein. I would buy again because of the great fragrance. I am in college and recommend this to anyone who wants to impress people. :)</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband.  He likes it, it smells great, wish he would wear it more often.</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. got it for my son and should have got it for my husband. lol</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Was a true item, not a fake. Will shop here again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice smell but leave stain!</li>
            <li> Several women have made the remark &amp;#34;you smell so nice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and bought this on Amazon from the FragranceNet.com site. It did come on time and was packaged alright. It was a gift for my brother and of course i didn&#x27;t open the packaging before giving it to him. After a month, when he opened it, the spray pump of the bottle was not working. So this is pretty much a waste of money for me now.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy the scent of this cologne.  I just recently found this and I am very glad I did.  It can be worn for both casual/business/formal use.  I get compliments everywhere I go when wearing this.  It is very pleasing and not overpowering.  Lasts all day long.  It&#x27;s great to get a whiff of this every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this again.  I also recently purchased the matching deodorant.......awesome.  Smells just like the cologne.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, smells really great, but won&#x27;t last very long. I like it anyway and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a wonderful addition to my collection! Fast shipping, brand new. One of my new favorite colognes. CK Eternity Aqua is a light and airy smell that lasts througout the day.</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic one. It&#x27;s like it was diluted in water by 100X.&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I had bought a smaller bottle not from this site and it smelled much more intense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Calvin Klein fragrances and this one is no exception.  It&#x27;s light, clean and fresh and makes me want to move in close to my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this cologne and so does my girlfriend. I have purchased this same cologne many times and will likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> we took a chance and bought a cologne online, it was a great idea, i&#x27;ve had eternity before, never the aqua, especially buying it online, the price was way better than buying it at the retailer, way better than waiting in line and it was exactly as described, thank you!!</li>
            <li> We love the nice fresh scent and this was much cheaper than it would have been from other merchants too.</li>
            <li> Great price and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The other day I had a homeless lady tell me that I &amp;#34;Stank pretty&amp;#34;. What more of a ringing endorsement could one mere mortal need?</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law. He loves it!!</li>
            <li> This was good purchase everything went well.  I would definitely buy this cologne again when I have the chance no arguments here</li>
            <li> Great Long lasting scent and wife absolutely loves it. One of the better scents offered by Eternity. Exceeded our expectations.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on this cologne.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burberry Summer old editions (2007 to 2009). Eternity Aqua is similar to my old brand...Nice fragrance! Only drawback, it doesn&#x27;t lasts for whole day as compared to Burberry Summer (almost 24hrs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good mild fragrance for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Good for casual use. The packaging is nice. I was worried that a perfume might not make it safely through the mail but had no problems. Price was competitive. Overall a very good buy. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought it from a store, but want to leave a review in case if it helps someone. This is one of my favortie perfumes. For reference, some of the perfumes I&#x27;ve had are L&#x27;eau d&#x27;Issey by Issey Miyake for Men, Burberry Brit, Hugo by Hugo Boss, Only The Brave by Diesel, Bvlgari Aqua etc. Eternity Aqua is up there with all these classic perfumes and is cheaper than most! No stains, great smell and lasts all day. I got Calvin Klein Escape recently and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the Aqua.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> This is a good purchase, I have not had any issues with the scent being diluted or short-lived. It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Just I can say that is awesome. I want to be unique, so I am not recommending this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got a fake one. It did even last 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I received the cologne and right out the box just a few sprays and I was turning heads very nice scent women seem to really like it on me,</li>
            <li> Every year I pick out a new cologne for my fiancee.  I first smelled this in a magazine; and then I found it on Amazon.  This smells amazing!</li>
            <li> My husband wears the regular Eternity, and I love the way it smells on him. He wanted to try something new. I am a big fan of Eternity for him and did not want to stray too far away from that scent for him. I saw this one so I decided to purchase it for him. It is a different scent than the original Eternity but still close enough in the same family that I still like it on him. It is a little lighter than the original and has a fresh, clean scent. I like both for different reasons.</li>
            <li> look out ladies! my favorite for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I really like this, even better than Eternity. The Aqua smells great to me and it was a better price than Belks. I am happy with it and would buy again when I run out. I would recommend smelling it somewhere before buying because everyone is different.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a genuine Eternity product! I have used their products for many years and this one scent only lasts for a short while!&lt;br /&gt;My other Eternity products, you can still smell it the next day. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man that&#x27;s tried probably 20 or more different types of cologne, and this is my favorite. It smells so amazing, when someone walks by wearing this, you smell it and love it. A 3.4 ounce bottle lasted a little over 6 months, which is great, and I got so many compliments on this cologne! Everyone loved it. Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> My account was just open, you check your records</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good smelling spray - you&#x27;ll love it. The quality of the bottle is also nice. Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. it is designed to be a very light and refreshing fragrance...and this one accomplishes that very well. It does last a while, but if you are looking for that cologne that will smell as if you just sprayed it all day long, this one won&#x27;t be for you, because it is a light smell that stays with you most of the day, but after a little while settles on your skin and becomes a light scent...Excellent choice! Must try!</li>
            <li> This is a cool summery scent better for younger men, but it is a little boring for me, I mean, nothing really especial about it. I use this every day to work, but wear gucci by gucci at nights which smells far better and more classy, but almost twice as expensive. I recommend this if you are a young man, or if you are looking for something just cool but not sophisticated. The good thing about it does not over smell in hot or cold days and is tolerable by most people.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my man at Christmas.  I love this fragrance.  Nice size for a much better price than a department store.</li>
            <li> i bought this product before and love it and it has a great price recommend  to anyone who wants their  man to smell good</li>
            <li> I tried is sport when you running exercise or you walk in the park is recommended please feel free awesome</li>
            <li> The price I paid for this 3.4 ounce Eternity Aqua on Amazon, was considerably less than the prices I had found on the 1.7 ounce container, when shopping in stores and the the quality was exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne after smelling a sample of it in a magazine and I don&#x27;t regret it. It is very fresh smelling cologne. It&#x27;s got a water type smell to it as the name implies and I have gotten several compliments on the smell while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great price and speed of getting it to me!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, it smells so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent and so do I.  this product is authentic. The price is reasonable also. Good packaging.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, was looking for something clean, and not woodsy or musky. musky wear bliss fragrance so wanted to find something that would compliment my fragrance so they would d by compete with each other. Nice, crisp fragrance, water notes</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this scent, especially my wife. Got it at the right price. So far no problems. Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple years now and it is a remarkable fragrance. i love it and people often tell me how good i smell and ask me what it is. winner right here</li>
            <li> Have gotten multiple compliments in just a short time of use and a few people have even asked what it is. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a LOT of compliments from this one.  I cannot smell this cologne while wearing it sadly, but women around me seem to notice quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my hubby&#x27;s birthday gift. He loved it. Great value for money. Nice fragrance. Will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> Lo utilizo a diario al ir al trabajo, tiene un aroma que tranquilamente dura todo el dia, es mentira que en comentarios anteriores mencionaban que mancha la ropa oscura, cumple con mis exigencias.</li>
            <li> love it smells great a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> A nice balanced scent.  My hubby sometimes puts the cologne on a little heavier than necessary, but with this spray, it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the orginal eternity and it&#x27;s really hard to perfect something that&#x27;s great - this aqua version is nice - I won&#x27;t even try to describe it but it&#x27;s good. I like that it&#x27;s a bit stronger than the original and seems to stick around a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this cologne, thanks so much! I love the scent! Great item. Thanks again. Fast shipment. just want i wanted</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> A great fragrance for everyday or special occasions.  The fragrance lasts a long time and has a clean, fresh and appealing aroma.  A good cologne to have in your collection as a scents choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few scents (Ralph Lauren and Lacoste, to name a few) and this one is one of the cleanest and long lasting that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve sampled quite a few Aqua scents from other high dollar makers and the quality of this CK scent is right up there with them, especially for the price.</li>
