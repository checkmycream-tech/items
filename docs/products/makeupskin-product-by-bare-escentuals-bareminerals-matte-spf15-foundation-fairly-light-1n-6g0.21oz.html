            <li>but this is the best for my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great product line to get stuck on!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural-looking and the texture is so creamy and perfect.</li>
            <li>This color foundation is perfect if you are fair like me with freckles.</li>
            <li>It looks great and comes pre packaged.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great without feeling caked on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is great foundation-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60s and find it to be an excellent light but covering foundation.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look good at all.  </li>
            <li>This product actually is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I found that you need a really good brush to apply it</li>
            <li>After a while I did try to replace it with a drugstore brand but the quality wasn&#x27;t so good</li>
            <li>Great product and stays on nicely all day.</li>
            <li>I thought the foundation was a good Christmas for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>its nice, but not as flawless as they make it sound.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>Idk how they do it, but this product is amazing for me.</li>
            <li>Also, the skin tone matches mine perfect, This is something important to keep in mind if you are trying this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is the best product out there for your face in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is perfect for someone like me who has breakouts.</li>
            <li>My face glows and looks healthy again.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation because it goes on smoothly and is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I went and priced this at a makeup store and it was almost 15 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Love ordering it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Matte foundation is such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love ordering almost everything on Amazon, but this is an exception.</li>
            <li>I always use bareminerals and love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li>It offers great coverage.</li>
            <li>like the powder, easy on, easy to clean at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>This matte finish gives good coverage without the shine that the original bare minerals has, which is great for older skin.  </li>
            <li>I got hooked on BareMinerals a couple of years ago and it has been fantastic since it lets my skin breath while I am wearing it.</li>
            <li>it is so light but covers well.  </li>
            <li>fairly light is darker than I wanted</li>
            <li>The package arrived pretty quickly so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Since she picked it out by brand name, I know she was excited to receive it and will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the original foundation.</li>
            <li>I ordered from here fairly light makeup, and when the package was received, they had covered the actual shade with tape and it was fairly medium.</li>
            <li>I normally use the original and love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look flawless and even covers very bad acne scars and even acne flare ups incredibly well.</li>
            <li>I love the new packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt think the price could be true but this is the real deal stuff!</li>
            <li>I did, however, use the product, and it seemed to be bare minerals, so in the end it worked out okay.</li>
            <li>I believe that choosing the right shade is very important for this make-up to work for you properly.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted with the convenience of being shipped right to my house.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and makes my skin look fresh and smooth rather than chalky as I&#x27;ve found some other mineral makeups do.</li>
            <li>Large container, came right away,</li>
            <li>I love the light coverage and how it doesnt clog my pores or feel heavy.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and you can barely tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Mine is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>It did not make me break out at all and really helped control blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any quality makeup stores around me</li>
            <li>The wrong color was sent, fairly medium instead of fairly light.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of BareMinerals Foundation for the past 5 years and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t plan on changing that any time soon.</li>
            <li>They also got clever and replaced the shade sticker on the bottom of the makeup.</li>
            <li>However I usually apply this first, then use a little of the original foundation on top.</li>
            <li>Arrived brand new just as stated.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to try a bunch of different shades until you&#x27;ve found the perfect one.</li>
            <li>The whole experience was just a bit sketchy though, so I have resumed buying my bare minerals at the brick and mortar makeup stores.</li>
            <li>I really can use this and not have to touch up for several hours.</li>
            <li>Your skin can breathe and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li>and she has been having no trouble.</li>
            <li>Lightening fast shipping, product was exactly what I expected big fan of BareMinerals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for years and was sent Matte by mistake</li>
            <li>I am a natural red-head and it is really hard to find complimentary make-up for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>but since it wasn&#x27;t a super saver shipper item the price was about the same (I&#x27;m not sure if Sephora charges for shipping).</li>
            <li>I only recently broke out when I started using a revlon concealer underneath bare minerals.</li>

It makes my skin look flawless and even covers very bad acne scars and even acne flare ups incredibly well. It&#x27;s so natural-looking and the texture is so creamy and perfect. Idk how they do it, but this product is amazing for me. It&#x27;s one of my staple items in my make-up bag.  Also, the skin tone matches mine perfect, This is something important to keep in mind if you are trying this product for the first time. I believe that choosing the right shade is very important for this make-up to work for you properly. I would suggest that if you don&#x27;t feel you know your shade, have someone at Sephora help you out before purchasing it online. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try a bunch of different shades until you&#x27;ve found the perfect one.</li>
            <li> fairly light is darker than I wanted but I like the product.  I just have to find a lighter color.</li>
