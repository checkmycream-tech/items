            <li>Good grit but very very flimsy!</li>
            <li>and I can tell they are better.</li>
            <li>love that this is a multi pack too since I feel like I am always looking for a nail file.</li>
            <li>These are OK.</li>
            <li>Cant reuse them too many times...</li>
            <li>I like to be able to keep one in my purse, one in my night stand, one in my desk, etc.</li>
            <li>Much better than the neon ones, which shed their color over and under and around your nails.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite files.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t purchase again, though I do love the Tweezerman cuticle scissors and callous buff bar.</li>
            <li>Better than most for the price.  </li>
            <li>They are good for your nails for the fact that it&#x27;s not rough on the nail when you are filing, which is good.</li>
            <li>Great emery boards, high quality</li>
            <li>They are sturdier than normal nail files, which is great when you are not a patient person.  </li>

            <li>Great for filing natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and do the job according to the Lady of the house, a beautiful human being that likes to keep herself in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>but i prefer a bit coarser grit to take off more nail more quickly.</li>
            <li>These are really cool nail files!</li>
            <li>Their other products are excellent too!!</li>
            <li>I like these emery boards, and the color is easy to see in my purse.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t wear out as easily as others</li>
            <li>Still used them all, great for one time use only. :)</li>
            <li>wife thinks there ok nothing special</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman emery boards are a pretty nice nail file.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price, and since Tweezerman is a reputable company that makes super tweezers, so it&#x27;s no surprise</li>
            <li>Awesome little emery boards.  </li>
            <li>They clean up nail breaks or tears easily</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap nail files that work.</li>
            <li>They clean up nail breaks or tears easily.</li>
            <li>The grit does not wear away like cheap emery boards.  </li>
            <li>I knew I would find them someplace, and good old Amazon and Tweezerman brought them to me.</li>
            <li>Not a fine grade file in my opinion but works perfectly for finger &amp; toenails.</li>
            <li>I am happy that Amazon carries them, the quality is outstanding compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>without making a new purchase decision every time one wears out so I liked to be able to buy a bunch economically at my convenience.</li>
            <li>If you wear contacts you know how it feels to break one, after clipping your nails , use these to file your fingers to give the that smooth surface you need to clean the contacts without tearing them up</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>And worth every penny!</li>
            <li>They work quickly and leave your nails smooth with no snags.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>True to the standards of all Tweezerman products these boards as strong and durable with just the right grit.  </li>
            <li>These are way better than normal cheap emery boards.</li>
            <li>and they work perfect for&lt;br /&gt;my delicate nails.  </li>
            <li>Nice medium grit on these ... not too coarse that it tears your nails, and not too fine that it just feels like a buffer ... as Goldilocks said, this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are the perfect weight and width to smooth down children&#x27;s and adult&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>They are economical and easy to see, being bright pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend all day filing my nails with something that takes forever, give me something that will do the trick quickly and efficiently</li>
            <li>totally adequate</li>
            <li>so all I can say is that it does the job and is worth it</li>
            <li>Takes the shine right out of your nails.  </li>
            <li>They are great for soft nails that tear easily and smooth down rough spots like magic.</li>
            <li>Some emery boards are so fine and soft they are ineffective.  </li>
            <li>If you are actually interested in shaping your nails, these files will do the job.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really have looked!</li>
            <li>These things are absolutely stellar.  </li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>OK, but they wear out 4X faster than the thicker Tweezerman files that last for months and months.</li>
            <li>I only use it to keep jagged edges smooth, but the edge of the file is wearing away too quickly.  </li>
            <li>But these are good quality and last awhile and actually file your nails without tearing them up</li>
            <li>I have a file in pretty much every room of my house, just in case.</li>
            <li>I do keep a cheap pair of tweesers available for other family members and hide my Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers from all others.</li>
            <li>In the long run, the cheap ones cost more because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Really like these files.</li>
            <li>They really do pack a punch.</li>
            <li>5 VERY course boards.  </li>
            <li>These are similar to the cheap ones you toss after one or two uses.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>These are worth the extra dollar or two because they last twice as long and are good quality.  </li>
            <li>They grind through nail very quickly and smoothly without snagging, but they don&#x27;t produce a frayed or hard edge.  </li>
            <li>wear out pretty quickly, thinner than I expected</li>
            <li>Strong enough to use on toe nails, but gentle enough for fingernails.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Very thin, great for purse</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last forever, but unless you&#x27;re looking for something to just grind down your nails, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li>I felt ridiculous ordering nail files online, but they are so worth it!!!</li>
            <li>As some reviews mentioned one side is coarse, however, that&#x27;s exactly the point.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They will last you for a long time and do a precise job.</li>
            <li>very thin boards give way too easily to file precisely.</li>
            <li>It took me a few purchases to find a real emery board - most of them are made of plastic these days or full of glitter - seriously?</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is a brand that I trust completely for all things cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised by how durable they seem to be while being so thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a month so far.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not hard enough for my nails.</li>
            <li>Much wider than standard emory boards, and they seem to last longer as well.</li>
            <li>Very solid/sturdy, and they last a while (MUCH longer than the typical emory board).</li>
            <li>These were much thinner than expected.</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy and rough.</li>
            <li>These files leave the end of my nail tips smooth as compared to other files that tend to leave little burs that I must angle the file to remove.</li>
            <li>These files are very thin so perfect for someone with thin nails.</li>
            <li>their other products are of high quality too.</li>

            <li> It took me a few purchases to find a real emery board - most of them are made of plastic these days or full of glitter - seriously?</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a brand that I trust completely for all things cosmetic.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised by how durable they seem to be while being so thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a month so far.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not hard enough for my nails.</li>
            <li> Much wider than standard emory boards, and they seem to last longer as well.</li>
            <li> Very solid/sturdy, and they last a while (MUCH longer than the typical emory board).</li>
            <li> These were much thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy and rough.</li>
            <li> These files leave the end of my nail tips smooth as compared to other files that tend to leave little burs that I must angle the file to remove.</li>
            <li> These files are very thin so perfect for someone with thin nails.</li>
            <li> their other products are of high quality too.</li>
            <li> Not thick like typical nail files.  </li>
            <li> It does come with 5, but I expected this first one to last a little longer before needing the others.</li>
            <li> I had been having a problem lately that every nail file I purchase is not rough enough or gets filed down quickly.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> They will last a long time Thank you</li>
            <li> It seems they probably won&#x27;t last too long, but I guess that&#x27;s why you get five.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than expected, although, I couldn&#x27;t find any place that said how big they were.</li>
            <li> I searched them in every single local store and could not find them.</li>
            <li> After filing natural, short nails about 2 times there is hardly any grit left.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but way too expensive up front, and then they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the old emery boards.</li>
            <li> I prefer these nail files to any other files I bought over the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li> There are 2 grits only and the lightest is still very rough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin enough to get around corners, and last surprisingly long, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Very thin boards and the grit comes off quickly.</li>
            <li> Also I think the file would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> They are thin and not too rough, so they file really well.  </li>
            <li> Now I can leave one in a few different rooms and never be out of luck.</li>
            <li> There is not much that can be done to or with an emery board</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin enough to get around corners, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have bought some in the past that I can only use one side as the other is way too rough.</li>
            <li> and I was crushed!</li>
            <li> It will file the nail down on one side and is gentler on the other side.</li>
            <li> I will go back to them when these are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Flimsy and ineffective on thick nails.</li>
            <li> These will wear down before you get anywhere on acrylic or thicker nails.</li>
            <li> I mean, like they last one or two times.</li>
            <li> my nails are delicate and I have trouble finding emery boards that are not too coarse and not too&lt;br /&gt;delicate.  </li>
            <li> No better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Both sides are pretty coarse grain, no fine side, which is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want heavy duty like sandpaper for your nails, but they could be a little bit courser on the one side.</li>
            <li> They are not as stiff as I am used to</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t the cdescision of simplea  off ideas,  </li>
            <li> To thin snaps in half</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t produce a frayed or hard edge.</li>
            <li> The reason why it didn&#x27;t get a five stars was because it&#x27;s a little thin.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a thick or very hard emery board to them though</li>
            <li> I was afraid these might be pink, but alas, they were lavender in color.</li>
            <li> These files are thin, but they do work.  </li>
            <li> I have thin nails.</li>
            <li> Thin but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Terrible, didn&#x27;t even last 2 filings.  </li>
            <li> Very thin boards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of buying the Revlon ones that are no good anymore.</li>
            <li> I have never been unhappy with Tweezerman products .</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find files of this quality.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They clean up nail breaks or tears easily</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is a brand that I trust completely for all things cosmetic.  These emery boards are no exception.  They are the perfect weight and width to smooth down children&#x27;s and adult&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these before and they always are as represented, nail files.</li>
            <li> Very thin, great for purse</li>
            <li> This nail file does a great job!  It will file the nail down on one side and is gentler on the other side.</li>
            <li> I like these emery boards, and the color is easy to see in my purse. They are not too coarse. Good for my nails. I have bought some in the past that I can only use one side as the other is way too rough. These are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Good and strong emery boards.</li>
            <li> Great files! I bought them for home and work.</li>
            <li> These are really cool nail files! They do they job and do it with ease!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I use these. They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> these are the best emery boards i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> If you wear contacts you know how it feels to break one, after clipping your nails , use these to file your fingers to give the that smooth surface you need to clean the contacts without tearing them up</li>
            <li> It was what I got for the price</li>
            <li> Nice emery boards. They are bigger than expected, although, I couldn&#x27;t find any place that said how big they were. They are 7&amp;#34;x3/4&amp;#34;x1/6&amp;#34;. They seem like good quality and a nice combination of grits. I&#x27;m sick of buying the Revlon ones that are no good anymore.</li>
            <li> They work quickly and leave your nails smooth with no snags. They don&#x27;t produce a frayed or hard edge. They&#x27;re thin enough to get around corners, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Wife loves them. These are way better than normal cheap emery boards. I don&#x27;t even file my nails and I can tell they are better. My wife loves they way work.</li>
            <li> Best emery boards out there!</li>
            <li> These files are very thin so perfect for someone with thin nails. They don&#x27;t have a thick or very hard emery board to them though so if you have acrylic or nail gel tips, look elsewhere. These will wear down before you get anywhere on acrylic or thicker nails.</li>
            <li> These are great nail files, they don&#x27;t bend easily and are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I prefer these nail files to any other files I bought over the last 5 years.  Good  product</li>
            <li> Very thin boards and the grit comes off quickly. Cheap.</li>
            <li> I have never been unhappy with Tweezerman products . They are well made. Tweezermanhas great quality control.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to file in one direction..</li>
            <li> Will buy this product again. Great files.</li>
            <li> They work.  Nothing special.  No better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought these and I don&#x27;t like them. Both sides are pretty coarse grain, no fine side, which is worthless to me. They&#x27;re very sturdy, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last forever, but unless you&#x27;re looking for something to just grind down your nails, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> Great for filing natural nails.  I use these when filing my children&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> The best nail file I&#x27;ve ever used. They last for a looooooooooong time and I work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Really like these files. They are great for soft nails that tear easily and smooth down rough spots like magic.</li>
            <li> Much wider than standard emory boards, and they seem to last longer as well. Very high quality. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great &amp; durable. Not a fine grade file in my opinion but works perfectly for finger &amp; toenails.</li>
            <li> These were much thinner than expected. I am using them, but I will not buy them again.</li>
            <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear out as easily as others</li>
            <li> very thin boards give way too easily to file precisely.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  An emery board I won&#x27;t have to discard after one use.  I knew I would find them someplace, and good old Amazon and Tweezerman brought them to me.</li>
            <li> These files are thin, but they do work.  As some reviews mentioned one side is coarse, however, that&#x27;s exactly the point. Some emery boards are so fine and soft they are ineffective.  If you are actually interested in shaping your nails, these files will do the job.</li>
            <li> Best nail files in the world!! Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere and I was crushed! I felt ridiculous ordering nail files online, but they are so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> These files are a bit thicker than the reviews described. Very solid/sturdy, and they last a while (MUCH longer than the typical emory board). The color is nice, too.</li>
            <li> Good quality, shipped on time</li>
            <li> I had been having a problem lately that every nail file I purchase is not rough enough or gets filed down quickly. These are very sturdy and rough. They will last a long time Thank you</li>
            <li> It took me a few purchases to find a real emery board - most of them are made of plastic these days or full of glitter - seriously? But these are good quality and last awhile and actually file your nails without tearing them up</li>
            <li> just a good product will buy gain</li>
            <li> love it...shapes easy...</li>
            <li> BEst nail files I have found &amp; I really have looked!</li>
            <li> To thin snaps in half</li>
            <li> Nice medium grit on these ... not too coarse that it tears your nails, and not too fine that it just feels like a buffer ... as Goldilocks said, this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, and since Tweezerman is a reputable company that makes super tweezers, so it&#x27;s no surprise their other products are of high quality too.</li>
            <li> The reason why it didn&#x27;t get a five stars was because it&#x27;s a little thin.</li>
            <li> Good quality nail files!</li>
            <li> Best nail files. Very difficult to find files of this quality.  Only 4 stars because they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, slim nail files. They really do pack a punch. I am surprised by how durable they seem to be while being so thin.&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely gritty and get the job done, which I appreciate. I don&#x27;t want to spend all day filing my nails with something that takes forever, give me something that will do the trick quickly and efficiently and I am happy. Bam! These have got that covered.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a multi pack too since I feel like I am always looking for a nail file. Now I can leave one in a few different rooms and never be out of luck.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails. These files leave the end of my nail tips smooth as compared to other files that tend to leave little burs that I must angle the file to remove. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wow! Good stuff. I use these for my nail decals, and for smoothing my toenails. They are economical and easy to see, being bright pink. They are sturdier than normal nail files, which is great when you are not a patient person.  I have a file in pretty much every room of my house, just in case.</li>
            <li> These are OK. Not hard enough for my nails. Cant reuse them too many times...</li>
            <li> Way overpriced, but they are good.</li>
            <li> Basic emery boards. Work well. Do the job.</li>
            <li> Good product would buy again.</li>
            <li> These boards don&#x27;t break/crack when used repeatedly and the surface lasts a while, also.</li>
            <li> Cheap nail files that work. It seems they probably won&#x27;t last too long, but I guess that&#x27;s why you get five.</li>
            <li> 5 VERY course boards.  I thought I was getting 5 boards of 5 different varying grits. There are 2 grits only and the lightest is still very rough. Takes the shine right out of your nails.  ....I might use these to sand some wood though.</li>
            <li> These nail files work well. They are not as stiff as I am used to but it does not affect their functionality. I like to be able to keep one in my purse, one in my night stand, one in my desk, etc. without making a new purchase decision every time one wears out so I liked to be able to buy a bunch economically at my convenience.</li>
            <li> Affordable and do the job according to the Lady of the house, a beautiful human being that likes to keep herself in tip top shape. Enough to last a while, these Tweezerman Nail File Collection Pack of Emery Boards, 5 count, will deliver the goods each time they are used. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> great files that are sturdy and do their job.</li>
            <li> wife thinks there ok nothing special</li>
            <li> Good grit but very very flimsy! Still used them all, great for one time use only. :)</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely stellar.  They grind through nail very quickly and smoothly without snagging, but they don&#x27;t produce a frayed or hard edge.  They&#x27;re thin enough to get around corners, and last surprisingly long, especially considering the price.  I never found an emery board that works as well as this before.</li>
            <li> Much better than the neon ones, which shed their color over and under and around your nails. These lilac ones are just fine and do a great job.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite files.  They are thin and not too rough, so they file really well.  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is in line with the economy price. Would be a good choice for a guest bathroom, travel, etc.</li>
            <li> wear out pretty quickly, thinner than I expected</li>
            <li> Terrible, didn&#x27;t even last 2 filings.  After filing natural, short nails about 2 times there is hardly any grit left. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman emery boards are a pretty nice nail file. They are good for your nails for the fact that it&#x27;s not rough on the nail when you are filing, which is good. You don&#x27;t want heavy duty like sandpaper for your nails, but they could be a little bit courser on the one side. There is one smoother side and one courser side but not that course. Also I think the file would last a little longer. I gave it a 4 star because of that.</li>
            <li> Very thin boards I could have gotten the cheapest generic brand and been happier</li>
            <li> True to the standards of all Tweezerman products these boards as strong and durable with just the right grit.  Strong enough to use on toe nails, but gentle enough for fingernails.</li>
            <li> These are the best emery boards, they have the fine and the coarse, one side for each and they work perfect for&lt;br /&gt;my delicate nails.  my nails are delicate and I have trouble finding emery boards that are not too coarse and not too&lt;br /&gt;delicate.  I usually don&#x27;t the cdescision of simplea  off ideas,  I just like the idea of choosing the gift</li>
            <li> Always the best products!!!  And worth every penny! I do keep a cheap pair of tweesers available for other family members and hide my Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers from all others. I don&#x27;t want the tip to get bent or anything thing like that. Excellent for removing splinters and glass. Their other products are excellent too!!</li>
            <li> Best nail files I&#x27;ve found yet!  Perfect for filing off my Jamberry tips!</li>
            <li> totally adequate but i prefer a bit coarser grit to take off more nail more quickly.</li>
            <li> Not thick like typical nail files.  These are similar to the cheap ones you toss after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Awesome little emery boards.  I keep them in every room.  They clean up nail breaks or tears easily.</li>
            <li> Best nail files I have ever used.  Thin but sturdy.  The grit does not wear away like cheap emery boards.  These are worth the extra dollar or two because they last twice as long and are good quality.  I&#x27;ll never buy the cheaper ones again.  In the long run, the cheap ones cost more because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Great emery boards, high quality</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a month so far.  I only use it to keep jagged edges smooth, but the edge of the file is wearing away too quickly.  It does come with 5, but I expected this first one to last a little longer before needing the others.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but way too expensive up front, and then they don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the old emery boards. I mean, like they last one or two times. Won&#x27;t purchase again, though I do love the Tweezerman cuticle scissors and callous buff bar.</li>
            <li> Better than most for the price.  Sturdy.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  Just what I needed to finish my nails.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected. There is not much that can be done to or with an emery board so all I can say is that it does the job and is worth it</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. Doesn&#x27;t file well. Can&#x27;t say anything good.</li>
            <li> Good size, cute color, function very well. I was afraid these might be pink, but alas, they were lavender in color.</li>
            <li> I searched them in every single local store and could not find them. I am happy that Amazon carries them, the quality is outstanding compared to other brands. They will last you for a long time and do a precise job.</li>
            <li> Nice for fitting in handbags</li>
            <li> OK, but they wear out 4X faster than the thicker Tweezerman files that last for months and months. I will go back to them when these are gone.&lt;br /&gt;Flimsy and ineffective on thick nails.</li>
