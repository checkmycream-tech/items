            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It works amazing</li>
            <li>A great product at a fantastic price point.</li>
            <li>my feet are smooth and happy</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I have used it now for about 6 weeks</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely the best product I have ever found for the dry/cracking skin I have had on my feet.....</li>
            <li>and it softens up your feet nicely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>And though they all had their own level of successes nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>Okay, not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Eucerin was ok, but not as good as nuetrogena.</li>
            <li>We also tried the ILoveMyStruts foot creame and she liked it</li>
            <li>Effective .. tried or 2 weeks and could see the results..</li>
            <li>Effective, but just to greasy.</li>
            <li>Great refreshing and clean scent!</li>
            <li>Buy this here because it is alot cheaper and easier to find then in the store, my mother and wife swear by this stuff say it is the best on market and cant live with out it.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels good, it absorbs very quickly, I&#x27;m tempted to use it for all of me.  </li>
            <li>The smell is delicious and your skin gets very soft with this product.</li>
            <li>But, the most important thing is that it is very effective on the driest of skin, feet and heels.</li>
            <li>this is the best product that i have ever used for  my feet, it keeps them extremely soft.</li>
            <li>take a lot of abuse, and while this product won&#x27;t remove callouses or bunions, nor cure aching metatarsals, it is a wonderful product for keeping your feet feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing thus far, to happen to my feet.</li>
            <li>I find the scent is clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are a lot of good foot products available.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;m not embarrassed by my feet - great product .</li>
            <li>diabetic and foot care is very very important.</li>
            <li>Feels more like vaseline, petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more lotion consistency.</li>
            <li>Oh how I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and Amazon&#x27;s price blows away Target.</li>
            <li>, I just buy it for them , but they do love it</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li>I love this?</li>
            <li>Probably one of the better foot creams out there.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one in the stores for years.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i gave it a shot.</li>

            <li>Nothing works better for me.</li>
            <li>I was really glad to find out</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs better than the Nutrogena Hand Cream which I had been using.</li>
            <li>i love this foot cream.</li>
            <li>all, a lovely product, which I will repurchase, but you have to know when not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
            <li>It works so great and really does the job.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Awesome cream, my wife swears by it and uses it daily!</li>
            <li>Well, I am now on my third tube of this product, and cannot say how impressed I am with it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>

            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>This stuff smells better and even works better.  </li>
            <li>Ain&#x27;t satisfied though.</li>
            <li>For most of my life, I&#x27;ve neglected putting any creams or lotions on my feet which has led to dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>it will be okay.</li>
            <li>My husband stopped using it as he said it was drying his feet out more than they were.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is perfect!  </li>
            <li>I always know when I pruchase a Neutrogena product that I will probably love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it here</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even try anything else because I don&#x27;t need to any more.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Many stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon sells it on their site.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foot cream.  </li>

            <li>So glad to find it in Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Two nights after using this cream, my heels were smooth!  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many</li>
            <li>When Amazon had the Kindle special of $10 off $30 of Neutrogena products, I included the foot cream in my order, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>it is very effective and works very well...</li>
            <li>I have asthma and allergies, so part 2 may not be important to everyone, but i think part 1, product greasiness, may be very important to many people.</li>
            <li>excellent cream for dry heel skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena foot cream is the best product for dry feet.  </li>
            <li>It is the best product of its kind that I have tried and it has proven very helpful and effective against dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>Best stuff for dry heels!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used for my rough feet.</li>
            <li>this is the best product for your feet before slipping on shoes or sandals.</li>
            <li>Your feet feel very smooth and smell so fresh!  </li>
            <li>very useful product for healing the heel cracks nothing else works better.</li>
            <li>Works just okay, moisturize feet okay, but without any super results, so if you need just moisturize your feet</li>
            <li>I have tried two other products and this was the best.</li>
            <li>Amazon made it so easy to automatically send it to him</li>
            <li>SO by the next morning, your feet are nice and soft! :D</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to see it available here!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to wear socks and shoes/sneakers: fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to wear sandals with lots of straps (like my Chaco&#x27;s): fine.</li>
            <li>This product is okay on mild skin dryness condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products in many price categories without true success.  </li>
            <li>In dry winter months this works great and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer for the feet.  </li>
            <li>The used to have a different formula that was also great.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my feet looking nice.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this product would help smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>And it works great when used in conjunction with the aforementioned buffing</li>
            <li>B002BWOY6G Neutrogena Soothing Wrap Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce (</li>
            <li>, This cream is perfect, not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Keeps feet comfortably moist, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It does make my feet feel smoother, which should be the primary goal of any cream.  </li>
            <li>The search continues for a non-greasy, unscented (or lightly scented) foot cream.</li>
            <li>Foot cream leaves feet baby smooth</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit greasy to be honest, but it you put it on at night before bed, it works far better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy with this product, and I mostly refuse any other hand cream.</li>
            <li>the neutrogena foot cream is a great product the really works and the seller delivered the product as agreed and would use the seller again and highly recommend the seller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they did, as now I looked online and found it much cheaper here!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena products have never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>(if you can throw in some extra massaging time while watching tv or listening to an audiobook, your feet will love you even more!)</li>
            <li>I have two problems with the product that are very much unique to me.  </li>
            <li>I do think I have a higher sensitivity to some scents than most people, so this may not be a problem for others.  </li>
            <li>He climbs ladders and walks on concrete floors at his four hour job in mornings during the week, and then works his own business of massage the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>After applying to feet, walk across hardwood floors, then rub residue in with a clean cloth to see if NFC will work as a hardwood floor conditioning agent.]</li>
            <li>This is great for dry soles.</li>
            <li>Drug stores no longer carry the product and I was surprised and pleased that I was able to obtain it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Well because my skin is sooooo extremely dry, this product works great to hydrate my foot.  </li>
            <li>It comes in real handy after I showered after a long day of playing volleyball on the hot sand.  </li>
            <li>This is a shame as this product had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The best feature I love is that it is LONG LASTING.  </li>
            <li>Great for my dry and cracking heels!  </li>
            <li>This is great treatment for rough feet.</li>
            <li>putting this cream on and covering my feet with socks for a couple of hours did the trick...and very well it did... :)</li>
            <li>When I wake up my feet are much softer and are holding moisture better.</li>
            <li>LOVE this foot cream soooo much.</li>
            <li>The Norwegian Foot Cream is really good.</li>
            <li>love it...not oily...absorbs fast and keeps working</li>
            <li>also has a nice soft scent</li>
            <li>I now have several tubes and at a good price.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for years and its the only product which seems to do my feet any good.</li>
            <li>Ordered several and the price was fair.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that, to me, isn&#x27;t too powerful.  </li>
            <li>Designed as a treatment for the dry and cracked soles of one&#x27;s feet, this is one of the more effective products on the market.  </li>
            <li>No bad scent, just clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best heel cream ever!</li>
            <li>Nurtogena woth continued use softens the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job of softening my skin and it really does last all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this cream doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>and I go through them really quick.</li>
            <li>This foot cream does the trick for a quick smoothing to climb into bed at night or for gradual repair over time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all types of foot cream, I live in Miami so sandals are a most all year</li>
            <li>being an excellent example, that provide long lasting moisture with no greasiness.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>my favorite foot cream by far!</li>
            <li>was amazed when I used it for the first time because my feet were still moist in the morning!  </li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products, and have really dry skin on my feet and this cream works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Besides being a little pricey this foot cream is great.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not 100% better after using this, and the smell can be a little off-putting, but it IS an effective product for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a very silky and smooth foot cream.</li>
            <li>And while you can slide on a smooth floor if you get up as soon as you&#x27;ve applied it, I find it&#x27;s consistancy immediately after application is much closer to that of body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I apply twice a day in the morning and before bed and it really helps to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li>this cream is worth the price....</li>
            <li>Sure, it is greasy but the benefits far outweigh that aspect of this cream, plus you can always wash your hands.</li>
            <li>This allows the cream to be absorbed into the skin overnight.</li>
            <li>Winter and boots beg for soft feet:)</li>
            <li>unless some compelling reason.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried so many brands, but this is the ONLY one that truly keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s all absorbed and gone by the morning.  </li>
            <li>I wish this product were advertised more widely because if more people knew about it, more would use it &amp; it would be more widely distributed.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it may contain something from a similar product called \\&quot;spenol\\&quot; which was originally intended on cows udders, but now is mostly used on humans.</li>
            <li>And the scent is mild, not \\&quot;girly,\\&quot; (nor is the packaging) so even a man might be willing to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always loved this brand and the other brands I had tried</li>
            <li>The lotion makes your soles slippery, and you&#x27;ll slip right out of your mules or maybe flip flops.</li>
            <li>will finish out the bottles but do not think I will be purchasing again as I think I need to keep searching for something that was right for me.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for your feet that need help with dry, rough feet.</li>
            <li>and my feet look like normal people with just a light coating of dryness</li>
            <li>As long as your feet are nicely secured in the footwear:</li>
            <li>Other benefits are it is not greasy, it has a pleasant scent and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>In fact, the search is off, since this cream is perfect for taking care of chapped hands, elbows, and other assorted dry spots that crop up from time to time.  </li>
            <li>Having tried multiple other brands, I found none comes close to the effective results of this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Why search when you found what works and it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li>I agree, and I liked the old formula a little better.  </li>
            <li>Now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years, and I could not find a better one.  </li>
            <li>Later I found out that at Walmart the cost of four tubes would have been $14.96 instead of $19.75: each tube is $3,74 and no need to buy more than one.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time this year and it has been a hit.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like the scent!</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet soft &amp; crack free, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fixes cracked heels like this foot cream--and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  </li>
            <li>But mostly because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first heard about this,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was intrigues by the name, and I of course love the Norwegian flag, so I first got hand cream.</li>
            <li>After a couple of nights, my feet are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through most of a tube, and I have mixed feelings about it.  </li>
            <li>This product has a lot in common with Vicks Vaporub, undoubtedly because of the petrolatum (petroleum jelly, which contributes greatly to the consistency) and menthol (which contributes to the smell).  </li>
            <li>really!</li>
            <li>This is the first foot cream I have ever purchased</li>
            <li>The foot cream, hand cream and lip moisturizer all work exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>We first received a bottle from my husband&#x27;s team at St. Clare Hospital during his cancer treatment.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is a wonderful way to keep the feet free of dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li>I usually cannot stay with a routine with creams for long, so this was perfect for</li>
            <li>I found it to be nice and rich and long lasting....</li>
            <li>This lotion is very rich and is exactly what my dry feet have been thirsting for.  </li>
            <li>have previously used a Dr.Sholl (can&#x27;t spell it) cream that was amazing but could not find it</li>
            <li>Second, the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent... and really helps with the normally dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even given out some of these to friends and family members with the same problem of finding a lotion that helps with dry, cracking skin on the feet and they too loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and has a nice, thick application, which many other foot creams do not provide.  </li>
            <li>She use it before and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this foot cream</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say really, it does what it says.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this foot cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is very slippery.</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you are looking for a foot cream that really works, this is it.</li>
            <li>I really wish that Neutrogena didn&#x27;t put as much perfume in the product.</li>
            <li>It comes very close to the \\&quot;cracked heel\\&quot; with</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Just after one use your feet feel sooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li>Since this is really greasy/thick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>really like the added bonus of Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my feet very well moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have begun to depend on it so much that I begin to get nervous , if the tube is about to finish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more convenient to order through Amazon than it is to go from place to place physically and telephonically in hopes of finding the product.</li>
            <li>I tried many other formulas but none were as neutral as the Neutrogena products here.</li>
            <li>I have bought numerous products from all over, such as Avon&#x27;s foot care line (pads, scrubs, lotions), the as seen on TV miracle foot stick, the pretty feet skin remover lotion, and many others.</li>
            <li>Better than Gold Bond or any of the other Neutrogena products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>(I shop mostly at Walmart, but have looked in other stores).  </li>
            <li>I usually apply right after I shower and put my socks on, by evening my feet are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to find so very glad</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Norwegian Foot Cream is the ONLY thing that really works on my feet, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  </li>
            <li>I apply it every night before bed and my feet wake up soft and smooth, in spite of wearing sandals or open shoes every day.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but glad to find it here!</li>
            <li>The grasy feel of the initial application quickly gives way to rapid absorption.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that keeps my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This twice daily combined with a quick pumice stone scrub in the shower each morning</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>you have psorasis in the feet, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am just HAPPY to be able to find this at all, as it seems to be almost impossible to find in a any local retail stores.</li>
            <li>consistency and texture is closer to that of a rich lotion, as opposed to an ointment - Aquaphor Ointment (a severe dry skin treatment) in my view, is greasy.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this for my dry elbows, but it works great on rough feet, too!</li>
            <li>Just a small amount on each foot before bed, covered with socks, and my feet are nice and soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>will comment that the this new formula (with the red stripe across the top of the box and tube) is slightly different than the old formula (from about 5 years ago), which is a comment that some others have made.  </li>
            <li>I do have to apply it most every night, but it and a foot scraper keep my feet from getting dry enough to itch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions recommended for dry feet</li>
            <li>The second problem is very specific to those of us with allergy problems, the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li>, I do Pilates regularly, and this will make my heels slip right off the Reformer.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting on right after a shower to seal in extra moisture.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wear socks, it leaves footprints over the floor when you first put it on, only because it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li>This foot cream is absolutely as good, if not better, than any professional product &amp; at one third the price.  </li>
            <li>i put it on every night and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in Nevada and I apply this to my feet every night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>As I become an old lady, my feet need a lot of care, and Neutrogena foot cream really softens up the old hooves.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my feet very soft and moist and there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves feet very soft.</li>
            <li>The Extremely dry hot climate really takes a toll on the feet.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find in my area so thanks to Amazon for making it easily available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product but was always curious how other foot creams compare.  </li>
            <li>I love Norwegian formula from Neutrogena, not only because I am Norwegian.</li>
            <li>husband even comments on my soft feet!</li>
            <li>First the product is simply too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Soft soles!  </li>
            <li>Applied daily, my feet are smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li>A pleasure to use and my feet are very soft and comfortable with Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Feet.</li>
            <li>My feet are relatively smooth but will occasionally feel dry out of the shower or when climbing in bed at night.  </li>
            <li>This product tends to be effective in most situations during the cold Winter weather in restoring moisture to feet that are dry, but not too severely damaged</li>
            <li>I live in the hot, Dry Desert and wear Sandals about 9-10 months a year.</li>
            <li>I use many Neutrogena products and their foot cream is hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>After using this once a day for a couple weeks my feet were soft again.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow ...</li>
            <li>I dont think my feet have ever been so soft except maybe when I was an infant...</li>
            <li>It made my feet so soft.  </li>
            <li>At least, I do. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>When my companion comes to town, I can prepare by greeting him with soft hands and feet, and</li>
            <li>I am a professional pedicurist with 20 years experience.  </li>
            <li>Even heels as hideous as mine are baby soft and glowing within 2-3 nighttime treatments of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I completely swear by it.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>This is the only foot cream that I have found that REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped to prevent her feet from cracking especially around her heels.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really want to buy a four-pack, but I do use it often (especially in sandal season)</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that really works well.</li>
            <li>It did help keep my feet soft, though.</li>
            <li>this is a whole different approach for me, and it works so well</li>
            <li>Nothing but NOTHING heals dry, cracked feet, lips, elbows and fingernails like Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream--nor does it so quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d expect any decent foot cream to do the same.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s new to cold dry weather and swears this is the best thing for dry feet.</li>
            <li>Very few local outlets sell it any more in my area.</li>
            <li>Nutrpgena foot cream works like no other!  </li>
            <li>I live in southern California and the Santa Ana conditions really used to dry out the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize dry even cracked feet.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on on foot and this cream really helps ward off the dry scaly patches I am prone to.  </li>
            <li>Norwegian is the only one that really works.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Rough Feet.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with the cream on my feet, but unfortunately, to get to my feet, it must first go in my hands.  </li>
            <li>Great for maintenance after removing tough callouses, they won&#x27;t come back if used everyday.</li>
            <li>generally don&#x27;t use the product after showering in the morning because it seems counterproductive to put on socks which will wipe away the cream.  </li>
            <li>Do this regularly and your feet will be soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Reduce the dryness and roughness of my feet apparently after one week use.</li>
            <li>I am constantly walking around with out shoes and find that this cream helps me to keep my feet soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how soft my hands were from only a couple of days use.</li>
            <li>Used up old supplies and working on 2nd tube from order.  </li>
            <li>great product, impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li>and I said ya right, only for other peoples feet, not mine, mine nothing had ever worked!</li>
            <li>Very good product for really bad dry cracked feet!</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and almost did not buy this product since they wrote that this product was very greasy and slippery.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that works well and actually heals my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>I live in North Dakota, where it gets really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>only use this on my heels, and generally at night.  </li>
            <li>So, if you do activities in bare feet that require some traction, use a different lotion for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it all throughout the winter to ensure my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up like old leather.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as fast as the hand cream but is much less greasy.</li>
            <li>Previously used a lotion that was really priced.</li>
            <li>Cream is heavy but absorbs, and if used twice a day ( morning &amp; night ) you will see a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I have rough, dry feet, and find a lot of foot creams don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>I have had my feet get too soft using this product, making them a little sensitive.</li>

            <li> Was so happy to be able to order this online from Amazon as I could not locate it in any drug store and had no idea it even existed.  </li>
            <li> I once used Gold bond foot cream but after using Neutrogena I was very satisfied with its results</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used, it is excellent for dry</li>

            <li> Very good quality, my foot are happy to use it, foot&#x27; skin became soft and elastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It works amazing</li>
            <li> A great product at a fantastic price point.</li>
            <li> my feet are smooth and happy</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I have used it now for about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the best product I have ever found for the dry/cracking skin I have had on my feet.....</li>
            <li> and it softens up your feet nicely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> And though they all had their own level of successes nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Eucerin was ok, but not as good as nuetrogena.</li>
            <li> We also tried the ILoveMyStruts foot creame and she liked it</li>
            <li> Effective .. tried or 2 weeks and could see the results..</li>
            <li> Effective, but just to greasy.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing and clean scent!</li>
            <li> Buy this here because it is alot cheaper and easier to find then in the store, my mother and wife swear by this stuff say it is the best on market and cant live with out it.  </li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> It feels good, it absorbs very quickly, I&#x27;m tempted to use it for all of me.  </li>
            <li> The smell is delicious and your skin gets very soft with this product.</li>
            <li> But, the most important thing is that it is very effective on the driest of skin, feet and heels.</li>
            <li> this is the best product that i have ever used for  my feet, it keeps them extremely soft.</li>
            <li> take a lot of abuse, and while this product won&#x27;t remove callouses or bunions, nor cure aching metatarsals, it is a wonderful product for keeping your feet feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing thus far, to happen to my feet.</li>
            <li> I find the scent is clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there are a lot of good foot products available.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m not embarrassed by my feet - great product .</li>
            <li> diabetic and foot care is very very important.</li>
            <li> Feels more like vaseline, petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more lotion consistency.</li>
            <li> Oh how I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and Amazon&#x27;s price blows away Target.</li>
            <li> , I just buy it for them , but they do love it</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> I love this?</li>
            <li> Probably one of the better foot creams out there.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one in the stores for years.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I still have to exfoliate my heels every so often, but this helps keep from needing to do it more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better for me.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to find out</li>

            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs better than the Nutrogena Hand Cream which I had been using.</li>
            <li> i love this foot cream.</li>
            <li> all, a lovely product, which I will repurchase, but you have to know when not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
            <li> It works so great and really does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream, my wife swears by it and uses it daily!</li>
            <li> Well, I am now on my third tube of this product, and cannot say how impressed I am with it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> This stuff smells better and even works better.  </li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t satisfied though.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve neglected putting any creams or lotions on my feet which has led to dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> it will be okay.</li>
            <li> My husband stopped using it as he said it was drying his feet out more than they were.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is perfect!  </li>
            <li> I always know when I pruchase a Neutrogena product that I will probably love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad to find it here</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even try anything else because I don&#x27;t need to any more.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Many stores no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon sells it on their site.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> I also like being able to buy it in bulk</li>
            <li> It helps keep his feet healthy.</li>
            <li> So glad to find it in Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Two nights after using this cream, my heels were smooth!  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many</li>
            <li> When Amazon had the Kindle special of $10 off $30 of Neutrogena products, I included the foot cream in my order, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> it is very effective and works very well...</li>
            <li> I have asthma and allergies, so part 2 may not be important to everyone, but i think part 1, product greasiness, may be very important to many people.</li>
            <li> excellent cream for dry heel skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena foot cream is the best product for dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It is the best product of its kind that I have tried and it has proven very helpful and effective against dry, cracked feet.  </li>
            <li> Best stuff for dry heels!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> this is the best product for your feet before slipping on shoes or sandals.</li>
            <li> Your feet feel very smooth and smell so fresh!  </li>
            <li> very useful product for healing the heel cracks nothing else works better.</li>
            <li> Works just okay, moisturize feet okay, but without any super results, so if you need just moisturize your feet</li>
            <li> I have tried two other products and this was the best.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it so easy to automatically send it to him</li>
            <li> SO by the next morning, your feet are nice and soft! :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to see it available here!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to wear socks and shoes/sneakers: fine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to wear sandals with lots of straps (like my Chaco&#x27;s): fine.</li>
            <li> This product is okay on mild skin dryness condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products in many price categories without true success.  </li>
            <li> In dry winter months this works great and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer for the feet.  </li>
            <li> The used to have a different formula that was also great.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my feet looking nice.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this product would help smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> And it works great when used in conjunction with the aforementioned buffing</li>
            <li> B002BWOY6G Neutrogena Soothing Wrap Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce (</li>
            <li> , This cream is perfect, not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Keeps feet comfortably moist, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It does make my feet feel smoother, which should be the primary goal of any cream.  </li>
            <li> The search continues for a non-greasy, unscented (or lightly scented) foot cream.</li>
            <li> Foot cream leaves feet baby smooth</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit greasy to be honest, but it you put it on at night before bed, it works far better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy with this product, and I mostly refuse any other hand cream.</li>
            <li> the neutrogena foot cream is a great product the really works and the seller delivered the product as agreed and would use the seller again and highly recommend the seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they did, as now I looked online and found it much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products have never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> (if you can throw in some extra massaging time while watching tv or listening to an audiobook, your feet will love you even more!)</li>
            <li> I have two problems with the product that are very much unique to me.  </li>
            <li> I do think I have a higher sensitivity to some scents than most people, so this may not be a problem for others.  </li>
            <li> He climbs ladders and walks on concrete floors at his four hour job in mornings during the week, and then works his own business of massage the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> After applying to feet, walk across hardwood floors, then rub residue in with a clean cloth to see if NFC will work as a hardwood floor conditioning agent.]</li>
            <li> This is great for dry soles.</li>
            <li> Drug stores no longer carry the product and I was surprised and pleased that I was able to obtain it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Well because my skin is sooooo extremely dry, this product works great to hydrate my foot.  </li>
            <li> It comes in real handy after I showered after a long day of playing volleyball on the hot sand.  </li>
            <li> This is a shame as this product had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The best feature I love is that it is LONG LASTING.  </li>
            <li> Great for my dry and cracking heels!  </li>
            <li> This is great treatment for rough feet.</li>
            <li> putting this cream on and covering my feet with socks for a couple of hours did the trick...and very well it did... :)</li>
            <li> When I wake up my feet are much softer and are holding moisture better.</li>
            <li> LOVE this foot cream soooo much.</li>
            <li> The Norwegian Foot Cream is really good.</li>
            <li> love it...not oily...absorbs fast and keeps working</li>
            <li> also has a nice soft scent</li>
            <li> I now have several tubes and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and its the only product which seems to do my feet any good.</li>
            <li> Ordered several and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell that, to me, isn&#x27;t too powerful.  </li>
            <li> Designed as a treatment for the dry and cracked soles of one&#x27;s feet, this is one of the more effective products on the market.  </li>
            <li> No bad scent, just clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best heel cream ever!</li>
            <li> Nurtogena woth continued use softens the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also does a great job of softening my skin and it really does last all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this cream doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> and I go through them really quick.</li>
            <li> This foot cream does the trick for a quick smoothing to climb into bed at night or for gradual repair over time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all types of foot cream, I live in Miami so sandals are a most all year</li>
            <li> being an excellent example, that provide long lasting moisture with no greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li> my favorite foot cream by far!</li>
            <li> was amazed when I used it for the first time because my feet were still moist in the morning!  </li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products, and have really dry skin on my feet and this cream works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Besides being a little pricey this foot cream is great.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not 100% better after using this, and the smell can be a little off-putting, but it IS an effective product for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a very silky and smooth foot cream.</li>
            <li> And while you can slide on a smooth floor if you get up as soon as you&#x27;ve applied it, I find it&#x27;s consistancy immediately after application is much closer to that of body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I apply twice a day in the morning and before bed and it really helps to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li> this cream is worth the price....</li>
            <li> Sure, it is greasy but the benefits far outweigh that aspect of this cream, plus you can always wash your hands.</li>
            <li> This allows the cream to be absorbed into the skin overnight.</li>
            <li> Winter and boots beg for soft feet:)</li>
            <li> unless some compelling reason.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many brands, but this is the ONLY one that truly keeps my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s all absorbed and gone by the morning.  </li>
            <li> I wish this product were advertised more widely because if more people knew about it, more would use it &amp; it would be more widely distributed.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it may contain something from a similar product called \\&quot;spenol\\&quot; which was originally intended on cows udders, but now is mostly used on humans.</li>
            <li> And the scent is mild, not \\&quot;girly,\\&quot; (nor is the packaging) so even a man might be willing to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always loved this brand and the other brands I had tried</li>
            <li> The lotion makes your soles slippery, and you&#x27;ll slip right out of your mules or maybe flip flops.</li>
            <li> will finish out the bottles but do not think I will be purchasing again as I think I need to keep searching for something that was right for me.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for your feet that need help with dry, rough feet.</li>
            <li> and my feet look like normal people with just a light coating of dryness</li>
            <li> As long as your feet are nicely secured in the footwear:</li>
            <li> Other benefits are it is not greasy, it has a pleasant scent and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> In fact, the search is off, since this cream is perfect for taking care of chapped hands, elbows, and other assorted dry spots that crop up from time to time.  </li>
            <li> Having tried multiple other brands, I found none comes close to the effective results of this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Why search when you found what works and it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li> I agree, and I liked the old formula a little better.  </li>
            <li> Now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, and I could not find a better one.  </li>
            <li> Later I found out that at Walmart the cost of four tubes would have been $14.96 instead of $19.75: each tube is $3,74 and no need to buy more than one.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time this year and it has been a hit.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like the scent!</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet soft &amp; crack free, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fixes cracked heels like this foot cream--and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  </li>
            <li> But mostly because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first heard about this,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I was intrigues by the name, and I of course love the Norwegian flag, so I first got hand cream.</li>
            <li> After a couple of nights, my feet are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through most of a tube, and I have mixed feelings about it.  </li>
            <li> This product has a lot in common with Vicks Vaporub, undoubtedly because of the petrolatum (petroleum jelly, which contributes greatly to the consistency) and menthol (which contributes to the smell).  </li>
            <li> really!</li>
            <li> This is the first foot cream I have ever purchased</li>
            <li> The foot cream, hand cream and lip moisturizer all work exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> We first received a bottle from my husband&#x27;s team at St. Clare Hospital during his cancer treatment.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is a wonderful way to keep the feet free of dry, rough skin.</li>
            <li> I usually cannot stay with a routine with creams for long, so this was perfect for</li>
            <li> I found it to be nice and rich and long lasting....</li>
            <li> This lotion is very rich and is exactly what my dry feet have been thirsting for.  </li>
            <li> have previously used a Dr.Sholl (can&#x27;t spell it) cream that was amazing but could not find it</li>
            <li> Second, the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Lovely scent... and really helps with the normally dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even given out some of these to friends and family members with the same problem of finding a lotion that helps with dry, cracking skin on the feet and they too loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and has a nice, thick application, which many other foot creams do not provide.  </li>
            <li> She use it before and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say really, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is very slippery.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you are looking for a foot cream that really works, this is it.</li>
            <li> I really wish that Neutrogena didn&#x27;t put as much perfume in the product.</li>
            <li> It comes very close to the \\&quot;cracked heel\\&quot; with</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Just after one use your feet feel sooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li> Since this is really greasy/thick.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> really like the added bonus of Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my feet very well moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have begun to depend on it so much that I begin to get nervous , if the tube is about to finish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more convenient to order through Amazon than it is to go from place to place physically and telephonically in hopes of finding the product.</li>
            <li> I tried many other formulas but none were as neutral as the Neutrogena products here.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous products from all over, such as Avon&#x27;s foot care line (pads, scrubs, lotions), the as seen on TV miracle foot stick, the pretty feet skin remover lotion, and many others.</li>
            <li> Better than Gold Bond or any of the other Neutrogena products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> (I shop mostly at Walmart, but have looked in other stores).  </li>
            <li> I usually apply right after I shower and put my socks on, by evening my feet are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find so very glad</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Foot Cream is the ONLY thing that really works on my feet, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  </li>
            <li> I apply it every night before bed and my feet wake up soft and smooth, in spite of wearing sandals or open shoes every day.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but glad to find it here!</li>
            <li> The grasy feel of the initial application quickly gives way to rapid absorption.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that keeps my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This twice daily combined with a quick pumice stone scrub in the shower each morning</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> you have psorasis in the feet, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am just HAPPY to be able to find this at all, as it seems to be almost impossible to find in a any local retail stores.</li>
            <li> consistency and texture is closer to that of a rich lotion, as opposed to an ointment - Aquaphor Ointment (a severe dry skin treatment) in my view, is greasy.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this for my dry elbows, but it works great on rough feet, too!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount on each foot before bed, covered with socks, and my feet are nice and soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> will comment that the this new formula (with the red stripe across the top of the box and tube) is slightly different than the old formula (from about 5 years ago), which is a comment that some others have made.  </li>
            <li> I do have to apply it most every night, but it and a foot scraper keep my feet from getting dry enough to itch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions recommended for dry feet</li>
            <li> The second problem is very specific to those of us with allergy problems, the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li> , I do Pilates regularly, and this will make my heels slip right off the Reformer.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting on right after a shower to seal in extra moisture.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wear socks, it leaves footprints over the floor when you first put it on, only because it&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li> This foot cream is absolutely as good, if not better, than any professional product &amp; at one third the price.  </li>
            <li> i put it on every night and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in Nevada and I apply this to my feet every night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> As I become an old lady, my feet need a lot of care, and Neutrogena foot cream really softens up the old hooves.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my feet very soft and moist and there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It leaves feet very soft.</li>
            <li> The Extremely dry hot climate really takes a toll on the feet.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in my area so thanks to Amazon for making it easily available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product but was always curious how other foot creams compare.  </li>
            <li> I love Norwegian formula from Neutrogena, not only because I am Norwegian.</li>
            <li> husband even comments on my soft feet!</li>
            <li> First the product is simply too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Soft soles!  </li>
            <li> Applied daily, my feet are smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use and my feet are very soft and comfortable with Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Feet.</li>
            <li> My feet are relatively smooth but will occasionally feel dry out of the shower or when climbing in bed at night.  </li>
            <li> This product tends to be effective in most situations during the cold Winter weather in restoring moisture to feet that are dry, but not too severely damaged</li>
            <li> I live in the hot, Dry Desert and wear Sandals about 9-10 months a year.</li>
            <li> I use many Neutrogena products and their foot cream is hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> After using this once a day for a couple weeks my feet were soft again.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow ...</li>
            <li> I dont think my feet have ever been so soft except maybe when I was an infant...</li>
            <li> It made my feet so soft.  </li>
            <li> At least, I do. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> When my companion comes to town, I can prepare by greeting him with soft hands and feet, and</li>
            <li> I am a professional pedicurist with 20 years experience.  </li>
            <li> Even heels as hideous as mine are baby soft and glowing within 2-3 nighttime treatments of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I completely swear by it.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> This is the only foot cream that I have found that REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped to prevent her feet from cracking especially around her heels.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really want to buy a four-pack, but I do use it often (especially in sandal season)</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that really works well.</li>
            <li> It did help keep my feet soft, though.</li>
            <li> this is a whole different approach for me, and it works so well</li>
            <li> Nothing but NOTHING heals dry, cracked feet, lips, elbows and fingernails like Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream--nor does it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d expect any decent foot cream to do the same.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s new to cold dry weather and swears this is the best thing for dry feet.</li>
            <li> Very few local outlets sell it any more in my area.</li>
            <li> Nutrpgena foot cream works like no other!  </li>
            <li> I live in southern California and the Santa Ana conditions really used to dry out the heels of my feet.</li>
            <li> It really does moisturize dry even cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on on foot and this cream really helps ward off the dry scaly patches I am prone to.  </li>
            <li> Norwegian is the only one that really works.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Rough Feet.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with the cream on my feet, but unfortunately, to get to my feet, it must first go in my hands.  </li>
            <li> Great for maintenance after removing tough callouses, they won&#x27;t come back if used everyday.</li>
            <li> generally don&#x27;t use the product after showering in the morning because it seems counterproductive to put on socks which will wipe away the cream.  </li>
            <li> Do this regularly and your feet will be soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Reduce the dryness and roughness of my feet apparently after one week use.</li>
            <li> I am constantly walking around with out shoes and find that this cream helps me to keep my feet soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how soft my hands were from only a couple of days use.</li>
            <li> Used up old supplies and working on 2nd tube from order.  </li>
            <li> great product, impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> and I said ya right, only for other peoples feet, not mine, mine nothing had ever worked!</li>
            <li> Very good product for really bad dry cracked feet!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and almost did not buy this product since they wrote that this product was very greasy and slippery.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works well and actually heals my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> I live in North Dakota, where it gets really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> only use this on my heels, and generally at night.  </li>
            <li> So, if you do activities in bare feet that require some traction, use a different lotion for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it all throughout the winter to ensure my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up like old leather.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as fast as the hand cream but is much less greasy.</li>
            <li> Previously used a lotion that was really priced.</li>
            <li> Cream is heavy but absorbs, and if used twice a day ( morning &amp; night ) you will see a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I have rough, dry feet, and find a lot of foot creams don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> I have had my feet get too soft using this product, making them a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> My husband gets cracked feet if he doesn&#x27;t consistently use this and there are only a few other brands out there that work.</li>
            <li> Tried different foot creams for my dry heels, and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Amazon do not allow multiple orders of the 4 pack in a single transaction so you have to order multiple times or it shows as out of stock.</li>
            <li> Again, at night, I usually grease up my feet really well, put on my night socks, and go to bed.</li>
            <li> only thing plus daily pumice that keeps my very dry heels/feet</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, soaks into the skin well without being greasy, and works instantly to smooth rough skin.</li>
            <li> It does a terrific job getting rid of my dry skin problem with my feet.</li>
            <li> As someone who is constantly outdoors and has an addiction to flip-flops, I have constantly dry and flaky heels and hideous lumpy callouses.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry heels on both feet and actually thought that I had a Heel Spur because of the pain.  </li>
            <li> My wife has dry feet, especially around her heels.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your feet very soft in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have very dry feet, especially in the heel area</li>
            <li> As long as this product is on the shelf I will be buying it.</li>
            <li> You can feel how moisturizing and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so I figured I save a bit in the long run.</li>
            <li> big relief for rough skin</li>

            <li> My feet were dry and had started peeling.</li>

            <li> works on my dry heels and my corns as well...</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount so a tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this, as it seems kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I expect this 4 pack to last me about a year.</li>
            <li> She has a dry rough foot in winter.</li>
            <li> They were dry and cracked, rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have dry, rough heels</li>
            <li> Walking 12 hours every day in heavy boots, his feet are very painful and the skin is very hard, but now his feet look very healthy and very soft, thanks for Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> My feet became very dry a couple of years ago</li>
            <li> my feet tend to be very dry...</li>
            <li> During the winter months, my feet tend to get very dry, probably because they are always covered by shoes and socks.  </li>
            <li> I only have to file the rough skin off of my feet half of the time because of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This cream has definitely helped soften my heels a little.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could purchase them from only one source on Amazon; it would make life a little easier.</li>
            <li> If you are at all worried about slipping, put it on just before climbing into bed.  </li>
            <li> how well it softens rough feet.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both use it for our rough feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy and slipper; wear socks after you put this on, otherwise you&#x27;ll be slipping everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that for some reason I don&#x27;t have as much trouble with athlete&#x27;s foot between my toes if I use this regularly at night.</li>
            <li> have brought my feet back from the dead.</li>
            <li> Thus, I don&#x27;t have any problems with slipping</li>
            <li> I did not really notice a smell.</li>
            <li> That avoids any &#x27;slipping and sliding in shoes&#x27;, which some comments indicate.  </li>
            <li> As a result my feet get really dry to the point of slight peeling.</li>
            <li> You really do only need to use a little bit!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need it every day, I find I use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used other products but none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not greasy like a lot of other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for hands and feet due to winter drying of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other foot cream since.</li>
            <li> Well, my feet now looks like I just left the salon everyday!</li>
            <li> This is not like other Neutrogena products, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because the package is so small.</li>
            <li> However, Neutrogena has a couple of drawbacks which makes it suffer in comparison to other foot creams.  </li>
            <li> I had it in my drawer for like a year without using it because I got a gift and started using the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> In other words he stands all day at what he does.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every other day and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> tried a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> If  you get cracked skin on your feet in cold, dry weather, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works and doesn&#x27;t mess up your clothing like vaseline.</li>
            <li> I had very rough heels, and no pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the manufacturer seems incapable of making it widely available in stores, at least in my locale.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but recently I have had a hard time finding it on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep in socks, drives me crazy, so they come off right before I fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as Eucerin :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A small amount covers a large area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Less expensive than other options</li>
            <li> The odor is not very strong, which I also like.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy feeling, and I imagine it is slippery if you wear shoes without socks immediately after application, but I just put it on at bedtime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have also tried it on a spot of eczema that refused to heal for over six months and in less than a week it&#x27;s almost gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a slight fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The tube has shrunk......</li>
            <li> It is penetrating and not super greasy.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had a sever problem of psorasis in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active at the gym, play tennis, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never seen Neutrogena with any of my fishermen family members, so I knew THAT was not true.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback because the label read like a chemical factory.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and saw little improvement.</li>
            <li> Bought a pack of 4 and used it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you were to use this on a part of your foot that sweats at the beginning of the day, you might have trouble keeping backless sandals or clogs on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to find this on store shelves, so I order it here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think my feet are that bad, but the product is not making much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find Neutrogena Foot Cream in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> the past month, I&#x27;ve followed an evening ritual of using this cream when I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> not help excessive dryness</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because the sizes too small for the price</li>
            <li> , it is difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I wish now I would have, because unless you know me and have seen my feet in the past, you might not believe it.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount each time does the job.</li>
            <li> The Foot cream is a little bit greasy, but that&#x27;s a very small consession for something that works this well.     </li>
            <li> This lotion is 3-4 as thin as the other product.</li>
            <li> have been looking all over in various stores where I live, and could no longer buy it...sooooooo sad!!!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately that also creates dry feet</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee was a failure (and very messy).</li>
            <li> As the seasons chane the skin on my foot becomes crusty and hard,  </li>
            <li> This item is hard to find at stores</li>
            <li> I often look in drugstores for this item but it is often hard to find.</li>
            <li> After few days, it improved my husband very thick and hard skin on his feet.</li>
            <li> at least not on my feet.</li>
            <li> Having a rough place on my foot feel scratchy on my sheets is the absolute worst!  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what this did for me.  </li>
            <li> Its not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, thick, soothing, and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping to slowly close them up.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible feet all my adult life with callouses that were always 1/4 inch thick and deep cracks that would sometimes bleed and hurt.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount every evening, and then wear a thin bed time sock.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several of my friends with terrible, dry, caloused feet and they have all seen improvement.  </li>
            <li> My heels are so bad, I bought 4 tubes and plan on continuing to use it for a long time, maybe forever.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The cream is very moisturizing but the scent is absolutely disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Without it, my poor feet would be a cracked and peeling disaster.</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted.  </li>
            <li> It has revived my tired achy feet and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the package is very small and I have to buy them four at a time.  </li>
            <li> I could get this foot cream again--I have been trying at every store here in town and had been unable to do so.  </li>
            <li> cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Foot Cream, specifically, has proven difficult to find in my residence area.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has not made my feet any softer.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I&#x27;m creating waste each month.</li>
            <li> You can NOT go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Please try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> and my husband suffers from sever cracked skin that eventually results in bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a terrible problem with scaly, rough heels but Neutrogena Foot Cream works wonders!!!!  </li>
            <li> I used to use a very expensive product to soften my feet that comes from a shop.  </li>
            <li> I am as bad with applying stuff on my feet as I am with my hands, so this is a god sent.</li>
            <li> Forget about removing the bad stuff</li>
            <li> so I am not so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was so disappointed that I could no longer find it.</li>
            <li> This is not a problem in the winter time when I&#x27;m wearing socks, but in the summer, it&#x27;s very unpleasant when my feet squish-squish in my work shoes.  </li>
            <li> It was 30.00 and smelled horrible.  </li>

            <li> This is wonderful for the feet.  My feet became very dry a couple of years ago and I tried a couple of things that were supposed to help, but Neutrogena Foot Cream is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  I recommend it to anyone who mentions having problems with dryness on the feet.  It&#x27;s also a good night moisturizer for your lips.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever tried and have been using this brand for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> the best cream  for feet and  hands  for the  dry skin of my mother because of chemotherapy that she received</li>
            <li> this cream is worth the price....it is very effective and works very well...my feet tend to be very dry...putting this cream on and covering my feet with socks for a couple of hours did the trick...and very well it did... :)</li>
            <li> Feels more like vaseline, petroleum jelly. I prefer a more lotion consistency.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t for me.  It&#x27;s for my Father in Law.  Amazon made it so easy to automatically send it to him so he doesn&#x27;t run out.  He swears by this brand of foot cream.</li>
            <li> Very good product for really bad dry cracked feet!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for dry heels! Great for maintenance after removing tough callouses, they won&#x27;t come back if used everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the very best foot cream on the market. I have tried others, but nothing compares. This &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; your cracked heels!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, slippery w/o socks</li>
            <li> Oh how I love this stuff. Yet another product they don&#x27;t sell here anymore. It&#x27;s one of the best foot creams out there though. It goes on a bit greasy to be honest, but it you put it on at night before bed, it works far better. If you put it on after a shower, put it on before you put on your tights or socks. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. My feet have never been softer, and the cracks on my heel smoothed out in no time.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sister. She has a dry rough foot in winter. She use it before and it works very well. Thanks, Amaon, for the good price for this good product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and Amazon&#x27;s price blows away Target. A little goes a long way, I expect this 4 pack to last me about a year. I put it on my feet and ankles generously before bed and then throw a pair of socks on. I can&#x27;t sleep in socks, drives me crazy, so they come off right before I fall asleep. If you don&#x27;t wear socks, it leaves footprints over the floor when you first put it on, only because it&#x27;s nice and thick and I&#x27;d expect any decent foot cream to do the same.</li>
            <li> Nutrpgena foot cream works like no other!  As the seasons chane the skin on my foot becomes crusty and hard,  Nurtogena woth continued use softens the skin quickly.  I heartily recommend ir</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is a wonderful way to keep the feet free of dry, rough skin. Applied daily, my feet are smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> I used this product after spending a week on the beach, barefoot. My feet were dry and had started peeling. After using this once a day for a couple weeks my feet were soft again. I have had my feet get too soft using this product, making them a little sensitive. Who knew that was possible? Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I live in North Dakota, where it gets really dry in the winter. As a result my feet get really dry to the point of slight peeling. I put this cream on at night before I go to bed, and put socks over it. I don&#x27;t even need it every day, I find I use it about every other day. When I wake up my feet are much softer and are holding moisture better. Sure, it is greasy but the benefits far outweigh that aspect of this cream, plus you can always wash your hands. As for the scent that others are complaining about, that goes away after a while. As long as this product is on the shelf I will be buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer for the feet.  Best to use just before bedtime so you wake up with moisturized feet and avoid unsightly cracks.  Amazon do not allow multiple orders of the 4 pack in a single transaction so you have to order multiple times or it shows as out of stock.</li>
            <li> Buy this here because it is alot cheaper and easier to find then in the store, my mother and wife swear by this stuff say it is the best on market and cant live with out it.  hope that helps  you out, I just buy it for them , but they do love it</li>
            <li> very useful product for healing the heel cracks nothing else works better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foot cream because I could not find the Neutrogena Cracked Heel Cream I used to buy. This lotion is 3-4 as thin as the other product. They have added scent to this as well. Being a man, I don&#x27;t need the lady stink...at least not on my feet.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. Did I tell you I love this?</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the best product I have ever found for the dry/cracking skin I have had on my feet.....Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Besides being a little pricey this foot cream is great. Its not runny or too thick. Its very nice and isn&#x27;t greasy. Once its on it soaks in and isn&#x27;t getting all over the place. I really like this foot cream and it softens up your feet nicely. I use it after I soak my feet.</li>
            <li> This really is terrific foot cream.  If you are at all worried about slipping, put it on just before climbing into bed.  It&#x27;s amazing how well it softens rough feet.  I highly recommend it.  Four tubes is a lot for me, so I gave one to a friend, and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the better foot creams out there.  My husband gets cracked feet if he doesn&#x27;t consistently use this and there are only a few other brands out there that work. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this one in the stores for years.  The Neutrogena hand cream also works wonders with chronic dry feet.</li>
            <li> Nothing has moisturized my dry, cracked feet like this has. They used to crack until they would bleed. Now they are soft and smooth. This is the best product I have found for my feet.</li>
            <li> the neutrogena foot cream is a great product the really works and the seller delivered the product as agreed and would use the seller again and highly recommend the seller</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this foot cream soooo much. It works amazing u have no idea!!!! I&#x27;m glad i gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and foot care is very very important. The Norwegian Foot Cream is really good. It is best used before going to bed at night. Apply it, put on a pair of socks and go to sleep. This allows the cream to be absorbed into the skin overnight. Do this regularly and your feet will be soft and supple. Other benefits are it is not greasy, it has a pleasant scent and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does a terrific job getting rid of my dry skin problem with my feet. It&#x27;s also inexpensive. So there is no reason not to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all: Dr. Scholl&#x27;s (Scholl&#x27;s Cracked Skin Repair Cream is wonderful, but not as good as Neutrogena), Miracle Foot Repair, Udderly Smooth, every name brand.  Nothing but NOTHING heals dry, cracked feet, lips, elbows and fingernails like Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream--nor does it so quickly.  People complain it&#x27;s \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;--but the cream does not transfer to floors when you walk if you let it absorb a couple minutes or follow its application with a pair of socks for five minutes.  Shower, apply cream to mummified areas of your body, wear socks if needed and all the discomfort, cracking, bleeding, scabbing and attempts to heal same are history.</li>
            <li> Tried different foot creams for my dry heels, and always come back to this one. I still have to exfoliate my heels every so often, but this helps keep from needing to do it more. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love it!  I think it is the best foot cream ever and have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love it. Nothing works better for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s not easy to find in the drug stores, so I was very happy to see it available here!  Winter and boots beg for soft feet:)</li>
            <li> Reduce the dryness and roughness of my feet apparently after one week use. Very good for me. The only shortcoming is too greasy.</li>
            <li> order it all the time.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a very silky and smooth foot cream. After few days, it improved my husband very thick and hard skin on his feet. Walking 12 hours every day in heavy boots, his feet are very painful and the skin is very hard, but now his feet look very healthy and very soft, thanks for Neutrogena. I have been using this product for several years, and I could not find a better one.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow ... I dont think my feet have ever been so soft except maybe when I was an infant...</li>
            <li> will like to buy it again</li>
            <li> this is the best product that i have ever used for  my feet, it keeps them extremely soft. I have been using it for a number of years now and nothing else seems to work. I have used other products but none have worked as well as this one. Some stores have stopped selling it, so i have to order on line. love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was really glad to find out I could get this foot cream again--I have been trying at every store here in town and had been unable to do so.  I have always loved this brand and the other brands I had tried just were not the same.  Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.  The used to have a different formula that was also great. I use this after pedicures and it make my feet feel awesome for weeks!  This is the second order I placed and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> This product does a good job. I do have to apply it most every night, but it and a foot scraper keep my feet from getting dry enough to itch.  It is slightly greasy feeling, and I imagine it is slippery if you wear shoes without socks immediately after application, but I just put it on at bedtime. It rubs in well enough that it does not seem to stain the sheets. It does work well enough that you don&#x27;t have to apply as much of it as other foot creams that I have tried. The odor is not very strong, which I also like.  I was paying over $7 a tube at wally world and they recently quit carrying it. I&#x27;m glad they did, as now I looked online and found it much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this foot cream on Amazon -- have been looking all over in various stores where I live, and could no longer buy it...sooooooo sad!!! Have been using it for a number of years and it does work wonderfully..since I am a diabetic, and our feet have to be maintained properly, I truly believe in this product.. thank you Neutrogena..&lt;br /&gt;P.S. also purchased it for my neighbor who has been searching for it too, and is a diabetic...she swears by it too...[[ASIN:B001E96OCO Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Rough Feet, 2 Ounce (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product. Been using it for years. Nothing much to say really, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, and I could not find an equal to this product.  I feel the price could be lower, but I understand, if the demand is there, the price is going nowhere but up.  Overall it is a product that I would recommend, when the opportunity arises.  An excellent product.    James Lewis</li>
            <li> Bought a pack of 4 and used it everyday. Did not notice any improvement after using it on a daily basis. I will look for a better option. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used.  My husband and I both use it for our rough feet.  It is very thick and creamy, soaks into the skin well without being greasy, and works instantly to smooth rough skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever used, it is excellent for dry heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually Amazon prices are good, so I placed my order without checking.  Later I found out that at Walmart the cost of four tubes would have been $14.96 instead of $19.75: each tube is $3,74 and no need to buy more than one.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I purchase this cream and I still love it. It really does moisturize dry even cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I have very dry feet, especially in the heel area and I have tried many products.  Neutrogena products have never disappointed me.  I loved this product from the moment I used it.  It made my feet so soft.  I would recommend this to anyone who has really dry feet and heels.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find Neutrogena Foot Cream in any of my local stores. Happily I found it on Amazon.  It is the best foot cream ever! It softens dry heels and foot skin. Easy to use, a little goes a long way.  Having tried multiple other brands, I found none comes close to the effective results of this amazing product. [[ASIN:B001E96OCO Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Rough Feet, 2 Ounce (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena foot, hand and facial cream for over 20 years. Absolutely the best. Love it.</li>
            <li> great product, impossible to find locally. must have for heel cracking, works great. Can&#x27;t do without, bought four tubes to last for awhile.</li>
            <li> using this on my feet and a scar that is healing and my shins this winter - nothing is drying out and I&#x27;m keeping the itchy dry skin at bay...love it...not oily...absorbs fast and keeps working</li>
            <li> During the winter months, my feet tend to get very dry, probably because they are always covered by shoes and socks.  I tried this for the first time this year and it has been a hit.  It absorbs better than the Nutrogena Hand Cream which I had been using.</li>
            <li> i love this foot cream. it is the best. cant go wrong for the price. also has a nice soft scent</li>
            <li> This cream is great! You really do only need to use a little bit! I have eczema on on foot and this cream really helps ward off the dry scaly patches I am prone to.  It also does a great job of softening my skin and it really does last all day.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy like a lot of other creams I have tried. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this cream is very good for my foot, it makes them feel relaxed and moisturized...</li>
            <li> Great product! almost odorless. Just what the doctor ordered for my worn out, beat up feet. I tried many other formulas but none were as neutral as the Neutrogena products here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product but was always curious how other foot creams compare.  I have always come back to this and will remain with it unless some compelling reason.  The best feature I love is that it is LONG LASTING.  I don&#x27;t have to use it daily.  I use it every 3-4 days.  I&#x27;m very active at the gym, play tennis, etc. and this cream doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this foot cream for years but have been having difficulty finding it. I now have several tubes and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for hands and feet due to winter drying of my skin. This is the only thing that works well and actually heals my skin back to normal. I use it all throughout the winter to ensure my skin doesn&#x27;t dry up like old leather.</li>
            <li> When I use it, the products works great.  The only thing I dislike is the scent - it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing, thick, soothing, and it smells heavenly. I really, really like the scent! So, basically, it does what it says it will do, and it makes your feel smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is very slippery. If you&#x27;re going to wear socks and shoes/sneakers: fine. If you&#x27;re going to wear sandals with lots of straps (like my Chaco&#x27;s): fine. As long as your feet are nicely secured in the footwear: fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like open back styles, like mules or clogs, beware. The lotion makes your soles slippery, and you&#x27;ll slip right out of your mules or maybe flip flops. At least, I do. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do Pilates regularly, and this will make my heels slip right off the Reformer. So, if you do activities in bare feet that require some traction, use a different lotion for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a lovely product, which I will repurchase, but you have to know when not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended by my manicurist years ago. I have not used any other foot cream since. I apply it every night before bed and my feet wake up soft and smooth, in spite of wearing sandals or open shoes every day. I go through a lot of cream, so I&#x27;ve been buying them through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save so that I&#x27;m never out of this miracle product.</li>
            <li> I have used this products for years on my feet during the winter months. It works so great and really does the job.</li>
            <li> When Amazon had the Kindle special of $10 off $30 of Neutrogena products, I included the foot cream in my order, and boy am I glad I did!  We&#x27;ve been passing the tubes around the house and the votes are in.  It&#x27;s a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feet take a lot of abuse, and while this product won&#x27;t remove callouses or bunions, nor cure aching metatarsals, it is a wonderful product for keeping your feet feeling soft.  In the search for maintaining my feet - for comfort (well, maybe I&#x27;ll admit to a wee bit of vanity as well) -  I&#x27;ve tried many products in many price categories without true success.  But with Neutrogena Foot Cream, my search for a great foot cream may be over.  In fact, the search is off, since this cream is perfect for taking care of chapped hands, elbows, and other assorted dry spots that crop up from time to time.  And the scent is mild, not \\&quot;girly,\\&quot; (nor is the packaging) so even a man might be willing to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also tried it on a spot of eczema that refused to heal for over six months and in less than a week it&#x27;s almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some reviewers have called it \\&quot;greasy,\\&quot; in my opinion it&#x27;s consistency and texture is closer to that of a rich lotion, as opposed to an ointment - Aquaphor Ointment (a severe dry skin treatment) in my view, is greasy.  Neutrogena Foot Cream isn&#x27;t.  And while you can slide on a smooth floor if you get up as soon as you&#x27;ve applied it, I find it&#x27;s consistancy immediately after application is much closer to that of body lotion.  [Note to Self re Multi-tasking - After applying to feet, walk across hardwood floors, then rub residue in with a clean cloth to see if NFC will work as a hardwood floor conditioning agent.]</li>
            <li> One of the best creams I&#x27;ve found!  It keeps my feet soft &amp; crack free, even in the winter.  Hard to find, but glad to find it here!</li>
            <li> Nothing fixes cracked heels like this foot cream--and I&#x27;ve tried many different products.  It has a light pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> If  you get cracked skin on your feet in cold, dry weather, this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works and doesn&#x27;t mess up your clothing like vaseline. Very few local outlets sell it any more in my area.</li>
            <li> I am constantly walking around with out shoes and find that this cream helps me to keep my feet soft and hydrated. The grasy feel of the initial application quickly gives way to rapid absorption.</li>
            <li> I remember this as being richer and longer lasting.  After this batch is used up, I think I will try petroleum jelly and compare.</li>
            <li> Worked where the 2 prescriptions from my dermatologist did not work.  First time I&#x27;m not embarrassed by my feet - great product .</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that keeps my feet soft and smooth.  I have a terrible problem with scaly, rough heels but Neutrogena Foot Cream works wonders!!!!  Ladies, if you are looking for a foot cream that really works, this is it.</li>
            <li> My feet are no longer an eyesore. They were dry and cracked, rough to the touch. Not anymore. I noticed a difference after several days.</li>
            <li> I love Norwegian formula from Neutrogena, not only because I am Norwegian. But mostly because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first heard about this, I though \\&quot;what a joke.\\&quot;  I&#x27;d never seen Neutrogena with any of my fishermen family members, so I knew THAT was not true. I suspect it may contain something from a similar product called \\&quot;spenol\\&quot; which was originally intended on cows udders, but now is mostly used on humans. Fishermen MAY have used that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was intrigues by the name, and I of course love the Norwegian flag, so I first got hand cream. I was amazed how soft my hands were from only a couple of days use. I got gloves to wear at night, and before bed, I greased up my hands, put on gloves and went to bed. I usually cannot stay with a routine with creams for long, so this was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely happy with this product, and I mostly refuse any other hand cream. When I saw the foot cream, I got it immediately. Again, at night, I usually grease up my feet really well, put on my night socks, and go to bed. After a couple of nights, my feet are soft and smooth. I am as bad with applying stuff on my feet as I am with my hands, so this is a god sent. When my companion comes to town, I can prepare by greeting him with soft hands and feet, and all I need to do, is start using it 3-4 days before he arrives, depending on how chapped my feet are.  I really love this product!  Would definitely recommend it for both daily moisturiser and emergency care product.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Unbelievable relief for your eczema! Never thought I&#x27;d find something that actually worked. Been using it for twice a day for 5 days, and the difference is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A small amount covers a large area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Less expensive than other options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy and slipper; wear socks after you put this on, otherwise you&#x27;ll be slipping everywhere.</li>
            <li> I miss this foot cream when I run out. It&#x27;s the best thing thus far, to happen to my feet.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It is the best foot cream I know. The smell is delicious and your skin gets very soft with this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome cream, my wife swears by it and uses it daily!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, my foot are happy to use it, foot&#x27; skin became soft and elastic. Very glad to buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. You can feel how moisturizing and how long it lasts. It helps with the deep cracks in my heels that i have had forever and it&#x27;s helping to slowly close them up. Won&#x27;t use anything else. I have bought numerous products from all over, such as Avon&#x27;s foot care line (pads, scrubs, lotions), the as seen on TV miracle foot stick, the pretty feet skin remover lotion, and many others. And though they all had their own level of successes nothing compares to this. What I like about it is that it feels good on your hands too. I recommend putting on right after a shower to seal in extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Used it immediately and my saw immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on my arms too and helped with the winter skin!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my rough feet. I apply twice a day in the morning and before bed and it really helps to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry and cracking heels!  I recommend the Neutogena foot cream for anyone who have the same issue</li>
            <li> I live in southern California and the Santa Ana conditions really used to dry out the heels of my feet. I started using this by chance years ago and haven&#x27;t had a cracked heel since. It is hard to find in my area so thanks to Amazon for making it easily available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing plus daily pumice that keeps my very dry heels/feet smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My husband even comments on my soft feet!</li>
            <li> I am a professional pedicurist with 20 years experience.  This foot cream is absolutely as good, if not better, than any professional product &amp; at one third the price.  A great product at a fantastic price point.</li>
            <li> Designed as a treatment for the dry and cracked soles of one&#x27;s feet, this is one of the more effective products on the market.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer seems incapable of making it widely available in stores, at least in my locale.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot, Dry Desert and wear Sandals about 9-10 months a year. The Extremely dry hot climate really takes a toll on the feet.  Well, I am now on my third tube of this product, and cannot say how impressed I am with it&#x27;s effectiveness. I use a small amount every evening, and then wear a thin bed time sock. The Foot cream is a little bit greasy, but that&#x27;s a very small consession for something that works this well.     Well, my feet now looks like I just left the salon everyday! They look and feel perfect!  I am no longer using a foot file, pumice stone, ped Egg, ect..... no need.  All I can say, is that I am now hooked for good on this stuff!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many brands, but this is the ONLY one that truly keeps my feet smooth. i put it on every night and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really keeps my feet looking nice. I&#x27;ve also found that for some reason I don&#x27;t have as much trouble with athlete&#x27;s foot between my toes if I use this regularly at night.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is the best, Ive used this for many years, I use it on my hands and elbows, knees and feet. Its not just for feet and the healing is overnight. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of butters and lotions and creams, when it comes to healing this is the only thing I can trust to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream! It has done wonders for my dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> My feet feel wonderful with this product</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I was able to get it at a great price and it came in the time that it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> I used to use a very expensive product to soften my feet that comes from a shop.  It was 30.00 and smelled horrible.  This stuff smells better and even works better.  Great price on this too.  It&#x27;s a little hard to find this on store shelves, so I order it here.</li>
            <li> Just a drop, makes your foot feel so good.  Wish it came in a bigger tube though.</li>
            <li> After a winter of dry feet and no pedicures, my heels were paying the price.  This twice daily combined with a quick pumice stone scrub in the shower each morning have brought my feet back from the dead.</li>
            <li> As someone who is constantly outdoors and has an addiction to flip-flops, I have constantly dry and flaky heels and hideous lumpy callouses. Let me tell you that I have tried everything, and nothing compares to the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula foot cream. I&#x27;ve seen others complaining about the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; but follow my lead and it won&#x27;t be an issue - use the cream at night before bed (if you can throw in some extra massaging time while watching tv or listening to an audiobook, your feet will love you even more!) then pop on a pair of cotton socks and off to sleepy land. Even heels as hideous as mine are baby soft and glowing within 2-3 nighttime treatments of this stuff. I completely swear by it. And best of all, it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> This product is okay on mild skin dryness condition. Used it on. My husband&#x27;s heels. Ain&#x27;t satisfied though. Not as strong as Eucerin :(</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry heels on both feet and actually thought that I had a Heel Spur because of the pain.  I started using this every day and it works perfectly.  My heels are so bad, I bought 4 tubes and plan on continuing to use it for a long time, maybe forever.</li>
            <li> Te best product for your feet, ever.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve neglected putting any creams or lotions on my feet which has led to dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;In the past month, I&#x27;ve followed an evening ritual of using this cream when I go to bed.  The results have been great.  The dryness and cracking are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally don&#x27;t use the product after showering in the morning because it seems counterproductive to put on socks which will wipe away the cream.  1x a night seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry soles. It doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as fast as the hand cream but is much less greasy.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to be able to order this online from Amazon as I could not locate it in any drug store and had no idea it even existed.  It is the best product of its kind that I have tried and it has proven very helpful and effective against dry, cracked feet.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted.  Neutrogena Foot Cream, specifically, has proven difficult to find in my residence area.  It&#x27;s far more convenient to order through Amazon than it is to go from place to place physically and telephonically in hopes of finding the product. I&#x27;m sure that there are a lot of good foot products available. I like Neutrogena&#x27;s product and would recommend it if asked.</li>
            <li> This product tends to be effective in most situations during the cold Winter weather in restoring moisture to feet that are dry, but not too severely damaged</li>
            <li> The local stores cannot keep this self on the shelf. Was delighted to see it on Amazon! We love it.</li>
            <li> I found this foot cream while traveling in Europe. It is very hard to find. It is excellent for your feet that need help with dry, rough feet. I have tried many products, but I like this one the best. No bad scent, just clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> my favorite foot cream by far! pricy at thedrug store but found a four pack on Amazon!! my feet are smooth and happy</li>
            <li> Only for cream that softens my feet, closes cracks and removes callouses in one night!</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever found</li>
            <li> I have found this Neutrogena foot cream to be the best I have ever used. Drug stores no longer carry the product and I was surprised and pleased that I was able to obtain it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use and my feet are very soft and comfortable with Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Feet.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price or the results. Previously used a lotion that was really priced. This is a reall good BUY.</li>
            <li> I have dry, rough heels and I was hoping this product would help smooth them out.  I&#x27;ve been through most of a tube, and I have mixed feelings about it.  I&#x27;m going to list the ingredients, because some of them definitely affect my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Cyclomethicone, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Keratin Amino Acids, Menthol, Allantoin, Dilauryl Thiodipropionate, Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Linoleate, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, be prepared for the smell.  This product has a lot in common with Vicks Vaporub, undoubtedly because of the petrolatum (petroleum jelly, which contributes greatly to the consistency) and menthol (which contributes to the smell).  Menthol may provide something of a cooling sensation, if you&#x27;re looking for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to keratin amino acids, please note that keratin is a protein formed only by animals (it&#x27;s in hair, nails, skin, hooves, feathers, etc.), so if you are a vegan or are trying to avoid animal-derived products, you will want to stay away from this product.  As you can see, it does also contain parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this on my heels, and generally at night.  I put on socks afterwards.  Thus, I don&#x27;t have any problems with slipping as it&#x27;s all absorbed and gone by the morning.  If you were to use this on a part of your foot that sweats at the beginning of the day, you might have trouble keeping backless sandals or clogs on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has definitely helped soften my heels a little.  It doesn&#x27;t help the roughest parts of my skin -- for that, I need a buffing pad -- but it does soften my heels somewhat.  And it works great when used in conjunction with the aforementioned buffing pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I&#x27;m not 100% better after using this, and the smell can be a little off-putting, but it IS an effective product for my purposes.  This is a 3.5 star product for me.poses.  This is a 3.5 star product for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves your feet very soft in a few days. I recommend it to all my friends. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product I no longer have cracked and bleeding hands this winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried two other products and this was the best. My feet are not chapped anymore. Burt&#x27;s Bee was a failure (and very messy). Eucerin was ok, but not as good as nuetrogena.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very rich and is exactly what my dry feet have been thirsting for.  I find the scent is clean and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my boyfriend. He&#x27;s new to cold dry weather and swears this is the best thing for dry feet. Better than Gold Bond or any of the other Neutrogena products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Only cream that heals my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been happier, or softer.  Also a wonderful product for chapped lips, ashy elbows, knees and a great hand moisterizer.  I use it for dryness all over....really!</li>
            <li> This is the first foot cream I have ever purchased and I have used an entire bottle, applying it faithfully to my feet every night.  Unfortunately, it has not made my feet any softer.  I woke up every morning with my feet in the same condition it was before I had applied the Neutrogena Foot Cream.  This is a personal preference but I also was not a fan of the scent, I think it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.  I just tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut Foot Cream with a pair of socks on last night and found Burt&#x27;s Bees actually softens the feet.</li>
            <li> A friend told me she uses this as hand lotion.  In dry winter months this works great and the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> excellent cream for dry heel skin. works great on hands and finger nails too!</li>
            <li> I once used Gold bond foot cream but after using Neutrogena I was very satisfied with its results</li>
            <li> Product has a good price so I am not so disappointed. Works just okay, moisturize feet okay, but without any super results, so if you need just moisturize your feet not help excessive dryness it will be okay.</li>
            <li> The cream is very moisturizing but the scent is absolutely disgusting.  It has an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to it.  I really wish that Neutrogena didn&#x27;t put as much perfume in the product.</li>
            <li> Being a pedicurist for people in the businss I bought \\&quot;CRACKED HEEL\\&quot; Neutrogena foot cream for years..WOW what a great product!!!!.and of course it was discontinued. I was beside myself with trying to replace it, so I took a chance with the tube of Neutrogena just labeled \\&quot;foot cream.\\&quot; I found it to be nice and rich and long lasting....It comes very close to the \\&quot;cracked heel\\&quot; with a slight fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The tube has shrunk......but I&#x27;m happy. Donna J</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products and thought i would try this one because i have problems with dry feet.  I have two problems with the product that are very much unique to me.  First the product is simply too greasy.  This is not like other Neutrogena products, [[ASIN:B002BWOY6G Neutrogena Soothing Wrap Body Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8.5 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] being an excellent example, that provide long lasting moisture with no greasiness.  The second problem is very specific to those of us with allergy problems, the scent is too strong.  The product on my feet wasn&#x27;t the problem, but after applying the product to my feet, and washing my hands twice, the scent was still in my hands.  I have asthma and allergies, so part 2 may not be important to everyone, but i think part 1, product greasiness, may be very important to many people.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena foot cream is the best product for dry feet.  The formula is not greasy.  You only need a small amount so a tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  As I become an old lady, my feet need a lot of care, and Neutrogena foot cream really softens up the old hooves.  Just smear your feet up and add socks on your way to bed.</li>
            <li> This is the only foot cream that I have found that REALLY works.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and this is it!  So happy I was able to find this on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend who has really dry feet especially in the winter and as some of the other reviewers said it is rather oily but she loves it and prefers it that way.  We also tried the ILoveMyStruts foot creame and she liked it but she continues to go with this product instead and she has said she has absolutely loved it.  It has really helped to prevent her feet from cracking especially around her heels.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your feet.  Your feet feel very smooth and smell so fresh!  I would be purchasing this item again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for both my husband and I. I have feet that peel and my husband suffers from sever cracked skin that eventually results in bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband did not like the smell. I did not really notice a smell. My husband stopped using it as he said it was drying his feet out more than they were. I am still using it and my feet are peeling, they do not seem as dry however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used a Dr.Sholl (can&#x27;t spell it) cream that was amazing but could not find it so I ordered this instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will finish out the bottles but do not think I will be purchasing again as I think I need to keep searching for something that was right for me. This is a shame as this product had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and saw little improvement.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this every night - good product</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> I have rough, dry feet, and find a lot of foot creams don&#x27;t work very well.  Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream is perfect!  Just a small amount on each foot before bed, covered with socks, and my feet are nice and soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and its the only product which seems to do my feet any good. Without it, my poor feet would be a cracked and peeling disaster.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Especially with multiple pack one does have to look for same product again.  Used up old supplies and working on 2nd tube from order.  Bought that from Nordstrom before and am impressed with product.</li>
            <li> I live in Nevada and I apply this to my feet every night before I go to bed.  It keeps my feet very soft and moist and there is no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but recently I have had a hard time finding it on store shelves.  (I shop mostly at Walmart, but have looked in other stores).  It makes my feet feel &amp; look great, which is good because I like to go barefooted.  I have recommended it to several of my friends with terrible, dry, caloused feet and they have all seen improvement.  I wish this product were advertised more widely because if more people knew about it, more would use it &amp; it would be more widely distributed.  I always know when I pruchase a Neutrogena product that I will probably love it.</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my dry elbows, but it works great on rough feet, too!</li>
            <li> I have tried all types of foot cream, I live in Miami so sandals are a most all year but unfortunately that also creates dry feet, This cream is perfect, not too heavy or oily. I did not give it 5 stars because the sizes too small for the price and I go through them really quick. This item is hard to find at stores so I always get it here</li>
            <li> This foot cream actually works.  Unfortunately the package is very small and I have to buy them four at a time.  I hate that I&#x27;m creating waste each month. I only gave 4 stars because the package is so small.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is soothing when you put it on and truly moisturizes the feet.  It is penetrating and not super greasy.  No strong smell.  This is the best foot cream I&#x27;ve used.  It comes in real handy after I showered after a long day of playing volleyball on the hot sand.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried works better.</li>
            <li> This is great treatment for rough feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best Neutrogena foot product ever!!!!!! I am completely addicted.  This is a must have for anyone that cares for their feet!!!! When you go without socks/hoisery this is the best product for your feet before slipping on shoes or sandals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of foot creams over the years, and this one beats them all!  I usually apply right after I shower and put my socks on, by evening my feet are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I am not finding it to work as well as the hand cream.  I don&#x27;t even think my feet are that bad, but the product is not making much of a difference.  Over the years, I have found the hand cream to be good.</li>
            <li> Cream is heavy but absorbs, and if used twice a day ( morning &amp; night ) you will see a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I have always been very impressed with this product. It softens dry calloused feet with out leaving them greasey. I often look in drugstores for this item but it is often hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great moisturizer. It is NOT a cream. It is an ointment.  It isnot greasy at all. Has a nice, light smell. But, the most important thing is that it is very effective on the driest of skin, feet and heels. I love it. It can be hard to find so very glad tht Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> My wife has dry feet, especially around her heels.  This stuff really works.  Glad to find it here, it is difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> GOOD, BEEN USING FOR YRS. BEST OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Smells clean and has a nice, thick application, which many other foot creams do not provide.  Keeps feet comfortably moist, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different foot creams, and I&#x27;ve yet to find one that solves my cracked heel problems.  It does make my feet feel smoother, which should be the primary goal of any cream.  However, Neutrogena has a couple of drawbacks which makes it suffer in comparison to other foot creams.  First, it&#x27;s extremely greasy.  This is not a problem in the winter time when I&#x27;m wearing socks, but in the summer, it&#x27;s very unpleasant when my feet squish-squish in my work shoes.  Second, the scent is too strong for me.  I do think I have a higher sensitivity to some scents than most people, so this may not be a problem for others.  I&#x27;m fine with the cream on my feet, but unfortunately, to get to my feet, it must first go in my hands.  That&#x27;s all it takes to get me sniffling and my eyes burning and watering.  The search continues for a non-greasy, unscented (or lightly scented) foot cream.</li>
            <li> I use this on the heels and bottom of my feet after a bath or shower.  Lovely scent... and really helps with the normally dry, flaky skin.  Didn&#x27;t really want to buy a four-pack, but I do use it often (especially in sandal season) so I figured I save a bit in the long run.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Just after one use your feet feel sooooooo much softer. Since this is really greasy/thick. After I shower, I put it on my feet, put some socks on and wear them to sleep. SO by the next morning, your feet are nice and soft! :D</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever found!  I had it in my drawer for like a year without using it because I got a gift and started using the other stuff.  I started using it when the gift ran out and I have never looked back.  In fact, I am kicking myself for wasting a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed when I used it for the first time because my feet were still moist in the morning!  I only have to file the rough skin off of my feet half of the time because of it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had horrible feet all my adult life with callouses that were always 1/4 inch thick and deep cracks that would sometimes bleed and hurt. Someone told me about this cream and I said ya right, only for other peoples feet, not mine, mine nothing had ever worked! This product is amazing, I have used it now for about 6 weeks and my feet look like normal people with just a light coating of dryness, I had no hope so I did not take before and after pictures. I wish now I would have, because unless you know me and have seen my feet in the past, you might not believe it. I will always use this cream when my feet get started on the dry skin again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions recommended for dry feet and this is the only one that really works well. I&#x27;ve even given out some of these to friends and family members with the same problem of finding a lotion that helps with dry, cracking skin on the feet and they too loved it. I don&#x27;t even try anything else because I don&#x27;t need to any more. Why search when you found what works and it is very reasonably priced?</li>
            <li> Soft soles!  The only foot cream I ever use.  The best price I could find.</li>
            <li> For me one of the best creams for feet. I try lots of them but my opinion didn* t change till now.</li>
            <li> Use this product regularly and it keeps my soles soft and pink. It took a couple of weeks and some scaling, but now the Arizona heat and wearing sandals doesn&#x27;t leave cracks in my soles.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Started using it last year, and have been faithful to it&lt;br /&gt;since.  I like to use it at night, just before bed.  That avoids any &#x27;slipping and sliding in shoes&#x27;, which some comments indicate.  My feet never looked&lt;br /&gt;better, and you don&#x27;t even have to use it EVERY night.  The only drawback,&lt;br /&gt;in my mind, is the cap on the tube... Neutrogena decided to eliminate the flip-top, which made it lots easier to use.  Wish they&#x27;d bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the added bonus of Subscribe &amp; Save.  That way I never have to&lt;br /&gt;remember to order, yet I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream ever.  If you have dry and cracked feet, use this product and you will be amazed.  Many stores no longer carry it.  I am so glad Amazon sells it on their site.</li>
            <li> I recommend all--or almost all--of the Neutrogena products.  The foot cream, hand cream and lip moisturizer all work exactly as promised.  I wish I could purchase them from only one source on Amazon; it would make life a little easier.</li>
            <li> It is great for cracked heels. I am using it every night.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a paid review and I purchased the item from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  I strongly recommend this Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream for Dry Rough Feet. It leaves feet very soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was so disappointed that I could no longer find it. Ordered several and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> As we all know their is no cure for psorasis and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a year. Previously I had a sever problem of psorasis in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it once daily. It keeps my feet very well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The psorasis of the feet remains in remission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have begun to depend on it so much that I begin to get nervous , if the tube is about to finish and I have no replenishment ( I travel a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have psorasis in the feet, I highly recommend it. You can NOT go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid to write it!!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Norwegian Foot Cream is the ONLY thing that really works on my feet, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  I have no idea what&#x27;s in it that makes it different from the rest, but it IS different in that it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will comment that the this new formula (with the red stripe across the top of the box and tube) is slightly different than the old formula (from about 5 years ago), which is a comment that some others have made.  I agree, and I liked the old formula a little better.  That being said, I am just HAPPY to be able to find this at all, as it seems to be almost impossible to find in a any local retail stores.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my feet. All cracks gone</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and almost did not buy this product since they wrote that this product was very greasy and slippery.  Well because my skin is sooooo extremely dry, this product works great to hydrate my foot.  Plus the smell was neutral to me...great product.!</li>
            <li> I use many Neutrogena products and their foot cream is hard to find in the stores.  I use it every day and like their hand cream, it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing and clean scent!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena foot cream is the best i have used on my heels during the winter months, that keeps them from cracking.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this, as it seems kind of greasy. It did help keep my feet soft, though. I was a little taken aback because the label read like a chemical factory. I think I will try something else when I&#x27;m through with these.</li>
            <li> Great product, works for me!</li>
            <li> It feels good, it absorbs very quickly, I&#x27;m tempted to use it for all of me.  It&#x27;s not overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Foot cream leaves feet baby smooth</li>
            <li> This is truly the best foot lotion out there.  It has revived my tired achy feet and my husbands also.  He climbs ladders and walks on concrete floors at his four hour job in mornings during the week, and then works his own business of massage the rest of the day.  In other words he stands all day at what he does. This lotion soothes and softens the feet.  A wonderful revitalization!  We first received a bottle from my husband&#x27;s team at St. Clare Hospital during his cancer treatment.  This was a wonderful gift.  Please try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foot cream.  It has a light smell that, to me, isn&#x27;t too powerful.  I also like being able to buy it in bulk so I always have some on hand (or foot, heh).  My feet are relatively smooth but will occasionally feel dry out of the shower or when climbing in bed at night.  Having a rough place on my foot feel scratchy on my sheets is the absolute worst!  This foot cream does the trick for a quick smoothing to climb into bed at night or for gradual repair over time.  I typically only apply it in the evenings when going to bed because it is so slippery.  That way I just hop under the covers and let it do its thing while I&#x27;m snoozing.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - met expectation</li>
            <li> My father has diabetes. My mother takes care of his feet every morning using this cream. It helps keep his feet healthy. I have it on auto delivery so that they always have the product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  My feet would crack open all the time.  I use this cream every other day and have had no problems.  Just a small amount each time does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and always paid premium for it. So glad to find it in Subscribe and Save. What I was paying for two I get four and no shipping cost. Yea for Subscribe and save. This product is the best foot cream for my feet.</li>
            <li> tried a lot of other products. Norwegian is the only one that really works. It is the only foot cream I would tell anyone to use.</li>
            <li> Effective .. tried or 2 weeks and could see the results..</li>
            <li> big relief for rough skin</li>
            <li> I had very rough heels, and no pumice stone.  Two nights after using this cream, my heels were smooth!  Seriously the best heel cream ever!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite skin care products ever! Noticeable improvement after the first use. I recommend it to everyone and suggest you buy more than one at a time!</li>
            <li> too greasy for me.  I will try another brand.  Smells good.  Effective, but just to greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products, and have really dry skin on my feet and this cream works better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used to scrub them off ... this is a whole different approach for me, and it works so well, I&#x27;m wondering how I didn&#x27;t discover this a decade ago.  Forget about removing the bad stuff - make it all soft and pink.  At least that&#x27;s what this did for me.  In less than a week of usage, my feet are as soft and pink as my baby&#x27;s are. I&#x27;m super happy!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; works great!</li>
            <li> works on my dry heels and my corns as well...all Neutrogiana products are the best I have ever found and I have tried many</li>
