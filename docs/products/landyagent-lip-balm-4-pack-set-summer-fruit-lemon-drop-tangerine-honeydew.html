            <li>It makes my lips smell great</li>
            <li>Great service great product</li>
            <li>The EOS lip balms are the best thing that I have found that will keep my lips moist not chapped like some others do,I love them and at a great price</li>
            <li>Exceptionally good lip balm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great fun packaging and the product feels great on the lips.</li>
            <li>they are really nice.</li>
            <li>What a Fantastic and effective product!  </li>
            <li>Not only are they great colors, but they smell and taste good too!</li>
            <li>I have everyone of them.:-)</li>
            <li>We love these.</li>
            <li>Bought her more than one pack.</li>
            <li>love these things.</li>
            <li>and tasty. :-)</li>
            <li>I thought these were adorable and couldn&#x27;t wait to get them.  </li>
            <li>Nice price and perfect for everyday lip balm.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my lips are smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li>These adorable lip balms are super cute, super fun, and super effective.</li>
            <li>They fit my lips much better, the taste is much better, and they keep my lips moist much longer too!  </li>
            <li>However, EOS has been the most effective by far.</li>
            <li>all new, in original package, excellent condition, not a single detail, great delivery, would totally recommend!</li>
            <li>Something about putting your lips around them makes you keep coming back for more!!</li>
            <li>i am a guy and love the flavors and its not shiny but makes your lips so soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love the fruity scents, but the horribly sweet tastes are too much.</li>
            <li>and my husband loves them since my lips become far more kissable.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just enough for my lips to stay moist and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I loved all the flavors but the tangerine is too soft even after putting it in the freezer for a few hours the Eos tangarine was still too soft.</li>
            <li>Love these lip balms long lasting and very moisturizing.this lip balm will now and forever be on my shopping list.</li>
            <li>What a strange texture, very soft and lumpy.  </li>
            <li>What a fun little surprise!!</li>

            <li> i am a guy and love the flavors and its not shiny but makes your lips so soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips after applying. I wish i would of discovered this years ago l.</li>
            <li> The EOS lip balms are the best thing that I have found that will keep my lips moist not chapped like some others do,I love them and at a great price</li>
            <li> I loved all the flavors but the tangerine is too soft even after putting it in the freezer for a few hours the Eos tangarine was still too soft.</li>

            <li> love these things. i have them all over the house, in all of my gym bags and at work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great fun packaging and the product feels great on the lips. Definitely smell the flavour of the product. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not only are they great colors, but they smell and taste good too! I have noticed that my lips are smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li> summer fruit smells bad</li>
            <li> Packaging was broken and flawed, was not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally good lip balm</li>
            <li> It was a knock-off. It smells like plastic.</li>
            <li> I have never used a lip balm that didn&#x27;t dry my lips out.  This is the BEST lip balm Ever, I will NEVER use anything else!!!!!  it is&lt;br /&gt;soothing and tasty. :-)</li>
            <li> all new, in original package, excellent condition, not a single detail, great delivery, would totally recommend! so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to lip balms. I have tried them all. I thought these were adorable and couldn&#x27;t wait to get them.  What I am not a fan of is the ones that have flavors to them. Yuck!  I love the fruity scents, but the horribly sweet tastes are too much. The tangerine is medicated so it smells like balmex.  I think I will stick with my palmers cocoa butter lip balm.</li>
            <li> My lips always get so chapped in winter. I have tried every type of chapstick. However, EOS has been the most effective by far. Each container lasts for months at a time so the value for the money is great. It makes my lips smell great and my husband loves them since my lips become far more kissable.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on EOS Lip balm!  Except for the Tangerine.  What a strange texture, very soft and lumpy.  But the others are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great service great product</li>
            <li> What a Fantastic and effective product!  I have completely stopped buying all other brands of chapstick in favor of these.  They fit my lips much better, the taste is much better, and they keep my lips moist much longer too!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love these lip balms long lasting and very moisturizing.this lip balm will now and forever be on my shopping list.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know where to start with the EOS Lip Balms. What a fun little surprise!! These adorable lip balms are super cute, super fun, and super effective. Something about putting your lips around them makes you keep coming back for more!! I use it about three times a day and that&#x27;s just enough for my lips to stay moist and satisfied. This is a GREAT gift for just about anyone!</li>
