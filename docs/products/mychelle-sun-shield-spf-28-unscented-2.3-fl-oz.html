            <li>I love this sun cream!</li>
            <li>I liked the Sun Shield Unscented and decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>My own experience is that I find the formula too pasty.</li>
            <li>And yet, here is my honest review</li>
            <li>Does not leave any kind of oily film.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 6 months now, and it is amazing how it perfectly works for my, since I have oily and very sensitive</li>
            <li>It has a light but pleasant order.</li>
            <li>Scent is light and pleasant coconut.  </li>
            <li>For a natural sunscreen, the texture is absolutely perfect and it smells just baaaarely like coconut</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy, has a light, pleasant fragrance, does not burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>The best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work on my face</li>
            <li>so I thought this might get me to wear sunblock on my acne-prone face more often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect sunscreen out there, but having tried numerous ones, I think this is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect smell and texture, but SPF is a bit low.</li>
            <li>I love this during the winter time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the version without Coconut, but I just love the smell of the Coconut formulation, and I think it is a bit more soothing.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunblock out there.</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are appealing.</li>
            <li>I love the textured, the aroma of coconut and the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the smell of coconut</li>
            <li>I felt confident trying it since I love using MyChelle&#x27;s Oil-Free Grapefruit Face Lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If someone were more fair-skinned I would think they would need to apply more often.  </li>
            <li>I love MyChelle, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Love the smell - reminds me of the beach but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Great soft scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Super great natural skincare company.</li>
            <li>I also started using their other face products, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with a medium skin tone who tans fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen is light and perfect for the face where you don&#x27;t want a greasy mess or the &amp;#34;sunscreen smell&amp;#34; all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Happily this sunscreen blends in well, so I look normally white instead of clown-white.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>A plus too that is gluten free.</li>
            <li>The product is heavier, but clean feeling and not greasy.</li>
            <li>That is correct, it does not in the least, which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>, it is not only light, it makes a nice light daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This one has a mild smell of coconut--pleasant but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It contains zinc and titanium dioxide (better for you than the chemicals in most drug store brands), but doesn&#x27;t leave my face white and ghostly.</li>
            <li>It also dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>even in a very hot weather this sunblock is not shiny/oily looking.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that gets a little dryer in winter and this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily, very creamy and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other mineral sunscreens + moisturizers like Josie Maran&#x27;s SPF 40 and Kimberly Sayer&#x27;s daytime moisturing cream with SPF and those go on nice and light.</li>
            <li>One tip though, when applying it, it&#x27;s best to work it in pretty fast because it starts to dry and will ball up if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch recommended by EWG for being less toxic than regular brands, and this one has worked the best for me and my family.</li>
            <li>Very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of white on my face.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than what my dermatologist recommended as sun protection (that one left my skin feeling oily).</li>
            <li>only wish is that it had a higher SPF, but I think that&#x27;s more a function of the limitations of the ingredients than anything else.</li>
            <li>The latter tend to be very long, so I&#x27;m happy it lasted</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It blends reasonably well, but the coconut scent is a bit too strong for daily use.  </li>
            <li>It can leave a white caste if you do not rub it in well, but if you rub it in, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>Very important.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No irritating fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Thanks MyChelle.</li>
            <li>And my 32-year old skin rarely breaks out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really fair-skinned.</li>
            <li>The 2.3 oz tube lasts much longer than I imagined, too.</li>
            <li>It does not have much smell at all.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Kiss</li>
            <li>Rubs in smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave white tint.</li>
            <li>but it does protect from the sun very well</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen I need to use Zinc</li>
            <li>The consistency is different because of the zinc compound, but that&#x27;s what makes it such an effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is great for everyday use in Southern California where I live.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this enough to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Yes, it contains micronized zinc, but from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s still the lesser of many potential</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>No stinging in the eyes, no icky chemical sunscreen smell/taste that we normally associate with applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This one rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave big white streaks like some of the other safe sun blocks.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>Love this face lotion, it&#x27;s thick, so something to get used to, and you really have to work the lotion in.  </li>
            <li>Only clear on single application not on the re-apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again because it&#x27;s not greasy at all, and I love that.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tint my skin white nor does it become soup when I&#x27;m out in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>The texture was kind of thick and oily, and I feel that it went rancid rather quickly - developed that &#x27;old oil&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film so much as gum up on my face and then flake off like the shavings from a pencil eraser.</li>
            <li>Maybe it should be stored in the fridge until you&#x27;re ready to open the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product especially after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>The based part about this product is that they are environmentally conscious.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have no problem with it at all.</li>
            <li>had completely forgotten that I tried this product.</li>
            <li>However, you must apply it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my research on natural sunscreens and this is one of the ones often recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only used it on my face at first, but got another tube in the coconut version to use on my body the last time we went to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Super light, doesn&#x27;t get weird and powdery or greasy, keeps the sun away.  </li>
            <li>This is stark white coming out of the tube but magically rubs in leaving no trace of white.</li>
            <li>The only thing about using it all over your body is that you do kind of need a lot to amply cover larger areas (unlike the face where you only need a small dime size or less), so you will likely go through a tube pretty fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, it&#x27;s mineral based so the sunscreen is free of most of the questionable chemicals in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, it provides broad based spectrum protection.  </li>
            <li>You will definitely need a separate moisturizer first if you have dry or dryish skin.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the one with no fragrance though for the face, especially if you are sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful, and small enough to take traveling as well.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No stinging in the eyes, no icky chemical sunscreen smell/taste that we normally associate with applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This one rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave big white streaks like some of the other safe sun blocks.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> Love this face lotion, it&#x27;s thick, so something to get used to, and you really have to work the lotion in.  </li>
            <li> Only clear on single application not on the re-apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again because it&#x27;s not greasy at all, and I love that.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tint my skin white nor does it become soup when I&#x27;m out in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li> The texture was kind of thick and oily, and I feel that it went rancid rather quickly - developed that &#x27;old oil&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film so much as gum up on my face and then flake off like the shavings from a pencil eraser.</li>
            <li> Maybe it should be stored in the fridge until you&#x27;re ready to open the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product especially after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> The based part about this product is that they are environmentally conscious.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have no problem with it at all.</li>
            <li> had completely forgotten that I tried this product.</li>
            <li> However, you must apply it quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my research on natural sunscreens and this is one of the ones often recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used it on my face at first, but got another tube in the coconut version to use on my body the last time we went to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Super light, doesn&#x27;t get weird and powdery or greasy, keeps the sun away.  </li>
            <li> This is stark white coming out of the tube but magically rubs in leaving no trace of white.</li>
            <li> The only thing about using it all over your body is that you do kind of need a lot to amply cover larger areas (unlike the face where you only need a small dime size or less), so you will likely go through a tube pretty fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, it&#x27;s mineral based so the sunscreen is free of most of the questionable chemicals in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it provides broad based spectrum protection.  </li>
            <li> You will definitely need a separate moisturizer first if you have dry or dryish skin.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the one with no fragrance though for the face, especially if you are sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful, and small enough to take traveling as well.</li>
            <li> Indeed it is dry and sheer</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen without all the harsh chemicals and greasy feel.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll be switching back to those other brands.</li>
            <li> The tube is on the smaller side for a sunscreen, but the quality is such that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunscreen and this is the only one who does not smell bad and does not give your face a oily look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not oily, it rubs in almost like a dry oil.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and found that must sunscreens that are mineral based tend to dry it out.  </li>
            <li> As with the other physical sunblocks, there is still a very slight white cast.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I just wish they would come out with a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; version in a bigger size that glides on a little easier.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even feel anything, then  touch your face by accident and boom, it is wet.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent, and none of the really bad chemicals that are found in other SPF lotions found over the counter.</li>
            <li> All other sunscreens irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to rub in and unless you are albino, it will leave a noticeable white film on your face and especially along the hairline.  </li>
            <li> I have dark skin (think Gabrielle Union complexion, so still not the darkest).</li>
            <li> me, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a creamier, less chemical sunscreen and this fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> Does not make my face an oily mess, but a little thicker than the kiss my face that I use in summer.  </li>
            <li> and I have to apply this at least every hour or hour and a half when I am out on the water and still have ended up with a slight tan on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you reapply, the previously layer is still there and it starts making your turn white and becomes difficult to apply evenly and transparently</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even especially like it for that because the spf is weak and you have to rub it in too hard.</li>
            <li> Yet another expensive face sunblock that I can now only use on my tattoos.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some a little too close to my mouth and got a taste of it and was surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t disgusting like other sunscreens I might have accidentally &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34; in the past.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this was a bad batch or some old</li>
            <li> Because it does not have any crazy potentially toxic ingredients, I used it during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too moisturizing at all, and I think that&#x27;s partly because it was just too thick.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t used to be quite so thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for the past three years and it is usually less expensive on amazon than at a health food store.</li>
            <li> and I tested it at the pool and a baseball game.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m not sure that would be a bad thing, some people might not be into that).</li>
            <li> I hate face sunblocks that are goopy/thick and feel heavy on a skin.</li>
            <li> My husband was very skeptical about its supposed non-oiliness even after I raved about it, but I got him to give it a try</li>
            <li> Looks really nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of white on my face. The best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. I like it much better than what my dermatologist recommended as sun protection (that one left my skin feeling oily). This one does not nor does it make my face shiny.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural physical sunscreen. I&#x27;ve used MyChelle products before, but from the cosmetics line, never skincare. I love this sunblock. I have dark skin (think Gabrielle Union complexion, so still not the darkest). This is stark white coming out of the tube but magically rubs in leaving no trace of white. It&#x27;s also not oily, it rubs in almost like a dry oil. I&#x27;m sure this would work on my face but I stick to carrot oil there, I use this on my arms and they are darker than my face from driving.</li>
            <li> Love the smell - reminds me of the beach but not too strong.  Moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film so much as gum up on my face and then flake off like the shavings from a pencil eraser. Looks really nasty. Yet another expensive face sunblock that I can now only use on my tattoos. And I don&#x27;t even especially like it for that because the spf is weak and you have to rub it in too hard.</li>
            <li> Great soft scent of coconut.</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion, it&#x27;s thick, so something to get used to, and you really have to work the lotion in.  Smells pretty decent, and none of the really bad chemicals that are found in other SPF lotions found over the counter.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Indeed it is dry and sheer&lt;br /&gt;- Feels great when you apply, great for the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- If you reapply, the previously layer is still there and it starts making your turn white and becomes difficult to apply evenly and transparently&lt;br /&gt;- Only clear on single application not on the re-apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again because it&#x27;s not greasy at all, and I love that.  But I only use it when I know I only need to use it once and not reapply.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this enough to use it regularly. The texture was kind of thick and oily, and I feel that it went rancid rather quickly - developed that &#x27;old oil&#x27; smell. Maybe it should be stored in the fridge until you&#x27;re ready to open the bottle. I had a MyChelle moisturizer/night creme that I absolutely loved so I thought this might get me to wear sunblock on my acne-prone face more often. I wonder if this was a bad batch or some old stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, not worth the money. I just wear giant hats instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect sunscreen out there, but having tried numerous ones, I think this is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it&#x27;s mineral based so the sunscreen is free of most of the questionable chemicals in other sunscreens.  Yes, it contains micronized zinc, but from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s still the lesser of many potential evils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it provides broad based spectrum protection.  UVA/UVB.  Very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, it&#x27;s the only zinc oxide/TiO2 sunscreen I&#x27;ve yet used that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slathering myself in melted vanilla ice cream.  It doesn&#x27;t tint my skin white nor does it become soup when I&#x27;m out in the hot sun.  Nevertheless, this is not a water resistant sunscreen.  If you plan to go out for a run or a swim etc., you will have to reapply it often.  If you are sitting on the beach on a 90 degree day, expect to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourthly, many sunscreens are loaded with fragrances etc., which can get tedious.  This one has a mild smell of coconut--pleasant but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the sunscreen works.  I live in Florida.  I have yet to get a sunburn here while wearing this.  I try to limit my time in the sun as well.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it had a higher SPF, but I think that&#x27;s more a function of the limitations of the ingredients than anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months now, and it is amazing how it perfectly works for my, since I have oily and very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will use this forever.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous sunscreens that are chemical-free, and this is the only one that does not go on like glue and leave my skin looking like I put white paint on it. I only used it on my face at first, but got another tube in the coconut version to use on my body the last time we went to Hawaii. The only thing about using it all over your body is that you do kind of need a lot to amply cover larger areas (unlike the face where you only need a small dime size or less), so you will likely go through a tube pretty fast. I just wish they would come out with a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; version in a bigger size that glides on a little easier. For the face though, this stuff is the best. I&#x27;d recommend the one with no fragrance though for the face, especially if you are sensitive. I have sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I also started using their other face products, and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Perfect smell and texture, but SPF is a bit low.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a creamier, less chemical sunscreen and this fills the bill.  It goes on smoothy, and feels good.  I use it on days when I&#x27;ll be in and out of the sun - if I am going out for an extended sun-period I use something heavier</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen without all the harsh chemicals and greasy feel. This fits the bill. The smell is pleasant and not overbearing and does NOT leave a greasy sheen but dries matte, and moisturizes well. One tip though, when applying it, it&#x27;s best to work it in pretty fast because it starts to dry and will ball up if you&#x27;re not careful, otherwise great!</li>
            <li> Discovered this on EWG (environmental workers group) where they rate the toxicity of beauty products and cleaners. This one rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave big white streaks like some of the other safe sun blocks. It has a light but pleasant order.</li>
            <li> I liked the Sun Shield Unscented and decided to try this one.  It blends reasonably well, but the coconut scent is a bit too strong for daily use.  It also feels a bit waxy.  As with the other physical sunblocks, there is still a very slight white cast.</li>
            <li> I love this during the winter time.  It feels so soothing to put on in the morning.  I have combination skin that gets a little dryer in winter and this stuff is great.  Does not make my face an oily mess, but a little thicker than the kiss my face that I use in summer.  It can leave a white caste if you do not rub it in well, but if you rub it in, it is fine.  I have tried the version without Coconut, but I just love the smell of the Coconut formulation, and I think it is a bit more soothing.  This does have some anti-oxidants in it, and it is not in a jar, so the anti-oxidants won&#x27;t lose potency.  Not tested on animals.  No irritating fragrances.  Because it does not have any crazy potentially toxic ingredients, I used it during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! For a natural sunscreen, the texture is absolutely perfect and it smells just baaaarely like coconut (you won&#x27;t smell like a tropical drink-- although I&#x27;m not sure that would be a bad thing, some people might not be into that). I use it every day and intend to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunblock out there. I have tried a bunch recommended by EWG for being less toxic than regular brands, and this one has worked the best for me and my family. It goes on smooth, but is not greasy. It contains zinc and titanium dioxide (better for you than the chemicals in most drug store brands), but doesn&#x27;t leave my face white and ghostly. I keep reordering this because I use it every day and also give tubes to my loved ones. This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> Good product with good ingredients, and very effective.</li>
            <li> My husband has allergy of some chemical ingredients. But this sunblock works perfect for my honey:) Thanks MyChelle. And there is sale on site for Memorial day. (20%)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product especially after reading the reviews. My own experience is that I find the formula too pasty. So when I put it on, it feels chalky. It also made me break out curiously enough. And my 32-year old skin rarely breaks out so I knew it was this product. It wasn&#x27;t too moisturizing at all, and I think that&#x27;s partly because it was just too thick. I&#x27;ve tried other mineral sunscreens + moisturizers like Josie Maran&#x27;s SPF 40 and Kimberly Sayer&#x27;s daytime moisturing cream with SPF and those go on nice and light. So I&#x27;ll be switching back to those other brands.</li>
            <li> Works well on my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really, really fair-skinned. I have a lot of experience with sunscreen on my face, not all of it pleasant. Happily this sunscreen blends in well, so I look normally white instead of clown-white. It also keeps my face and neck from getting burned, which makes me happy. The smell and texture are appealing. On my oily skin, the sunscreen soaks in so I don&#x27;t end up feeling extra greasy. It&#x27;s useful, and small enough to take traveling as well. The 2.3 oz tube lasts much longer than I imagined, too.</li>
            <li> The product is heavier, but clean feeling and not greasy. The scent is light and pleasing. It also dissipates quickly. I use this product as my go-to face sunscreen. A plus too that is gluten free. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and found that must sunscreens that are mineral based tend to dry it out.  However, this did not.  I love the textured, the aroma of coconut and the way it makes my skin feel.  The based part about this product is that they are environmentally conscious.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is great for everyday use in Southern California where I live. My skin is sensitive and I have no problem with it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the smell of coconut and because I&#x27;ve been trying to find a sunscreen for my face that doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. This sunscreen exceeds my expectations. It goes on smooth and creamy, has a light, pleasant fragrance, does not burn my eyes. I accidentally got some a little too close to my mouth and got a taste of it and was surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t disgusting like other sunscreens I might have accidentally &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34; in the past. My husband was very skeptical about its supposed non-oiliness even after I raved about it, but I got him to give it a try and now he loves it, too! I will defininitely be buying this again. Amazon seems to have the best pricing. Go, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: June 2015&lt;br /&gt;I had completely forgotten that I tried this product. I still don&#x27;t remember trying this product. And yet, here is my honest review, that is no different than the review I was just about to write about this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was traveling two weeks ago and had not remembered to bring sunscreen. I purchased this sunscreen from a grocery store for like, $22 or something like that. I felt confident trying it since I love using MyChelle&#x27;s Oil-Free Grapefruit Face Lotion. I am blown away, again. Even if I don&#x27;t remember trying it before, my thoughts after using it exclusively for an all over sunscreen are -- it&#x27;s worth the money!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing sunblock protection: I didn&#x27;t get sunburned. I had no breakouts. No stinging in the eyes, no icky chemical sunscreen smell/taste that we normally associate with applying sunscreen. This sunscreen changes the way I see sunscreen. Does not leave any kind of oily film. I will not buy another sunscreen ever again. The tube is on the smaller side for a sunscreen, but the quality is such that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not oily, very creamy and goes on smooth. It has a hint of coconut smell. Not over powering at all. I wanted something to wear under my makeup that had protection. This is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on that it is not supposed to irritate your eyes.  That is correct, it does not in the least, which is wonderful.  All other sunscreens irritate my eyes.  However, you must apply it quite frequently.  I am Caucasian with a medium skin tone who tans fairly easily.  I do not like to get ANY sun on my face though and I have to apply this at least every hour or hour and a half when I am out on the water and still have ended up with a slight tan on my face.  If someone were more fair-skinned I would think they would need to apply more often.  It does not have much smell at all.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great for my sensitive skin.  I have been using for the past three years and it is usually less expensive on amazon than at a health food store.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunscreen and this is the only one who does not smell bad and does not give your face a oily look. The only thing I do not like about it they should produce 50 factor one.</li>
            <li> I love Mychelle products!  I use them daily and nightly!  This product though has changed.  It didn&#x27;t used to be quite so thick and pasty.  It is very hard to rub in and unless you are albino, it will leave a noticeable white film on your face and especially along the hairline.  I much prefer Kiss My Face Face Factor SPF 30, it is not only light, it makes a nice light daytime moisturizer.  I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my research on natural sunscreens and this is one of the ones often recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super great natural skincare company. Sunscreen is light and perfect for the face where you don&#x27;t want a greasy mess or the &amp;#34;sunscreen smell&amp;#34; all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it—am planning on staying with it for the long-term!</li>
            <li> Found this product on the database for safe/natural sunscreens. Very happy with it. It&#x27;s summer in Texas and I tested it at the pool and a baseball game. The latter tend to be very long, so I&#x27;m happy it lasted and I got home without redness. I apply it to my face. I have pina colada spray by Coola for my body. Also use Badger Balm USA sport and face tinted sunscreens. They work awesome too, although Coola is a pricey brand.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. This is a good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are used to having moisturizer and sunscreen in one, you&#x27;ll need some adjustment time.  You will definitely need a separate moisturizer first if you have dry or dryish skin.  The consistency is different because of the zinc compound, but that&#x27;s what makes it such an effective sunscreen.  The smell is awesome and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin breaking out.  I love MyChelle, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li> Very nice sunscreen!  Scent is light and pleasant coconut.  Rubs in smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave white tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it. finally I sunblock that is not greasy. it gives matte finish. my skin is very dry so I have to use face moisturizer under it. even in a very hot weather this sunblock is not shiny/oily looking. I hate face sunblocks that are goopy/thick and feel heavy on a skin. this one is not.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and sometimes my nose \\&quot;sweats\\&quot; under this cream. i&#x27;ve had same experience with a couple face creams before. you don&#x27;t even feel anything, then  touch your face by accident and boom, it is wet. but it does protect from the sun very well</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen!  Super light, doesn&#x27;t get weird and powdery or greasy, keeps the sun away.  Great under makeup or just on its own.  I will definitely buy this again and I have recommended it all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen I need to use Zinc and this provides good coverage.  I haven&#x27;t burned once with it and I&#x27;m out for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful! I love this sun cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sunscreen. The coconut smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, which is a plus.</li>
