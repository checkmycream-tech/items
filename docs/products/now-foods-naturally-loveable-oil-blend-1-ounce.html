    <ol>
            <li>The smell is great added to massage oil or infuser or linen spray!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost perfect!</li>
            <li>is a perfect premade blend if you don&#x27;t want to worry about buying everything separately and mixing it correctly....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>We use this oil in our diffuser and it smells great!</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great smell and price</li>
            <li>Has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Has a great citrus undertone.</li>
            <li>It is a good oil.</li>
            <li>It is the best safest way to clean any diffuser.</li>
            <li>However it ended up being my very favorite oil</li>
            <li>I thought I liked them all, but something in it does not smell good to me.</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I love this blend!  </li>
            <li>Considering full 1 oz size at very reasonable price, I think it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love the scent and the atmosphere it creates.</li>
            <li>This oil does leave residue, like most citrus oil&#x27;s will, in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love to mix this blend with the Cheer Up Buttercup blend.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love the rest of the NOW oil products though :)</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance and would buy again</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved the smell at first.</li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power directly on my skin, but it&#x27;s very pleasant</li>
            <li>Excellent smell, potent but not overwhelming or cheap.</li>
            <li>I use a Q-tip to clean the disk and any crevices.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it had more ylang ylang in it, but I will just add it on my own to suit my preferences.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This stuff really smells great, I ordered it on a whim out of curiously having never tried any of Now</li>
            <li>Helps me feel energized and my home smell fresh.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>...&#x27;twas a worthy impulse purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovey citrusy/very faintly floral scent that works best for me in lotions.</li>
            <li>The smell is great but not long lasting at all.  </li>
            <li>This oil blend smells beautiful - but the fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li>Make sure you like all the scents in this blend of essential oils before purchasing.</li>
            <li>To me, this smells musty (not the kind of must perfumes will sometimes have, but that of an old house must), and is not naturally loveable, more like naturally hateable.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the smell on my skin.</li>
            <li>I swear the two really do elevate my mood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real mood lifter.  </li>
            <li>It really depends on the person, I guess.</li>
            <li>Very citrusy.</li>
            <li>Although this is not one of the effects it advertises, it promotes really deep calm peaceful sleep.</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops on a small piece of fabric that I have placed in my purse to make it smell wonderful too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I will use it for in a natural based cleaner.</li>
            <li>This blend smelled decent.</li>
            <li>I am never without &amp;#34;naturally lovable&amp;#34;or &amp;#34;clear the air.&amp;#34; I highly recommend both of these oils.</li>
            <li>Lovely blend that took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>I put it in my diffuser and put some on my wrists when I want to sleep deeply and feel peaceful.</li>
            <li>it has a little of the citrusy smell of &amp;#34;buttercup,&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t really smell that sweet as I thought it might.</li>
            <li>In order to clean it I use another Now essential oils blend, &amp;#34;clear the air.&amp;#34; I use a few drops on a cotton ball and wipe the entire surface clean.</li>
            <li>Clear the air also works wonders for headaches.</li>
            <li>and I frequently reorder it.</li>
            <li>I have some difficulty sleeping and staying asleep and this oil is the first helpful thing I have found a long time.</li>
            <li>As a personal preference I did not like the smell too much</li>
            <li>I have ordered several NOW products and essential oils and have loved them all, but this one is no good.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my purse and will use a tiny drop directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>but it is not bad; I just did not love it.</li>
            <li>Compared to other essential oil companies, Now oils tend to be a little weaker so you have to use more drops in a diffuser than you would with some other brands.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch or what....</li>
            <li> I feel bad that my UPS man had to smell this.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really smells great, I ordered it on a whim out of curiously having never tried any of Now Foods oil blends...&#x27;twas a worthy impulse purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovey citrusy/very faintly floral scent that works best for me in lotions. I find it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power directly on my skin, but it&#x27;s very pleasant and I like that it&#x27;s not highly concentrated or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Also a good base to customize with other EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bottle was leaking upon arrival.  This stuff smells AWFUL too!  I feel bad that my UPS man had to smell this.  Everyone who smelled it all said the same thing: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s smells like urine.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Make sure you like all the scents in this blend of essential oils before purchasing. I thought I liked them all, but something in it does not smell good to me. To me, this smells musty (not the kind of must perfumes will sometimes have, but that of an old house must), and is not naturally loveable, more like naturally hateable.</li>
            <li> This oil blend smells beautiful - but the fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> The smell is great added to massage oil or infuser or linen spray!</li>
            <li> Meh. it has a little of the citrusy smell of &amp;#34;buttercup,&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t really smell that sweet as I thought it might.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I initially received it as a gift with a diffuser and I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved the smell at first. However it ended up being my very favorite oil and I frequently reorder it. My husband and I both love the scent and the atmosphere it creates. Although this is not one of the effects it advertises, it promotes really deep calm peaceful sleep. I put it in my diffuser and put some on my wrists when I want to sleep deeply and feel peaceful. I have some difficulty sleeping and staying asleep and this oil is the first helpful thing I have found a long time.The smell is floral, citrusy and multilayered. My husband really likes the smell on my skin. Compared to other essential oil companies, Now oils tend to be a little weaker so you have to use more drops in a diffuser than you would with some other brands. The part I like about that is that you can use it neat on your skin without any negative effects. I have actually purchased other oil blends designed to help you sleep and they don&#x27;t work as well as this one does for me. This oil does leave residue, like most citrus oil&#x27;s will, in the diffuser. It needs to be cleaned out every day or every other day to prevent mold and build up. We use our diffuser with this oil in it almost every night. In order to clean it I use another Now essential oils blend, &amp;#34;clear the air.&amp;#34; I use a few drops on a cotton ball and wipe the entire surface clean. I use a Q-tip to clean the disk and any crevices. It is the best safest way to clean any diffuser. Clear the air also works wonders for headaches. I am never without &amp;#34;naturally lovable&amp;#34;or &amp;#34;clear the air.&amp;#34; I highly recommend both of these oils.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour.  The smell is great but not long lasting at all.  I put some on my sheets and by the time I went to bed at night the smell was long gone.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Great smell and price</li>
            <li> I bought this to blend into my homemade lotions, body oils, soap, body mist, magnesium oil, and room freshener. I also put a few drops on a small piece of fabric that I have placed in my purse to make it smell wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too fruity, and it is not too floral either. It&#x27;s almost perfect! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it had more ylang ylang in it, but I will just add it on my own to suit my preferences.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect premade blend if you don&#x27;t want to worry about buying everything separately and mixing it correctly.... it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is a good oil. As a personal preference I did not like the smell too much but it is not bad; I just did not love it.</li>
            <li> I love to mix this blend with the Cheer Up Buttercup blend. I swear the two really do elevate my mood.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I agree with another reviewer - not too citrus-y, not too floral-y... it&#x27;s just right.  I keep it in my purse and will use a tiny drop directly on my skin.  It&#x27;s a real mood lifter.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine shared her appreciation for the smell but neither of my two sisters did.  It really depends on the person, I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch or what....but this smells disgusting! I have ordered several NOW products and essential oils and have loved them all, but this one is no good.</li>
            <li> Use this every day! Has a great smell. Helps me feel energized and my home smell fresh. Has a great citrus undertone. Have given up on store bought air fresheners and diffuse this instead. Have purchased multiple times.</li>
            <li> This blend smelled decent.</li>
            <li> I love this blend!  I mix it with a carrier oil and use it as perfume.</li>
            <li> Lovely blend that took a little getting used to. I used it in my body oil and loooove it. I have been using it everyday since I made the body oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;It is a mix of citrus and floral scents.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite looking forward to this but sadly it smells much like pledge wood cleaner. Which is exactly what I will use it for in a natural based cleaner. Love the rest of the NOW oil products though :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a 5 star because of its overall value. I use it in Deneve essential oil diffuser, 12 drops to a fill. Excellent smell, potent but not overwhelming or cheap. It produces thick vapors which I find lacking with diluted oils. Considering full 1 oz size at very reasonable price, I think it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and would buy again</li>
            <li> We use this oil in our diffuser and it smells great! Very citrusy. A few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful!</li>
