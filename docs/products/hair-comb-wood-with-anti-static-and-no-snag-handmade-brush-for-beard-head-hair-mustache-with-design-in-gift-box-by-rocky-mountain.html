            <li>Very light and comfortable comb works great!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>Everything they said it was, nice quality beard comb for the money.</li>
            <li>If your a man, or woman with a nice beard in need of a nice comb that does as described then this is the comb for you.</li>
            <li>High quality and an awesome price.</li>
            <li>super light and great quality.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful comb!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way through the scruffiest beard and does not leave any static.</li>
            <li>100% better than the plastic combs from the store.</li>
            <li>but I do find it runs through my beard with much greater ease than anything</li>
            <li>but my barbers skilled hands can manage.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair comb.</li>
            <li>Great comb would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It goes thru my beard really easy.</li>
            <li>It easily works</li>
            <li>Nice comb, well made and came in a nice classy box.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to hold and feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as prone to breakage as horn and not as cheap looking as the plastic combs.</li>
            <li>Nice wood looks high end.</li>
            <li>Really good product... real wood, and well crafted, thanks</li>
            <li>have pretty fine and frankly overgrown hair.</li>
            <li>Since I switched from a Con-Air plastic comb to this guy, tangles come right out, and my hair breakage has gone to almost zero.</li>
            <li>I keep it right by the couch and just comb by beard while watching TV or reading.</li>
            <li>After a full day of walking, sitting, and standing it is no worse for wear.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell fantastic, but the amount of snags and knots I get in my beard have dropped significantly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I love wooden comes.</li>
            <li>This one is very durable and definitely worth the money the people.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta get yourself one.</li>
            <li>First, let me mention the one con: there&#x27;s a chemical smell, which I assume is from the finish on the wood.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would survive in my back pocket for the day</li>
            <li>High quality, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Over all it is a decent comb and does exactly what one is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>comb that is gentle on the scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>I thought my Kent FOT pocket comb was gentle; it&#x27;s not as gentle as this comb.</li>
            <li>Thanks Rocky Mountain Barber Co. ....</li>
            <li>It is larger than I expected and has a good heft to it</li>
            <li>Very nice comb a little big to cary</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will clear up, and since I use this comb to get in and out in a hurry, I don&#x27;t really mind the smell, so long as it is indeed temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but happily I was wrong.</li>
            <li>The Comb is great but the box it comes in gives it a pretty bad smell which has stuck to the comb.</li>
            <li>I spent a long time looking at all the wooden combs on Amazon, but the right choice was really easy.</li>
            <li>Has a distinct and different smell bit that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s a handcrafted comb made of wood and not a cheap dollar store plastic piece of $h!t.</li>
            <li>Had my doubts about a non snarl comb due to my rather thick beard, but when I received it, it worked better than any comb I used before,</li>

            <li> Great comb would highly recommend. It feels like a face massage when I use it.</li>
            <li> High quality and an awesome price. If you have a beard, you need this!</li>
            <li> I am so beyond happy I bought this comb! Feels great on the scalp! A lot of men&#x27;s essentialist posts will say you need a tortuous-shell comb but they are dead wrong.</li>
            <li> High quality, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, closed-grained wood (birch?) comb that is gentle on the scalp and skin. Bigger than your typical pocket comb. I thought my Kent FOT pocket comb was gentle; it&#x27;s not as gentle as this comb.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful comb! My beard loves it! Perfect! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Great comb!! super light and great quality. I purchased this for my beard and it works wonderful</li>
            <li> The Comb is great but the box it comes in gives it a pretty bad smell which has stuck to the comb. Hoping that after using it for a bit with some oil that the smell will improve.</li>
            <li> Very light and comfortable comb works great!</li>
            <li> It made a world of difference vs plastic combs. It goes thru my beard really easy.</li>
            <li> Over all it is a decent comb and does exactly what one is supposed to do. However I am 100% disappointed that the comb is made in china! Nowhere dose it say that it&#x27;s not American made in the description, that should have been a clue. Figured with a name like rocky mountain barber company thought I&#x27;d receive a product made bya burly bearded rocky mountain man. Fool me once</li>
            <li> Really good product... real wood, and well crafted, thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent comb! I love wooden comes. This one is very durable and definitely worth the money the people.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta get yourself one.</li>
            <li> Best beard comb I&#x27;ve ever used!... So Smoooooooth .....Not ever going back to plastic combs on my face again!... Thanks Rocky Mountain Barber Co. ....</li>
            <li> My husband loved his Rocky Mountain Comb for his beard. He is very happy with it and says it is awesome. Shipping and delivery were excellent, arrived very quickly. We definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just received my comb today. Couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It easily works it&#x27;s way through the scruffiest beard and does not leave any static. Works well with oils and balms to help evenly distribute.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts about a non snarl comb due to my rather thick beard, but when I received it, it worked better than any comb I used before, great product both in use and construction!</li>
            <li> just the best beard comb I have ever had awesome</li>
            <li> Everything they said it was, nice quality beard comb for the money.</li>
            <li> Has a distinct and different smell bit that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s a handcrafted comb made of wood and not a cheap dollar store plastic piece of $h!t.

            <li> The best purchase I have made for my beard. Not only does it smell fantastic, but the amount of snags and knots I get in my beard have dropped significantly. 100% better than the plastic combs from the store. I never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> First, let me mention the one con: there&#x27;s a chemical smell, which I assume is from the finish on the wood. I&#x27;m sure it will clear up, and since I use this comb to get in and out in a hurry, I don&#x27;t really mind the smell, so long as it is indeed temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine and frankly overgrown hair. Since I switched from a Con-Air plastic comb to this guy, tangles come right out, and my hair breakage has gone to almost zero. I spent a long time looking at all the wooden combs on Amazon, but the right choice was really easy. If you have finer hair, buy this comb. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say. Recommend all their products</li>
            <li> Excellent Item. It&#x27;s not as prone to breakage as horn and not as cheap looking as the plastic combs.</li>
            <li> Nice comb, well made and came in a nice classy box. Nice wood looks high end.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best comb I&#x27;ve purchased in years. It is larger than I expected and has a good heft to it so it&#x27;s easy to hold and feels sturdy. It&#x27;s wood and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would survive in my back pocket for the day but happily I was wrong. After a full day of walking, sitting, and standing it is no worse for wear. I was leery of the &#x27;no snag&#x27; claim but I do find it runs through my beard with much greater ease than anything but my barbers skilled hands can manage.</li>
            <li> Very nice comb a little big to cary but it works well</li>
            <li> Has a bad smell to it. I think it&#x27;s made in China...bottom of the box has UPC that says made in China. I tried washing the comb but stink still remains. If I could do it all over again I don&#x27;t think I would buy this comb.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. It smells so good. I keep it right by the couch and just comb by beard while watching TV or reading. The scent and feel of the comb is so relaxing.</li>
            <li> This things awesome feels great Gliding Through my Hair. My favorite hair comb.</li>
