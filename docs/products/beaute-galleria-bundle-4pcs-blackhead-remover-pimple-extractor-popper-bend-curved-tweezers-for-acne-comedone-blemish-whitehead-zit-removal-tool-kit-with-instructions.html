            <li>However these are great tools for good prices.</li>
            <li>Might be an nice gift idea!</li>
            <li>These tools are what the professionals use to remove acne--for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watch the videos or attain your training elsewhere, and use them in good health.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the set.</li>
            <li>I like the bundle, good quality and multi-purposes even though one of them</li>
            <li>This is a good set for the price.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starter kit.  </li>
            <li>and i loved the item..</li>
            <li>Good quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li>she loves them and are good quality</li>
            <li>Good quality for cost.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a good job at extracting.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I believe cystic acne is always best left to dermatologists, who can instruct in best ways of control.</li>
            <li>Periodically I need to help him remove the blackheads and these tools are so much more efficient than bobby pins!  </li>
            <li>The two loop styles are best for this chore, and as a retired nurse, I believe the pointy tool is for piercing large whiteheads and cysts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I liked that I could purchase all 3 at once.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these implements is nice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re handy to have for any skin eruptions without damaging the skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over do it because these things work incredibly effectively.</li>
            <li>The set includes instructions, identifying each tool with details on how to use each and sanitize during and after use, which I very much liked.</li>
            <li>These are good quality, but after having them for a week or 2, i don&#x27;t use them and find that they end up leaving more marks on my face than if I just use my fingers.</li>
            <li>I liked the quality and job it did.</li>
            <li>These are very effective if you need a quick way to get rid of pimples, or to &amp;#34;pop them&amp;#34; safely, but be warned!</li>
            <li>She says they make it very easy to get rid of the things on my face she doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>very easy on my skin</li>
            <li>The product was good and fit well into the description.</li>
            <li>They have many uses as you get a nice set.</li>
            <li>Great facial tools at a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since receiving these tools, I&#x27;ve had a couple opportunities to try them out, mostly on blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t just bang them against your face and expect them to work magic.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wipe the effected area of skin with alcohol before and after.  </li>
            <li>I would love to give this five stars, but because no instructions are including, I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by the quality for the low cost of this product.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with these.</li>
            <li>I found the needle and the eyehole the most efficent and safest tools for blackhead extracting.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have better luck using a safety pen.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought 3 more to give to my friends.</li>
            <li>Awesome, face feels way cleaner after a short &#x27;pop everything&#x27; session.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li>Watched many videos.</li>
            <li>However my wife seems to like these better that squeezing, so there&#x27;s that too.</li>
            <li>5 star quality for sure.</li>
            <li>Working on better cleansing, but using the tools in this bundle to attack the whiteheads one by one</li>
            <li>I needed a new set as I had lost mine a while ago, and they all work beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very nice and works very well for a friend</li>
            <li>Great buy, came super fast!</li>
            <li>Has been working great so far.</li>
            <li>and she said she loved it and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Each tool comes with a plastic sleeve for storage, and you can easily combine all three tools into the largest sleeve for storage.</li>
            <li>Shipper/vender was very quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>okay, so it didn&#x27;t really work for me, kind of messed up my face.</li>
            <li>The metal is strong and durable.</li>
            <li>It works fine for the price.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fine for variety and price.</li>
            <li>I have seen many forms of this kit, but this is the most reasonably price and very nice as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these, but I have no idea how to use them!</li>
            <li>They are huge.</li>
            <li>I am happy with these products and the different tools available in the package.</li>
            <li>I found several facebook vids that have great tips on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great, it actually works.it&#x27;s metal and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I find them easy and effective to use and I highly recommend them to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li>Use gently and they will help a ton!!!</li>
            <li>They are easily cleaned with a quick soak in isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li>The shipping on this product was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and easy sale.</li>
            <li>Nice and small; great for travel</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these little gadgets are!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Using clean tools and keeping the area clean with alcohol</li>
            <li>I clean them in alcohol and store in the slips they came in.</li>
            <li>You can clean out pores and take care of blemishes without damages the surrounding tissue.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is I didn&#x27;t find the results of the product to be as good as the product description describes.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and a lot better than the fingers.</li>
            <li>I can say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and she gets the job done pretty quick!</li>
            <li>A more extensive kit might be more practical than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are great products, a little tricky to figure out at first, you will have to google the use of each but great overall.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>The items are of good quality metal, with a nice weight to them, and seem like they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was very please at the fine workmanship.</li>
            <li>Leave your face alone otherwise, or just use a nice facial sponge.</li>
            <li>These are much better than my old zit poppers.  </li>
            <li>I wish it could have come with a case to store it in but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>the one I have were well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These aren&#x27;t complete magic, in that they do take some practice and maybe some learning to use well.  </li>
            <li>I love using these complete tool set.</li>
            <li>I hoped to use them to help clean out the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I also seem to be able to clean up problem spots before they become a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for responsible adults. :)</li>
            <li>These tools are great, but my whiteheads were too small to pop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is great, it really is more about how carefully you read the instructions and how carefully you use them.</li>
            <li>They are great at easily and cleanly removing the odd skin blemish like blackheads, whiteheads, and other problems like infected hair follicles.</li>
            <li>Very fast delievery</li>
            <li>My product was hard to find I was so happy they had my product.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they should do but follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using my fingers to remove blackheads this whole time!</li>
            <li>These are exactly what we need.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this better is if it came with instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am now able to remove deeply buried blackheads that my fingers cannot squeeze out.</li>
            <li>I stopped using them pretty much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what these could be used for as no one has pores that large.</li>
            <li>Tips tend to bend and the loops are a tad large.</li>
            <li>works great for black and white heads</li>
            <li>I thought they came in one case but they each were in different containers, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I could see if someone used them too much that you could damage your skin</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t leave indents on the skin as much.</li>
            <li>I use these, I don&#x27;t have as much scarring.  </li>
            <li>They can wreak havoc on your skin (especially if it&#x27;s mature skin).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is for</li>
            <li>but they dont really do much.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re high quality!</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Funny at first but then got old.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d had these tools, I would have been able to remove active acne lesions without damaging the nearby tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I did use a loop to scrape my nose, particularly on the sides, and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was of high quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were a more further, detailed set of instructions, not just a little sticky note sized paper that explains it in a couple sentences.</li>
            <li>I bought these mainly to control black-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tools were unexpectedly high quality, surgical metal.</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>I took a hot bath and used a mirror along with these little miracle workers and my face was so much cleaner!!!</li>
            <li>A certain type of person really enjoys medical videos.</li>
            <li>They do definitely extract my pores, but they kind of damage the surrounding tissue a little bit.</li>
            <li>I just would have expected a clean edge.</li>
            <li>that I have few breakouts any more, but I have young daughters that still suffer from our oily genes.</li>
            <li>but they definitely worked as expected. :)</li>
            <li>The thin round pressure sides are the best but also harsher on the skin than the oval shaped ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, a lot of the videos above can also be educational.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that their use is necessarily intuitive, but having watched the zit popping videos presented by physicians and other professionals, I knew how to use the tools appropriately.</li>
            <li>Must have tool for every adult who has blackhead issues!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve not mastered the technique of actually using them, save for one or two whiteheads that were on their way out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Currently using with glycolic peeling soap so whiteheads and blackheads come out cleanly when used properly.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, but the needle extractor isn&#x27;t as sharp and pointy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>They certainly give you different options for dealing with your blemishes.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE AT ALL SENSITIVE TO BLOOD AND SCENES OF GRISLY DEATH!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful but useful</li>
            <li>YouTube apparently requires that a lot of them be classified as educational, and there are several physicians that approach it with patient education in mind.</li>
            <li>There will be a small learning curve but you can easily master it.</li>
            <li>I consider myself to have somewhat large pores and decent sized black heads...</li>
            <li>I only really use the spade one and occasionally the lance.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave big red smudges like when you use your fingers!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on your skin while using, as you have red spots for several hours if you do.</li>
            <li>They can withstand some major pimple popping force.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have isn&#x27;t so much with the product, as it came with everything listed and it was shipped rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I think that is due to most people not taking few if any sterilizing precautions.  </li>
            <li>, only leaves a red mark if you press to hard, nevertheless, MUCH better method than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>Helps clear problem skin areas without brusing or causing further break outs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m old enough now</li>
            <li>These are only really good if you are someone with some serious black heads.  </li>
            <li>first time using I had a little trouble getting the technique down right (gently pressing and rocking from side to side to loosen the hair follicle), but the next day had it down right</li>
            <li>I also use medicated treatments to keep my skin clear and I have a facial steaming machine I use to open up my pores.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid, try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>The best zit popping videos do not have screaming idiots and shaky cameras, but instead have steady close ups and advice that can be used to improve your health.</li>

            <li> you can&#x27;t just bang them against your face and expect them to work magic.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wipe the effected area of skin with alcohol before and after.  </li>
            <li> I would love to give this five stars, but because no instructions are including, I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed by the quality for the low cost of this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with these.</li>
            <li> I found the needle and the eyehole the most efficent and safest tools for blackhead extracting.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have better luck using a safety pen.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought 3 more to give to my friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome, face feels way cleaner after a short &#x27;pop everything&#x27; session.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li> Watched many videos.</li>
            <li> However my wife seems to like these better that squeezing, so there&#x27;s that too.</li>
            <li> 5 star quality for sure.</li>
            <li> Working on better cleansing, but using the tools in this bundle to attack the whiteheads one by one</li>
            <li> I needed a new set as I had lost mine a while ago, and they all work beautifully.</li>
            <li> Very nice and works very well for a friend</li>
            <li> Great buy, came super fast!</li>
            <li> Has been working great so far.</li>
            <li> and she said she loved it and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Each tool comes with a plastic sleeve for storage, and you can easily combine all three tools into the largest sleeve for storage.</li>
            <li> Shipper/vender was very quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> okay, so it didn&#x27;t really work for me, kind of messed up my face.</li>
            <li> The metal is strong and durable.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the price.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fine for variety and price.</li>
            <li> I have seen many forms of this kit, but this is the most reasonably price and very nice as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these, but I have no idea how to use them!</li>
            <li> They are huge.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these products and the different tools available in the package.</li>
            <li> I found several facebook vids that have great tips on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great, it actually works.it&#x27;s metal and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I find them easy and effective to use and I highly recommend them to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> Use gently and they will help a ton!!!</li>
            <li> They are easily cleaned with a quick soak in isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and easy sale.</li>
            <li> Nice and small; great for travel</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these little gadgets are!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Using clean tools and keeping the area clean with alcohol</li>
            <li> I clean them in alcohol and store in the slips they came in.</li>
            <li> You can clean out pores and take care of blemishes without damages the surrounding tissue.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is I didn&#x27;t find the results of the product to be as good as the product description describes.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and a lot better than the fingers.</li>
            <li> I can say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and she gets the job done pretty quick!</li>
            <li> A more extensive kit might be more practical than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are great products, a little tricky to figure out at first, you will have to google the use of each but great overall.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> The items are of good quality metal, with a nice weight to them, and seem like they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was very please at the fine workmanship.</li>
            <li> Leave your face alone otherwise, or just use a nice facial sponge.</li>
            <li> These are much better than my old zit poppers.  </li>
            <li> I wish it could have come with a case to store it in but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> the one I have were well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t complete magic, in that they do take some practice and maybe some learning to use well.  </li>
            <li> I love using these complete tool set.</li>
            <li> I hoped to use them to help clean out the large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I also seem to be able to clean up problem spots before they become a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for responsible adults. :)</li>
            <li> These tools are great, but my whiteheads were too small to pop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is great, it really is more about how carefully you read the instructions and how carefully you use them.</li>
            <li> They are great at easily and cleanly removing the odd skin blemish like blackheads, whiteheads, and other problems like infected hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Very fast delievery</li>
            <li> My product was hard to find I was so happy they had my product.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they should do but follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using my fingers to remove blackheads this whole time!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what we need.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this better is if it came with instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am now able to remove deeply buried blackheads that my fingers cannot squeeze out.</li>
            <li> I stopped using them pretty much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these could be used for as no one has pores that large.</li>
            <li> Tips tend to bend and the loops are a tad large.</li>
            <li> works great for black and white heads</li>
            <li> I thought they came in one case but they each were in different containers, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I could see if someone used them too much that you could damage your skin</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t leave indents on the skin as much.</li>
            <li> I use these, I don&#x27;t have as much scarring.  </li>
            <li> They can wreak havoc on your skin (especially if it&#x27;s mature skin).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is for</li>
            <li> but they dont really do much.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re high quality!</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> Funny at first but then got old.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d had these tools, I would have been able to remove active acne lesions without damaging the nearby tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did use a loop to scrape my nose, particularly on the sides, and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was of high quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were a more further, detailed set of instructions, not just a little sticky note sized paper that explains it in a couple sentences.</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly to control black-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tools were unexpectedly high quality, surgical metal.</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> I took a hot bath and used a mirror along with these little miracle workers and my face was so much cleaner!!!</li>
            <li> A certain type of person really enjoys medical videos.</li>
            <li> They do definitely extract my pores, but they kind of damage the surrounding tissue a little bit.</li>
            <li> I just would have expected a clean edge.</li>
            <li> that I have few breakouts any more, but I have young daughters that still suffer from our oily genes.</li>
            <li> but they definitely worked as expected. :)</li>
            <li> The thin round pressure sides are the best but also harsher on the skin than the oval shaped ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, a lot of the videos above can also be educational.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that their use is necessarily intuitive, but having watched the zit popping videos presented by physicians and other professionals, I knew how to use the tools appropriately.</li>
            <li> Must have tool for every adult who has blackhead issues!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve not mastered the technique of actually using them, save for one or two whiteheads that were on their way out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Currently using with glycolic peeling soap so whiteheads and blackheads come out cleanly when used properly.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but the needle extractor isn&#x27;t as sharp and pointy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> They certainly give you different options for dealing with your blemishes.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE AT ALL SENSITIVE TO BLOOD AND SCENES OF GRISLY DEATH!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful but useful</li>
            <li> YouTube apparently requires that a lot of them be classified as educational, and there are several physicians that approach it with patient education in mind.</li>
            <li> There will be a small learning curve but you can easily master it.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to have somewhat large pores and decent sized black heads...</li>
            <li> I only really use the spade one and occasionally the lance.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave big red smudges like when you use your fingers!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on your skin while using, as you have red spots for several hours if you do.</li>
            <li> They can withstand some major pimple popping force.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have isn&#x27;t so much with the product, as it came with everything listed and it was shipped rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I think that is due to most people not taking few if any sterilizing precautions.  </li>
            <li> , only leaves a red mark if you press to hard, nevertheless, MUCH better method than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> Helps clear problem skin areas without brusing or causing further break outs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m old enough now</li>
            <li> These are only really good if you are someone with some serious black heads.  </li>
            <li> first time using I had a little trouble getting the technique down right (gently pressing and rocking from side to side to loosen the hair follicle), but the next day had it down right</li>
            <li> I also use medicated treatments to keep my skin clear and I have a facial steaming machine I use to open up my pores.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid, try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> The best zit popping videos do not have screaming idiots and shaky cameras, but instead have steady close ups and advice that can be used to improve your health.</li>
            <li> I bought and tried these tools based on what I&#x27;d seen in zit popping videos, and I&#x27;m impressed with their effectiveness even in the hands of a rank amateur.</li>
            <li> Since he works as a chimney sweep/installer/repairman he often comes home covered in soot and it hides in his larger pores no matter how long he showers (long!).  </li>
            <li> The extractor areas were far to big to work on all but the largest pimples - didn&#x27;t work at all for the small blackheads on my nose or chin.  </li>
            <li> I like this product but they are smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am a middle aged person that is still fighting acne.  </li>
            <li> maybe I just lack the skill to use these properly as I think a careful squeeze works just as well.</li>
            <li> Sharp needle only worked a couple of times.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be gone in a few seconds with no big red smudge or irritated skin!</li>
            <li> The only reason these do not get 5 stars is because one of the comedone extractor loops has already started to bend and become misshaped with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this a five star review is the needle has a slight barb on the end.</li>
            <li> I only wish the pointy one was a little sharper.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long!!!</li>
            <li> The beauty tools are exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> These items work exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> These tools are well built and work, but they don&#x27;t work as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Think the sharp point should be sharper.</li>
            <li> Very minimal to almost no scarring and redness.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> This spade tool lets me get black heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the Tweezerman one that I recently loss.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that pressing too hard will bend the tip somewhat, but then again, I press really hard.</li>
            <li> so BE CAREFUL!!!</li>
            <li> know many say popping zits is bad and can make it worse.  </li>
            <li> It is not strong, it yields with the presure on the face.</li>
            <li> I love everything from zit popping to the absolutely insane stuff found on Rotten.com</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Im not sure what is it used for ..</li>
            <li> The pieces are small.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that made me sad was that the product was so small that it fell out of a box while I was moving into college.</li>
            <li> Besides losing the product (because it is so small)</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with these items which came as a kit, I didn&#x27;t return them and regret that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not sure how some of these extractors work because they haven&#x27;t done anything when I tried using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at using it  :-/</li>
            <li> Got very dull very fast! :(</li>
            <li> can be painful if not used properly</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but at least now it&#x27;s an upgrade from just your fingernails.</li>
            <li> Does what it should do and less painfully than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> I found the tools difficult to use to remove the blackheads</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just for really bad pimples that need to be popped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how badly my pores were clogged with junk until I used these tools.</li>
            <li> Have a date and have an annoying lil blackhead?</li>
            <li> The others tools are worthless!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I believe it helped get some stubborn blackheads. Only thing I didn&#x27;t care, there wasn&#x27;t any instructions on how to properly use it. So I used Google to figure it out. But now that I know how to use it, I like it.</li>
            <li> Got very dull very fast! :( Sharp needle only worked a couple of times. The tools also rip through the plastic storage bags.</li>
            <li> christmas gift for my sister and she said she loved it and it worked very well.  she seemed very happy. would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly to avoid scarring.  Great product though!</li>
            <li> Requires a bit of finesse but perfectly as described</li>
            <li> This product is made of the great quality. A must have if you suffer from pimples. It does not heart to use it.</li>
            <li> Be careful but useful</li>
            <li> I found the tools difficult to use to remove the blackheads</li>
            <li> One end of 2 of the pieces bent and broke off.  Poor quality.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Finally, a tool set to deal with pesky pimples.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but at least now it&#x27;s an upgrade from just your fingernails.</li>
            <li> Think the sharp point should be sharper.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t finish it. Funny at first but then got old.</li>
            <li> The beauty tools are exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> These tools were unexpectedly high quality, surgical metal. I was very please at the fine workmanship. They are great at easily and cleanly removing the odd skin blemish like blackheads, whiteheads, and other problems like infected hair follicles. They are easily cleaned with a quick soak in isopropyl alcohol. These were a very good deal!</li>
            <li> A certain type of person really enjoys medical videos. A subset of that type enjoys videos of medical procedures. A minority of those weirdos gets into the gross videos like zit popping. I&#x27;m one of those psychos. I love everything from zit popping to the absolutely insane stuff found on Rotten.com (VIEWER DISCRETION REQUIRED THERE--DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ARE AT ALL SENSITIVE TO BLOOD AND SCENES OF GRISLY DEATH!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, a lot of the videos above can also be educational. YouTube apparently requires that a lot of them be classified as educational, and there are several physicians that approach it with patient education in mind. Those are where I learned about these tools. The best zit popping videos do not have screaming idiots and shaky cameras, but instead have steady close ups and advice that can be used to improve your health. These tools are what the professionals use to remove acne--for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m old enough now that I have few breakouts any more, but I have young daughters that still suffer from our oily genes. I bought and tried these tools based on what I&#x27;d seen in zit popping videos, and I&#x27;m impressed with their effectiveness even in the hands of a rank amateur. Growing up, I of course popped hundreds of zits the way we all know is damaging to the skin and I have the scars to show for it. If I&#x27;d had these tools, I would have been able to remove active acne lesions without damaging the nearby tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving these tools, I&#x27;ve had a couple opportunities to try them out, mostly on blackheads on my nose. It&#x27;s amazing how well they work! I don&#x27;t know that their use is necessarily intuitive, but having watched the zit popping videos presented by physicians and other professionals, I knew how to use the tools appropriately. I find them easy and effective to use and I highly recommend them to anyone with acne. Watch the videos or attain your training elsewhere, and use them in good health. And good looks!</li>
            <li> okay, so it didn&#x27;t really work for me, kind of messed up my face. :/ I think it&#x27;s just for really bad pimples that need to be popped. Leave your face alone otherwise, or just use a nice facial sponge.</li>
            <li> Is perfect. Just what I was looking for. I needed a new set as I had lost mine a while ago, and they all work beautifully. If you don&#x27;t know how to use them when you buy them - google it. Some of them are a bit tricky. There are techniques to using these tools...you can&#x27;t just bang them against your face and expect them to work magic. However these are great tools for good prices. The matte metal has a great feel to it.</li>
            <li> High quality.  These things are awesome.  They can withstand some major pimple popping force.&lt;br /&gt;When I whip these out at parties, people are all like &amp;#34;Ooooo!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product was quick and easy. The metal is strong and durable. The only downfall is I didn&#x27;t find the results of the product to be as good as the product description describes.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and it works like a charm. I liked that I could purchase all 3 at once.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are much better than my old zit poppers.  I only really use the spade one and occasionally the lance.  Just be sure to wipe the effected area of skin with alcohol before and after.  I also wipe and dip the tools in alcohol constantly when using.  These precautions help keep zits from reappearing spreading.  This spade tool lets me get black heads I didn&#x27;t even know where there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many say popping zits is bad and can make it worse.  I think that is due to most people not taking few if any sterilizing precautions.  Just squeezing them with their fingers, no washing or anything.  Using clean tools and keeping the area clean with alcohol I have never had problems with spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to minimize red marks afterward apply ice to any former zit for two minutes.  This is usually only necessary for white heads.</li>
            <li> I like these but thought they would be cheaper.  Get them if you have issues with zits and such. s</li>
            <li> Must have tool for every adult who has blackhead issues!</li>
            <li> I wish it could have come with a case to store it in but well worth the money. I only wish the pointy one was a little sharper.</li>
            <li> This nice lil&#x27; kit works great! Gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave big red smudges like when you use your fingers! Have a date and have an annoying lil blackhead? Use these and it&#x27;ll be gone in a few seconds with no big red smudge or irritated skin! If you don&#x27;t have these you should definitely get them ASAP!</li>
            <li> The items are of good quality metal, with a nice weight to them, and seem like they will last a long time.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve not mastered the technique of actually using them, save for one or two whiteheads that were on their way out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did use a loop to scrape my nose, particularly on the sides, and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who knows how to use them.  I would love to give this five stars, but because no instructions are including, I can&#x27;t.  However, I do see that their are directions posted here, so I&#x27;m going give it another try.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> These are great products, a little tricky to figure out at first, you will have to google the use of each but great overall.  the fact that there are 3 pieces in this it covers all types of pimples.  Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake or give you raccoon eyes. Don&#x27;t be afraid, try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> The quality of these implements is nice. The only problem is the size of the ends that are to be used as extractors. They are huge. I hoped to use them to help clean out the large pores on my nose. These were of no use to me. I don&#x27;t know what these could be used for as no one has pores that large.</li>
            <li> These tools are great, but my whiteheads were too small to pop. I only could get one which worked instantly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these, but I have no idea how to use them! Even after youtubing their uses I am at a loss. I wish I hadn&#x27;t opened the package so I could return them.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the set.</li>
            <li> I like these.  They&#x27;re handy to have for any skin eruptions without damaging the skin.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of white heads on my nose and the edges of my nose. I like the bundle, good quality and multi-purposes even though one of them Im not sure what is it used for ..</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything like this before but now that I have I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long!!! I didn&#x27;t know how badly my pores were clogged with junk until I used these tools. My pores are finally starting to shrink and I can tell my skin is cleaner because i&#x27;m getting the crud out!!! I also use medicated treatments to keep my skin clear and I have a facial steaming machine I use to open up my pores. The bathtub works great too though. I took a hot bath and used a mirror along with these little miracle workers and my face was so much cleaner!!! Don&#x27;t over do it because these things work incredibly effectively. I could see if someone used them too much that you could damage your skin so BE CAREFUL!!! Use gently and they will help a ton!!! I highly recommend for responsible adults. :)</li>
            <li> My product was hard to find I was so happy they had my product. It came quickly and easy sale. I will be buying form them again!</li>
            <li> Works very well, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> This is a good set for the price. The set includes instructions, identifying each tool with details on how to use each and sanitize during and after use, which I very much liked. Each tool comes with a plastic sleeve for storage, and you can easily combine all three tools into the largest sleeve for storage. The only reason I did not give this a five star review is the needle has a slight barb on the end. I&#x27;ve never owned a needle extractor, so perhaps this is correct, but it seemed as though it was a fault in the sharpening. This did not hinder my ability to use the tool, nor did I feel as though it was damaging. I just would have expected a clean edge.</li>
            <li> My wife chose these tools to use on my face. She says they make it very easy to get rid of the things on my face she doesn&#x27;t like. I can say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and she gets the job done pretty quick!</li>
            <li> The product came before the date it was promised. It was of high quality stainless steel. I was impressed by the quality for the low cost of this product.</li>
            <li> These are only really good if you are someone with some serious black heads.  I consider myself to have somewhat large pores and decent sized black heads...didn&#x27;t turn out so great.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the price. It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the Tweezerman one that I recently loss. But it&#x27;s fine for variety and price.</li>
            <li> The extractor areas were far to big to work on all but the largest pimples - didn&#x27;t work at all for the small blackheads on my nose or chin.  Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Wish I had these when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have seen many forms of this kit, but this is the most reasonably price and very nice as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with these. Very easy to use and they help with any skin blemishes. I clean them in alcohol and store in the slips they came in.</li>
            <li> Shipper/vender was very quick and efficient.  It just isn&#x27;t quality product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about these....I&#x27;m probably not using them correctly. I&#x27;ve watched several YouTube videos about them and I think the ones on there are wider so they don&#x27;t leave indents on the skin as much. They do definitely extract my pores, but they kind of damage the surrounding tissue a little bit. I stopped using them pretty much.</li>
            <li> Has been working great so far. Very sturdy and a lot better than the fingers.</li>
            <li> works great,Built well haven&#x27;t used all the tools but the one I have were well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great tool to have at home. The tools work well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller!</li>
            <li> I found the needle and the eyehole the most efficent and safest tools for blackhead extracting. The others tools are worthless! So you d only Need one tool instead of three!</li>
            <li> I am happy with these products and the different tools available in the package. I received proper instruction on how to use each tool before using it, and I would not recommend using these on yourself or anyone else without the proper technique. The only reason these do not get 5 stars is because one of the comedone extractor loops has already started to bend and become misshaped with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I like this product but they are smaller than I expected.  They do exactly what they should do but follow the instructions.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but the needle extractor isn&#x27;t as sharp and pointy as I thought it would be. You&#x27;d have better luck using a safety pen.</li>
            <li> I had to google how to use these instruments but they definitely worked as expected. :)</li>
            <li> These items work exactly as expected. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are good quality, but after having them for a week or 2, i don&#x27;t use them and find that they end up leaving more marks on my face than if I just use my fingers. The pointed end is just a sharpened piece of metal, mine is almost like a scalpel.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but awesome product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at using it  :-/</li>
            <li> Tips tend to bend and the loops are a tad large.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using my fingers to remove blackheads this whole time! This product is incredible! first time using I had a little trouble getting the technique down right (gently pressing and rocking from side to side to loosen the hair follicle), but the next day had it down right and it WORKS!! very easy on my skin, only leaves a red mark if you press to hard, nevertheless, MUCH better method than using your fingers. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> My ethestician niece is jealous of my purchase.  Buying her a set for her birthday!</li>
            <li> i dnt know what it is</li>
            <li> works great for black and white heads</li>
            <li> I wish I had found these years ago.  I am a middle aged person that is still fighting acne.  I bought these mainly to control black-heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t complete magic, in that they do take some practice and maybe some learning to use well.  I found several facebook vids that have great tips on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use these, I don&#x27;t have as much scarring.  I also seem to be able to clean up problem spots before they become a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use every tool in the set, fairly regularly.  I like them.</li>
            <li> Nice and small; great for travel</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these little gadgets are!  If you have a tendency to get clogged pores this is the way to take care of them.  You can clean out pores and take care of blemishes without damages the surrounding tissue.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> can be painful if not used properly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter kit.  The pieces are small.  They certainly give you different options for dealing with your blemishes.  A more extensive kit might be more practical than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Would definitely look up some how to&#x27;s before using.</li>
            <li> The thin round pressure sides are the best but also harsher on the skin than the oval shaped ones.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems using them. I thought they came in one case but they each were in different containers, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The product was good and fit well into the description. The only thing that made me sad was that the product was so small that it fell out of a box while I was moving into college. I still can&#x27;t find it, so I assume it&#x27;s gone. Besides losing the product (because it is so small) I liked the quality and job it did.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I wish I would have bought 3 more to give to my friends. Might be an nice gift idea!</li>
            <li> These tools are well built and work, but they don&#x27;t work as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome, face feels way cleaner after a short &#x27;pop everything&#x27; session.</li>
            <li> Very fast delievery and i loved the item..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great once you learn how to use each tool.</li>
            <li> warming!! Do NOT use these if you don&#x27;t know how. They can wreak havoc on your skin (especially if it&#x27;s mature skin).</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to include some sort of instruction sheet.  I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is for so I&#x27;ve been winging it. Otherwise I love it.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what we need.  Ours have not yet been recovered since our recent move - still in a mystery box somewhere.  My husband had severe acne when he was a teen, before the newer treatments, and it left him with some scarring.  Since he works as a chimney sweep/installer/repairman he often comes home covered in soot and it hides in his larger pores no matter how long he showers (long!).  Periodically I need to help him remove the blackheads and these tools are so much more efficient than bobby pins!  The two loop styles are best for this chore, and as a retired nurse, I believe the pointy tool is for piercing large whiteheads and cysts. I don&#x27;t recommend it because of the possibility of spreading the infection or pushing it deeper into subcutaneous tissue.  I believe cystic acne is always best left to dermatologists, who can instruct in best ways of control.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have isn&#x27;t so much with the product, as it came with everything listed and it was shipped rather quickly. I just wish there were a more further, detailed set of instructions, not just a little sticky note sized paper that explains it in a couple sentences.</li>
            <li> This hurt my face. I have tried this several times to use this. Watched many videos. This just bruised my face.</li>
            <li> Thought these would make removing blackheads and whiteheads easier but they dont really do much. I don&#x27;t have enormous facial pores which I think these are designed for.</li>
            <li> Great for removing blackheads. My only gripe is that pressing too hard will bend the tip somewhat, but then again, I press really hard.</li>
            <li> maybe I just lack the skill to use these properly as I think a careful squeeze works just as well. However my wife seems to like these better that squeezing, so there&#x27;s that too.</li>
            <li> Great, it actually works.it&#x27;s metal and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with these items which came as a kit, I didn&#x27;t return them and regret that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is not strong, it yields with the presure on the face.</li>
            <li> Good quality and sturdy. There will be a small learning curve but you can easily master it. Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on your skin while using, as you have red spots for several hours if you do. I plan to research on youtube the best methods for using these, as they do not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend wanted these so I got them for her she loves them and are good quality</li>
            <li> Great facial tools at a great price. They have many uses as you get a nice set. 5 star quality for sure.</li>
            <li> Very nice and works very well for a friend just that i wish the price was lower! but everythnig shipping and product was all as well</li>
            <li> Does what it should do and less painfully than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> Whiteheads everywhere!  Working on better cleansing, but using the tools in this bundle to attack the whiteheads one by one my face is clearing up.  Would definitely recommend for effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re high quality!</li>
            <li> Helpful. Good quality for cost.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job at extracting.</li>
            <li> Helps clear problem skin areas without brusing or causing further break outs.</li>
            <li> Great buy, came super fast!</li>
            <li> They work very well. I don&#x27;t use mine but once a month or so.  Don&#x27;t want to over do it and end up with scars on my face.</li>
            <li> Currently using with glycolic peeling soap so whiteheads and blackheads come out cleanly when used properly. Very minimal to almost no scarring and redness. I wish I bought this earlier. The only thing that would make this better is if it came with instructions on how to use. Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are very effective if you need a quick way to get rid of pimples, or to &amp;#34;pop them&amp;#34; safely, but be warned! They are addictive and you can end up damaging your skin if you don&#x27;t use them correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, it really is more about how carefully you read the instructions and how carefully you use them.</li>
            <li> Not sure how some of these extractors work because they haven&#x27;t done anything when I tried using them. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! As described! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love using these complete tool set. I am now able to remove deeply buried blackheads that my fingers cannot squeeze out.</li>
