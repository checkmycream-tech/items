            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL....</li>
            <li>Okay, that&#x27;s a smidgen of an exaggeration, but it&#x27;s close to accurate.  </li>
            <li>Has a really strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>This is a body spray, a light fragrance that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>love this scent, it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>there is a rich, intoxicating scent that captivates and enchants the senses.</li>
            <li>Smells okay not like pure coconut.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweeter than the old version but still nice.</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>I mix this with Lavannila Roller Ball true Vanilla.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this scent so so much.</li>
            <li>Omg, I had this in a travel size &amp; couldn&#x27;t resist getting a full size.</li>
            <li>It was extremely fast shipping, I&#x27;m so in love with this scent</li>
            <li>I use it along with the cool coconut surf lotion and spray.</li>
            <li>Love this,it smells like summer and sitting on the beach,it was just the pick me up I needed in the middle of winter after getting all the snow we just got,if you love the smell of sun tan oil and the beach</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly</li>
            <li>So coconutty and fresh and sweet.  </li>
            <li>A bit strong and not as much of a coconut scent as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Right after spraying is does have an alcohol smell but that leaves very fast.</li>
            <li>When I received it, it was exactly everything I imagined.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to say I like all Bath n&#x27;Body products.  </li>
            <li>First off let me say I absolutely LOVE bath sand body works, I have about twelve different scents.</li>
            <li>Almost everyday I get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>At first I got this particular Bath &amp; Body Works fragrance because it was the most inexpensive and only Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li>They smell like pure plastic.</li>
            <li>Very tropical scent.</li>
            <li>this pairs well with one million (rabanne) as well as B&amp;BW cashmere glow (another of my absolute favourites).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut.</li>
            <li>I really love Bath and Body Works products and this one is pretty typical.</li>
            <li>dont understand the bad reviews, its awesome... defs buy it.</li>
            <li>keep in mind that if you buy this in store it has a slightly different packaging sticker but as I can tell they are still the same exact scents.</li>
            <li>but I really MISS the coconut they used to have that actually smelled just like coconut without the flowers or vanilla mixed in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe the fragrance notes but to me it has a &amp;#34;vanilly&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;coconuty&amp;#34;, slightly fruity, &amp;#34;sunscreenish scent&amp;#34;...</li>

            <li> I gave it a four star only because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my others.</li>
            <li> But doesnt last long</li>
            <li> The scent doesnt last THAT long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I wear it all year long not just in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the spray and lotion absolutely STINK!!!</li>
            <li> But a simple trick especially if you have long hair which I do down to my waist, is to flip your hair over upside down and mist your hair all over.</li>
            <li> I typically layer my scents (using bodywash, lotion and fragrance too).</li>
            <li> but I just wish the smell lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> &amp; I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy fragrances online</li>
            <li> It smelled like cocoa butter, which is not a favorite scent for me.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical on if she&#x27;d like it or not only bc</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> Kinda just stinks.</li>
            <li> Even sprayed in the air it stinks.</li>
            <li> or I get sick of it.</li>
            <li> but this is just so horrible</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical. I don&#x27;t usually buy fragrances online and I feel like the price was changed the moment after I purchased, ripping me off about $5. But it arrived super fast and the scent is awesome. I was looking for something summery and coconutty and I got what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the body mist but I just wish the smell lasted a little longer. It&#x27;s great to use though if you already have the matching lotion.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and it&#x27;s the best!! I have a LOT of perfumes and body sprays and this one is the one I have been reaching for the most. It&#x27;s a wonderful summer scent!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice summer scent.  Not overpowering, not too flowery.  Smells like the beach.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Can&#x27;t wear it too many days in a row or I get sick of it. Good for price. Smells like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> It smelled like cocoa butter, which is not a favorite scent for me.</li>
            <li> Get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> So coconutty and fresh and sweet.  Perfect for a beach occasion.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! But doesnt last long</li>
            <li> love this scent, it&#x27;s my new favorite. wore it on vacation to the coast last fall and now every time I wear it I think about vacation, sand and surf :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like coconut.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like i thought it would, but i guess that&#x27;s my problem not the products.</li>
            <li> Love this! The scent is amazing and strong. Someone said it smelt like a plastic bag? No way. Very tropical scent. I dont smell too much coconut though but its still great. The scent doesnt last THAT long but thats the same for any perfume. I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> this is perhaps my most favourite fragrance. I absolutely love it. there is a rich, intoxicating scent that captivates and enchants the senses. this pairs well with one million (rabanne) as well as B&amp;BW cashmere glow (another of my absolute favourites).</li>
            <li> Love this scent and it stays with you throughout the day !!#</li>
            <li> At first I got this particular Bath &amp; Body Works fragrance because it was the most inexpensive and only Bath and Body Works body mist on Amazon Prime, as well as the fact that I love the scent of coconut. When I received it, it was exactly everything I imagined. I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe the fragrance notes but to me it has a &amp;#34;vanilly&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;coconuty&amp;#34;, slightly fruity, &amp;#34;sunscreenish scent&amp;#34;...lol. I am living in the Caribbean and I must say this is the perfect body mist for the summer, tropical vacations &amp; hot weather climates. Almost everyday I get compliments on how good I smell. I&#x27;m out all day from around 7am-6pm and it lasts all day. This will be my second bottle in 4 months &amp; I use it everyday. Love it!</li>
            <li> Has a really strong alcohol smell. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like coconut. Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> BB products are excellent</li>
            <li> I really love Bath and Body Works products and this one is pretty typical. A bit of floral and coconut definitely reminded me of Oahu. I would have given it a 5 star but I really MISS the coconut they used to have that actually smelled just like coconut without the flowers or vanilla mixed in. This is a body spray, a light fragrance that is not overpowering. I typically layer my scents (using bodywash, lotion and fragrance too). I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.  It&#x27;s sweeter than the old version but still nice.</li>
            <li> got this as a mothers day gift for my mom.. i was skeptical on if she&#x27;d like it or not only bc well.. i bought it online but believe me it smells amazing! we both love it! dont understand the bad reviews, its awesome... defs buy it.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations! Love it!</li>
            <li> Does not smell anything like coconuts... ? Kinda just stinks. Strong alcohol smell. True story. Doesn&#x27;t last all day... But does any fragrance last all day</li>
            <li> Smells great just wish the smell lasted longer</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> The only liquid I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon that didn&#x27;t leak in transit.  Okay, that&#x27;s a smidgen of an exaggeration, but it&#x27;s close to accurate.  Smells good, and the scent lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> A bit strong and not as much of a coconut scent as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Very good smell. A little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This spray has a wonderful light tropical smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t stay long but it&#x27;s inexpensive to buy and comes in a smaller purse size to freshen your scent throughout the day. Right after spraying is does have an alcohol smell but that leaves very fast. Especially if you rub it in wherever you spray it. One of my favorite uses is at the beach or when I wish I was. I mix this with Lavannila Roller Ball true Vanilla. They smell delicious together and awesome on their own. I know my husband sure loves this. he calls it yummy!! Says I always smell yummy now:) I gave it a four star only because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as my others. But a simple trick especially if you have long hair which I do down to my waist, is to flip your hair over upside down and mist your hair all over.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent so so much. I always get compliments on it and to be honest I wear it all year long not just in the warmer months. Will be buying again in bulk because I&#x27;m scared they might discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind that if you buy this in store it has a slightly different packaging sticker but as I can tell they are still the same exact scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product. It smells quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Smells okay not like pure coconut.  Also, you have to  spray on all day, doesn&#x27;t like.  would not buy again.</li>

            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say I like all Bath n&#x27;Body products.  If u like the feel of summer/beach on ur skin you will love this fragrance . It has that coconut, flowery fragrance that some suntan oils have which gives that great feeling of beachy suntans, and all around summer fun we remember at our fav&#x27; beach.&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance is awesome. I get compliments all the time when I&#x27;m wearing it. I also purchased the lotion..The duo is yummy together.&lt;br /&gt;Try it...U WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail!! It was extremely fast shipping, I&#x27;m so in love with this scent I&#x27;m definitely going to order more!!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> First off let me say I absolutely LOVE bath sand body works, I have about twelve different scents. The shower gel to this smells AMAZING but unfortunately the spray and lotion absolutely STINK!!! They smell like pure plastic. It&#x27;s like they bottled up a bunch of plastic bags and used it as perfume. Even sprayed in the air it stinks. If your looking into this set just buy the shower gel. I use it along with the cool coconut surf lotion and spray. I never write reviews but this is just so horrible I had to. I don&#x27;t want anyone to suffer like I did. I bought it during the January 2015 semi annual sale.</li>
            <li> Well wrapped to protect from breakage!  Arrived as promised!</li>
            <li> Great purchase, fast delivery, very pleased, seller recommended</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! The scent lingers. It reminds me of the tropics. LOVE all the line.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh reminds of my nonexistent trip to hawaii.Smells amazing! You could use this as a room spray and wouldnt run out for like 2 years!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL.... ITS AWESOME N COMPLAINTS</li>
