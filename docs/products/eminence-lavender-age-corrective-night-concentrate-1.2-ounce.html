            <li>about a month can see great results.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t look as puffy, and ok, let&#x27;s just be real honest...</li>

            <li>it is amazing and makes my face feel like silk....</li>
            <li>Absolute BEST stuff EVER!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Eminence, and this Lavender concentrate is amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I look any better</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Love the feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the aroma.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the wrinkles from increasing and makes my skin look so much better.  </li>
            <li>I use many Eminence products purchased through Amazon because I can get a much better price...</li>
            <li>While I want to love these products, for some reason eminence does not soak into my skin.</li>
            <li>Great natural eye care product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are premium products, and as such you a pay a bit more than what you will find in the drugstore, but a great complexion is worth it in my book.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great the next morning.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, and unlike most natural products good for sensitive skin, it doesnt have that odd texture that seems to rub off if you put anything else on your skin and smells great due to the lavendar.</li>
            <li>The only skin care line I really like after years of searching for good skin creme.</li>
            <li>and then eventually gets absorbed.</li>
            <li>Texturally, not crazy about it, but it has kept my face moisturized.</li>
            <li>Discovered this product line while receiving a facial and love it.</li>
            <li>Was introduce to this product by getting a facial and my face from one use felt so smooth and after usinf now</li>
            <li>It may take a while, but it&#x27;s worth the waiting for when you have clear glowing skin again.</li>
            <li>have been using this in conjunction with my other products for a few weeks, and I can honestly say I love it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and all Eminence products.</li>
            <li>As the weather gets cold and the air dryer, I am finding this moisturizer wonderful to use nightly and daily.  </li>
            <li>I have not been disappointed with ANY of their products and will continue to use them and order through Amazon...fast shipping and great products!!!</li>
            <li>I use it at night before bed, and my skin is really soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to recognize if it has truly reduced the appearance of fine lines, but I really like it as part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde in my early 60s with dry, sensitive skin, and the two together made a visible difference in my skin.</li>

            <li> works well on my sensitive skin, and in coordination with other Eminence products.</li>
            <li> As I have mentioned in my other reviews for Eminence products, I simply can&#x27;t say enough about them.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but you can catch a subtle whiff of lavender (which I absolutely love!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any big changes for the 2 months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately, I noticed less ruddiness when I woke up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a little over a month, and I already see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> me and my partner have been using this for a few months now and are amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it in the day time too to help with the dryness this crazy cold weather we have been experiencing.  </li>

I have been using them for a little over a month, and I already see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this in conjunction with my other products for a few weeks, and I can honestly say I love it. Almost immediately, I noticed less ruddiness when I woke up in the morning. My face didn&#x27;t look as puffy, and ok, let&#x27;s just be real honest...I didn&#x27;t look as haggard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once again, the scent!  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but you can catch a subtle whiff of lavender (which I absolutely love!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are premium products, and as such you a pay a bit more than what you will find in the drugstore, but a great complexion is worth it in my book.</li>

            <li> Absolute BEST stuff EVER!!!! I use just a drop morning and night...it is amazing and makes my face feel like silk....I use many Eminence products purchased through Amazon because I can get a much better price...I have not been disappointed with ANY of their products and will continue to use them and order through Amazon...fast shipping and great products!!!</li>
            <li> While I want to love these products, for some reason eminence does not soak into my skin. I feel it lathers up a lot and then eventually gets absorbed. Texturally, not crazy about it, but it has kept my face moisturized. Not sure I see any big changes for the 2 months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent night creme.  My skin looks great the next morning.</li>
            <li> Not for super-sensitive skin: has Ubiquinone aka Coenzyme Q10.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Eminence, and this Lavender concentrate is amazing. I use it at night before bed, and my skin is really soft in the morning. I highly recommend this and all Eminence products.</li>
            <li> My face had begun to have an allergic reaction, so I&#x27;ve discontinued use</li>
