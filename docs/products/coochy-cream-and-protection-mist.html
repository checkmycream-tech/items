            <li>Twice a day is perfect for me.  </li>

            <li>This product was a great price</li>

            <li>I Love Coochy Cream!</li>
            <li>I originally received this as a bachelorette gift and loved it ever since!</li>
            <li>Scent is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that the shaving cream is amazing, I will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li>kind of.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve done many things to try to prevent it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is kinda magic...</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>Waxing would probably be the better solution for that.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting.</li>
            <li>Love that this set came with the aftershave spray.  </li>
            <li>works ok not like</li>
            <li>Smells like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t seem to work much better than store brand shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more to girls with razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The mist is fantastic!</li>
            <li>And I love the smell (so does my boyfriend).</li>
            <li>The spray works ok, but I was more looking forward to using the cream.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to shave, smells amazing and leaves the skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I tend to get ingrown hairs easily</li>
            <li>This stuff is really great for sensitive areas like the bikini area, but it&#x27;s great for everything, especially if you&#x27;re prone to razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great - both for men and women shaving their private areas.</li>
            <li>razor burn free.  </li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and feel silky.  </li>
            <li>I love that one pump of the cream works for my whole leg!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would end my bikini bumps after reading so many reviews.</li>
            <li>It does give you a nice soft, close shave.   </li>
            <li>Nice and soft on the skin and</li>
            <li>her intimate area we shaved was better off not using this.</li>
            <li>The protection mist feels so nice and helps to prevent rashes and itching on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing good things about this product but when i read the back of the coochy cream bottle i realized that it is just conditioner</li>
            <li>My legs, armpits and bikini regions are silky smooth for the whole day!  </li>
            <li>With Coochy in the mix AND my regular shaving cream my legs are feeling pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>Will ALWAYS buy on amazon as it is such an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic it really does prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Shaving with the grain, sideways from the grain, soaking in warm water, exfoliating, bikini zone, different soaps, waxing, and Nair.  </li>
            <li>Its worth a try but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>It really is just like hair conditioner only a bit more moisturizing and when rubbed in the hands enough it will become a kind of whitish color that goes on better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was worth the purchase for the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>plus After Shaving Protection Mist (4 oz)]] just want to tell you thank you for makeing it right with me on this.</li>
            <li>The cream comes and a very large size</li>
            <li>The bottle says you can use it as hair conditioner - which wasn&#x27;t that great and for the price you could get the same effect  from Suave or some other cheap brand.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for my razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it I was not blown away or anything.</li>
            <li>I used it alone that first time</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and this product really helps for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and both the shaving cream and the the protective spray helps keep me from getting razor burn every time I shave.  </li>
            <li>but the smell isn&#x27;t strong enough for anyone else to smell.  </li>
            <li>leaves skin super smooth and soft, and it really does help with the reduction of red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li>The shave cream is also HUGE and is simply shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave lotion is very silky and I feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin as I&#x27;m shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed with the results.  </li>
            <li>I dont really know where to begin...</li>
            <li>I do this every time now and it leaves my hair much softer.</li>
            <li>I use it but can&#x27;t really tell if it is doing anything for me.</li>
            <li>I will pay closer attention to it and repost in a bit to tell you if it really does do anything.</li>
            <li>thanks ever so much                                   lisa lamar</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>This has made shaving so much easier for me...</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely adores this stuff</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body (legs, bikini area and under arms).</li>
            <li>It really does prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I plan to order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>My husband actually stole it from me previously and used it as his shave cream and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Seriously effective product - I still get a few ingrown hairs/ irritated bumps, but my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It smells funny because it has a lot of natural botanicals in it</li>
            <li>right at the beginning of my showers because once the shower is over and it&#x27;s time to shave the follicles are very soft and hah...are struck down by my blade easily.    </li>
            <li>This shave creme and slow growth spray as a concept are  a great idea, But this creme not only didn&#x27;t help to fight razor rash</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from the Slumber Parties company and looked for it on Amazon because it was kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>and I have been using Coochy for 6 year and won&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t live without this two products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>We use a combination of oldtime shave soap and vegitable oil for a clean shave, that takes days to grow back not like the reveiwed creme in which we had to shave the very next day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about half a month now and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Only I have yet to shave with it so far since it really could be a hassle.</li>
            <li>I do notice that my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not enough to really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t imagine shaving my \\&quot;sensitive</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any female that shaves.</li>
            <li>but I have to keep applying all day long and even then it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the problem completely.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I have to keep applying all day long and even then it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the problem completely.    </li>
            <li> I have used Coochy Cream in the past and was very please and expect the same results if this is the same product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve looked for a long time!</li>
            <li> you will never go back to other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> wont ever go back to other shaving gels, no sir.</li>
            <li> Just too bad that, because of the cute name, they can&#x27;t sell this stuff at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually positively covered in angry red bumps, but with Coochy, I&#x27;m silky-soft and far less irritated.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair down there and to me Coochy is hair conditioner for your pubes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptically about this at first since I am very sensitive down below and have to be very careful about everything I use.</li>
            <li> Then I saw this and, after much mental debate, ordered it.     </li>
            <li> then add about 3 pumps of Coochy to it and mix it together to create this thick foamy concoction that goes on my legs and gives me something to look at because Coochy by itself goes on clear.</li>
            <li> but I am skeptical about whether it really could stop ingrown hairs or itchies for such rough terrain.</li>
            <li> This does what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted this product mainly for my legs because no matter what expensive razor I bought (Venus Embrace) or what expensive shaving cream I got at the store</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for months now; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is much larger in the picture and when I received my package in the mail it was incredibly small and probably a travel size amount.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my legs, underarms(at night,after shave, NO deodorant), and other places.</li>
            <li> No more red bumps!!  </li>
            <li> Was buying this at a head shop and it cost me $15.00 for a bottle half the size.  </li>
            <li> only it comes in a bigger bottle and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Using moisturizer seems to help a little bit</li>
            <li> I shave my legs and bikini line with no or little issues of bumps.</li>
            <li> this shit is the bomb.</li>
            <li> My legs usually itch like crazy after shaving, but when I use the spray, my legs feel soft and moisturized immediately without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I still do get a few from time to time but not nearly as many as i use to while using something like bikini zone!</li>
            <li> The chemical smell of the spray is very harsh and I do not use it at all.</li>
            <li> i was shocked to get a new bottle in the mail.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t slow the growth at all.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I could say is that I received a defective pump on the cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same one that the stores sell that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well :( disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when it got here, because in the title it says cream AND spray, but it only came with the spray.</li>
            <li> Very hard to pump out as it has a safety guard on it that often clicks on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious!</li>
            <li> , My wife and i are very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I ordered this and only received the shave cream.  The protection mist was no where to be found.  Have not used the product itself yet.  I have used Coochy Cream in the past and was very please and expect the same results if this is the same product.  My husband actually stole it from me previously and used it as his shave cream and LOVED it.  Wish I could try the mist!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great - both for men and women shaving their private areas. The after mist works great to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for my razor bumps.  I tend to get ingrown hairs easily and I&#x27;ve done many things to try to prevent it.  Shaving with the grain, sideways from the grain, soaking in warm water, exfoliating, bikini zone, different soaps, waxing, and Nair.  Using moisturizer seems to help a little bit but I have to keep applying all day long and even then it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the problem completely.    With this product system, I don&#x27;t have to worry about soaking in water before I shave.  The shave lotion is very silky and I feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin as I&#x27;m shaving.  I do notice that my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast but it&#x27;s not enough to really make a difference.  I just get the leg prickle&#x27;s in the morning instead of in the evening.    As for my bikini zone, I&#x27;ve been using the after shave spray for about a week now.  I am absolutely amazed with the results.  It smells funny because it has a lot of natural botanicals in it but the smell isn&#x27;t strong enough for anyone else to smell.  I spray it on after I shave, then again in the evenings and mornings until I shave again.  Twice a day is perfect for me.  This product works.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only tried it after a close friend recommended it... Now I can&#x27;t imagine shaving my \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; without it. The spray is also wonderful for those who shave close and wear thongs - prevents rubbing/chaffing. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would end my bikini bumps after reading so many reviews. But even with using the spray daily I still got itchy bumps after a day or so.   It does give you a nice soft, close shave.   The bottle says you can use it as hair conditioner - which wasn&#x27;t that great and for the price you could get the same effect  from Suave or some other cheap brand.    Its worth a try but don&#x27;t expect a miracle. Feels like glorified conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of products before and never ended up razor burn free.  I had zero irritation when I used it.  I use it whenever I shave my legs or armpits.  My legs are smooth and feel silky.  This stuff is kinda magic...</li>
            <li> The cream works very good.  Nice and soft on the skin and the spray was an added plus.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything else! No razor burn or itchy bumps! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loves this and she recommends it to any and all women who shave anything on there bodies</li>
            <li> Coochy Shave Creame is a wonderful product.  My legs, armpits and bikini regions are silky smooth for the whole day!  I would highly recommend this product to any female that shaves.</li>
            <li> Product is great but the bottle has changed. Very hard to pump out as it has a safety guard on it that often clicks on.</li>
            <li> I have the after shave mist already and I wanted the same one again which is in the picture. It is much larger in the picture and when I received my package in the mail it was incredibly small and probably a travel size amount. The shave cream is also HUGE and is simply shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not correctly advertised in the picture nor in the description. Do not buy this unless you want a travel size after shave mist and a simple shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I dont really know where to begin...Hmmm. I have been using this for about half a month now and am not disappointed. I originally wanted this product mainly for my legs because no matter what expensive razor I bought (Venus Embrace) or what expensive shaving cream I got at the store my legs would always have some red bumps and skin that looked like it had been nicked a lot. It was starting to piss me off because I moisturize my legs all the timmmmme. Then I saw this and, after much mental debate, ordered it.     Now let&#x27;s see...how to describe the cream and my experience with it. When I first used it I was not blown away or anything. It really is just like hair conditioner only a bit more moisturizing and when rubbed in the hands enough it will become a kind of whitish color that goes on better. I used it alone that first time and it worked well enough. I decided though that it needed some help. I recommend this to everyone: add IT to your regular shaving cream. I just can&#x27;t get over not having foam. I like to squirt some of my SkinTimate shaving cream into my hand then add about 3 pumps of Coochy to it and mix it together to create this thick foamy concoction that goes on my legs and gives me something to look at because Coochy by itself goes on clear. I need guidelines okay? I want to see where I have shaved and where I need to shave next. This improved the product in my opinion. With Coochy in the mix AND my regular shaving cream my legs are feeling pretty damn good. So are my underarms. OH! I like to rub some Coochy on my underarms(and legs) right at the beginning of my showers because once the shower is over and it&#x27;s time to shave the follicles are very soft and hah...are struck down by my blade easily.    On a side note..kind of. I do use this on MY coochy. Only I have yet to shave with it so far since it really could be a hassle. I have very coarse hair down there and to me Coochy is hair conditioner for your pubes. I&#x27;m serious! Like I said before: apply at the beginning of the shower. I do this every time now and it leaves my hair much softer. I may shave with it one day but I am skeptical about whether it really could stop ingrown hairs or itchies for such rough terrain. Waxing would probably be the better solution for that.    I almost forgot about the After-shave Protection Mist stuff. It&#x27;s interesting. Smells like aloe...smells like medicine actually. I use it but can&#x27;t really tell if it is doing anything for me. I like to think it does. I spray it on my legs, underarms(at night,after shave, NO deodorant), and other places. It has a cooling sensation. It probably is helping some but I have been to focused on what the shaving cream does for me. I will pay closer attention to it and repost in a bit to tell you if it really does do anything.</li>
            <li> This shave creme and slow growth spray as a concept are  a great idea, But this creme not only didn&#x27;t help to fight razor rash it didn&#x27;t slow the growth at all. The creme smells good but thats about it, My wife and i are very disappointed in this product her intimate area we shaved was better off not using this. We use a combination of oldtime shave soap and vegitable oil for a clean shave, that takes days to grow back not like the reveiwed creme in which we had to shave the very next day.</li>
            <li> This product was a great price and I have been using Coochy for 6 year and won&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Seriously effective product - I still get a few ingrown hairs/ irritated bumps, but my skin is very sensitive. I&#x27;m usually positively covered in angry red bumps, but with Coochy, I&#x27;m silky-soft and far less irritated. I use it everywhere, including my legs and underarms, and I&#x27;ve been recommending Coochy to all my friends. 6/5 stars!</li>
            <li> Was buying this at a head shop and it cost me $15.00 for a bottle half the size.  Love that this set came with the aftershave spray.  Not sure what it does exactly but I use it.  The set I received is different from the photo, it&#x27;s a newer looking design for both the shave cream and aftershave spray.  Will ALWAYS buy on amazon as it is such an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes, it helps with in-growns and just overall smoothness wherever you use it.  Scent is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I Love Coochy Cream! I have never found something that works so well...and I&#x27;ve looked for a long time! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and this product really helps for a smooth shave. The protection mist feels so nice and helps to prevent rashes and itching on sensitive skin. It smells really nice too!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001W3YQZO Coochy Shave Cream Pear Berry (16 oz) plus After Shaving Protection Mist (4 oz)]] just want to tell you thank you for makeing it right with me on this. if anybody has not ever used this cream. just try it. and men my hubby shaves his face and his head with it and now thats all we uses. you will never go back to other shaving creams. when you shiped the  roungh  bottale i was shocked to get a new bottle in the mail. and at no charg. thanks ever so much                                   lisa lamar</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing good things about this product but when i read the back of the coochy cream bottle i realized that it is just conditioner it&#x27;s the same consistency and the bottle says you can use it in your hair as conditioner!! (save your money and buy some suave!) I do however like the smell of this product. I am giving this product 4 stars because i will be repurchasing the protection mist! it&#x27;s fantastic it really does prevent ingrown hairs. I still do get a few from time to time but not nearly as many as i use to while using something like bikini zone!</li>
            <li> this shit is the bomb. wont ever go back to other shaving gels, no sir. leaves skin super smooth and soft, and it really does help with the reduction of red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from the Slumber Parties company and looked for it on Amazon because it was kind of expensive. I decided to try this product to see if it was similar. It is just like the Coochy shaving cream I bought from Slumber Parties only it comes in a bigger bottle and is less expensive. My skin is very soft after shaving. My husband uses it too and loves it!</li>
            <li> works ok not like it did 10 years ago i think it is made differnetly now. fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t seem to work much better than store brand shaving cream. I still get some razor burn.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that the shaving cream is amazing, I will never use anything else ever again. It makes it so easy to shave, smells amazing and leaves the skin incredibly smooth. The only reason I&#x27;m deducting a star is because of the scent of the spray. The chemical smell of the spray is very harsh and I do not use it at all. Yes, it does work but I&#x27;m sensitive to smell and I like smelling good so it would&#x27;ve been great if it was scented like the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was worth the purchase for the shaving cream. I will repurchase as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t live without this two products.  My skin is super sensitive and both the shaving cream and the the protective spray helps keep me from getting razor burn every time I shave.  I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion after spraying the mist on my legs.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more to girls with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I love that one pump of the cream works for my whole leg! It&#x27;s going to last a loooong time. It smells good an allows for a nick-free close shave. The mist is fantastic! My legs usually itch like crazy after shaving, but when I use the spray, my legs feel soft and moisturized immediately without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptically about this at first since I am very sensitive down below and have to be very careful about everything I use. But, I have used both products several times now and NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!! And I love the smell (so does my boyfriend). This has made shaving so much easier for me...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> This does what I expected it to do. I shave my legs and bikini line with no or little issues of bumps. It works well with my husbands neckline as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered. I ordered what was in the picture but got something different. I am very disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely adores this stuff</li>
            <li> I ordered this because this is the brand I love and couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores, sadly when I received it in the mail it wasn&#x27;t the brand that&#x27;s pictured it&#x27;s the same one that the stores sell that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well :( disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when it got here, because in the title it says cream AND spray, but it only came with the spray. The spray works ok, but I was more looking forward to using the cream.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found this! I originally received this as a bachelorette gift and loved it ever since!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth. I use it on my whole body (legs, bikini area and under arms). The cream comes and a very large size and I have been using it for months now; a little goes a long way. The only bad thing I could say is that I received a defective pump on the cream. Other than that I plan to order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> No more red bumps!!  This stuff is really great for sensitive areas like the bikini area, but it&#x27;s great for everything, especially if you&#x27;re prone to razor burn.  The protection mist is a must have as well.  It really does prevent ingrown hairs.  Just too bad that, because of the cute name, they can&#x27;t sell this stuff at your local drug store.</li>
