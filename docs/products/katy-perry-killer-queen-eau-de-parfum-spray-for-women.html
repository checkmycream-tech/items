            <li>I received a sample of Killer Queen by Katy Perry to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Perfect size &amp; the real deal</li>
            <li>so it is a nice change.</li>
            <li>I love Katy Perry&#x27;s music, and I Loved Queen and their &amp;#34;Killer Queen&amp;#34;music, so</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just my own preference though</li>
            <li>I liked it and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>The unique bottle is great, but It would have been nice if it came with a stand.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite perfume!!!</li>
            <li>Great scent, a bit spicy without an over powering sweet smell.  </li>

            <li>:) I love all of Katy&#x27;s perfumes but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Not too strong at all!</li>
            <li>Loved it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>Got this item at a great price per ounce and fast shipping from the seller !</li>
            <li>Package came in a medium sized box, the bottle was very secure.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, kind of sweet, kind of fruity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Killer Queen is pleasant and easy to wear, but it&#x27;s just not anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li>We loved it so much, my nephew and I both purchased one!!</li>
            <li>this bottle is huge!</li>

            <li>One of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
            <li>I really love this perfume.</li>
            <li>but it still has a light and playful kind of smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I bought it twice in about a year, I use it all the time, I love it.</li>
            <li>The musk scent is most prominent, and I&#x27;m almost convinced a man could get away with wearing it too.</li>
            <li>I like it, but don&#x27;t love love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to her Revolution perfume which I totally love.</li>
            <li>LOvely fragance.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume I just wish it came with a stand.</li>

            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Much better than Pur.</li>
            <li>Either way, love the scent.</li>
            <li>Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I love Katy&#x27;s Purr, and her Meow, but Kill Queen smells too spicy for me.  </li>
            <li>So it was okay, just not for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this smells</li>
            <li>and it was such a great deal!</li>
            <li>I guess that Coty just wanted to use the exotic name in the description, but used something else in the perfume instead,</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I really love this sent.</li>

            <li>GRAND DAUGHTER  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments for it.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfume that my husband and I both love, and this is it.  </li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very neat bottle that looks great on my shelf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something more....</li>
            <li>more adult-like.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>More of a floral rather than</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied if she is</li>
            <li>I get the most whiff of bergamot and patchouly in this</li>
            <li>Was expecting something better.</li>
            <li>this product. :)</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love.</li>
            <li>but i love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Why I love this product:  </li>
            <li>I keep this on my counter in my bathroom and it looks stunning.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Great price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I should have researched this better because I would have preferred to receive a stand with this bottle.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent ever!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and I love smeeling it on her</li>
            <li>The vial-shaped bottle is actually the best thing about it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the perfume just for that reason.</li>
            <li>and I love katy perry .</li>
            <li>and I love the bottle design.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, safely packaged and a great product.</li>
            <li>I love it more than my Chanel-</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and the fragrance stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>She really likes it and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It is now my favorite go-to scent</li>
            <li>well it arrived fast, smells great</li>
            <li>Will buy again :)</li>
            <li>I do love it however, and love the bottle which lays on it&#x27;s side.  </li>
            <li>The bottle shape is very unique.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much and the price I got it for is amazing!</li>
            <li>Having it lay on its side definitely detracts from the beautiful bottle and you don&#x27;t get the nice appearance of the color gradient as shown.</li>
            <li>but this one, i keep smelling all day long :) love it!!!</li>
            <li>The smell stays on all day long and is just WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>Loved this perfume so much!</li>
            <li>My Mom loved it so much too, so my Dad just bought it for her for Valentine&#x27;s day!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m hoping my mother can fashion something for me, since she works with all kind of materials to build with.</li>
            <li>This perfume is really strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t use more than a 2-3 sprays.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this perfume with all the good reviews</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large, good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful it smells really nice for anyone you young and old can wear this  </li>
            <li>It is a light airy scent that makes you feel feminine and confident.</li>
            <li>However, the top piece is cheap plastic</li>
            <li>My neice was so happy and surprised that she received this gift.  </li>
            <li>A great perfume for a young woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the smell, and she is absolutely &amp;</li>
            <li>love this new scent, and Freddie would have loved it too.</li>
            <li>Its very light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is perfect for those of use that like things a little more spicy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting on it to go on sale because I will not pay full price for perfumes!</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my daughter who loves it because the musk smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Alittle strong for me</li>
            <li>Oh God why.... this smells like a combination of strong soap and mens aftershave...</li>
            <li>packaging/bottle design wise) while retaining a youthful (not tween), vibrant scent within the glass Ruby-shaped bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly strong but it does tend to taper off throughout the day, which I am fine with, because I dislike when people carry around a miasma of overly strong perfume.</li>
            <li>Literally my favorite scent ever and so much for such a great price!</li>
            <li>She keeps it in her/guest bathroom on the counter because it is so beautiful and different!</li>
            <li>More of a sweet musky.</li>
            <li>and so quickly too!</li>
            <li>This perfume is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Bottle is unique and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I took a huge gamble</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>Bottle could have been filled with water.</li>
            <li>but this price is great especially for the 3.4 ounce size!</li>
            <li>Fantastic price.</li>
            <li>My primary perfume choices are Chanel Chance and Vera Wang.</li>
            <li>A nice gentle floral scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and would highly recommend to any women who loves turns heads with their scent!</li>
            <li>but it is actually a light fragrance</li>
            <li>So happy to have made a right choice for my 12 year old Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a very warm, mysterious scent.  </li>
            <li>The bottle shape is fun to hold and looks beautiful enough to display.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very fast, packaged safely,</li>
            <li>love it, it&#x27;s probably my new favorite smell.</li>
            <li>and when I went to pull the top off the first time the medallion broke off in my hand.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Killer Queen opens with a rich plum note.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received the email that I did not even both to look at the pictures of the bottle.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so fun!</li>
            <li>but I wanted the original.</li>
            <li>This bottle requires the stand because of its unique shape in order to stand up.</li>
            <li>but I do put more on later in the day just because I love it and want to smell it more.</li>
            <li>Huge, beautiful bottle with lovely scent that I feel would attract young adults to middle age adults.  </li>
            <li>I adore this new and amazing perfume by Katy Perry.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume its my favorite that I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>An excellent fruity lightly floral fragrance that is just right and not overwhelming ever.  </li>
            <li>Bought for a special lady in my life and she loves it.</li>
            <li>but, boy were they right!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Killer Queen doesn&#x27;t have a unique stamp of it&#x27;s own to make it stand out from the crowd, and it is not something that I&#x27;d imagine Katy herself actually wearing.ct, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and authentic product.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it smells good and lasting</li>
            <li>so i wanted the full bottle.</li>
            <li>Teenage daughter loved this gift.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Sweet, yet with a not-so-subtle bite to it.  </li>
            <li>Musky and fruity without being too sweet.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s full of perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but SOO</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I always get compliments where ever I am...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet n sudductive&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased a second bottle from Amazon as my sister kept using my perfume every time she came over, so I got her a bottle of her own for her birthday - she was thrilled and loves it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I love Katy Perry, and I like the scent, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Purr.  </li>
            <li>The smell for killer queen is nice if you like soft sweet perfumes, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>It has quickly became one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so big for such an amazing price!!!</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and as described</li>
            <li>quick to ship, item as described.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, glad I purchased it, but wish it was longer lasting.</li>
            <li>It is authentic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Killer Queen doesn&#x27;t have a unique stamp of it&#x27;s own to make it stand out from the crowd, and it is not something that I&#x27;d imagine Katy herself actually wearing.</li>
            <li>I already own her other two perfumes, but Meow had become my favorite when compared to Purr.</li>
            <li>Reminds me somewhat of Fantasy by Britney Spears, but it definitely has it&#x27;s own unique spin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty as well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great once when u spray but takes less than 10 minutes to fade.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but is not very strong.  </li>
            <li>but nope, again, this is all sexy bergamot and patchouli with some sweet undertones to keep it young and feminine.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, just perfect!</li>
            <li>Found this at a store for twice as much with only 1 fl oz...was so excited to receive this for such a great price!</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more once I run out!  </li>
            <li>I feel like I need to either spray a lot at first or carry it with me for respraying during the day!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real thing!!</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, not too strong but present, gets compliments.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand, because the bottle is designed to lay on its side just fine</li>
            <li>The name is a bit odd, but the perfume is very nice.</li>
            <li>Probably could have saved a few dollars,  great scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like the light fragrance</li>
            <li>And for the price it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the 22$.</li>
            <li>A+ for a really nice fragrance, especially in the celebrity perfume category.</li>
            <li>you are really only able to keep it in the cheap plastic that came in the box</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Came 3 days later than supposed to, but other than that very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it at a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li>and then I read other mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need KQ right now</li>
            <li>FedEx dropped it off right on my porch.</li>
            <li>and it is totally different from the Katy Perry Royal Revolution which to me that one is more sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance smells very nice and not strong.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cool and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really floral or sweet</li>
            <li>The only drawback I have experienced is the short life of the scent.</li>
            <li>My other daughter is very pleased.</li>
            <li>As such the bottle only really sits on it&#x27;s side which sort of diminishes the effect of the beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li>the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>It still has a pleasant smell but it is not just plain fruity smelling.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy it when I run out :)</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty and the scent divine.  </li>
            <li>personally dont love it anymore</li>
            <li>Love the smell, big bottle.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>the bottle is big and adorable.</li>
            <li>Bought this item as a gift because of name recognition at first</li>
            <li>I first saw it as a sample in a magazine and just had to have it.</li>
            <li>It actually gets better the longer you&#x27;ve been wearing it.</li>
            <li>The bottle in a pretty</li>
            <li>This perfume smells exactly like Lancome&#x27;s La Vie Est Belle and Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a money savvy (or broke/cheap) girl like me that still wants a taste of the luxe life, get this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to overlook that.  </li>
            <li>It took a long time to arrive which was a problem because it was supposed to be a Christmas present but otherwise great product</li>
            <li>one spray of that perfume is equal to 7 ( or more) sprays of this stuff, cancelling out any savings.</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li>I like the bottle though, and so does my boyfriend, he wants to steal the bottle from me!  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like how I picture Katy Perry would smell, like candy and Heaven.</li>
            <li>and I asked a few of my guy coworkers if they thought it smelled good.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not long lasting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweeter than most perfumes, without the cloying, choking lack of subtlety of 99% of other sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li>One guy&#x27;s face turned red and he had a huge smile on his face.</li>
            <li>Love it and get stopped by random people while running errands asking what perfume I wear because I smell so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price, but definitely for a younger crowd.</li>
            <li>If this makes sense it is a scent that I like for fall or winter but would probably not wear it in the summer months because I usually pick more floral or clean fresh scents for summer.</li>
            <li>The description is apt because it&#x27;s sort of like dark berries and clove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully, they sell this for a long time, because I never intend to use anything else! :)</li>
            <li>I quickly accepted and was so surprised when I received the product.</li>
            <li>This scent is often compared to a certain designer perfume but</li>
            <li>Is sweet, SUPER strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>When I was asked to try Killer Queen by Katy Perry, I barely read the email because I was so excited.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, it is the entire reason I purchased it (also, I bought the first bottle from Dillard&#x27;s and it came with a really nifty white travel bag).  </li>
            <li>For that reason I am glad I got the larger size for just a little more money.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li>and I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>But when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t really digging the smell on me.</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t really think that diminishes the beauty).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My wife really like it and wears it every day.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is very feminine without being girly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral with berry and very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this fragrance.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I apply in one go.  </li>
            <li>It smells more musky and elderly than I expected.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and really wanted to like it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to say that I&#x27;m a male reviewer.  </li>
            <li>Going to the local perfume store at the mall, we tested many different female scents and so many of them gave us headaches.  </li>
            <li>and it just takes up too much room on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not normally a big fan of the celebrity perfumes because I tend to think they smell a bit cheap as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So yea I really recommend getting.</li>
            <li>Ordered wednesday and received by Monday with the free standard shipping.</li>
            <li>Expected a more favorable smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the scent</li>
            <li>Nice big size that will last quite a while too.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not to crazy about most perfumes so this is good stuff</li>
            <li>I love perfumes with praline and/or vanilla in, but this is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me - it reminds me of other perfumes all the way through.</li>
            <li>Smells much better than her other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have the other Katy Perry scents and this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>But once you get it you&#x27;ll be comfortable with the bottle as the weight of the bottle is flat and it doesn&#x27;t spill either.</li>
            <li>The scent is a phenomenal blend of amber and musk, with a sharp citrus splash.  </li>
            <li>A nice scent and semi long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of perfume where it gets to the room ten steps before you do, and hangs around long after you&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li>a new company now in charge of the Katy Perry fragrances, Katy promising a new mature image, the meaning behind the perfume&#x27;s name, and the marketing campaign for this product, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day, I do usually have to spritz on a bit more before going out at night, and it smells sweet without smelling like a little girls candy perfume.</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool looking also, but it doesn&#x27;t stand up, it sits sideways since there is no flat surface on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not anything special, just a regular perfume.</li>
            <li>Can be a little strong!</li>
            <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t normally wear perfume but really likes this.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I found a place that had a full sized bottle on display and it smelled totally different.</li>
            <li>really likes new Frangance....</li>
            <li>However, when buying in stores, you pay A LOT more for A LOT less.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for an older woman who wears Chanel or Dior.</li>
            <li>On my skin, the main notes that pop out are the berries, plum and patchouli.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, and it has decent staying power.</li>
            <li>The scent makes for a great everyday perfume as long as you don&#x27;t mind bringing some with you for frequent touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>and then there are VERY VERY GENTLE AND NOT SHARP desert and berry tones...</li>
            <li>; I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this fragrance</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume to another person.</li>
            <li>Definitely a little stronger scent, probably more directed at evening outtings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not familiar with celosia, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to smell appealing -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but not super unique or long-lasting.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bold and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they tried too hard to mix sweet with spicy and there are too many notes mixed in.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new fragrance and came across this in a mailer.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and I&#x27;ve had no problem with this.</li>
            <li>i love how they even sent samples of other perfume!!!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just use to higher priced perfume (which I will go back to)</li>
            <li>First time I purchased a much smaller bottle from Sephora.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume of all time (and I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about that.)</li>
            <li>I have never smelled anything like this, Wow!</li>
            <li>I would take away one star as the scent does not last all day - but the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li>In a day of crushing men&#x27;s souls and taking down the patriarchy, I want to smell like the flowers I water with the blood of my enemies.</li>
            <li>I was using &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel&amp;#34; but after smelling this, I have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet and soft reminds me of shakira s florale (the pink bottle) however by the time I got home</li>
            <li>The bottle is a dark red with a gold top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled the other Katy Perry scents and they&#x27;re just too sweet for me</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance but would like it to last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>It was sealed in a clear plastic wrap inside of the box.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Old Spice after shave, and I have never&lt;br /&gt;liked that smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Official scent notes; wild berries, plum, bergamot, Celosia, jasmine, plumeria, cashmere, patchouli and liquid</li>
            <li>However the result is still &#x27;young&#x27; and unoriginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the result is still &#x27;young&#x27; and unoriginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells so soft and sensual.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas</li>
            <li>so her 12 year old daughter used some of her savings to purchase this item for her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mature but</li>
            <li>May be too mature for some teens, but could suit others.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I was really apprehensive only because I never know what to expect when ordering perfume offline.</li>
            <li>Bought this perfume as a late Christmas gift to my mother and I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really interesting, complex perfume...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to get the purple and blue bottles as well, but I do not care for the scents as much as I like this one.</li>
            <li>The perfume was bought for my 21year old daughter</li>
            <li>A smaller bottle costs twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li>I think Katy perry really did it big with this one .</li>
            <li>I am really pleasantly surprised at how much I love the scent, plus, it arrived sooner than it was supposed to by at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>the only downside is that the bottle cant stand up right unless you purchase the stand but not a big deal.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a slightly stronger scent, but it&#x27;s not all overpowering, while still having a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>I grew up with sweet smelling perfumes, particularly ones with caramel notes, but I don&#x27;t like wearing them nowadays as I think they smell too juvenile and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a huge sucker for the color red.  </li>
            <li>but it lays down and is fine, not a big hang up.</li>
            <li>Being as I can&#x27;t find my Christian Dior original Poison perfume, I had to look around and test out some other perfumes</li>
            <li>I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands.  </li>
            <li>But still a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that I wish the bottle came with some kind of stand, otherwise you just have to lay it on its side, which is such a waste for such a regal-looking bottle.</li>
            <li>The soft, creamy praline adds a slight nuttiness so it is a warm, comforting mix, which does lend a teensy bit of a different air to Killer Queen as it dries down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally a fan of her scents but this one is my new night out scent!</li>
            <li>The final drydown reminds me of La Vie Est Belle, so there&#x27;s nothing new here</li>
            <li>The scent seems to last pretty long</li>
            <li>Dumb name and goofy advertising photo with Katie Perry, but</li>
            <li>I am not sure it lasts very long, however when I put it on I just love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy, mysterious and subtle.</li>
            <li>I assumed when I bought this bottle, or at least the biggest size available, that it would also come with the stand that it is displayed on in the stores.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Katy&#x27;s 3rd fragrance is mature (</li>
            <li>it was only natural that I would want to try this scent.  </li>
            <li>but it came with that top part broken and that kinda ruined the beauty of that bottle</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t guess what - I am not able to separate any floral notes from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance, as the praline develops and mixes with the patchouli, lasting for the duration of the perfume.</li>
            <li>This is dark and almost musky with a hint of floral to it, which I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Actually really like this musky smell - the only other perfume I like is Opium</li>
            <li>loved the scent, container very difficult should have some type of stand.  </li>
            <li>It is a deep scent without being heavy and it lasts a long time unlike some reviews that say it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I was really worried that this would smell like the blue version of this which I had read a review that said it &amp;#34;smelled like cotton candy on crack.&amp;#34; I hate floral scents and super sweet scents.</li>
            <li>Decided to get another bottle on Amazon, and to my delight, the much larger bottle looks and smells exactly the same, and I paid less!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
            <li> She liked it.</li>
            <li> because although I liked the smell of this parfum spray the smell is gone within 30-40 minutes of putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of Killer Queen by Katy Perry to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Perfect size &amp; the real deal</li>
            <li> so it is a nice change.</li>
            <li> I love Katy Perry&#x27;s music, and I Loved Queen and their &amp;#34;Killer Queen&amp;#34;music, so</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just my own preference though</li>
            <li> I liked it and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> The unique bottle is great, but It would have been nice if it came with a stand.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Great scent, a bit spicy without an over powering sweet smell.  </li>

            <li> Loved it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Got this item at a great price per ounce and fast shipping from the seller !</li>
            <li> Package came in a medium sized box, the bottle was very secure.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, kind of sweet, kind of fruity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Killer Queen is pleasant and easy to wear, but it&#x27;s just not anything to get excited about.</li>
            <li> We loved it so much, my nephew and I both purchased one!!</li>

            <li> One of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume.</li>
            <li> but it still has a light and playful kind of smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I bought it twice in about a year, I use it all the time, I love it.</li>
            <li> The musk scent is most prominent, and I&#x27;m almost convinced a man could get away with wearing it too.</li>
            <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t love love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to her Revolution perfume which I totally love.</li>
            <li> LOvely fragance.</li>

            <li> Much better than Pur.</li>
            <li> Either way, love the scent.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I love Katy&#x27;s Purr, and her Meow, but Kill Queen smells too spicy for me.  </li>
            <li> So it was okay, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this smells</li>
            <li> and it was such a great deal!</li>
            <li> I guess that Coty just wanted to use the exotic name in the description, but used something else in the perfume instead,</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I really love this sent.</li>
            <li> She thought it smelled similar to be delicious.</li>

            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I would still purchase the product but keep in mind you may need to reapply throughout the day. :-)</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not so sure anymore.</li>
            <li> GREAT price &amp; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really love it and will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I love the container.</li>
            <li> She loves it, but I find it to be cloying and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> GRAND DAUGHTER  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments for it.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfume that my husband and I both love, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Killer Queen by Katy Perry is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> I love wearing this one.  </li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this scent.</li>
            <li> love this perfume</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was a better bargain than purchasing thru the retail vendors.</li>
            <li> As celebrity fragrances go, this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very neat bottle that looks great on my shelf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something more....</li>
            <li> more adult-like.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> More of a floral rather than</li>
            <li> Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied if she is</li>
            <li> I get the most whiff of bergamot and patchouly in this</li>
            <li> Was expecting something better.</li>
            <li> this product. :)</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love.</li>
            <li> but i love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Why I love this product:  </li>
            <li> I keep this on my counter in my bathroom and it looks stunning.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Great price with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I should have researched this better because I would have preferred to receive a stand with this bottle.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> and I love smeeling it on her</li>
            <li> The vial-shaped bottle is actually the best thing about it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the perfume just for that reason.</li>
            <li> and I love katy perry .</li>
            <li> and I love the bottle design.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, safely packaged and a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it more than my Chanel-</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the fragrance stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> She really likes it and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It is now my favorite go-to scent</li>
            <li> well it arrived fast, smells great</li>
            <li> Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I do love it however, and love the bottle which lays on it&#x27;s side.  </li>
            <li> The bottle shape is very unique.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much and the price I got it for is amazing!</li>
            <li> Having it lay on its side definitely detracts from the beautiful bottle and you don&#x27;t get the nice appearance of the color gradient as shown.</li>
            <li> but this one, i keep smelling all day long :) love it!!!</li>
            <li> The smell stays on all day long and is just WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume so much!</li>
            <li> My Mom loved it so much too, so my Dad just bought it for her for Valentine&#x27;s day!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m hoping my mother can fashion something for me, since she works with all kind of materials to build with.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t use more than a 2-3 sprays.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this perfume with all the good reviews</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large, good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful it smells really nice for anyone you young and old can wear this  </li>
            <li> It is a light airy scent that makes you feel feminine and confident.</li>
            <li> However, the top piece is cheap plastic</li>
            <li> My neice was so happy and surprised that she received this gift.  </li>
            <li> A great perfume for a young woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, and she is absolutely &amp;</li>
            <li> love this new scent, and Freddie would have loved it too.</li>
            <li> Its very light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is perfect for those of use that like things a little more spicy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting on it to go on sale because I will not pay full price for perfumes!</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my daughter who loves it because the musk smell was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Alittle strong for me</li>
            <li> Oh God why.... this smells like a combination of strong soap and mens aftershave...</li>
            <li> packaging/bottle design wise) while retaining a youthful (not tween), vibrant scent within the glass Ruby-shaped bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly strong but it does tend to taper off throughout the day, which I am fine with, because I dislike when people carry around a miasma of overly strong perfume.</li>
            <li> Literally my favorite scent ever and so much for such a great price!</li>
            <li> She keeps it in her/guest bathroom on the counter because it is so beautiful and different!</li>
            <li> More of a sweet musky.</li>
            <li> and so quickly too!</li>
            <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Bottle is unique and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I took a huge gamble</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Bottle could have been filled with water.</li>
            <li> but this price is great especially for the 3.4 ounce size!</li>
            <li> Fantastic price.</li>
            <li> My primary perfume choices are Chanel Chance and Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> A nice gentle floral scent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and would highly recommend to any women who loves turns heads with their scent!</li>
            <li> but it is actually a light fragrance</li>
            <li> So happy to have made a right choice for my 12 year old Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a very warm, mysterious scent.  </li>
            <li> The bottle shape is fun to hold and looks beautiful enough to display.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very fast, packaged safely,</li>
            <li> love it, it&#x27;s probably my new favorite smell.</li>
            <li> and when I went to pull the top off the first time the medallion broke off in my hand.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Killer Queen opens with a rich plum note.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the email that I did not even both to look at the pictures of the bottle.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so fun!</li>
            <li> but I wanted the original.</li>
            <li> This bottle requires the stand because of its unique shape in order to stand up.</li>
            <li> but I do put more on later in the day just because I love it and want to smell it more.</li>
            <li> Huge, beautiful bottle with lovely scent that I feel would attract young adults to middle age adults.  </li>
            <li> I adore this new and amazing perfume by Katy Perry.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its my favorite that I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> An excellent fruity lightly floral fragrance that is just right and not overwhelming ever.  </li>
            <li> Bought for a special lady in my life and she loves it.</li>
            <li> but, boy were they right!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Killer Queen doesn&#x27;t have a unique stamp of it&#x27;s own to make it stand out from the crowd, and it is not something that I&#x27;d imagine Katy herself actually wearing.ct, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and authentic product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it smells good and lasting</li>
            <li> so i wanted the full bottle.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved this gift.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Sweet, yet with a not-so-subtle bite to it.  </li>
            <li> Musky and fruity without being too sweet.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s full of perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but SOO</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I always get compliments where ever I am...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet n sudductive&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a second bottle from Amazon as my sister kept using my perfume every time she came over, so I got her a bottle of her own for her birthday - she was thrilled and loves it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I love Katy Perry, and I like the scent, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Purr.  </li>
            <li> The smell for killer queen is nice if you like soft sweet perfumes, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> It has quickly became one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so big for such an amazing price!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and as described</li>
            <li> quick to ship, item as described.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, glad I purchased it, but wish it was longer lasting.</li>
            <li> It is authentic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Killer Queen doesn&#x27;t have a unique stamp of it&#x27;s own to make it stand out from the crowd, and it is not something that I&#x27;d imagine Katy herself actually wearing.</li>
            <li> I already own her other two perfumes, but Meow had become my favorite when compared to Purr.</li>
            <li> Reminds me somewhat of Fantasy by Britney Spears, but it definitely has it&#x27;s own unique spin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very pretty as well.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great once when u spray but takes less than 10 minutes to fade.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> but nope, again, this is all sexy bergamot and patchouli with some sweet undertones to keep it young and feminine.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, just perfect!</li>
            <li> Found this at a store for twice as much with only 1 fl oz...was so excited to receive this for such a great price!</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more once I run out!  </li>
            <li> I feel like I need to either spray a lot at first or carry it with me for respraying during the day!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, not too strong but present, gets compliments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand, because the bottle is designed to lay on its side just fine</li>
            <li> The name is a bit odd, but the perfume is very nice.</li>
            <li> Probably could have saved a few dollars,  great scent.  </li>
            <li> I really like the light fragrance</li>
            <li> And for the price it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the 22$.</li>
            <li> A+ for a really nice fragrance, especially in the celebrity perfume category.</li>
            <li> you are really only able to keep it in the cheap plastic that came in the box</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Came 3 days later than supposed to, but other than that very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it at a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> and then I read other mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need KQ right now</li>
            <li> FedEx dropped it off right on my porch.</li>
            <li> and it is totally different from the Katy Perry Royal Revolution which to me that one is more sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance smells very nice and not strong.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cool and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really floral or sweet</li>
            <li> The only drawback I have experienced is the short life of the scent.</li>
            <li> My other daughter is very pleased.</li>
            <li> As such the bottle only really sits on it&#x27;s side which sort of diminishes the effect of the beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li> the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> It still has a pleasant smell but it is not just plain fruity smelling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to buy it when I run out :)</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty and the scent divine.  </li>
            <li> personally dont love it anymore</li>
            <li> Love the smell, big bottle.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> the bottle is big and adorable.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift because of name recognition at first</li>
            <li> I first saw it as a sample in a magazine and just had to have it.</li>
            <li> It actually gets better the longer you&#x27;ve been wearing it.</li>
            <li> The bottle in a pretty</li>
            <li> This perfume smells exactly like Lancome&#x27;s La Vie Est Belle and Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a money savvy (or broke/cheap) girl like me that still wants a taste of the luxe life, get this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to overlook that.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive which was a problem because it was supposed to be a Christmas present but otherwise great product</li>
            <li> one spray of that perfume is equal to 7 ( or more) sprays of this stuff, cancelling out any savings.</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty fast!</li>
            <li> I like the bottle though, and so does my boyfriend, he wants to steal the bottle from me!  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like how I picture Katy Perry would smell, like candy and Heaven.</li>
            <li> and I asked a few of my guy coworkers if they thought it smelled good.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not long lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweeter than most perfumes, without the cloying, choking lack of subtlety of 99% of other sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li> One guy&#x27;s face turned red and he had a huge smile on his face.</li>
            <li> Love it and get stopped by random people while running errands asking what perfume I wear because I smell so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price, but definitely for a younger crowd.</li>
            <li> If this makes sense it is a scent that I like for fall or winter but would probably not wear it in the summer months because I usually pick more floral or clean fresh scents for summer.</li>
            <li> The description is apt because it&#x27;s sort of like dark berries and clove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully, they sell this for a long time, because I never intend to use anything else! :)</li>
            <li> I quickly accepted and was so surprised when I received the product.</li>
            <li> This scent is often compared to a certain designer perfume but</li>
            <li> Is sweet, SUPER strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> When I was asked to try Killer Queen by Katy Perry, I barely read the email because I was so excited.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, it is the entire reason I purchased it (also, I bought the first bottle from Dillard&#x27;s and it came with a really nifty white travel bag).  </li>
            <li> For that reason I am glad I got the larger size for just a little more money.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> But when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t really digging the smell on me.</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t really think that diminishes the beauty).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife really like it and wears it every day.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is very feminine without being girly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral with berry and very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li> Also, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this fragrance.</li>
            <li> no matter how much I apply in one go.  </li>
            <li> It smells more musky and elderly than I expected.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and really wanted to like it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to say that I&#x27;m a male reviewer.  </li>
            <li> Going to the local perfume store at the mall, we tested many different female scents and so many of them gave us headaches.  </li>
            <li> and it just takes up too much room on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not normally a big fan of the celebrity perfumes because I tend to think they smell a bit cheap as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> So yea I really recommend getting.</li>
            <li> Ordered wednesday and received by Monday with the free standard shipping.</li>
            <li> Expected a more favorable smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the scent</li>
            <li> Nice big size that will last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not to crazy about most perfumes so this is good stuff</li>
            <li> I love perfumes with praline and/or vanilla in, but this is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me - it reminds me of other perfumes all the way through.</li>
            <li> Smells much better than her other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have the other Katy Perry scents and this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> But once you get it you&#x27;ll be comfortable with the bottle as the weight of the bottle is flat and it doesn&#x27;t spill either.</li>
            <li> The scent is a phenomenal blend of amber and musk, with a sharp citrus splash.  </li>
            <li> A nice scent and semi long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of perfume where it gets to the room ten steps before you do, and hangs around long after you&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li> a new company now in charge of the Katy Perry fragrances, Katy promising a new mature image, the meaning behind the perfume&#x27;s name, and the marketing campaign for this product, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding.</li>
            <li> It lasts most of the day, I do usually have to spritz on a bit more before going out at night, and it smells sweet without smelling like a little girls candy perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle is really cool looking also, but it doesn&#x27;t stand up, it sits sideways since there is no flat surface on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not anything special, just a regular perfume.</li>
            <li> Can be a little strong!</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t normally wear perfume but really likes this.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I found a place that had a full sized bottle on display and it smelled totally different.</li>
            <li> really likes new Frangance....</li>
            <li> However, when buying in stores, you pay A LOT more for A LOT less.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for an older woman who wears Chanel or Dior.</li>
            <li> On my skin, the main notes that pop out are the berries, plum and patchouli.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, and it has decent staying power.</li>
            <li> The scent makes for a great everyday perfume as long as you don&#x27;t mind bringing some with you for frequent touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> and then there are VERY VERY GENTLE AND NOT SHARP desert and berry tones...</li>
            <li> ; I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this fragrance</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume to another person.</li>
            <li> Definitely a little stronger scent, probably more directed at evening outtings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not familiar with celosia, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to smell appealing -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but not super unique or long-lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bold and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they tried too hard to mix sweet with spicy and there are too many notes mixed in.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new fragrance and came across this in a mailer.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents and I&#x27;ve had no problem with this.</li>
            <li> i love how they even sent samples of other perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just use to higher priced perfume (which I will go back to)</li>
            <li> First time I purchased a much smaller bottle from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time (and I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about that.)</li>
            <li> I have never smelled anything like this, Wow!</li>
            <li> I would take away one star as the scent does not last all day - but the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li> In a day of crushing men&#x27;s souls and taking down the patriarchy, I want to smell like the flowers I water with the blood of my enemies.</li>
            <li> I was using &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel&amp;#34; but after smelling this, I have a new favorite!  </li>
            <li> It smells sweet and soft reminds me of shakira s florale (the pink bottle) however by the time I got home</li>
            <li> The bottle is a dark red with a gold top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled the other Katy Perry scents and they&#x27;re just too sweet for me</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but would like it to last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It was sealed in a clear plastic wrap inside of the box.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Old Spice after shave, and I have never&lt;br /&gt;liked that smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Official scent notes; wild berries, plum, bergamot, Celosia, jasmine, plumeria, cashmere, patchouli and liquid</li>
            <li> However the result is still &#x27;young&#x27; and unoriginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the result is still &#x27;young&#x27; and unoriginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells so soft and sensual.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas</li>
            <li> so her 12 year old daughter used some of her savings to purchase this item for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mature but</li>
            <li> May be too mature for some teens, but could suit others.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was really apprehensive only because I never know what to expect when ordering perfume offline.</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume as a late Christmas gift to my mother and I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really interesting, complex perfume...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to get the purple and blue bottles as well, but I do not care for the scents as much as I like this one.</li>
            <li> The perfume was bought for my 21year old daughter</li>
            <li> A smaller bottle costs twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li> I think Katy perry really did it big with this one .</li>
            <li> I am really pleasantly surprised at how much I love the scent, plus, it arrived sooner than it was supposed to by at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> the only downside is that the bottle cant stand up right unless you purchase the stand but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a slightly stronger scent, but it&#x27;s not all overpowering, while still having a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> I grew up with sweet smelling perfumes, particularly ones with caramel notes, but I don&#x27;t like wearing them nowadays as I think they smell too juvenile and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a huge sucker for the color red.  </li>
            <li> but it lays down and is fine, not a big hang up.</li>
            <li> Being as I can&#x27;t find my Christian Dior original Poison perfume, I had to look around and test out some other perfumes</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands.  </li>
            <li> But still a little bit sweet.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I wish the bottle came with some kind of stand, otherwise you just have to lay it on its side, which is such a waste for such a regal-looking bottle.</li>
            <li> The soft, creamy praline adds a slight nuttiness so it is a warm, comforting mix, which does lend a teensy bit of a different air to Killer Queen as it dries down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or sweet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a fan of her scents but this one is my new night out scent!</li>
            <li> The final drydown reminds me of La Vie Est Belle, so there&#x27;s nothing new here</li>
            <li> The scent seems to last pretty long</li>
            <li> Dumb name and goofy advertising photo with Katie Perry, but</li>
            <li> I am not sure it lasts very long, however when I put it on I just love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sexy, mysterious and subtle.</li>
            <li> I assumed when I bought this bottle, or at least the biggest size available, that it would also come with the stand that it is displayed on in the stores.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Katy&#x27;s 3rd fragrance is mature (</li>
            <li> it was only natural that I would want to try this scent.  </li>
            <li> but it came with that top part broken and that kinda ruined the beauty of that bottle</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t guess what - I am not able to separate any floral notes from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance, as the praline develops and mixes with the patchouli, lasting for the duration of the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is dark and almost musky with a hint of floral to it, which I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Actually really like this musky smell - the only other perfume I like is Opium</li>
            <li> loved the scent, container very difficult should have some type of stand.  </li>
            <li> It is a deep scent without being heavy and it lasts a long time unlike some reviews that say it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I was really worried that this would smell like the blue version of this which I had read a review that said it &amp;#34;smelled like cotton candy on crack.&amp;#34; I hate floral scents and super sweet scents.</li>
            <li> Decided to get another bottle on Amazon, and to my delight, the much larger bottle looks and smells exactly the same, and I paid less!</li>
            <li> and I did come across a couple reviews that said the fragrance did not last long.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a flat bottom surface.</li>
            <li> Seems to last just as long too.</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t a strong scent, it is in fact very weak.</li>
            <li> got a 1 oz bottle at Kohl&#x27;s for $39 and didn&#x27;t think too much about it...until a saw this on Amazon, a 3.4 oz bottle for less than what I payed for the other one&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Smells so good, I know I should wear it everyday because it&#x27;s expensive, but sometimes I just can&#x27;t help it!</li>
            <li> Both smell like they were made for little kids, like my 6 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Still feminine and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I consider this purchase a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It lasts really long too.</li>
            <li> minor issues:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle was bigger than I expected which was a plus.</li>
            <li> read reviews and noticed that some people feel they received a completely different product than they expected.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but not stupid expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfume (floral and citrus make me ill), so this sweet/musky/spicy scent is very pleasing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It reaches from the tip of my middle finger all the way down to my wrist where my forearm starts</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> The scent seems a little different compared to the sample I smelled from a magazine.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to order it and it be a knock off since it was so cheap...</li>
            <li> Also, the ridges are not very pronounced on the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had to stop it from rolling off my vanity a few times now :</li>
            <li> The plum note is long and distinctive, so carries down to the heart of the perfume, along with the patchouli.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that in the store the bottle has this nifty little stand to hold the bottle upright which you don&#x27;t actually get in the box.</li>
            <li> I got a small .5 ounce bottle just to try out at a local store</li>
            <li> so I sought ought her two other fragrances at Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> but they were out so after checking online at other stores and knowing I can find almost anything I need on Amazon</li>
            <li> Katy&#x27;s other perfume meow which smells like candy.</li>
            <li> It smells almost exactly like Chocolate Amber, which was sadly discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li> She told me the other day that her mom (my sister) keeps using it.</li>
            <li> Likeable scent, especially for winter,  but overall quality/longevity is poor.</li>
            <li> I first smelled it at Ulta, but it wz hella expensive, so I found it for a little cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Would return it but not worth the trip to the post office.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the stand, so the bottle design would probably be the only complaint.</li>
            <li> So if anything that&#x27;s more annoying (because that DOES diminish the beauty).</li>
            <li> and they both arrived in record time, padded down and secured</li>
            <li> so I have to lean it or lay it down.</li>
            <li> maybe 45m later the smell was almost gone there was only a vague linger.</li>
            <li> Not your typical kids perfume as you would think or expect.</li>
            <li> but I typically like Si from georgio armani, juicy couture vita la juicy, fantasy from britney spears and pour femme by dolce and gabanna if that helps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral, a little fruity, and sugary.</li>
            <li> But my little daughter prefers this scent to the others as well.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be a little heavy for close surroundings.</li>
            <li> this is a tough review because everyone likes different smells</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself, and wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> only problem is, when you see this bottle in stores, it is always perched on a thin gold colored wire stand.</li>
            <li> This is my all day everyday scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant presence of the powdery floral mix and patchouli.</li>
            <li> Only thing I can say is that I wish it came with a base to hold it upright because that diamond shape makes it impossible, but it lays nicely on</li>
            <li> It was expensive in local stores for even the smallest bottle</li>
            <li> and then hubby seen this big monster of a bottle and needless to say I was beyond exited to get it</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting, because the mini sampler bottle that I tried in a store smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> Sensual and subtle without going unnoticed.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained that the scent does not have staying power.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> I can wear it everyday and not get tired of it!</li>
            <li> The bottle did not come with a stand (I read in a few reviews it came with one and hoped there would be one) and is difficult to store as well it rolls off my dressing table and takes up a lot of room in my drawer.</li>
            <li> Now, the bottom design is dumb.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had the least expensive price.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand/holder for bottle</li>
            <li> Poor value.</li>
            <li> Not authentic perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Ill give it 5 for price when they decide to send me what i paid for</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have any staying power.</li>
            <li> After all, the stand isn&#x27;t anything fancy or difficult to include in the packaging.</li>
            <li> i was afraid that the bottle would be broken!</li>
            <li> The bottle is awkward for packing in a &amp;#</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a cotton candy, vanilla scented perfume but is impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if there was a bad batch or two put out.</li>
            <li> It had a sickly chemical scent after drying and was offensively stinky.</li>
            <li> I hate the shape of the bottle though.</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It makes the bottle very awkward!</li>
            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Probably could have saved a few dollars,  great scent.  Love Katy Perry</li>
            <li> I saw this or should I say smelled this in Target for double the price. Fast shipping and authentic product. Love it! My daughters always tell me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like nothing.  Bottle could have been filled with water. Would return it but not worth the trip to the post office.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes now. Love it and get stopped by random people while running errands asking what perfume I wear because I smell so good.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes that I have ever bought! The smell stays on all day long and is just WONDERFUL! It has quickly became one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Great Value.Also a great mothers day gift</li>
            <li> Great price, but I ordered this 3 days ago, and it has yet ship, Ill give it 5 for price when they decide to send me what i paid for</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume. I&#x27;ve smelled the other Katy Perry scents and they&#x27;re just too sweet for me but this one is great. It&#x27;s not too heavy or sweet but it still has a light and playful kind of smell. I can wear it everyday and not get tired of it! My husband loves it too so that&#x27;s a bonus that it doesn&#x27;t give him a headache! I got a small .5 ounce bottle just to try out at a local store and I so wish I would have gotten the bigger one instead but this price is great especially for the 3.4 ounce size! Definitely going to buy it when I run out :)</li>
            <li> So impressed with Fragrance.net i love how they even sent samples of other perfume!!!♥ very impressed!</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful and my boyfriend loves it. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I bought it twice in about a year, I use it all the time, I love it. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> My other daughter is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great bottle and love the scent.</li>
            <li> it came with a leak and each time i spray it, it leaks A LOT so it gets all over my hands and it stains the table i have it laying it on</li>
            <li> Found this at a store for twice as much with only 1 fl oz...was so excited to receive this for such a great price! Smells gorgeous on everyone!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells SO good!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a little stronger scent, probably more directed at evening outtings. The musk scent is most prominent, and I&#x27;m almost convinced a man could get away with wearing it too. I&#x27;m 44 and will keep this an evening scent. I like it, but don&#x27;t love love it. I had to update this review. I ended up giving it to my daughter who loves it because the musk smell was too strong for me. I&#x27;ll stick to her Revolution perfume which I totally love. I really wanted to love this perfume with all the good reviews but I just cant.</li>
            <li> This was at a great price, 1/2 what it is in the department store.</li>
            <li> LOvely fragance. I use it day and night</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product enough. THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its my favorite that I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> Is not real, don&#x27;t last and smell different!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I love this perfume I just wish it came with a stand.</li>
            <li> It was a great size bottle for 23 bucks can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> A nice scent and semi long lasting. Only with the bottle came with the stand but it lays down and is fine, not a big hang up.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but it came with that top part broken and that kinda ruined the beauty of that bottle but I lovvvvve this scent oh so mucccch</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes. A must have.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! I was looking for a new fragrance and came across this in a mailer. The scent is light but wonderfully delicious. It was expensive in local stores for even the smallest bottle so I immediately checked Amazon for comparable prices. Great buy for an awesome new scent!</li>
            <li> The perfume was for a gift, but I loved the way it smelled and every time I&#x27;m with that friend I sneak a couple sprays.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne ever!!!!! Believe me I have tried them all. I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> Being as I can&#x27;t find my Christian Dior original Poison perfume, I had to look around and test out some other perfumes and I really like this perfume. The price is really good and that is why I will continue to buy this. The scent is light and the kind of scents I like and the price is the best. Please keep this and the price where we can afford it. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume so much! And it&#x27;s so big for such an amazing price!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Is sweet, SUPER strong and long lasting. Great price too, so it&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> My daughter was more than thrilled to get this at Christmas. The bottle is pretty and the scent divine.  Well done K.P.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter who likes all of Katy Perry&#x27;s perfume! She loved the fragrance and the packaging. Got this item at a great price per ounce and fast shipping from the seller ! This fragrant would suit any age wearer!</li>
            <li> the bottle is super cute and very elegant, i recieved as a gift and it smells amazing!..the packaging alone just had me gasping lol..the only downside is that the bottle cant stand up right unless you purchase the stand but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Great scent, a bit spicy without an over powering sweet smell.  Gets spicier as it warms on your skin.  Fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Great product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this at Ulta and I loved it. I was excited to find it at a reasonable price here. But when I got it, I wasn&#x27;t really digging the smell on me. I gave it to my niece and she loved it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it smells good and lasting</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it and so do I.  Smells great, not to over powering.</li>
            <li> really likes new Frangance....good price!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. There aren&#x27;t enough words to describe the aroma that it puts on your skin. It is a light airy scent that makes you feel feminine and confident.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loved it, I also like the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a Fan...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Katy Perry fan so I sought ought her two other fragrances at Nordstroms. Which smelled like cotton candy on crack. So when this one came out I made a point to find it at Macy&#x27;s and I loved it. My husband got it for me as a gift and I love it. It&#x27;s fairly strong but it does tend to taper off throughout the day, which I am fine with, because I dislike when people carry around a miasma of overly strong perfume. The description is apt because it&#x27;s sort of like dark berries and clove. My only complaint is that in the store the bottle has this nifty little stand to hold the bottle upright which you don&#x27;t actually get in the box. As such the bottle only really sits on it&#x27;s side which sort of diminishes the effect of the beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not long lasting</li>
            <li> this bottle is huge! but i love it!</li>
            <li> One it&#x27;s Katy Perry and two I got my girlfriend the last years perfume and she loved it so I decided to follow up by getting this one and she likes Katy Perry</li>
            <li> saw the sample on a magazine and really liked it so i wanted the full bottle. love it, it&#x27;s probably my new favorite smell. I hate the shape of the bottle though. I don&#x27;t like to keep the boxes of my perfumes but with the shape of this i have to keep it.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  I am always looking for a cotton candy, vanilla scented perfume but is impossible to find.  This is perfect- best smelling perfume I ever wore. Will definitely get more once I run out!  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a perfume that your man will love on you get this. My ex loved this on me. It&#x27;s best to wear on a night time date.&lt;br /&gt;I personally dont love it anymore but it&#x27;s nice to wear sometimes.</li>
            <li> After receiving a sample for this fragrance, I loved it.  Started to do some research and I did come across a couple reviews that said the fragrance did not last long.  I decided to take a chance since there were also others that said the opposite.  So I went ahead and made the  purchase but, boy were they right!  I feel that the fragrance is undetectable after 2 hours, if that.  Very disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Much better than Pur. I don&#x27;t really care that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand, because the bottle is designed to lay on its side just fine (and I don&#x27;t really think that diminishes the beauty). However, the top piece is cheap plastic and when I went to pull the top off the first time the medallion broke off in my hand. So if anything that&#x27;s more annoying (because that DOES diminish the beauty). Either way, love the scent. Wasn&#x27;t looking for a museum show piece.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I go, I get compliments! Got the smaller sample kit for Christmas and after that ran out, I had to get the bigger size and this is perfect. Only thing I can say is that I wish it came with a base to hold it upright because that diamond shape makes it impossible, but it lays nicely on it&#x27;s side lol.  Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> The best smelling perfume Ive smelled in a  years. I absolutely love it!! I have already been recommending to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love Katy&#x27;s Purr, and her Meow, but Kill Queen smells too spicy for me.  It reminds me of Old Spice after shave, and I have never&lt;br /&gt;liked that smell.  I gave it to my daughter Laura, and she she lliked it, so I gave it to her.  So it was okay, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping. My wife really like it and wears it every day. I will reorder when she runs out. Have to keep your women happy you know.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this smells and it was such a great deal! Totally worth every penny! I usually try to see if I can purchase from amazon first before I get anywhere else. I had a rub on sample I had pulled out of my magazine and I asked a few of my guy coworkers if they thought it smelled good. One guy&#x27;s face turned red and he had a huge smile on his face. So I knew I needed to purchase this scent. Way better deal on amazon than in the store!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great price, awesome deal. Love the smell, big bottle. Only bummer is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand to hold it.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved this gift. This was exactly what she wanted. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price for the size. Perfect gift.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and as described</li>
            <li> quick to ship, item as described. smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is very feminine without being girly. Sensual and subtle without going unnoticed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume as a 37th anniversary gift for my wife.  We received one of those tear and sniff samples as an insert with the morning paper.  We both liked it.  Dumb name and goofy advertising photo with Katie Perry, but the fragrance is floral with a hint of musk.  Intoxicating.  Pricy, but not stupid expensive.</li>
            <li> Killer Queen opens with a rich plum note. I can also make out what I think is raspberry. The plum note is long and distinctive, so carries down to the heart of the perfume, along with the patchouli. This mixture of plum and patchouli is very similar to Midnight Heat by Beyonce - another Coty release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not familiar with celosia, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to smell appealing - the fragrance has been compared to that of a skunk online. I guess that Coty just wanted to use the exotic name in the description, but used something else in the perfume instead, but I can&#x27;t guess what - I am not able to separate any floral notes from the sweetly powdered floral jumble heart of the fragrance, as the praline develops and mixes with the patchouli, lasting for the duration of the perfume. I think that the powdered floral mix is extremely similar to Taylor by Taylor Swift overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant presence of the powdery floral mix and patchouli. The soft, creamy praline adds a slight nuttiness so it is a warm, comforting mix, which does lend a teensy bit of a different air to Killer Queen as it dries down. The final drydown reminds me of La Vie Est Belle, so there&#x27;s nothing new here either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official scent notes; wild berries, plum, bergamot, Celosia, jasmine, plumeria, cashmere, patchouli and liquid praline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killer Queen is pleasant and easy to wear, but it&#x27;s just not anything to get excited about. I love perfumes with praline and/or vanilla in, but this is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me - it reminds me of other perfumes all the way through. I will happily use my bottle as it was given to me as a gift, but Killer Queen isn&#x27;t something that I&#x27;d choose to buy for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new company now in charge of the Katy Perry fragrances, Katy promising a new mature image, the meaning behind the perfume&#x27;s name, and the marketing campaign for this product, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding. However the result is still &#x27;young&#x27; and unoriginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killer Queen doesn&#x27;t have a unique stamp of it&#x27;s own to make it stand out from the crowd, and it is not something that I&#x27;d imagine Katy herself actually wearing.ct, I was expecting Killer Queen to be adult, a bit more unique and confidently commanding.

            <li> This scent is amazing!! It&#x27;s floral with berry and very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;I got a 1 oz bottle at Kohl&#x27;s for $39 and didn&#x27;t think too much about it...until a saw this on Amazon, a 3.4 oz bottle for less than what I payed for the other one&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and a steal!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;m not generally a fan of her scents but this one is my new night out scent!</li>
            <li> this smells great, but the problem is the bottle. I saw it on display at Macy&#x27;s and it had a matching stand. When I ordered it, there wasn&#x27;t a stand included. It makes the bottle very awkward!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price, but definitely for a younger crowd. I would not recommend it for an older woman who wears Chanel or Dior. It&#x27;s very sweet smelling. It smells like sugar roasted almonds, but that is strictly my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a very affordable price. The scent stays with me all day! Great buy! The name is a bit odd, but the perfume is very nice.</li>
            <li> My mom wanted this perfume, after trying one of those samples in a magazine. I decided to buy this for her, I think she will be quite happy to get this perfume for Christmas. It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Stuff like this can be a challenge to buy online. You are buying it for the smell and that can change from person to person depending on your body and... you can not tell the fragrance from the names on the bottle. That said, it is a good product, and she (my gf) loves it. I am glad I purchased it, it has a wonderful fragrance on her.</li>
            <li> I really love this sent. I smelled it at Macys but they were out so after checking online at other stores and knowing I can find almost anything I need on Amazon I checked it out on here and it was even cheaper then the stores I looked at!</li>
            <li> Smells much better than her other fragrances. The unique bottle is great, but It would have been nice if it came with a stand.</li>
            <li> but I think this stuff is very nice for a budget price. My wife really enjoys it as well. She thought it smelled similar to be delicious.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my absolute favorite! I bought it for myself, and wear it everyday. I get lots of compliments and it lasts awhile.  My Mom loved it so much too, so my Dad just bought it for her for Valentine&#x27;s day! You will love it!</li>
            <li> Very big , daughter loves it!!!</li>
            <li> It smells so soft and sensual. My husband bought it for my birthday.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again. I get lots of complements on how good it smells</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing!! the bottle is big and adorable. I LOVE it! my boyfried loves it on me too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfectly packaged. Came when it was supposed to. Absolutely love the smell of killer queen. And for the price it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li> This perfume is perfect for those of use that like things a little more spicy.  Still feminine and lasts long. Love it!</li>
            <li> loved the scent, container very difficult should have some type of stand.  Would not purchase again, would not recommend product</li>
            <li> So happy to have made a right choice for my 12 year old Christmas gift. She love it. Amazon rocks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I would describe it as a very warm, mysterious scent.  On my skin, the main notes that pop out are the berries, plum and patchouli. Smells absolutely delicious, and the bottle is just beautiful! I would definitely recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands.  I would still purchase the product but keep in mind you may need to reapply throughout the day. :-)</li>
            <li> my mother loved it I took a huge gamble it was either this or beyonce heat but MS.Perry won her over</li>
            <li> I adore this new and amazing perfume by Katy Perry. I already own her other two perfumes, but Meow had become my favorite when compared to Purr. Now, I&#x27;m not so sure anymore. This perfume has a slightly stronger scent, but it&#x27;s not all overpowering, while still having a sweet smell to it. I ordered it along with a 6 oz. bottle of Meow and they both arrived in record time, padded down and secured so well that I knew the bottles would not have had any damage to them. The only downfall is that I wish the bottle came with some kind of stand, otherwise you just have to lay it on its side, which is such a waste for such a regal-looking bottle.Luckily, I&#x27;m hoping my mother can fashion something for me, since she works with all kind of materials to build with.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes! Arrived very fast, packaged safely, GREAT price &amp; I highly recommend! Smells fantastic! I get compliments from everyone.</li>
            <li> Smell wonderful. My 14 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas so her 12 year old daughter used some of her savings to purchase this item for her. The bottle is meant to sit on its side. It doesn&#x27;t have a flat bottom surface. However, the item looks just as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li> An excellent fruity lightly floral fragrance that is just right and not overwhelming ever.  I tend to like fruity smells over floral and this one hits the mark.  I buy based upon reviews not the celebrity attached to the perfume.  This one was well-rated on review sites as being fruity and berry.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful it smells really nice for anyone you young and old can wear this  I would buy again</li>
            <li> I feel so sexy when I wear this perfume! It has a great smell that lasts. You will be remembered when you wear this!</li>
            <li> I really love it and will purchase it again</li>
            <li> The smell is great once when u spray but takes less than 10 minutes to fade. It wasn&#x27;t like that with the one i got from macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Can be a little strong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent. Reminds me somewhat of Fantasy by Britney Spears, but it definitely has it&#x27;s own unique spin. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have any staying power. If the fragrance lasted longer, I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was gonna buy this based on reviews but I went to Walmart and tested it. It smells sweet and soft reminds me of shakira s florale (the pink bottle) however by the time I got home maybe 45m later the smell was almost gone there was only a vague linger. I decided not to purchase because I already have a problem with perfumes that need to constantly be sprayed such as the shakira s florale. The smell for killer queen is nice if you like soft sweet perfumes, not overpowering. I just wish it lasted longer but everyone has different chemistry so it&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle for me and as soon as i sprayed it on, I turned around and bought a second bottle!  I swear, it changes smell every time I put it on, and it&#x27;s never unpleasant :D</li>
            <li> Very happy for this Perfum!! This is for a friends birthday and was very excited to come across this! I recommend this 100%. Also, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I Tried a sample of this perfume from a magazine and loved it. Amazon had the least expensive price. It arrived on time and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My neice was so happy and surprised that she received this gift.  She loved it and it smells good. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. I think it would be a little heavy for close surroundings. I love the container.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, glad I purchased it, but wish it was longer lasting. I feel like I need to either spray a lot at first or carry it with me for respraying during the day!</li>
            <li> Lol, j/k. It was a gift. She liked it. Not overpowering, kind of sweet, kind of fruity. Didn&#x27;t come with the stand, so the bottle design would probably be the only complaint. But that&#x27;s not enough to keep me from giving it all stars.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice and attractive smell. Purchased it for my wife for Christmas. Not your typical kids perfume as you would think or expect.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely LOVES this fragrance. It is simply wonderful to smell on her. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Not anything special, just a regular perfume. I like it but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Based on a fragrance sample in a magazine I wanted to try it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just use to higher priced perfume (which I will go back to) because although I liked the smell of this parfum spray the smell is gone within 30-40 minutes of putting it on.  I consider this purchase a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Alittle strong for me</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it, but I find it to be cloying and overwhelming.  It&#x27;s the kind of perfume where it gets to the room ten steps before you do, and hangs around long after you&#x27;re gone.  Blech.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!! way cheaper then buying it in the store</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece.  It was a great price and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Good gift!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter. Smell just like the one at the department store. She&#x27;s happy so that makes me happy</li>
            <li> Smells so good, I know I should wear it everyday because it&#x27;s expensive, but sometimes I just can&#x27;t help it! :) I love all of Katy&#x27;s perfumes but this is my favorite! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Good value. Wonderful perfume. I had bought a bottle for me. Then for my daughter&#x27;s birthday she got a bottle. I also told my sister about it and she bought some for her daughter&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells great on my skin. The bottle shape is fun to hold and looks beautiful enough to display.  The only drawback I have experienced is the short life of the scent. I cannot notice it after an hour no matter how much I apply in one go.  The scent makes for a great everyday perfume as long as you don&#x27;t mind bringing some with you for frequent touch-ups.  For that reason I am glad I got the larger size for just a little more money.</li>
            <li> GREAT  SMELL  ITS ALL  GONE  I WILL HAVE  TO  ORDER  ANOTHER  ONE.MY  GRAND DAUGHTER  JUST  LOVES  IT.NOW  I  NO WHAT TO GET  HER  FOR  CHRISTMAS</li>
            <li> Literally my favorite scent ever and so much for such a great price!</li>
            <li> It smells more musky and elderly than I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but only lasts a few hours. Wish there was a stand for it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle. Like the shape and color. The fragrance smells very nice and not strong. I would recommend this perfume for anyone to try.</li>
            <li> What a great scent! I love the bottle, the scent and the price!  I get many compliments for it.....Thank you Katy Perry!</li>
            <li> Great scent, great price.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s OK, I just spray more on!  No regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of perfumes over the years, and never managed to finish a bottle until this scent came along.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfume that my husband and I both love, and this is it.  Alluring, but not overpowering.  Sweet, yet with a not-so-subtle bite to it.  Yup, this is The One.</li>
            <li> When I was asked to try Killer Queen by Katy Perry, I barely read the email because I was so excited. I quickly accepted and was so surprised when I received the product. I received a sample of Killer Queen by Katy Perry to review in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the box that held Killer Queen by Katy Perry, I was so amazed. I love the shape of the bottle! I was so excited when I received the email that I did not even both to look at the pictures of the bottle. The bottle shape is very unique. It is shaped like a jewel to where the bottle would have to lay on its side when not in use. The bottle is a dark red with a gold top. It resembles a beautiful gem atop a queen’s scepter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killer Queen by Katy Perry is one of my favorite scents.  I love wearing this one.  I received a sample of Killer Queen by Katy Perry to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! First time I purchased a much smaller bottle from Sephora. Decided to get another bottle on Amazon, and to my delight, the much larger bottle looks and smells exactly the same, and I paid less! Seems to last just as long too. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but would like it to last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift because of name recognition at first and then I read other mostly good reviews. The packaging was good and my mother in law loves fancy/interesting containers so this was perfect for her. Oh an the fragrance was good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful smelling perfume! Definitely my favourite. I wear it every day. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it the design of the bottle because it doesn&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this scent. I first saw it as a sample in a magazine and just had to have it. And that says a lot coming from someone who has never even bought actual perfume before. The bottle is quite large, good quality. It doesn&#x27;t come with the stand, but from what I gathered, none of them do. Smells amazing...feminine but musky enough that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;grown up.&amp;#34; I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice perfume!!!! HUGE BOTTLE!!!!!  Very Happy!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size &amp; the real deal Awesome</li>
            <li> no doubt my favorite scent as of now! love this perfume I had a lil bottle of it and then hubby seen this big monster of a bottle and needless to say I was beyond exited to get it and so quickly too!</li>
            <li> Smells very good. Love it. Came 3 days later than supposed to, but other than that very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Product was for my wife she enjoys it. It was a better bargain than purchasing thru the retail vendors.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! It actually gets better the longer you&#x27;ve been wearing it. Musky and fruity without being too sweet. I am very sensitive to scents and I&#x27;ve had no problem with this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time (and I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about that.) It&#x27;s sweeter than most perfumes, without the cloying, choking lack of subtlety of 99% of other sweet perfumes. It&#x27;s floral, a little fruity, and sugary. It&#x27;s not at all overpowering, and it has decent staying power. And it&#x27;s so fun! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> We gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she requested it and she has been very pleased!</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with this one...it has a very sweet smell that smells great but I don&#x27;t know about the staying power. My primary perfume choices are Chanel Chance and Vera Wang. As celebrity fragrances go, this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> the perfume itself is great but the box came all beaten up! i was afraid that the bottle would be broken!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells amazing!!!!!! I love it the shipping was very fast it came within 2 days. This fragrance gas a awesome smell I just love it. It&#x27;s mature but I Bellevue anyone of any age can wear it. I highly recommend buying this fragrance u can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great scent. It smells wonderful. It is authentic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fianc&amp;eacute; loves it. This bottle is HUGE. Way bigger than I thought but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. I have the other Katy Perry scents and this is not my favorite. It&#x27;s like they tried too hard to mix sweet with spicy and there are too many notes mixed in. I read the reviews and really wanted to like it, but I don&#x27;t. The best scent is Purr. If you trying to decide for you or a loved the one about this fragrance skip it and buy or repurchase Purr. The bottle did not come with a stand (I read in a few reviews it came with one and hoped there would be one) and is difficult to store as well it rolls off my dressing table and takes up a lot of room in my drawer. The bottle in a pretty and I would keep it out just for decoration if there was a stand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the fragrance! Very neat bottle that looks great on my shelf. Nice big size that will last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Im trying not to bathe myself in this perfume. It is a deep scent without being heavy and it lasts a long time unlike some reviews that say it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought for a special lady in my life and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Huge, beautiful bottle with lovely scent that I feel would attract young adults to middle age adults.  May be too mature for some teens, but could suit others.</li>
            <li> Great sale. Product,delivery &amp; price</li>
            <li> Actually really like this musky smell - the only other perfume I like is Opium so it is a nice change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to say that I&#x27;m a male reviewer.  My daughter is a Katy Perry fan.  She owns Purr and Meow as well.  Going to the local perfume store at the mall, we tested many different female scents and so many of them gave us headaches.  The one we liked the best was Britney Spears which the store manager said was oddly the best selling perfume there.  I cannot endorse Britney Spears so that was out of the question.  In my opinion, Meow and Purr from Katy Perry smells almost identical.  Both smell like they were made for little kids, like my 6 year old daughter.  But Killer Queen is different.  It still has a pleasant smell but it is not just plain fruity smelling.  It&#x27;s something more....something richer....more adult-like.  But my little daughter prefers this scent to the others as well.  Now, the bottom design is dumb.  It looks like it will roll over and drop.  But once you get it you&#x27;ll be comfortable with the bottle as the weight of the bottle is flat and it doesn&#x27;t spill either.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this before I even smelt the product but I thought the packaging was so beautiful I wanted it on my vanity but I was so happy to find out how nice the smell was. this is a tough review because everyone likes different smells but I typically like Si from georgio armani, juicy couture vita la juicy, fantasy from britney spears and pour femme by dolce and gabanna if that helps</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this nice perfume</li>
            <li> I finally got a chance to smell Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Killer Queen\\&quot; when I went to Macy&#x27;s and it smells similar to Flowerbomb. I already had my heart set on Flowerbomb so I just bought that instead. A bit pricier but I wanted the original. I don&#x27;t need KQ right now but I might buy it at some point, especially since the bottle is so pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (May 7th): I finally bought KQ! So glad cuz it smells amazing and the bottle is beautiful! Plus I got $10.00 back as store credit as part of the sale! Katy Perry&#x27;s \\&quot;Killer Queen\\&quot;, Viktor &amp; Rolf&#x27;s \\&quot;Flowerbomb\\&quot;, Juicy Couture&#x27;s \\&quot;Viva La Juicy\\&quot; and Beyonce&#x27;s \\&quot;Pulse\\&quot; are my signature fragrances!</li>
            <li> The scent seems a little different compared to the sample I smelled from a magazine.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who loves it. Have to admit, she does smell really good.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I am giving this four stars because of it&#x27;s shape. It has to lay on it&#x27;s side and it just takes up too much room on my vanity.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but is not very strong.  It will last for a few hours, but you can&#x27;t smell it unless really close to where it is applied.  It smells great but it just isn&#x27;t a strong scent, it is in fact very weak.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my newspaper.  I really like the light fragrance and it lasts.  It is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Smell is really good. More of a floral rather than Katy&#x27;s other perfume meow which smells like candy. I prefer meow but they both are great.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I was really apprehensive only because I never know what to expect when ordering perfume offline. This bottle is huge. It reaches from the tip of my middle finger all the way down to my wrist where my forearm starts and it&#x27;s full of perfume. I was really worried that this would smell like the blue version of this which I had read a review that said it &amp;#34;smelled like cotton candy on crack.&amp;#34; I hate floral scents and super sweet scents. This is dark and almost musky with a hint of floral to it, which I really don&#x27;t mind. I was also worried about packaging and if it would be a sealed box, but it was. It was sealed in a clear plastic wrap inside of the box. I am really pleasantly surprised at how much I love the scent, plus, it arrived sooner than it was supposed to by at least 6 hours. Great company, and great shipping. FedEx dropped it off right on my porch. Definitely worth the 22$.</li>
            <li> What a great deal. This is the larger size bottle. I got mine within two days. Smells like heaven!</li>
            <li> comes in a very good packing! love the smell!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Goes well with my body chemistry. My body tends to swallow colognes and by the end of the day I can&#x27;t smell them anymore. This one lasts all day. The only problem I see is that the bottle is shaped just as you see in the photo and you can not stand it up on it&#x27;s on. They should include in the box something you could stand the bottler up on.</li>
            <li> Great deal and smells amazing! I&#x27;ve been waiting on it to go on sale because I will not pay full price for perfumes! The only thing I hate is it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand/holder for bottle so I have to lean it or lay it down.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Recommended at the price.&lt;br /&gt;Insatiable an appetite.&lt;br /&gt;Wanna try?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this new scent, and Freddie would have loved it too. It&#x27;s bold and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume as a late Christmas gift to my mother and I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase. I kinda just went with the flow and hoped my mother would like it (I&#x27;ve never smelled it until I got it), it smells wonderful! Package came in a medium sized box, the bottle was very secure. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product exceeded my expectations. It is a great product at a great a price. I would definitely recommend this purchase to my friends.</li>
            <li> This massive bottle cost me same as the one ounce discounted bottle from Kohls! The spicy, sultry scent lasts all day. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Wife loved the scent. I&#x27;m satisfied if she is</li>
            <li> i really love this perfume!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells exactly like Lancome&#x27;s La Vie Est Belle and Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf...It lasts really long too. If you&#x27;re a money savvy (or broke/cheap) girl like me that still wants a taste of the luxe life, get this! It&#x27;s a really interesting, complex perfume...It&#x27;s sweet but SOO NOT in a syrupy celeb fragrance way. It&#x27;s sexy, mysterious and subtle. I get the most whiff of bergamot and patchouly in this and then there are VERY VERY GENTLE AND NOT SHARP desert and berry tones...I know that makes you think eww syrupy...but nope, again, this is all sexy bergamot and patchouli with some sweet undertones to keep it young and feminine. GET IT!</li>
            <li> This parfum was a gift for my mother.  I loved the smell, and she is absolutely &amp;#34;In Love&amp;#34; with it, plus the bottle is a beautiful addition to any bathroom counter.  We loved it so much, my nephew and I both purchased one!!</li>
            <li> Has a spicy scent, beautiful bottle!</li>
            <li> Oh God why.... this smells like a combination of strong soap and mens aftershave... mixed with pine-sole. Was expecting something better.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! I grew up with sweet smelling perfumes, particularly ones with caramel notes, but I don&#x27;t like wearing them nowadays as I think they smell too juvenile and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. I&#x27;m also not normally a big fan of the celebrity perfumes because I tend to think they smell a bit cheap as well. However, I did like this one when I tried it on in the store. It lasts most of the day, I do usually have to spritz on a bit more before going out at night, and it smells sweet without smelling like a little girls candy perfume. I also loved the packaging, the bottle is beautiful like the sacred heart seen in iconography, and I adore the name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, when you see this bottle in stores, it is always perched on a thin gold colored wire stand. I assumed when I bought this bottle, or at least the biggest size available, that it would also come with the stand that it is displayed on in the stores. After all, the stand isn&#x27;t anything fancy or difficult to include in the packaging. However, it does not come with the stand so it cannot be displayed upright as shown. Having it lay on its side definitely detracts from the beautiful bottle and you don&#x27;t get the nice appearance of the color gradient as shown. Also, the ridges are not very pronounced on the bottle so there isn&#x27;t a lot to keep it from rolling away. I&#x27;ve actually had to stop it from rolling off my vanity a few times now :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So A+ for a really nice fragrance, especially in the celebrity perfume category. C+ for presentation and packaging. That part needs some work.</li>
            <li> This perfume container is beautiful in person! My mother-in-law loves perfumes and fell in LOVE with the bottle! She keeps it in her/guest bathroom on the counter because it is so beautiful and different! Oh, and it smells heavenly. Not too strong at all! Unless you spray too many times!</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I always get compliments where ever I am... it&#x27;s sweet n sudductive&lt;br /&gt; I Recommend it</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume!!! Smells so amazing! !!</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter...this was on her Christmas list...she is very happy!  I would highly recommend this perfume to another person.</li>
            <li> Loved Purr and now I love Killer Queen!!! Lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume ever! However, when buying in stores, you pay A LOT more for A LOT less. I was so happy to find this HUGE bottle at such a great price and will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> The scent is a phenomenal blend of amber and musk, with a sharp citrus splash.  I would recommend it to ANY woman!!!  It smells almost exactly like Chocolate Amber, which was sadly discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Macys and it&#x27;s the most amazing fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Floral but also musky. It&#x27;s almost intoxicating. My boyfriend loved it on me. putting it on, my befriend could smell it on me all day. I will but this product. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for a birthday gift for my wife. Great scent.&lt;br /&gt;2 minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;  some leaked out into the box during shipment&lt;br /&gt;  does not come with a stand and with the pointed shape you are really only able to keep it in the cheap plastic that came in the box</li>
            <li> Katy&#x27;s 3rd fragrance is mature (packaging/bottle design wise) while retaining a youthful (not tween), vibrant scent within the glass Ruby-shaped bottle.  The bottle design is beautiful!  A great perfume for a young woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> My daughter has this perfume, and I fell in love with it! It is my favorite now! I was using &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel&amp;#34; but after smelling this, I have a new favorite!  I noticed she &amp;#34;my daughter&amp;#34; would spray it on before she left for work, and the fragrance was still on her 8/9 hours later! It&#x27;s her favorite, and I can understand why! I have never smelled anything like this, Wow! I love it! It&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance!! 😃</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love. Im not a big fan of Katy Perry but i love this fragrance. I couldnt believe the size i got for $30. I ordered the gift set and got some samples to carry with me. This bottle alone will last me a yr.</li>
            <li> Not authentic perfume!!! Do not by from this retailer. I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for quite sometime and this is not it.</li>
            <li> Why I love this product:  First of all, I&#x27;m a huge sucker for the color red.  The bottle design is wonderful - I keep this on my counter in my bathroom and it looks stunning.  To be perfectly honest, it is the entire reason I purchased it (also, I bought the first bottle from Dillard&#x27;s and it came with a really nifty white travel bag).  Having said that, I love the scent.  Its very light and clean smelling.  I would take away one star as the scent does not last all day - but the bottle is so pretty I&#x27;m willing to overlook that.  I purchased a second bottle from Amazon as my sister kept using my perfume every time she came over, so I got her a bottle of her own for her birthday - she was thrilled and loves it as much as I do.  I&#x27;m tempted to get the purple and blue bottles as well, but I do not care for the scents as much as I like this one.</li>
            <li> I like it!!! But still a little bit sweet. And I love the bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Great price with fast delivery. I should have researched this better because I would have preferred to receive a stand with this bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is A-MAZING! My favorite scent ever!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, they sell this for a long time, because I never intend to use anything else! :)</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, not too strong but present, gets compliments. You&#x27;ll feel like a queen, just like I do every day!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, not too strong. A nice gentle floral scent.  I love Katy Perry&#x27;s music, and I Loved Queen and their &amp;#34;Killer Queen&amp;#34;music, so it was only natural that I would want to try this scent.  I was very impressed and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, Very tasty! my husband love it on me! regards,</li>
            <li> Ever wanted a scent that would aid in your daily plans? Well, I found one for mine... In a day of crushing men&#x27;s souls and taking down the patriarchy, I want to smell like the flowers I water with the blood of my enemies. :^)</li>
            <li> Great except no stand included with it. Which was not advertised with the product. This bottle requires the stand because of its unique shape in order to stand up.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume.  I wear it everyday!  The bottle is very pretty as well.  Great value! Thanks</li>
            <li> this perfume smell different from the one i got from the store. Don&#x27;t buy. i compared the smell to the one they had at Macy, Dillard, and sears. its totally different from this.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells so good and even my mom thought so too. She&#x27;s not to crazy about most perfumes so this is good stuff yall. I have many perfumes and so I was happy to add this one to my collection. The bottle looks cool and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Loved it arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> Im giving it a solid five, I have nothing to complain about. I bought it for my wife and she loved and I love smeeling it on her It came qiuck and it was an awesome price. So yea I really recommend getting. The bottle was bigger than I expected which was a plus.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR AND IN GOOD TIME.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece for Christmas and she was so happy to get it.  She told me the other day that her mom (my sister) keeps using it.</li>
            <li> This is a berry fragrance with velvety floral undertones. It&#x27;s pretty, but not super unique or long-lasting. The vial-shaped bottle is actually the best thing about it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the perfume just for that reason.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and was a great price. It took a long time to arrive which was a problem because it was supposed to be a Christmas present but otherwise great product</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much and the price I got it for is amazing!</li>
            <li> killer queen is a great perfume for a great price I love this perfume and I love katy perry .</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and would highly recommend to any women who loves turns heads with their scent! Excellent price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell! It is so divine and so is the price! Must have!</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly, was as described and great price A++++</li>
            <li> smells great and I love the bottle design.</li>
            <li> Smells great good deal</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, safely packaged and a great product. The perfume was bought for my 21year old daughter but I loved the smell also! this perfume is designed for all ages.</li>
            <li> This smells AMAZING. I love it more than my Chanel- and that is saying a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the fragrance stays with you all day. The is an authentic perfume at a great discount price.</li>
            <li> Likeable scent, especially for winter,  but overall quality/longevity is poor. This scent is often compared to a certain designer perfume but one spray of that perfume is equal to 7 ( or more) sprays of this stuff, cancelling out any savings. I will not repurchase. Poor value.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! Smells just like the product sold in stores and lsts all day- always get compliments! Would recommend and purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! I first smelled it at Ulta, but it wz hella expensive, so I found it for a little cheaper here on Amazon. Shipped pretty fast! Ordered wednesday and received by Monday with the free standard shipping. I haven&#x27;t found a perfume that actually lasts when you spray it on...but this one, i keep smelling all day long :) love it!!! &amp; would def recommend to others.</li>
            <li> love the scent and the price!</li>
            <li> my sister loves it....</li>
            <li> Expected a more favorable smell. That&#x27;s just my own preference though</li>
            <li> I love Katy Perry, and I like the scent, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as Purr.  I like the bottle though, and so does my boyfriend, he wants to steal the bottle from me!  Looking forward to trying Royal Revolution.</li>
            <li> This is my all day everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I love this. It lasts a very long time. It smells so good, my boyfriend likes it too (:</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  I am not sure it lasts very long, however when I put it on I just love it.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t normally wear perfume but really likes this.  Bottle is unique and easy to hold.  Some reviewers have complained that the scent does not have staying power.  I think that the fullness of the scent makes you expect a heavier impact but it is actually a light fragrance</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She really likes it and it smells great. The price is great.. A smaller bottle costs twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li> I think Katy perry really did it big with this one . Out of all of her perfumes this one is my favorite !!</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance.Huge bottle!</li>
            <li> Great bargain and wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting, amazing fragrance. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like how I picture Katy Perry would smell, like candy and Heaven.</li>
            <li> The bottle is awkward for packing in a &amp;#34;travel bag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and I use it everyday!! It is now my favorite go-to scent and I get a lot of compliments on it from strangers.  The bottle is really cool looking also, but it doesn&#x27;t stand up, it sits sideways since there is no flat surface on the bottle.  Can&#x27;t wait to try Katy Perrys next perfume.</li>
            <li> Great shipping timing &amp; smells great</li>
            <li> This is THE best smelling  perfume ever!! Long lasting, just perfect!</li>
            <li> it was a gift and my daughters friend loved it</li>
            <li> Very sexy. I love this on my wife! More of a sweet musky.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to order it and it be a knock off since it was so cheap...well it arrived fast, smells great and it&#x27;s the real thing!! Great price! Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is really strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t use more than a 2-3 sprays. I&#x27;ve never had to re-apply it during the day. I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfume (floral and citrus make me ill), so this sweet/musky/spicy scent is very pleasing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews and noticed that some people feel they received a completely different product than they expected. It&#x27;s interesting, because the mini sampler bottle that I tried in a store smelled horrible. It had a sickly chemical scent after drying and was offensively stinky. Eventually, I found a place that had a full sized bottle on display and it smelled totally different. I liked it and decided to buy it. It makes me wonder if there was a bad batch or two put out.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume for Christmas. I love it!!! The scent seems to last pretty long but I do put more on later in the day just because I love it and want to smell it more. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the scent, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is really floral or sweet and it is totally different from the Katy Perry Royal Revolution which to me that one is more sweet smelling.  If this makes sense it is a scent that I like for fall or winter but would probably not wear it in the summer months because I usually pick more floral or clean fresh scents for summer. I do love it however, and love the bottle which lays on it&#x27;s side.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
