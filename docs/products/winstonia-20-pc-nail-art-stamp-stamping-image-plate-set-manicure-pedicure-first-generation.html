            <li>They are very well etched and stamp beautifully.</li>

            <li>Easy to pick up the design, nice designs.</li>
            <li>pretty great, i love some of the fancier ones, my nieces love some of the playful ones.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find a large set of plates that didn&#x27;t have any of those.</li>
            <li>Most of the plates work, but some don&#x27;t take the polish at all (like the Halloween plate).</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the variety offered on these plates</li>

            <li>I love nail stamping.</li>
            <li>There are no images for doing just tips and somehow I&#x27;m glad about that.</li>
            <li>These plates are outstanding, I just received them, I started testing them on paper</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing that one as well.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased, that I have just placed another order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Winstonia</li>
            <li>It gives you many options</li>
            <li>There are so many styles you can do with this set.</li>
            <li>Now, not all of them are my favorite design</li>
            <li>but most are.</li>

            <li>love the designs and the ease of using them.</li>
            <li>and I see many years ahead of using them.</li>
            <li>Once I had done that I put the plate on top of a napkin and painted over it with my favorite copper color from Essie.</li>
            <li>Perfect nails in only seconds!  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love these plates.</li>
            <li>They are larger then my salon express plate designs and stamp perfect.</li>
            <li>I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates.</li>
            <li>I might order more.</li>
            <li>I really love all of these designs.</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>i bought these because i love doing nails</li>
            <li>I just love the images on this set of stamps.</li>
            <li>I bought a set for me and one for my daughter in law for her birthday and both of us are in love.</li>
            <li>Well engraved some cute designs they seem to stamp well</li>
            <li>They are a great quality too and stamp very well.</li>
            <li>i liked this set it as pretty cool and stamps very nicely</li>

            <li>I love the unique designs from this set and get a lot of compliments on my nails when I wear Winstonia images!</li>
            <li>These are pretty standard for stamping plates -- good depth of engraving, good detail, and good thickness.</li>
            <li>So much fun!!</li>
            <li>Love this set, it has unique images, especially the holiday ones, and it stamps great!</li>
            <li>Designs are unique!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also a great starter set for those new to nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was nice and they were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>There are tons of videos all over the place for creative color combinations, styles, and easy to do looks that always impress.</li>
            <li>Not all of these plates have nice patterns, but most of the designs are nice and new.</li>
            <li>Winstonia plates are very good quality and at an amazing price and its only their first generation!</li>
            <li>awesome- wish the companies would make the full images larger for TOES- other wise great buy</li>
            <li>I tried out the 5 most detailed plates I could find in the set</li>
            <li>I used to try and paint my nails using special brushes and dotting tools but they took forever!</li>
            <li>All my other plates are perfect.</li>
            <li>Every on that I&#x27;ve tried has transferred easily.</li>
            <li>And at about $17, they&#x27;re definitely better priced than Konad or Bundle Monster, with the same great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been playing around with them and have already used them several times to create fun, beautiful manicures!</li>
            <li>Images are very clear, easy to clean, great product.</li>
            <li>with most nail plate sets, the full nail images are perfect for average length nails.  </li>
            <li>has worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Some of the designs with fine detail don&#x27;t always work.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product Came in less then a week</li>
            <li>and so I think these will suit her just fine.</li>
            <li>There was a problem when I received them, was sent two Thanksgiving plates; but was able to work with the company and get that taken care of quickly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to open the package and see all the beautiful designs this bundle has.</li>
            <li>The stamper and type of nail polish you use makes a huge difference as well.  </li>
            <li>Enough designs to make any gal happy.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making them available</li>
            <li>Winstonia&#x27;s customer service was great and so simple!</li>
            <li>The detail was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using these plates.</li>
            <li>Cute designs and easy to use and the shipping was fast!</li>

            <li>I would recommend this set to anyone lookinf for a staple set of images to use year-round, that includes for both Holidays, and every day fun!</li>
            <li>have fun!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I found out that there were nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure is this is the best to you</li>
            <li>Nice to see new designs.</li>
            <li>I have watched all the tutorials on how to prep the plates and stamper, how to clean both, and how to do the stamping...</li>
            <li>The edges were clean, not fuzzy.</li>
            <li>Not as clean of an image sometimes</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and lots of fun.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sets as far as most of the images are things that I could see myself using.</li>
            <li>recycle an old gift card or credit card and it works better!</li>
            <li>Not only do I love a lot of the unique designs that Winstonia used, but I love how cleanly etched and easy to use they are.</li>
            <li>I love nail art in general, It&#x27;s always nice to get new decals to use, I have got so many compliments on these.</li>
            <li>However, many of these are too large for their itty bitty fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Although she&#x27;s not a big fan of stamps she says these are super easy to use and very cute designs.</li>
            <li>This set has a nice variety and the plates that I have tried have been well engraved and transferred clear images.</li>
            <li>and I have a 3 inch binder FULL of plates.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length nails and the full nail images</li>
            <li>Some nail plate sets just don&#x27;t have as many images that I would really care to have on my nails.</li>
            <li>they have really cool designs.</li>
            <li>Great quality, standard size with a paper backing and large full nail designs.</li>
            <li>konad in only white special polish is best.</li>
            <li>pretty happy with these, no complaints, tons of great imagines, an excellant value for the money, something for everyone, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I am super bummed about these products.</li>
            <li>:) All plates have a protective backing and they do have a blue film on top of each plate that does need to be removed before you use them..</li>
            <li>i got my plates quickly.</li>
            <li>I had a problem with one of the plates and they quickly sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>These were the very first sets of plates that I bought, and I&#x27;ve bought several since, but these really might be my favorite!!</li>
            <li>Winstonia was my very first nail stamping set.</li>
            <li>This set has some really nice images but most of these are not very original.</li>
            <li>wait to see more from a new company.</li>
            <li>The plates are small, but nice quality and transfer nicely too.</li>
            <li>These plates have the traditional paper backing and adorable images!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>I love these and all imagesare clear!  </li>
            <li>Having fun whenever I can.</li>
            <li>also to people who just want to have fun with</li>
            <li>I almost forgot I ordered it, but it was well worth the wait, and I would do it again.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Fun to use.</li>
            <li>it is worth the investment</li>
            <li>My 3 and 5 year old girls love when I stamp their fingers with a fun design.  </li>
            <li>I love these plates, they stamp really well and the image selection is really varied.</li>
            <li>I really love this set and look forward to future Winstonia original plate sets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten plates from other sellers and as of now the Winstonia ones are the best I&#x27;ve gotten; I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone looking to invest in a set of stamping plates.</li>
            <li>And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>very well etched with unique designs...</li>
            <li>I had been searching high and low for good quality plates that won&#x27;t wipe out my bank account.</li>
            <li>I cant compare them to the konad plates as I havent received the ones I have ordered yet, but I would definitely recommend these, I can say that they do stamp a lot better with the konad special polish.</li>
            <li>, they have some cute designs but def not worth the money because most designs are duds.</li>
            <li>Fun images exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried out a couple designs from a couple different plates, and so far they all work beautifully!</li>
            <li>The stamps come out very clear and crisp and the shipping was very quickly.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun holiday and seasonal plates; not like many other sets available online.</li>
            <li>there are other companies ive seen since getting these that offer much cuter designs and more of their designs are cute so for example w</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a detailed peacock feather and here it is the price is outstanding for the amount and quality of these plates</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of plates and the set is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My first order from Winstonia and my order came ahead of schedule</li>
            <li>first set thou</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and they came so fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first order of stamping plates.</li>
            <li>Thank you sooo much!</li>
            <li>I love zebra print, but there are only so many different ways to use that ;)</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this set and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Every week I use a different Winstonia design and receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>Such as different holidays, summer, animal print and many more.</li>
            <li>Overall this was an amazing buy as far as quality, quanity, and the price of course!</li>
            <li>I only had one plate that was not etched enough, but Winstonia&#x27;s amazing customer service replaced the plate super fast!</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get this after much hesitation, but glad I did.</li>
            <li>This set has great designs and every one that I&#x27;ve used thus far (which is quite a few)</li>
            <li>My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will, would have loved to have this as 25 plates as the standard.</li>
            <li>the designs are deep enough to get a good stamp.</li>
            <li>I order this nail plates and they came pretty fast, one week</li>
            <li>First off they ship fast.</li>
            <li>I have really got the hang of doing the stamps so much that I now charge for them when I do manicures, acrylics, and gels!</li>
            <li>As I stated, I can&#x27;t vouch for ALL of the plates, but so far so good, and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints from other stampers who ordered.</li>
            <li>I would say that the full length images are good for up to medium length nails, if you have really long nails, the full nail images might be a tad short for you without having to double stamp.</li>
            <li>the little animals are super cute and stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stamped clean and crisp, even with a regular nail polish (I used Color Club Haute Couture).  </li>
            <li>I used regular nail polish, and every image came out crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li>Really recommended.</li>
            <li>all things considered, with the very tumultuous weather we have been having, I would not hold it against the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>its a real at home item.</li>
            <li>No problems with stamping as the plates are engraved very well,</li>
            <li>They work fantastic, images are deeply etched.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t find it to be a problem because it is not affecting the quality of the images.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t use them that much</li>
            <li>They transfer well and the details really show on my nails.</li>
            <li>There are pictures for nearly every holiday as well as fun patterns and designs.</li>
            <li>For these being a first generations series, I was nervous that most of plates would not be etched deep enough so they would not look as crisp as on the nails as they do on the plates.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I used a simple off brand black and they STILL looked amazing!</li>
            <li>The trick with stamping is to use pure acetone and to clean the plate regularly - that way</li>
            <li>The images are really good and there are some that are really different from ones you&#x27;re accustomed seeing in other plate collections.</li>
            <li>This set has a nice range of designs, going from full nail patterns to smaller little pictures.</li>
            <li>All the designs showed up crisp and clear, even the designs with large areas.</li>
            <li>I wish that there were 25 nail art plates in this set like in most of the other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to get to use those ones for the different times of year and holidays.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nothing special, I have some Cheeky stamps and they came in a really nice box for storage with a magnetic closure, these just came in a thin paper box.</li>
            <li>The images transfer cleanly, even the tiny intricate ones!</li>
            <li>cover most of my fingers perfectly, other than my thumb, which I did have to do a bit of double stamping for full</li>
            <li>I finally bought these after seeing so many ladies on social media sites use images from this set and wishing I had them.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs were big enough to cover my full nail which I couldn&#x27;t do the express.</li>
            <li>These plates are very nicely etched and has so much variety that I have a hard time deciding which one to use next.</li>
            <li>Only wish they would combine shipping costs if purchasing more than one item at the same time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these plates, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>These are high quality disks that work well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them to anyone who likes to do nail art.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any nail art stamper out there.</li>
            <li>, this set has different designs that sets it apart from the other companies, the images transfer nicely on the nails and the plates have the backing which helps...</li>
            <li>A nice set overall, with a variety of image types, from the more classic designs to the whimsical.</li>
            <li>my new nail plates will highly recommend these nail plates and the Winstonia brand.</li>
            <li>I own several other sets of nail plates but these are by far my favorites.  </li>
            <li>i bought the set for only one image, peacock feather and it stamps very well...but am in love with other images</li>
            <li>Winstonia was new to me</li>
            <li>I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>Love the designs, unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to use any because the stamper I bought from the same company has not worked for me.</li>
            <li>As far as using them, I&#x27;ve found that there is definitely a learning curve when first attempting nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>They all stamp very clearly and I have had no trouble using them at all.</li>
            <li>I have several sets of plates and they offer pretty much the same designs.</li>
            <li>Also ordered three large Stampers and only received one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had problems as of yet with only getting certain parts of images to stamp.</li>
            <li>It was okay for the money and considering it&#x27;s hard to get these type of art decals hand painted on your toes or fingers nail</li>
            <li>The images come out clear.</li>
            <li>Tons of different but very usable designs.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter is into nail art</li>
            <li>These do not work very well at all, tried multiple designs and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>I got these a day early</li>
            <li>You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you try out any of the old polishes you already have at home.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried a few of the designs from this set, but I love them.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to other active stampers who are  use to the popular brand names of stamping such a konad and bundle monster, etc.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these because they are very different from other designs I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>It covers all the major holidays, besides other fun designs.</li>
            <li>It would take me hours to paint my nails with as much details as these and not nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I like the different designs, there are not tons of the houndstooth and animal prints we always get with new sets.</li>
            <li>a little expenses but worth it</li>
            <li>but I must say I have no regrets</li>
            <li>Everything arrived as specified, and came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>The images look like they will stop well but keep in mind that the full images are on the small side.</li>
            <li>So many images to use you will never get bored or run out of new ideas.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t tried every single Winstonia stamp image from this collection, I have had no trouble transferring any of the images thus far.  </li>
            <li>The plates are built to last, heavy and sturdy and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but Winstonia was pretty rude and wanted me to pay shipping and only gave me a guarantee if they arrived back to them in a certain time frame.</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs, there is at least one design I will use on every single plate.</li>
            <li>The images are clear and work well with all types of nail polish as long as the polish is not transparent.</li>

            <li> Good thing because I was excited to use!</li>
            <li> Very impressed and excited to try out all of these cool designs.</li>
            <li> Eiffel Tower, Leaning Tower of Pisa, a curvy mermaid, this set is full of great designs.</li>
            <li> Most of the images are really nice and trendy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>

            <li> So far these plates are awesome.</li>
            <li> She says they are really easy to use!</li>
            <li> I loved these nail art plates and, as another buyer commented the designs are unique</li>
            <li> Wistonia always has a good varitey of images, and they stamp cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Happy New YEAR!!!</li>
            <li> They are very well etched and stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li> But the rest of the designs are great, the leopard print on the first plate is so detailed!  </li>
            <li> Easy to pick up the design, nice designs.</li>
            <li> pretty great, i love some of the fancier ones, my nieces love some of the playful ones.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find a large set of plates that didn&#x27;t have any of those.</li>
            <li> Most of the plates work, but some don&#x27;t take the polish at all (like the Halloween plate).</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the variety offered on these plates</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to get creative.</li>
            <li> So many diferent designs</li>
            <li> love the variety</li>
            <li> Love them...</li>
            <li> Love my plates.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and would order this brand again.</li>
            <li> and I love using it.</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping.</li>
            <li> There are no images for doing just tips and somehow I&#x27;m glad about that.</li>
            <li> These plates are outstanding, I just received them, I started testing them on paper</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing that one as well.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased, that I have just placed another order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Winstonia</li>
            <li> It gives you many options</li>
            <li> There are so many styles you can do with this set.</li>
            <li> Now, not all of them are my favorite design</li>
            <li> but most are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for more wistonia plates as I type.</li>
            <li> Stamp transfer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the variety of designs in this set.  </li>
            <li> I have attached photos for review of the swatched images on paper for those who would like to see :)  </li>

            <li> love the designs and the ease of using them.</li>
            <li> and I see many years ahead of using them.</li>
            <li> Once I had done that I put the plate on top of a napkin and painted over it with my favorite copper color from Essie.</li>
            <li> Perfect nails in only seconds!  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love these plates.</li>
            <li> They are larger then my salon express plate designs and stamp perfect.</li>
            <li> I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates.</li>
            <li> I might order more.</li>
            <li> I really love all of these designs.</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>
            <li> i bought these because i love doing nails</li>
            <li> I just love the images on this set of stamps.</li>
            <li> I bought a set for me and one for my daughter in law for her birthday and both of us are in love.</li>
            <li> Well engraved some cute designs they seem to stamp well</li>
            <li> They are a great quality too and stamp very well.</li>
            <li> i liked this set it as pretty cool and stamps very nicely</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are some very unique stamps included.</li>
            <li> I love the unique designs from this set and get a lot of compliments on my nails when I wear Winstonia images!</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard for stamping plates -- good depth of engraving, good detail, and good thickness.</li>
            <li> So much fun!!</li>
            <li> Love this set, it has unique images, especially the holiday ones, and it stamps great!</li>
            <li> Designs are unique!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also a great starter set for those new to nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was nice and they were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> There are tons of videos all over the place for creative color combinations, styles, and easy to do looks that always impress.</li>
            <li> Not all of these plates have nice patterns, but most of the designs are nice and new.</li>
            <li> Winstonia plates are very good quality and at an amazing price and its only their first generation!</li>
            <li> awesome- wish the companies would make the full images larger for TOES- other wise great buy</li>
            <li> I tried out the 5 most detailed plates I could find in the set</li>
            <li> I used to try and paint my nails using special brushes and dotting tools but they took forever!</li>
            <li> All my other plates are perfect.</li>
            <li> Every on that I&#x27;ve tried has transferred easily.</li>
            <li> And at about $17, they&#x27;re definitely better priced than Konad or Bundle Monster, with the same great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with them and have already used them several times to create fun, beautiful manicures!</li>
            <li> Images are very clear, easy to clean, great product.</li>
            <li> with most nail plate sets, the full nail images are perfect for average length nails.  </li>
            <li> has worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs with fine detail don&#x27;t always work.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product Came in less then a week</li>
            <li> and so I think these will suit her just fine.</li>
            <li> There was a problem when I received them, was sent two Thanksgiving plates; but was able to work with the company and get that taken care of quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to open the package and see all the beautiful designs this bundle has.</li>
            <li> The stamper and type of nail polish you use makes a huge difference as well.  </li>
            <li> Enough designs to make any gal happy.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making them available</li>
            <li> Winstonia&#x27;s customer service was great and so simple!</li>
            <li> The detail was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these plates.</li>
            <li> Cute designs and easy to use and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product they have many cute designs.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> Nail art is so fun!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this set to anyone lookinf for a staple set of images to use year-round, that includes for both Holidays, and every day fun!</li>
            <li> have fun!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I found out that there were nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure is this is the best to you</li>
            <li> Nice to see new designs.</li>
            <li> I have watched all the tutorials on how to prep the plates and stamper, how to clean both, and how to do the stamping...</li>
            <li> The edges were clean, not fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Not as clean of an image sometimes</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and lots of fun.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sets as far as most of the images are things that I could see myself using.</li>
            <li> recycle an old gift card or credit card and it works better!</li>
            <li> Not only do I love a lot of the unique designs that Winstonia used, but I love how cleanly etched and easy to use they are.</li>
            <li> I love nail art in general, It&#x27;s always nice to get new decals to use, I have got so many compliments on these.</li>
            <li> However, many of these are too large for their itty bitty fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Although she&#x27;s not a big fan of stamps she says these are super easy to use and very cute designs.</li>
            <li> This set has a nice variety and the plates that I have tried have been well engraved and transferred clear images.</li>
            <li> and I have a 3 inch binder FULL of plates.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length nails and the full nail images</li>
            <li> Some nail plate sets just don&#x27;t have as many images that I would really care to have on my nails.</li>
            <li> they have really cool designs.</li>
            <li> Great quality, standard size with a paper backing and large full nail designs.</li>
            <li> konad in only white special polish is best.</li>
            <li> pretty happy with these, no complaints, tons of great imagines, an excellant value for the money, something for everyone, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am super bummed about these products.</li>
            <li> :) All plates have a protective backing and they do have a blue film on top of each plate that does need to be removed before you use them..</li>
            <li> i got my plates quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with one of the plates and they quickly sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> These were the very first sets of plates that I bought, and I&#x27;ve bought several since, but these really might be my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Winstonia was my very first nail stamping set.</li>
            <li> This set has some really nice images but most of these are not very original.</li>
            <li> wait to see more from a new company.</li>
            <li> The plates are small, but nice quality and transfer nicely too.</li>
            <li> These plates have the traditional paper backing and adorable images!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I love these and all imagesare clear!  </li>
            <li> Having fun whenever I can.</li>
            <li> also to people who just want to have fun with</li>
            <li> I almost forgot I ordered it, but it was well worth the wait, and I would do it again.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Fun to use.</li>
            <li> it is worth the investment</li>
            <li> My 3 and 5 year old girls love when I stamp their fingers with a fun design.  </li>
            <li> I love these plates, they stamp really well and the image selection is really varied.</li>
            <li> I really love this set and look forward to future Winstonia original plate sets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten plates from other sellers and as of now the Winstonia ones are the best I&#x27;ve gotten; I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone looking to invest in a set of stamping plates.</li>
            <li> And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> very well etched with unique designs...</li>
            <li> I had been searching high and low for good quality plates that won&#x27;t wipe out my bank account.</li>
            <li> I cant compare them to the konad plates as I havent received the ones I have ordered yet, but I would definitely recommend these, I can say that they do stamp a lot better with the konad special polish.</li>
            <li> , they have some cute designs but def not worth the money because most designs are duds.</li>
            <li> Fun images exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried out a couple designs from a couple different plates, and so far they all work beautifully!</li>
            <li> The stamps come out very clear and crisp and the shipping was very quickly.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun holiday and seasonal plates; not like many other sets available online.</li>
            <li> there are other companies ive seen since getting these that offer much cuter designs and more of their designs are cute so for example w</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a detailed peacock feather and here it is the price is outstanding for the amount and quality of these plates</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of plates and the set is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My first order from Winstonia and my order came ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> first set thou</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and they came so fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first order of stamping plates.</li>
            <li> Thank you sooo much!</li>
            <li> I love zebra print, but there are only so many different ways to use that ;)</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this set and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Every week I use a different Winstonia design and receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> Such as different holidays, summer, animal print and many more.</li>
            <li> Overall this was an amazing buy as far as quality, quanity, and the price of course!</li>
            <li> I only had one plate that was not etched enough, but Winstonia&#x27;s amazing customer service replaced the plate super fast!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get this after much hesitation, but glad I did.</li>
            <li> This set has great designs and every one that I&#x27;ve used thus far (which is quite a few)</li>
            <li> My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will, would have loved to have this as 25 plates as the standard.</li>
            <li> the designs are deep enough to get a good stamp.</li>
            <li> I order this nail plates and they came pretty fast, one week</li>
            <li> First off they ship fast.</li>
            <li> I have really got the hang of doing the stamps so much that I now charge for them when I do manicures, acrylics, and gels!</li>
            <li> As I stated, I can&#x27;t vouch for ALL of the plates, but so far so good, and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints from other stampers who ordered.</li>
            <li> I would say that the full length images are good for up to medium length nails, if you have really long nails, the full nail images might be a tad short for you without having to double stamp.</li>
            <li> the little animals are super cute and stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stamped clean and crisp, even with a regular nail polish (I used Color Club Haute Couture).  </li>
            <li> I used regular nail polish, and every image came out crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li> Really recommended.</li>
            <li> all things considered, with the very tumultuous weather we have been having, I would not hold it against the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> its a real at home item.</li>
            <li> No problems with stamping as the plates are engraved very well,</li>
            <li> They work fantastic, images are deeply etched.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t find it to be a problem because it is not affecting the quality of the images.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t use them that much</li>
            <li> They transfer well and the details really show on my nails.</li>
            <li> There are pictures for nearly every holiday as well as fun patterns and designs.</li>
            <li> For these being a first generations series, I was nervous that most of plates would not be etched deep enough so they would not look as crisp as on the nails as they do on the plates.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I used a simple off brand black and they STILL looked amazing!</li>
            <li> The trick with stamping is to use pure acetone and to clean the plate regularly - that way</li>
            <li> The images are really good and there are some that are really different from ones you&#x27;re accustomed seeing in other plate collections.</li>
            <li> This set has a nice range of designs, going from full nail patterns to smaller little pictures.</li>
            <li> All the designs showed up crisp and clear, even the designs with large areas.</li>
            <li> I wish that there were 25 nail art plates in this set like in most of the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to get to use those ones for the different times of year and holidays.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nothing special, I have some Cheeky stamps and they came in a really nice box for storage with a magnetic closure, these just came in a thin paper box.</li>
            <li> The images transfer cleanly, even the tiny intricate ones!</li>
            <li> cover most of my fingers perfectly, other than my thumb, which I did have to do a bit of double stamping for full</li>
            <li> I finally bought these after seeing so many ladies on social media sites use images from this set and wishing I had them.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs were big enough to cover my full nail which I couldn&#x27;t do the express.</li>
            <li> These plates are very nicely etched and has so much variety that I have a hard time deciding which one to use next.</li>
            <li> Only wish they would combine shipping costs if purchasing more than one item at the same time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these plates, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These are high quality disks that work well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them to anyone who likes to do nail art.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any nail art stamper out there.</li>
            <li> , this set has different designs that sets it apart from the other companies, the images transfer nicely on the nails and the plates have the backing which helps...</li>
            <li> A nice set overall, with a variety of image types, from the more classic designs to the whimsical.</li>
            <li> my new nail plates will highly recommend these nail plates and the Winstonia brand.</li>
            <li> I own several other sets of nail plates but these are by far my favorites.  </li>
            <li> i bought the set for only one image, peacock feather and it stamps very well...but am in love with other images</li>
            <li> Winstonia was new to me</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> Love the designs, unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to use any because the stamper I bought from the same company has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> As far as using them, I&#x27;ve found that there is definitely a learning curve when first attempting nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> They all stamp very clearly and I have had no trouble using them at all.</li>
            <li> I have several sets of plates and they offer pretty much the same designs.</li>
            <li> Also ordered three large Stampers and only received one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems as of yet with only getting certain parts of images to stamp.</li>
            <li> It was okay for the money and considering it&#x27;s hard to get these type of art decals hand painted on your toes or fingers nail</li>
            <li> The images come out clear.</li>
            <li> Tons of different but very usable designs.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter is into nail art</li>
            <li> These do not work very well at all, tried multiple designs and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I got these a day early</li>
            <li> You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you try out any of the old polishes you already have at home.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried a few of the designs from this set, but I love them.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to other active stampers who are  use to the popular brand names of stamping such a konad and bundle monster, etc.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these because they are very different from other designs I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> It covers all the major holidays, besides other fun designs.</li>
            <li> It would take me hours to paint my nails with as much details as these and not nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I like the different designs, there are not tons of the houndstooth and animal prints we always get with new sets.</li>
            <li> a little expenses but worth it</li>
            <li> but I must say I have no regrets</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as specified, and came much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> The images look like they will stop well but keep in mind that the full images are on the small side.</li>
            <li> So many images to use you will never get bored or run out of new ideas.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried every single Winstonia stamp image from this collection, I have had no trouble transferring any of the images thus far.  </li>
            <li> The plates are built to last, heavy and sturdy and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> but Winstonia was pretty rude and wanted me to pay shipping and only gave me a guarantee if they arrived back to them in a certain time frame.</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs, there is at least one design I will use on every single plate.</li>
            <li> The images are clear and work well with all types of nail polish as long as the polish is not transparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at the whole nail stamping thing and though i&#x27;m not good yet....</li>
            <li> These plates stamp clearly like other brands i have, so they are not to be looked over.</li>
            <li> I really like that there are a bunch of tiny images that kids and folks with small nails to try out nail design.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long enough nails to do stamps on french tips</li>
            <li> When this finally came in the mail (a day earlier than expected!)</li>
            <li> It also has a couple different holiday/seasonal themed plates for Christmas/Winter, Thanksgiving/Fall, a Halloween plate, Fourth of July/Summertime, and lots of other ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see what the 2nd generation set is going to look like.</li>
            <li> It would make painting my nails so much easier, no more hassle with those darn brushes!</li>
            <li> (Other brands expected me to send back the entire set for an exchange...</li>
            <li> It contains a lot of holiday-themed images, plus plants, animals and various other designs.  </li>
            <li> This set is something you can truly use all year long!</li>
            <li> I like that they are different from the other stamping plates that I have</li>
            <li> The only other brands I&#x27;ve used are mash and salon express.</li>
            <li> but i have yet to have a single stamp work for me.</li>
            <li> but I got two of the same image plates I gave it to my little cousin</li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because some designs would not transfer even with the Konad polish; a little dissapointing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend watching a few of the numerous youtube tutorials that outline techniques and tips for use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested other brand plates on paper too, and didn&#x27;t come close to these plates, had to try twice, not with these.  </li>
            <li> and therefore they are no duplicates from other companies designs.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a photo (see the photo with the Beige base &amp; Red mushrooms stamped) using the Mushrooms from plate W110 for reference to the length of my nails and as an example of the coverage from the full nail image that I used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the edges were not too sharp but they still have a little roughness on them</li>
            <li> At the beginning I was a bit cautious to buy this brand because I had previously bought the Monster Bundle</li>
            <li> They promptly sent me a new plate and a mailing label to return the flawed one.  </li>
            <li> I first painted my nails with a base coat and then topped it with blue polish.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase because i had never heard of the brand and could not find any you tube reviews.</li>
            <li> I have a few Konad plates</li>
            <li> , im not sure if there is a learning curve</li>
            <li> not sure if its how im doing it or if its the stamps.</li>
            <li> so it sort of sucks</li>
            <li> but then I might have had other flawed plates again).  </li>
            <li> rather intricate expecting half of it to show up  but to my surprise I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the image sizes, the image is too small for a few of my nails</li>
            <li> the other patterns are crap</li>
            <li> ill never use because i don&#x27;t like the patterns and then even if i like a pattern</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> These are the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Most of the plates work, but some don&#x27;t take the polish at all (like the Halloween plate).</li>
            <li> My first order from Winstonia and my order came ahead of schedule and I am not disappointed with my purchase and I LOVE my new nail plates will highly recommend these nail plates and the Winstonia brand.</li>
            <li> This set has some really nice images but most of these are not very original. I have several sets of plates and they offer pretty much the same designs. This is wistonias first set thou so I will be looking out for their next set to see if that changes. The plates are nicely made and stamp well.</li>
            <li> I got these a week after I ordered them, they came before the estimated delivery date which is a plus!  I tested all the plates and all the designs.  They stamped clean and crisp, even with a regular nail polish (I used Color Club Haute Couture).  I love the variety offered on these plates and I definitely bought them for the moustache plate.  But the rest of the designs are great, the leopard print on the first plate is so detailed!  These plates cover my nails and may be a smidgen bigger than a Konad full-size image.  A very good investment and great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great image plate set. It contains a lot of holiday-themed images, plus plants, animals and various other designs.  The images transfer well, too.</li>
            <li> These were the very first sets of plates that I bought, and I&#x27;ve bought several since, but these really might be my favorite!!</li>
            <li> So many images to use you will never get bored or run out of new ideas.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. I specifically wanted this set for the christmas sweater image. I am disappointed in the image sizes, the image is too small for a few of my nails so I&#x27;ll have to get creative.</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs, there is at least one design I will use on every single plate. Every on that I&#x27;ve tried has transferred easily. I don&#x27;t have long enough nails to do stamps on french tips so I was happy to find a large set of plates that didn&#x27;t have any of those.</li>
            <li> i liked this set it as pretty cool and stamps very nicely</li>
            <li> Having fun whenever I can.</li>
            <li> So much fun!! I love these plates! So many diferent designs i never know what to chose! I chage design twice a week just because!</li>
            <li> These are the worst. The grooves aren&#x27;t deep enough and the image doesn&#x27;t lift on to the stamper. Super disappointing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the plates yet but the ones I have work well so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the little animals are super cute and stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety and I can&#x27;t wait to use the holiday themed plates. This set is something you can truly use all year long!</li>
            <li> I order this nail plates and they came pretty fast, one week and I had them with me, all of my plates came perfect, NO imperfections. Really recommended. Awesome designs.</li>
            <li> Great disks fun to use</li>
            <li> Love them... exactly what I wanted and they came so fast! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Enough designs to make any gal happy. And there you have it. My review of this great product.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> A nice set overall, with a variety of image types, from the more classic designs to the whimsical.</li>
            <li> Nail art is so fun!  Cute designs and easy to use and the shipping was fast! Good thing because I was excited to use!</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard for stamping plates -- good depth of engraving, good detail, and good thickness. The packaging was nice and they were shipped quickly. There is a bit of a learning curve with stamping, but when you get the hang of it, your manicures will look naked without it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the designs as there are always some in every set that don&#x27;t suit you.  This set has a nice variety and the plates that I have tried have been well engraved and transferred clear images.</li>
            <li> Love my plates. Tons of different but very usable designs. I am pleased with my purchase and would order this brand again.</li>
            <li> It works great. It is quick and easy to use. It will take a bit of practice if you never tried this technique. It shipped well and I love using it.</li>
            <li> I had ordered three sets for gifts no instructions come with them on how go use them. Also ordered three large Stampers and only received one. Wait for a respond.</li>
            <li> I like that there is a lot of different things on them. They give my clients a variety. Thank you for making them available</li>
            <li> The variety of images in this set is nice &amp; the images stamp flawlessly... Great set for an affordable price :)</li>
            <li> Love the designs, unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to use any because the stamper I bought from the same company has not worked for me. I have watched all the tutorials on how to prep the plates and stamper, how to clean both, and how to do the stamping... no luck. I am super bummed about these products.</li>
            <li> Most of the images are really nice and trendy. The only problem is that I have had difficulty transferring the more-intricate images onto the stamper.There&#x27;s a lot of plates and the set is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love nail art in general, It&#x27;s always nice to get new decals to use, I have got so many compliments on these.</li>
            <li> I totally love these, lots and lots of great designs. lots of variety good quality image plates. I love nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this type of nail art on a visit to Vagas. As soon a I got home I looked up similar products on Amazon and bought Winstonia 20 piece Nail art stamping Image plate.  It arrived on time and was wonderful.  The images are clear and work well with all types of nail polish as long as the polish is not transparent. I highly recommend this product.  I used them on my daughters and they loved it too. They have different seasonal images. I will purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get this after much hesitation, but glad I did. The images are really good and there are some that are really different from ones you&#x27;re accustomed seeing in other plate collections. There are no images for doing just tips and somehow I&#x27;m glad about that.</li>
            <li> These plates are a 5 stars!!  These plates are outstanding, I just received them, I started testing them on paper it took me two days, and let me tell you each and every image printed beautiful, the detailing was excellent.  I used regular nail polish, and every image came out crisp and clean.  Imagine with Konad polish can&#x27;t wait to design my nails.  I&#x27;ve tested other brand plates on paper too, and didn&#x27;t come close to these plates, had to try twice, not with these.  I highly recommend these plates, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Great value.</li>
            <li> This was my first order of stamping plates. I had not problems with the images I tried and nothing was out of place or scratched. The trick with stamping is to use pure acetone and to clean the plate regularly - that way you&#x27;ll get a solid image.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters collection! Very nice! They arrived in perfect condition! Thank you sooo much! Happy New YEAR!!!</li>
            <li> This set has great designs and every one that I&#x27;ve used thus far (which is quite a few) has worked just fine. I have a few Konad plates and this is definitely comparable in terms of quality. I&#x27;m curious to see what the 2nd generation set is going to look like. This one was an awesome bargain so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing that one as well.</li>
            <li> Another set of plates to add to my collection! Winstonia was new to me so i thought i&#x27;d give them a try, I was very impressed! These plates have the traditional paper backing and adorable images!  (look at Plate W115!). These plates stamp clearly like other brands i have, so they are not to be looked over. I recommend this to other active stampers who are  use to the popular brand names of stamping such a konad and bundle monster, etc. also to people who just want to have fun with you&#x27;re nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MASH, Konad, and Bundle Monster plates. So far, these plates from Winstonia are the best ones I&#x27;ve used. The images transfer cleanly, even the tiny intricate ones! Very impressed and excited to try out all of these cool designs.</li>
            <li> Took quite a while to come. I almost forgot I ordered it, but it was well worth the wait, and I would do it again.&lt;br /&gt;But all things considered, with the very tumultuous weather we have been having, I would not hold it against the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Some things are out of our control.&lt;br /&gt;Product is awesome. I was so pleased, that I have just placed another order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Winstonia</li>
            <li> Plates are wonderful. The images are a perfect size for toes and fingers and shipping was quick.  Only wish they would combine shipping costs if purchasing more than one item at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at the whole nail stamping thing and though i&#x27;m not good yet....I think this is a good kit. It gives you many options</li>
            <li> There are so many styles you can do with this set. Now, not all of them are my favorite design but most are. Best gift ever for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Excellent variety! Perfect for all seasons! Lots of fun holiday and seasonal plates; not like many other sets available online.</li>
            <li> Love these worked so well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one stamp but I chose one that was rather intricate expecting half of it to show up  but to my surprise I was wrong. I&#x27;m looking for more wistonia plates as I type. Good job guys!!</li>
            <li> great set. will buy from winstonia again.</li>
            <li> Design for every occasion you could possibly imagine. The plates are built to last, heavy and sturdy and definitely worth it. Very easy to use and the designs look great (purchased with a Konad stamper). There are tons of videos all over the place for creative color combinations, styles, and easy to do looks that always impress.</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. its a real at home item. a little expenses but worth it</li>
            <li> Very nice set of nail plates. Would purchase Winstonia again. Stamp transfer is fantastic! So many nice design to choose from!</li>
            <li> Wistonia always has a good varitey of images, and they stamp cleanly.  I would recommend this set to anyone lookinf for a staple set of images to use year-round, that includes for both Holidays, and every day fun!</li>
            <li> Images are very clear, easy to clean, great product. Will definitely purchase from this brand again. I love them! Awesome!</li>
            <li> All of them are so cute!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter is into nail art and I bought these plates to add to her collection. Although she&#x27;s not a big fan of stamps she says these are super easy to use and very cute designs.</li>
            <li> These do not work very well at all, tried multiple designs and nothing worked.  I don&#x27;t think the design is deep enough for the stamp to work.  I tried returning them but Winstonia was pretty rude and wanted me to pay shipping and only gave me a guarantee if they arrived back to them in a certain time frame. Never ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> Best designs. I love these and all imagesare clear!  There is even a gameboy, and tape. Vintage! Lol :-) oh yean the mustache is my fav!</li>
            <li> Met my expectations as a very good product at a very good price. No problems with stamping as the plates are engraved very well,</li>
            <li> I was searching for plates with holiday designs and really liked the variety in this set. I got these plates for Christmas and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Great service. ..Great product. ..will shop again soon! !!</li>
            <li> pretty great, i love some of the fancier ones, my nieces love some of the playful ones. this is quite a diverse set! takes some practice, after about a dozen times i&#x27;m an expert. youtube for instructions, it&#x27;s helpful. have fun!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works great! Can use almost any polish! Very satisfied! Love nail stamp art! I will be purchasing more stamping plates soon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the variety of designs in this set.  It also has something for the holidays all through the year!  This is a must have set for any one who uses nail stamps!</li>
            <li> I have not tested them ALL but the ones I did test were awesome- wish the companies would make the full images larger for TOES- other wise great buy</li>
            <li> Easy to pick up the design, nice designs. I like them a lot. The edges were clean, not fuzzy.Fun to use.</li>
            <li> If you collect nail art stamping sets, you need to have this one!  I loved these nail art plates and, as another buyer commented the designs are unique and therefore they are no duplicates from other companies designs.  I wish that there were 25 nail art plates in this set like in most of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job Winstonia!</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the next set that comes out!  Very clean stamping and great designs.  I like that they are different from the other stamping plates that I have and I have a 3 inch binder FULL of plates.  Nice to see new designs.</li>
            <li> These plates are great, they arrived very quickly.  They work fantastic, images are deeply etched.  I only had one plate with a blemish, so I contacted Winstonia through Amazon.  They promptly sent me a new plate and a mailing label to return the flawed one.  (Other brands expected me to send back the entire set for an exchange...but then I might have had other flawed plates again).  Winstonia&#x27;s customer service was great and so simple!</li>
            <li> I bout these plates for my sister as she enjoys nail art, they&#x27;re probably the best gift I&#x27;ve ever bought her! She literally uses them every day! There are plates for each season so you can chose according to the time of year what you want stamped on your nails! She says they are really easy to use! Great product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the plates yet but the ones I wasn&#x27;t too sure about worked great!  I like to use sally Hansen instadry polishes as they all stamp great but konad in only white special polish is best. also folks don&#x27;t ruin your plates using metal scrapers! recycle an old gift card or credit card and it works better!</li>
            <li> Some of the designs with fine detail don&#x27;t always work.  For the most part they work great! I&#x27;m very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this set of plates!  I have swatched and tested each image on paper and they stamped perfectly. I have attached photos for review of the swatched images on paper for those who would like to see :)  I had no problems at all with this set!&lt;br /&gt;As with most nail plate sets, the full nail images are perfect for average length nails.  I would say that the full length images are good for up to medium length nails, if you have really long nails, the full nail images might be a tad short for you without having to double stamp. I have medium length nails and the full nail images cover most of my fingers perfectly, other than my thumb, which I did have to do a bit of double stamping for full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a photo (see the photo with the Beige base &amp; Red mushrooms stamped) using the Mushrooms from plate W110 for reference to the length of my nails and as an example of the coverage from the full nail image that I used.&lt;br /&gt;This set is a must have IMO for nail stamping enthusiast and it&#x27;s also a great starter set for those new to nail stamping.  This set is great because of it&#x27;s ease of use and the really nice variety of images, including themed plates and Holiday plates.  I really love this set and look forward to future Winstonia original plate sets.  Way to go Winstonia!  Awesome 1st generation plate set!</li>
            <li> Love this set, it has unique images, especially the holiday ones, and it stamps great! Cant&#x27;t wait to see more from a new company.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a Tuesday and received by Friday, from Winstonia store. The amazon fulfilled order I placed at the same time is taking longer, so let&#x27;s say Winstonia is on the ball with shipping. I have tested a handful of images at time of review, and all stamp beautifully. I like the different designs, there are not tons of the houndstooth and animal prints we always get with new sets. WIN! I love zebra print, but there are only so many different ways to use that ;) The holiday plates are amazing, from Easter eggs to St. Patty day beer mugs. And there is a sweater print! Christmas sweater, with snowflakes, which we all love around the holidays. And the peacock feather is the BEST one I&#x27;ve gotten yet. They nailed it, this makes a lot of stampers happy. Eiffel Tower, Leaning Tower of Pisa, a curvy mermaid, this set is full of great designs. Overall, I love this set and would recommend. As I stated, I can&#x27;t vouch for ALL of the plates, but so far so good, and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints from other stampers who ordered. My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will, would have loved to have this as 25 plates as the standard. :) Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The company is amazing! Every week I use a different Winstonia design and receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have only tried a few of the designs from this set, but I love them. They have a paper backing so you wont be cut and the designs are deep enough to get a good stamp. The only other brands I&#x27;ve used are mash and salon express. They are just as good as the Mash and much better then Salon Express. The full nail designs were big enough to cover my full nail which I couldn&#x27;t do the express.</li>
            <li> Love the designs on these plates. Very good quality.....I get so many compliments about my nails. Women I do not even know want to pay me to do their nails : )</li>
            <li> Love the set! They&#x27;re are some very unique stamps included. I love the Tree and hang crystals from the limbs. The stamps come out very clear and crisp and the shipping was very quickly. Looking forward to more stamps from this company!</li>
            <li> This Set is Amazing.. First off they ship fast. :) All plates have a protective backing and they do have a blue film on top of each plate that does need to be removed before you use them.. I love how they have holiday images including in this set. And \\&quot;No\\&quot; worries ladies.. These are not dupe images.. They stamp flawless!.. I was extremely impressed.. I did do a review on these.........  [...]</li>
            <li> love the designs and the ease of using them. There was a problem when I received them, was sent two Thanksgiving plates; but was able to work with the company and get that taken care of quickly. So for product and service I give them a 5 STAR. Everyone loves the design and I see many years ahead of using them.</li>
            <li> I got these a day early so I was totally psyched already, but when I opened these and loomed through the plates my excitement level went through the roof!!! These are amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to tey them out! Eeek!</li>
            <li> I have try them and I am happy with all the images. They turn out great. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had been searching high and low for good quality plates that won&#x27;t wipe out my bank account. I received these plates for Christmas and they totally blew me out of the water. The quality is excellent. All the designs showed up crisp and clear, even the designs with large areas. The detail was fantastic. And at about $17, they&#x27;re definitely better priced than Konad or Bundle Monster, with the same great quality. Definitely going to purchase the second generation set!</li>
            <li> I got this item before the time frame they gave me. I was so excited to open the package and see all the beautiful designs this bundle has. At the beginning I was a bit cautious to buy this brand because I had previously bought the Monster Bundle but I must say I have no regrets, this set has different designs that sets it apart from the other companies, the images transfer nicely on the nails and the plates have the backing which helps...the edges were not too sharp but they still have a little roughness on them so I sanded them with a nail filer and they are perfect now.</li>
            <li> I love them! they are all so beautiful and they transfer very well onto the nail! They got here on time and I look forward to using all these designs</li>
            <li> I used to try and paint my nails using special brushes and dotting tools but they took forever! It would take me hours to paint my nails with as much details as these and not nearly as well. I was really excited when I found out that there were nail stamping plates. It would make painting my nails so much easier, no more hassle with those darn brushes! When this finally came in the mail (a day earlier than expected!) I opened it immediately. I first painted my nails with a base coat and then topped it with blue polish. Once I had done that I put the plate on top of a napkin and painted over it with my favorite copper color from Essie. Then scraped it with the Konad scraper, used the stamper and put it on my nail with a rolling motion. Voila!!! Perfect nails in only seconds!  I highly recommend using this product they have many cute designs. Such as different holidays, summer, animal print and many more. Get these scrapers!</li>
            <li> I had to buy the Stamper but I&#x27;m not sure is this is the best to you or I&#x27;m still in novice in trying to use it. It was okay for the money and considering it&#x27;s hard to get these type of art decals hand painted on your toes or fingers nail it is worth the investment but you must have patience</li>
            <li> Winstonia plates are very good quality and at an amazing price and its only their first generation! :) I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase I 100% recommend these plates !!</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping and I absolutely love these plates. There are so many different themes as well as random designs too. They are larger then my salon express plate designs and stamp perfect. I cant compare them to the konad plates as I havent received the ones I have ordered yet, but I would definitely recommend these, I can say that they do stamp a lot better with the konad special polish. The backing makes them easier to handle with out worrying about getting cut on the sides. Overall this was an amazing buy as far as quality, quanity, and the price of course! I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> So far these plates are awesome. I love the variety of images and the price is great. I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates. Not as clean of an image sometimes but I don&#x27;t want to ruin my plates. You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li> Very nice plates, they stamp well. I have them stored in the bundle monster case, which is a must buy as well.</li>
            <li> These are high quality disks that work well. The images come out clear.</li>
            <li> Awesome product Came in less then a week but I got two of the same image plates I gave it to my little cousin and she loved it</li>
            <li> Fun images exactly as advertised. Arrived promptly. These are so easy to use and lots of fun. I might order more.</li>
            <li> Some really nice designs.  Not all of these plates have nice patterns, but most of the designs are nice and new.</li>
            <li> Great nail plate set. I haven&#x27;t had problems as of yet with only getting certain parts of images to stamp. This is one of my favorite sets as far as most of the images are things that I could see myself using. Some nail plate sets just don&#x27;t have as many images that I would really care to have on my nails. The surfaces of my plates seemed to be somewhat scratched, but that happens with shipping sometimes. I really don&#x27;t find it to be a problem because it is not affecting the quality of the images.</li>
            <li> I really love all of these designs. Winstonia did a great job in selecting the designs to put on this collection. There are so many beautiful designs to chose from.</li>
            <li> pretty happy with these, no complaints, tons of great imagines, an excellant value for the money, something for everyone, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I cannot express just how happy I am with this set. I have been searching high and low for a detailed peacock feather and here it is the price is outstanding for the amount and quality of these plates aswell I tried out the 5 most detailed plates I could find in the set and they all stamped wonderfully for me I used a simple off brand black and they STILL looked amazing! I don&#x27;t care if your just starting out or if you have been stamping for a while the variety, quality, and price everyone NEEDS this set!</li>
            <li> i got my plates quickly. i love them. i have read reviews that people can&#x27;t use them and have got cut on them but if you know how to use stamping plates you will not get cut and they designs do stamp.  they are great. they have really cool designs.</li>
            <li> a coworker of mine uses nail art stamps so i figured id give it a shot, im not sure if there is a learning curve but i have yet to have a single stamp work for me. not sure if its how im doing it or if its the stamps.</li>
            <li> Only one of the place had a problem but not a big problem. I have really got the hang of doing the stamps so much that I now charge for them when I do manicures, acrylics, and gels! Great buy</li>
            <li> I bought the 20 pc. set and I really liked these plates.  The shipping was fast.  Customer service with Winstonia is really great, too.  I had a problem with one of the plates and they quickly sent out a replacement.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who likes to do nail art.</li>
            <li> I love Winstonia plates!  They are very well etched and stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li> i bought these because i love doing nails and i have a couple of konad plates so i thought these would be a great addition, they have some cute designs but def not worth the money because most designs are duds. there are other companies ive seen since getting these that offer much cuter designs and more of their designs are cute so for example w this pack there are a couple of plates ill never use because i don&#x27;t like the patterns and then even if i like a pattern it&#x27;s one pattern on one plate and the other patterns are crap so it sort of sucks and i don&#x27;t use them that much</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift. It&#x27;s for my sister to get started. It shipped quickly and was packaged well. The images look like they will stop well but keep in mind that the full images are on the small side. They wouldn&#x27;t cover my nails but my sister has smaller hands and so I think these will suit her just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried out a couple designs from a couple different plates, and so far they all work beautifully! This set has a nice range of designs, going from full nail patterns to smaller little pictures. It also has a couple different holiday/seasonal themed plates for Christmas/Winter, Thanksgiving/Fall, a Halloween plate, Fourth of July/Summertime, and lots of other ones. I&#x27;m excited to get to use those ones for the different times of year and holidays. I&#x27;ve gotten plates from other sellers and as of now the Winstonia ones are the best I&#x27;ve gotten; I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone looking to invest in a set of stamping plates.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love a lot of the unique designs that Winstonia used, but I love how cleanly etched and easy to use they are. Everything arrived as specified, and came much quicker than expected. I cannot wait to see what Winstonia releases next!</li>
            <li> I just love the images on this set of stamps. They transfer well and the details really show on my nails. The packaging is nothing special, I have some Cheeky stamps and they came in a really nice box for storage with a magnetic closure, these just came in a thin paper box. I was very happy with the short shipping time and great price.</li>
            <li> Winstonia was my very first nail stamping set. I like that you get 20 pieces for $15. It covers all the major holidays, besides other fun designs. The plates are small, but nice quality and transfer nicely too. I use my Winstonia plates often.</li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because some designs would not transfer even with the Konad polish; a little dissapointing.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by these plates. They all stamp very clearly and I have had no trouble using them at all. I am looking forward to future sets from this maker. You have a guaranteed customer here, put me on your list if you have one for future releases. I would highly recommend this to any nail art stamper out there. I have gotten nothing but compliments from both men and women alike on my nails using these plates.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this purchase because i had never heard of the brand and could not find any you tube reviews. But the plates are amazing. Great quality, standard size with a paper backing and large full nail designs.</li>
            <li> I finally bought these after seeing so many ladies on social media sites use images from this set and wishing I had them. The price was great and I am so happy that I made this purchase! I&#x27;ve been playing around with them and have already used them several times to create fun, beautiful manicures!</li>
            <li> I really like that there are a bunch of tiny images that kids and folks with small nails to try out nail design.</li>
            <li> Great designs! Designs are unique! I have ALOT of nail plates and none of them have these designs! Great plates for a great price. And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I own several other sets of nail plates but these are by far my favorites.  I bought a set for me and one for my daughter in law for her birthday and both of us are in love. Ordered these plates on Thursday and they were in my mailbox on Monday. These plates are very nicely etched and has so much variety that I have a hard time deciding which one to use next. I would definitely recommend these to others.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried every single Winstonia stamp image from this collection, I have had no trouble transferring any of the images thus far.  I love the unique designs from this set and get a lot of compliments on my nails when I wear Winstonia images!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the variety of patterns that are included in this set.  There are pictures for nearly every holiday as well as fun patterns and designs. As far as using them, I&#x27;ve found that there is definitely a learning curve when first attempting nail stamping.  I would recommend watching a few of the numerous youtube tutorials that outline techniques and tips for use.  Quite honestly, I&#x27;m still learning how to use these effectively.  The clarity of the patterns on my nails is hit and miss.  I don&#x27;t necessarily fault the product, I think it just takes time to get used to stamping.  The stamper and type of nail polish you use makes a huge difference as well.  Konad polishes work well, but can be pricey.  I would suggest that you try out any of the old polishes you already have at home.  Some work well... and others, well, just don&#x27;t. My 3 and 5 year old girls love when I stamp their fingers with a fun design.  However, many of these are too large for their itty bitty fingernails.  Even still, I&#x27;m glad I purchased this set and plan to continue to play around with them until I perfect the art of nail stamping.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these plates. They stamp well.</li>
            <li> The designs and soo Kool I love it!</li>
            <li> very well etched with unique designs...i bought the set for only one image, peacock feather and it stamps very well...but am in love with other images also..buy them, u wnt regret it...</li>
            <li> Well engraved some cute designs they seem to stamp well&lt;br /&gt;would recommend&lt;br /&gt;words words words words who is so wordy</li>
            <li> I have quite a lot of nail stamps from various brands. I was excited to get these because they are very different from other designs I&#x27;ve gotten. I especially love the holiday designs as I am known to decorate my nails for the holidays. I didn&#x27;t have any Thanksgiving designs so I was thrilled to get these. They are a great quality too and stamp very well. I&#x27;m happy to add these to my collection</li>
            <li> I love these plates, they stamp really well and the image selection is really varied. Check out alteredizzy.com for examples of my creations using these plates!</li>
            <li> For these being a first generations series, I was nervous that most of plates would not be etched deep enough so they would not look as crisp as on the nails as they do on the plates. Boy was I wrong. These are amazing! I only had one plate that was not etched enough, but Winstonia&#x27;s amazing customer service replaced the plate super fast! All my other plates are perfect. They all stamp perfectly and the designs are so adorable! I cannot wait for the second series to come out!</li>
