            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say this does what it says, but it does take time to do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of freaked out to use it now.</li>
            <li>Kind of a nice lotion though.</li>
            <li>I have many freckles that I wanted to remove.</li>
            <li>Worked better than I had hoped...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a difference with this cream yet.</li>
            <li>I recommend you get it if you don&#x27;t have as many spots.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best skin lightening I have ever used and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work a litle bit for me , i&#x27;ll will order more</li>
            <li>This also had a better scent.</li>
            <li>So happy to fined the old jar and even happier to be able to fined it here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for moisturizer</li>
            <li>Seems to be working okay and mild too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I bought it and two weeks later I started to see results..</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s non-greasy and odor- free.  </li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin, which I am very happy about  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really HOPING it will!!!</li>
            <li>I am excited to start using it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I used this cream very lightly after washing my face and the free gift of a serum that was included with my order, and now, about 2 hours after using it, my face feels soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>works good especially in the spring and summer when you get sun on your chest.</li>
            <li>the price is a joke for such good face cream.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>less than one week most of my age spots disappeared and my face has a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;The face cream is very soft and light as well and it is quickly absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and most creams irritate my skin by morning, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>Wife liked it so much that she threw out 2 new unopened containers of Palmers Skin Success cream.</li>
            <li>It has kept fine lines at bay too thanks to the alpha-hydroxy in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>you for such a good product that really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable and it delivers 100% of what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>and I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>, she loves them and says that her skin has improved over just the past couple weeks, she asked me to find more things she can benefit from so i will be purchasing more products from tony moly, mizon, and etude as well as skin food.</li>
            <li>I read that you&#x27;re not supposed to use hydroquinone for more than 2 months anyway, because it can have the opposite effect with over use.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using black and white bleaching cream underneath my make up for many, many years as my primer &amp; I will continue to do so</li>
            <li>It might help some people with their age spots but it did absolutely nothing for mine...  </li>
            <li>I am 75 and probably spend too much time in the sun during the summer months.</li>
            <li>If u want a fast fix this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much to fade brown spots.</li>
            <li>i use this after the kojie san soap it wasnt greasy absorbs fast and when i awoke in the morning i didnt hav that greasy nose</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really lasts, and my doctor has congratulated me for staying out of the sun.  </li>
            <li>you so much.  </li>
            <li>My Son found it for me and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;RSW</li>
            <li>I mean I did what it said to do and the results are good</li>
            <li>I also like that it has AHA which helps the active ingredient work better.</li>
            <li>the dark mustache look you get over your top lip from using birth control..</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly and I an unopened new container, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet and am not able to say if it is effective.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>WOW so happy with this product and highly recommend it to anyone who has uneven skin and other issues.</li>
            <li>With a daily application (it&#x27;s now habit for me), it lightens quite nicely, without causing an artificially pale appearance.  </li>
            <li>but first impression is that it is pleasantly scented, and it isn&#x27;t heavy or thick.</li>
            <li>It works well as a lotion though but have not seen any skin lightening so far.</li>
            <li>cream leaves my skin soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Smells like an old person</li>
            <li>My spots aren&#x27;t completely gone, but after about a week, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne sports getting lighter.</li>
            <li>, The price is cheap compared to other Beverly Hills packaged products with the same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know how its going to work as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products non have worked on dark spots like this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff takes a while to work, but it has removed three large age spots on my face: one above a brow, another on my chin and the last on my forehead.</li>
            <li>This cream takes a few weeks to work, so if you don&#x27;t see quick results, just keep using it and baby, before you know it people will be asking you for your skin care regime or what&#x27;s the name of your dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Product does not work as described and caused major damage to my face.</li>
            <li>I just started using this cream and when I first applied it to my face, I felt a slight tingle, as someone else had mentioned.</li>
            <li>I have gotten down to the last bits of my first jar.</li>
            <li>I used this for 4-5 weeks, but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my dark spots from sun and scarring.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know the main ingredient was carcinogenic when I bought it and that its banned in several other countries.</li>

            <li> Any how , it was just something I thought I would take a chance on and so far after a few weeks of daily use I have seen no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the results, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it&#x27;s worth a try since it&#x27;s a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed after all the great reviews :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream twice a day for several weeks and have seen a noticeable reduction to my dark spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through about half of it in the last 5 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to use sunscreen afterwards as this is part of the issue-that and ageing.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a big plus with me, because I can&#x27;t stand heavy, greasy creams on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the product and hopefully will see a difference by the time the container is empty.  </li>
            <li> Used about 2/3s of the jar with a couple of applications daily, usually one just before going to bed at night ...</li>
            <li> how im expected!</li>
            <li> I gave the rating a 2 because the pproduct was poorly packet - the cream spilled out and was pretty dried out!  </li>
            <li> Only slightly faded already small freckles.</li>
            <li> I. have to share the wealth on this hidden treasure.  </li>
            <li> the %  of active substance is not more to 2%</li>
            <li> I thought this is kinda like everything you see on late night tv for 19.99, never really does what it claims</li>
            <li> Few bucks gone no biggie</li>
            <li> Have used for a few months now and have not noticed any difference</li>
            <li> I have a few brown spots and some discoloration from scaring on my face and a few age spots on my arms which I also used this cream on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> so i bought her a few products from mizon</li>
            <li> and I usually have to apply moisturizer on immediately after washing my face.</li>
            <li> sorry to say that the product had no apparent effect on my age spots.</li>
            <li> look(negro pple know what i mean)</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and there it has stayed :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Made my face much worse!!!!  </li>

            <li> It might help some people with their age spots but it did absolutely nothing for mine...  and I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> I gave the rating a 2 because the pproduct was poorly packet - the cream spilled out and was pretty dried out!  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Used about 2/3s of the jar with a couple of applications daily, usually one just before going to bed at night ... sorry to say that the product had no apparent effect on my age spots. But, what the heck ... I am 75 and probably spend too much time in the sun during the summer months.</li>
            <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned. I&#x27;ve used this cream twice a day for several weeks and have seen a noticeable reduction to my dark spots. I&#x27;m careful to use sunscreen afterwards as this is part of the issue-that and ageing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a while now. I have many freckles that I wanted to remove. It didn&#x27;t remove them but it did make them lighter. I am not done with the tub yet. I use it every day twice a day. If u want a fast fix this is not for you. I will keep using it until it&#x27;s done to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, will have to wait until I use the entire jar and then see what happens.</li>
            <li> my mom initially bought this for age spots and she raved about it...I tried it for sun spots or simply consistency...this works and I have used RX skin lightening systems for sun spots before and melasma...this works.</li>
            <li> I thought this is kinda like everything you see on late night tv for 19.99, never really does what it claims, The price is cheap compared to other Beverly Hills packaged products with the same ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I have some skin sun spots that I just wanted to go away and even just diminish a bit. I would have been happy to just have them just lightened up a bit.  Any how , it was just something I thought I would take a chance on and so far after a few weeks of daily use I have seen no noticeable difference. Few bucks gone no biggie , I&#x27;ve seen similar products sell for up to $80.</li>
            <li> I. have to share the wealth on this hidden treasure.  I&#x27;ve been using black and white bleaching cream underneath my make up for many, many years as my primer &amp; I will continue to do so but at nite I use this fade cream to replenish the elasticity of my skin all over.  As a result of this fade cream I have a good even skin tone.  You have to try it, and you&#x27;ll be glad you did!  It&#x27;s also FRAGRANCE FREE!!!  This cream takes a few weeks to work, so if you don&#x27;t see quick results, just keep using it and baby, before you know it people will be asking you for your skin care regime or what&#x27;s the name of your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Prompt service. Good product. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Worked better than I had hoped...spots have faded, skin looks terrific.  Definitely worth the money.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I AM SEEING GOOD RESULTS AFTER TWO WEEKS</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I bought it and two weeks later I started to see results..Great buy would reccomend</li>
            <li> Did not the ingredients that were listed. If I had know what was in it I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I HAD NO PROBLEMS. IT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Too soon for a review.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and I an unopened new container, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet and am not able to say if it is effective.</li>
            <li> No results seen yet and it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks using it daily. It works well as a lotion though but have not seen any skin lightening so far.</li>
            <li> Not working on my skin type, I thought it was going to lighten the age spot on my face</li>
            <li> the %  of active substance is not more to 2% how im expected! is 1.5%</li>
            <li> Have used for a few months now and have not noticed any difference</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a difference with this cream yet.</li>
            <li> I have gotten down to the last bits of my first jar. This stuff takes a while to work, but it has removed three large age spots on my face: one above a brow, another on my chin and the last on my forehead. Small speckled age spots have gotten much lighter. It has even worked on age spots on the backs of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream leaves my skin soft, but not greasy. It has kept fine lines at bay too thanks to the alpha-hydroxy in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing this cream has not done is lighten the melasma on my jaw line. It has evened it out a bit, but that&#x27;s the hazards of being an aging female. Hormones + time + genetics &#x3D; permanent signs of aging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing a great review because I am about to order another pot of this fade creme!</li>
            <li> Made my face much worse!!!!  Brown spot all over!!!!  Watch out!!!</li>
            <li> Good service. As advertised.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream and when I first applied it to my face, I felt a slight tingle, as someone else had mentioned.I have a few brown spots and some discoloration from scaring on my face and a few age spots on my arms which I also used this cream on. Of course, I can&#x27;t say how it works but first impression is that it is pleasantly scented, and it isn&#x27;t heavy or thick. It sinks right into my skin, which I am very happy about  and that&#x27;s a big plus with me, because I can&#x27;t stand heavy, greasy creams on my face. I have dry skin and I usually have to apply moisturizer on immediately after washing my face. I used this cream very lightly after washing my face and the free gift of a serum that was included with my order, and now, about 2 hours after using it, my face feels soft and smooth to the touch. I hope it gets rid of my spots! I&#x27;ll ad and update when it does! If nothing else, it is a very nice cream. I gave it 4 stars only because I don&#x27;t know if it will  get rid of my spots! I&#x27;m really HOPING it will!!! UPDATE:  I didn&#x27;t get any results from this at all. It did nothing to lighten my age spots and hyperpigmentation. NOTHING. It&#x27;s fine for moisturizer but it ended up in my cabinet and there it has stayed :(</li>
            <li> Age spot fade creme&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know how its going to work as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
            <li> The product is great . I mean I did what it said to do and the results are good but some of my spots are still here. Maybe they will fade away over time. I recommend you get it if you don&#x27;t have as many spots.</li>
            <li> works good for age spots</li>
            <li> Good product. Can see it working.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  Purchased based on reviews.  Didn&#x27;t do much to fade brown spots.</li>
            <li> I use this cream just before bed.  I like that it&#x27;s non-greasy and odor- free.  My skin is very sensitive and most creams irritate my skin by morning, but not this one.  I also like that it has AHA which helps the active ingredient work better.</li>
            <li> WHEN I PUT IN MY HANDS THE NEXT MORNING MY HANDS GOT BURN</li>
            <li> works good especially in the spring and summer when you get sun on your chest.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a month and some change. I can honestly say this does what it says, but it does take time to do it. Patience is necessary when you use this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap-Sucks-doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom who is 53 with some wrinkles here and there (she looks great for her age) but she is selfconscious about her skin, so i explained to her that Korean beauty products are where she needs to start buying from instead of lancome or clinique and she doubted so i bought her a few products from mizon, she loves them and says that her skin has improved over just the past couple weeks, she asked me to find more things she can benefit from so i will be purchasing more products from tony moly, mizon, and etude as well as skin food. i recommend all these brands.</li>
            <li> Smells like an old person and I used it twice daily for almost 3 months and noticed zero benefits or lightening.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best skin lightening I have ever used and the price is a joke for such good face cream.&lt;br /&gt;In less than one week most of my age spots disappeared and my face has a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;The face cream is very soft and light as well and it is quickly absorbed by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.  I will use it for life !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a good product that really does what it says.</li>
            <li> I am a african...or negro from trinidad look it up.....i use this after the kojie san soap it wasnt greasy absorbs fast and when i awoke in the morning i didnt hav that greasy nose look(negro pple know what i mean)...will update if it works abit</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the main ingredient was carcinogenic when I bought it and that its banned in several other countries. I&#x27;m kind of freaked out to use it now.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working okay and mild too.</li>
            <li> I got this and used for many months and sorry to say I never saw any difference in my age spots.  Kind of a nice lotion though. Fast shipping too.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product does not work as described and caused major damage to my face.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream!! After just 3 treatments I have minimized years of sun damage and the dark mustache look you get over your top lip from using birth control..WOW so happy with this product and highly recommend it to anyone who has uneven skin and other issues. Price is very reasonable and it delivers 100% of what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an over the counter hydroquinone cream to see if it would work for me. I used this for 4-5 weeks, but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my dark spots from sun and scarring. I had to stop using it because I have sensitive skin, and it caused a slight acne-type rash on my face. I read that you&#x27;re not supposed to use hydroquinone for more than 2 months anyway, because it can have the opposite effect with over use. I was disappointed with the results, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it&#x27;s worth a try since it&#x27;s a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work a litle bit for me , i&#x27;ll will order more</li>
            <li> Wife liked it so much that she threw out 2 new unopened containers of Palmers Skin Success cream. This also had a better scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff really lasts, and my doctor has congratulated me for staying out of the sun.  With a daily application (it&#x27;s now habit for me), it lightens quite nicely, without causing an artificially pale appearance.  It&#x27;s also a reasonably good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through about half of it in the last 5 months. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this crème twice a day for about three weeks now and do not see a noticeable difference yet.  I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the product and hopefully will see a difference by the time the container is empty.  I use it on sun damage on my neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li> My spots aren&#x27;t completely gone, but after about a week, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne sports getting lighter. This is really good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a long time ago.  So happy to fined the old jar and even happier to be able to fined it here.  Have tried many other products non have worked on dark spots like this.  I am excited to start using it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.  My Son found it for me and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;RSW</li>
            <li> Did nothing to reduce any of my acne scars and I&#x27;m really disappointed after all the great reviews :/</li>
            <li> It did  not  do what is  written  on the  product</li>
            <li> Only slightly faded already small freckles. I would not buy again. I also used the whole jar everyday.</li>
