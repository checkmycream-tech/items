    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent just wish I could get these in this country</li>
            <li>, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The seller did great.</li>
            <li>Very nice sheet.</li>
            <li>Good idea.</li>
            <li>Not so good repair if the nail split is at the edge of the nail.  </li>
            <li>Good way to cover a nail break until it grows out.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails.  </li>
            <li>it just seems like it would eventually lift), but it does stay fairly well and does keep the break from tearing more until you can get to a point where you can fix it permanently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked great and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I put one of these patches over the split and trim the top.  </li>
            <li>I was sooo pleased when I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I then buffed the nail lightly, applied my top coat, polish, and clear coat, and voila, perfect nail and no snag.  </li>
            <li>but the stuff just sat on top of my nail and then pealed off.</li>
            <li>used bandages once, now the kit is mostly used up.</li>
            <li>a more permanent fix</li>
            <li>Better than any I&#x27;ve tried in the pat though.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product, it is great for a quick fix, almost invisible.</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, water seemed to get under the edges and very quickly it wore off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like strong post-it note glue.  </li>
            <li>I have tried super glue, nail glue, nail strengthener, tea bags, top coat, undercoat, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did though, because it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This comes with a pad to buff the nail smooth</li>
            <li>Completely prevents snags and way easier and more effective than glues.</li>
            <li>but for the most part they blend right in with your polish.  </li>
            <li>I hope it will be as good after lauhdry and will last.</li>
            <li>You may even want to take a quick swab of rubbing alcohol across to pull out any additional oils that may be on the nail.</li>
            <li>Both products are good and useful in different ways.  </li>
            <li>It has worn beautifully through water and everyday wear and NO SNAGGING ON CLOTHES, YAY!</li>
            <li>I had just split my nail right at the nail bed</li>
            <li>Price is right, no complaints.</li>
            <li>I do pretty well in the summertime because it&#x27;s very humid where I live, and my nails stay more moist and flexible.  </li>
            <li>the shipping cost is more than the price of the merchandise, I&#x27;m only giving this item two stars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had just as many showers, countless hand washings, and was even doing some manual labor over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad someone thought to make this very necessary product.</li>
            <li>the people who had them fall off quickly, I would be sure to use the buffer to file the nail slightly before applying.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help much for my nails.</li>
            <li>There really wasn&#x27;t a description of this product listed on the seller&#x27;s page.  </li>
            <li>This kit IS all that, but the adhesive just doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>Works great with nails split down the center.</li>
            <li>It seemed to hold ok for a few hours, but really didn&#x27;t stick that well and did not conform that well to the curvature of my nail.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These come in various sizes, but I tend to only get small cracks (1/8 - 1/4 inch at most), so I&#x27;ll most likely trim down the larger ones to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li>You can see the film on the nail once polish has been applied, but it will give my room to still wear my nails polished while the repair is growing out to later be filed down:).  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t use the 5 Second Nail Repair Kit when you have polish on unless you want permanent polish color stuck in the crack of the tear.</li>
            <li>In my view, these things are only useful to hold your nail in place until you can get home and do a proper repair.  </li>
            <li>What seems to have helped ME the most is wearing the cotton-spandex gloves every night, over a thick layer of hand cream with alpha hydroxy acid.</li>
            <li>So, bottom line, I would maybe carry this in my purse or travel bag, for a quick fix away from home - until I am able to use something more &amp;#34;permanent.&amp;#34;  I have used small pieces of Nexcare medical tape in the past, and that has stayed on a lot longer than these little decals.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these because I wanted a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; with no mess.  </li>
            <li>I have had opportunity to use the first one just two days ago; therefore, I won&#x27;t know if it actually works as long as advertized for a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my opinion is that they are not really that useful as they do not adhere well enough, nor conform to the curvature of the nail.</li>
            <li>and then what are essentially clear plastic stickers in various sizes.</li>
            <li>I have soft nails and they always seem to break mid nail and can&#x27;t be cut or filed.</li>
            <li>It says you can use it on bare Nails, or over / under polish.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like - only 5 days</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to adhere it to my bare nail, so I buffed the area of the split, put a base coat on (Essie protein base), let it dry, buffed lightly once more, then applied one of the smaller bandages on top.</li>
            <li> In the winter the air is dry, and it gets dryer still with central heating!  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure what I expected when I received this item, but I ended up with four tiny (about 1.5&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34;) squares of sticker paper and a few ovals of clear &amp;#34;bandages&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the nail from breaking and sticks well (have used a long a two weeks)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I get lots and lots of vertical splits in my dry and brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> After buffing, wash and dry the nail thoroughly.</li>
            <li> If my manicure is fairly new I can cut the little swatch down to size and change it out every two days but its a pain because the edges eventually lift and catch my hair or get linty.  </li>
            <li> The bandages are a little larger than I have used before, but can be applied and trimmed after the application.</li>
            <li> I tried a few more, but just gave up eventually and went back to using a fabric bandaid to prevent the nail from tearing (it would have been a painful one, as I cut into the fleshy part of the nail bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was careful not to touch the sticky part with my hands while I was putting it on</li>
            <li> This results in either me snagging it on clothes and other fabrics constantly, or trimming it off at an uncomfortably low length (which then often results in me trimming or biting all my other nails down because I can&#x27;t stand them to be uneven).</li>
            <li> The toenail on my big toe had a horizontal crack about half way down the nail that went half way across.</li>
            <li> What I actually received was 3 small 1.5 X 2 inch sheets of what I would describe as precut self-stick decals and a 1.75 inch square, foam core, two sided buffing pad.  </li>
            <li> I keep my Nails longer (usually somewhere around 1/4 inch), but have constant issues with my thumbnails cracking just below where the nail separates from my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since put one on my other thumbnail, and painted my nails overtop the bandages.</li>
            <li> because I have to take half of the responsibility for not getting what I expected since I made assumptions about what the product was.</li>
            <li> You cannot file it down without ruining your manicure</li>
            <li> These little bandages attach just where they are needed and accept polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are like little temporary glossy nail band-aids that go over your manicure.  </li>
            <li> I washed and dried my hands before applying the little decal, but did not use nail polish remover or alcohol</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> These little things are just what the doctor ordered to fix this issue!</li>
            <li> My manicure usually lasts less than two weeks because I&#x27;m very hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I get a bad tear and have one nail that splits down the middle length-wise.  </li>
            <li> Tough to make it work if you do it yourself.</li>
            <li> I am constantly troubled with split and craking nails.  </li>
            <li> (unless for some reason, like gardening without gloves) it gets dirty.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have nails that split and get snagged on clothing, etc., this is a great product. The adhesive sticks through water and whatever else you are handling throughout the day.  Completely prevents snags and way easier and more effective than glues.</li>
            <li> I have a nail that was damaged in the nailbed about 3 years ago.  Since then, no matter what I do, it splits in the same spot. I&#x27;ve tried everything and it keeps splitting.  I put one of these patches over the split and trim the top.  It keeps the nail from breaking and snagging.  The patch stays is place and is not affected by water etc.  I change it about once a week when I manicure my nails (unless for some reason, like gardening without gloves) it gets dirty.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on, therefore of no value in repairing the nail.</li>
            <li> The SuperNail Nail Bandages Instant Nail Repair did not arrive on time, but did eventually get here.  I have had opportunity to use the first one just two days ago; therefore, I won&#x27;t know if it actually works as long as advertized for a while.  The bandages are a little larger than I have used before, but can be applied and trimmed after the application.</li>
            <li> Good idea. Only wished they stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> I was sooo pleased when I found this product.  I had just split my nail right at the nail bed and I didn&#x27;t want to cut the remaining nail off (for fear of pain), but I also didn&#x27;t want it to snag on clothes either (pain again).  I found this at my local Sally store, went home and immediately applied it.  I buffed the nail and washed my hands so the film would adhere properly.  I then buffed the nail lightly, applied my top coat, polish, and clear coat, and voila, perfect nail and no snag.  You can see the film on the nail once polish has been applied, but it will give my room to still wear my nails polished while the repair is growing out to later be filed down:).  It has worn beautifully through water and everyday wear and NO SNAGGING ON CLOTHES, YAY!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help much for my nails.</li>
            <li> There really wasn&#x27;t a description of this product listed on the seller&#x27;s page.  Only a list of features.  I don&#x27;t know why but I thought I was getting a roll of nail repair material.  What I actually received was 3 small 1.5 X 2 inch sheets of what I would describe as precut self-stick decals and a 1.75 inch square, foam core, two sided buffing pad.  There are 10 decals per sheet in various sized oval shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hands and properly buffing my nail so that the glue would adhere, I found that the adhesive was not all that durable.  It&#x27;s like strong post-it note glue.  In my view, these things are only useful to hold your nail in place until you can get home and do a proper repair.  That combined with the fact that the order took 8 days to get to me and the shipping cost is more than the price of the merchandise, I&#x27;m only giving this item two stars.  One star because I like the buffing pad.  And one star because I have to take half of the responsibility for not getting what I expected since I made assumptions about what the product was.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product, it is great for a quick fix, almost invisible. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Tough to make it work if you do it yourself. I am still using it. I will come back on in a month to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Supernail Nail Bandage Instant Nail Repair Kit because of the written description. It works well and is easy to use.  I have soft nails and they always seem to break mid nail and can&#x27;t be cut or filed. These do the trick by applying and allowing nail growth. Works great with nails split down the center.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me... followed directions but the stuff just sat on top of my nail and then pealed off.</li>
            <li> Excellent just wish I could get these in this country</li>
            <li> waste of money.  used bandages once, now the kit is mostly used up. won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I wanted a &amp;#34;quick fix&amp;#34; with no mess.  This kit IS all that, but the adhesive just doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  I washed and dried my hands before applying the little decal, but did not use nail polish remover or alcohol (I did buff the edges of the split with the buffer pad that comes with the kit).  So, bottom line, I would maybe carry this in my purse or travel bag, for a quick fix away from home - until I am able to use something more &amp;#34;permanent.&amp;#34;  I have used small pieces of Nexcare medical tape in the past, and that has stayed on a lot longer than these little decals.  I do pretty well in the summertime because it&#x27;s very humid where I live, and my nails stay more moist and flexible.  In the winter the air is dry, and it gets dryer still with central heating!  That&#x27;s when I get lots and lots of vertical splits in my dry and brittle nails.  What seems to have helped ME the most is wearing the cotton-spandex gloves every night, over a thick layer of hand cream with alpha hydroxy acid.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product because of the mixed reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did though, because it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! I keep my Nails longer (usually somewhere around 1/4 inch), but have constant issues with my thumbnails cracking just below where the nail separates from my skin. This results in either me snagging it on clothes and other fabrics constantly, or trimming it off at an uncomfortably low length (which then often results in me trimming or biting all my other nails down because I can&#x27;t stand them to be uneven). These little things are just what the doctor ordered to fix this issue! I got a split in my nail last Tuesday and tried this out in the evening. It says you can use it on bare Nails, or over / under polish. I didn&#x27;t want to adhere it to my bare nail, so I buffed the area of the split, put a base coat on (Essie protein base), let it dry, buffed lightly once more, then applied one of the smaller bandages on top. I was careful not to touch the sticky part with my hands while I was putting it on so I didnt get any oils on it.  It&#x27;s now Monday and I&#x27;ve since put one on my other thumbnail, and painted my nails overtop the bandages. They are just now starting to peel away, but I&#x27;d say a solid 5-6 days isn&#x27;t too shabby!  I&#x27;ve had just as many showers, countless hand washings, and was even doing some manual labor over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in various sizes, but I tend to only get small cracks (1/8 - 1/4 inch at most), so I&#x27;ll most likely trim down the larger ones to get more use out of them. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping a supply of these on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who had them fall off quickly, I would be sure to use the buffer to file the nail slightly before applying. After buffing, wash and dry the nail thoroughly. You may even want to take a quick swab of rubbing alcohol across to pull out any additional oils that may be on the nail.</li>
            <li> Not so good repair if the nail split is at the edge of the nail.  The seller did great.</li>
            <li> I am constantly troubled with split and craking nails.  These little bandages attach just where they are needed and accept polish.</li>
            <li> Product did not work as advertised.  Didn&#x27;t hold the break like it was supposed to.  Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I split my nail about 2 months ago - and no matter what I do it won&#x27;t grow out.  I have tried super glue, nail glue, nail strengthener, tea bags, top coat, undercoat, etc.  You name it.  This is the only product I found that will keep my nail together and I don&#x27;t have to bother with it for days at a time.  Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like - only 5 days max but I am hoping over time it will be enough for the split to grow out.</li>
            <li> Very nice sheet. I hope it will be as good after lauhdry and will last.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails.  My manicure usually lasts less than two weeks because I&#x27;m very hard on my nails.  Once in a while I get a bad tear and have one nail that splits down the middle length-wise.  I keep these in my purse for when this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are like little temporary glossy nail band-aids that go over your manicure.  If you look closely you can tell they are there but for the most part they blend right in with your polish.  They last me about two days max.  If my manicure is fairly new I can cut the little swatch down to size and change it out every two days but its a pain because the edges eventually lift and catch my hair or get linty.  You cannot file it down without ruining your manicure and I doubt you can put gel over it (I haven&#x27;t tried but it just seems like it would eventually lift), but it does stay fairly well and does keep the break from tearing more until you can get to a point where you can fix it permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more permanent fix I use the 5 Second Nail Repair Kit under the gel polish.  Both products are good and useful in different ways.  You really can&#x27;t use the 5 Second Nail Repair Kit when you have polish on unless you want permanent polish color stuck in the crack of the tear.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure what I expected when I received this item, but I ended up with four tiny (about 1.5&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34;) squares of sticker paper and a few ovals of clear &amp;#34;bandages&amp;#34;.  I followed the directions and attempted to fix a hangnail from where I cut my nail using a kitchen knife while slicing veggies.  It seemed to hold ok for a few hours, but really didn&#x27;t stick that well and did not conform that well to the curvature of my nail.  Because of this, water seemed to get under the edges and very quickly it wore off.  I tried a few more, but just gave up eventually and went back to using a fabric bandaid to prevent the nail from tearing (it would have been a painful one, as I cut into the fleshy part of the nail bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my opinion is that they are not really that useful as they do not adhere well enough, nor conform to the curvature of the nail.</li>
            <li> I keep a package at home and in my travel bag. Good way to cover a nail break until it grows out. Only lasts a couple days though and then needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It keeps the nail from breaking and sticks well (have used a long a two weeks) however you can tell it&#x27;s there.  Better than any I&#x27;ve tried in the pat though.</li>
            <li> My nails always break where I cannot remove the nail. I have to wait until it grows out to remove. This buys me time.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on the nail and it stays until the nail grows out. I am glad someone thought to make this very necessary product.</li>
            <li> This worked great and was exactly what I needed. The toenail on my big toe had a horizontal crack about half way down the nail that went half way across. I was looking for something to hold it together and keep it from cracking further. This comes with a pad to buff the nail smooth and then what are essentially clear plastic stickers in various sizes. I&#x27;ve had it on for about two weeks and so far it&#x27;s worked great. Stays on through showering daily and taking shoes and socks on and off. Price is right, no complaints.</li>
