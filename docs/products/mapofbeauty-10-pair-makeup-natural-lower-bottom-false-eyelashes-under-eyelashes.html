            <li> As expected, thank you!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality and very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these would be shorter and thiner than my regular eyelashes so that sucks</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll have to cut them a little bit.</li>
            <li> Really thin would have to double up for one eye</li>
            <li> Cheap the worst eye lashes I have ever seen</li>
            <li> Poor quality and hard to apply</li>
            <li> The false hairs are a bit together</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it looks so fake</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult.</li>
            <li> but i do not have that optionthey are horrible</li>

            <li> These are really nice!!! In a local Beauty Supply store, one pair ranges from 3 to 4 bucks! So this amount for the price is unbeatable! And the lags are actually nice! I got these to try out to see if I could get use to bouton lashes, but they irritate the skin where the hair touches. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to cut them a little bit. Awesome product. Worth the money and the wait.</li>
