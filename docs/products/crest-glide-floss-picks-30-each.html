            <li>glides between even the most tightly-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>Unlike the blue glide floss sticks, there are the best.  </li>
            <li>If you teeth are crowded, this floss pick will work much better for you than any others.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work OK but not as well as I remember when it was made by Crest.</li>
            <li>I love Crest Glide Floss Picks.  </li>
            <li>Buy them often they are my favorite floss picks.</li>
            <li>I actually am okay with flossing now.</li>
            <li>Way better than any of those floss</li>
            <li>Love these flossers, never go without them.  </li>
            <li>I love the Crest Glide Picks.</li>
            <li>The floss is strong which is the most important, but my wife says some of the cheaper ones are easier to maneuver in her mouth.</li>
            <li>The design of these Glide Floss Picks are perfect because it makes reaching your back teeth very easy going straight into your mouth, and not having to come in from the side where your cheeks are in the way.</li>
            <li>Some have floss that doesn&#x27;t glide between the teeth easily.</li>
            <li>The curve of the pick makes it easy to reach anywhere in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li>Since your front teeth are easy to reach, the design is still easy to use there.</li>
            <li>Think they are easy for kids to use also</li>
            <li>smooth slides easily between teeth</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>The ability to pinch the sides to increase tension in the floss is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note, these Glide Floss Picks are sold on many different Amazon listings and in various quantities, so make sure to shop around for the best price.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Great for kids, especially, who can&#x27;t handle floss.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore in my local stores, but the ones in this order seem in every manner to be authentic and good.  </li>
            <li>Who ever knew being able to tighten a thread to get into tight spots could be so AMAZING?!?</li>
            <li>Since Crest took over the production of these picks, they break far more easily.</li>
            <li>I can no longed find them in the stores, so must order, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>I was instructed by my dental hygienist to get these, and boy was she right.</li>
            <li>no other pick seems to be able to get back there consistently, comfortably and without easily breaking.</li>
            <li>Since discovering these Crest Glide Floss Picks, we don&#x27;t use regular floss any more.  </li>
            <li>They are the only picks that don&#x27;t break or shred on me, and I love that you can squeeze the handle and tighten the floss.</li>
            <li>It was exactly like shown and priced very well.  </li>
            <li>SO happy to be able to find these here and would recommend them to anyone who has trouble with normal dental floss or other types of floss sticks!</li>
            <li>Luckily this seller offers this brand at a reasonable price and shipped them promptly.</li>
            <li>They cost a little more, but they are worth it if you don&#x27;t want to use a floss threader to pick shredded floss out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Also the fork and angled to really get back there comfortable.  </li>
            <li>These are the only one&#x27;s that will fit in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They make me enjoy flossing... such a daunting task...</li>
            <li>Really like the product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper to just purchase them at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Flossing can be a real pain.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried these, you should give them a shot, because it will make flossing so much easier to keep up</li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast service</li>
            <li>I cannot find these in stores anymore and continue to order them online because I like them so much.</li>
            <li>But they work well and are strong enough, if you&#x27;re lucky, to not only remove unwanted material, but also to provide all-important gum massage as well.</li>
            <li>Following this sage advice, these floss picks make the hard-to-get-to-places easily accessible and speed up the process for all teeth.</li>
            <li>Need to reach the back of your jaw so clean your teeth?</li>
            <li>so the design of this floss pick allow me to clean between the back molars.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without these!</li>
            <li>What can I say, I like this particular type of floss/pick because it is sturdy and lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>Also being able to tighten the floss helps helps pull the floss from tight spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Other floss picks break too easily or become loose and won&#x27;t fit between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I frequently bought out their supplies so it certainly wasn&#x27;t from lack of sales.</li>
            <li>She cant live without them and my dad was a dentist</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a lot of control with the Crest flossers, and it&#x27;s the only thing that gets me to floss consistently.  </li>
            <li>It slides in between teeth smoothly allowing for less gum irritation.  </li>
            <li>The floss lasts beyond one use, and you can squeeze the handle a little bit to temporarily increase the tension of the floss a bit more, making it easier to get the floss between some teeth; stop squeezing and the tension relaxes back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Finally smart enough to check Amazon.  </li>
            <li>east for old ladies to use.  </li>
            <li>They are flimsy and do not work any where near as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different picks, but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not sure why Crest discontinued selling these as they actually make flossing enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>The straight across style floss picks don&#x27;t make it any easier to get to your back teeth, which are really the most difficult to deal with, because your cheeks are still in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are slightly more expensive than some other brands, but it is very well worth</li>
            <li>the variable tension really helps, you can squeeze it to make it loose and you can wrap it around the tooth well.</li>
            <li>I tried other brands with this particular design</li>
            <li>Glide has taken this messy, awkward task and made it EASY with the Y-shaped floss holder pre-strung with their unique super-thin floss TAPE, which (as their brand name suggests)</li>

            <li> I tried other brands with this particular design</li>
            <li> Glide has taken this messy, awkward task and made it EASY with the Y-shaped floss holder pre-strung with their unique super-thin floss TAPE, which (as their brand name suggests)</li>
            <li> The flat pick design did not work in that my fingers were having to hold the pick in such a way that it made my back molars inaccessible.  </li>
            <li> The Y-shape, with an ergonomic arch,  allows you to easily reach behind your wisdom teeth (if you kept them) and between molars and between all the other pearly-whites.</li>
            <li> Glide&#x27;s super thin, flat, practically unbreakable tape floss does the trick.  </li>
            <li> The design they use on these allows you to get into your back teeth without wrangling a loose bit of floss.</li>
            <li> The shape of these is different than other flossers, and this is the only one that works for me.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these for me as it is super hard to get in the back molars since I have such a small mouth and can&#x27;t open wide.</li>
            <li> So, it saves money in the long run.</li>
            <li> You pinch the thing together and the floss is as taut or loose as you like.</li>
            <li> You can squeeze an area in the middle of the pick to increase the tension or let go to have it be a little looser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Floss seems a little different</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this item was a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> When this product was not available I tried other brands which were awkward, this is easy to use between the teeth and my hygienist does not spend a long time with me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular floss string because trying to get two hands in my mouth to reach my back teeth is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The only ones in the drug store have a different configuration and are awkward to use especially in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> There were other cheaper options for the OralB picks</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and they do not compare.</li>
            <li> Love the picks - HATE the price.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when my local big box store discontinued carrying this and only carried the flat Glide pick instead.  </li>
            <li> Competing designs, C-shaped or D-shaped, which look like tiny coping saws,  are threaded with standard thick flossing string, too thick to get between those awkwardly tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> Some are a flat design that makes it difficult to reach the back.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with several tight teeth that make flossing in the back difficult.</li>
            <li> I carry a few in my purse for when I go out to eat or go to the movies (</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> These floss Picks are amazing!  Need to reach the back of your jaw so clean your teeth? All set!  Need to disrupt the bacteria in your gums to prevent tooth decay? Gotcha Covered! Have a piece of popcorn stuck? We have a pick on the end for that!&lt;br /&gt;Using the routine my Hygienist and Dentists prescribed, my gum pockets reduced all over my mouth and we have prevent more cavities and damage from my nasty little sugar habit, as well as healing up four (4) dental caries spots of concern. Mind you, this is one element of the care regiment, but it is an excellent element.</li>
            <li> Since Crest took over the production of these picks, they break far more easily. But they work well and are strong enough, if you&#x27;re lucky, to not only remove unwanted material, but also to provide all-important gum massage as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these for me as it is super hard to get in the back molars since I have such a small mouth and can&#x27;t open wide.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law loves these. He looked for them all over and couldn&#x27;t find them. He was extremely happy when i told him i would be able to get them form amazon.</li>
            <li> The floss is strong which is the most important, but my wife says some of the cheaper ones are easier to maneuver in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Why do you bother me to rate but then try to control how I rate. I find this to be annoying.</li>
            <li> Been looking for these at stores and couln&#x27;t find.  Finally smart enough to check Amazon.  Love this product. east for old ladies to use.  75 yr happy picker.</li>
            <li> On time shipping.Used to get them from Rite Aide.They stopped getting themThey were called Crest glide.Now they say Oral-B.Use them all the time.</li>
            <li> The best floss on the market simple as that , they use to carry them everywhere but I can only find them online.</li>
            <li> They land in the bottom of my purse, end up being washed.  I can never have enough of these flossers and prefer these over any of the others.  These are great just to use during the day.  To ward of gum problems flossing is a definite must!  Great product and I recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different picks, but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are the only one&#x27;s that will fit in between my teeth.  They are great.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing! I know it&#x27;s important so I do it daily, but still dread it. These floss picks make the daunting task more bearable. I&#x27;ve tried about 7-10 different types of floss picks. Some are a flat design that makes it difficult to reach the back. Some have floss that doesn&#x27;t glide between the teeth easily. With some brands the floss either frays or breaks off one end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Crest Glide Floss Picks I haven&#x27;t had any of these problems. The design is prefect. The curve of the pick makes it easy to reach anywhere in your mouth. The texture of the floss itself glides easier in and out of teeth. The floss stays in place and doesn&#x27;t stretch out. You can squeeze an area in the middle of the pick to increase the tension or let go to have it be a little looser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are slightly more expensive than some other brands, but it is very well worth the extra few pennies to have something quality that makes it easier and less frustrating to floss!</li>
            <li> These are the only things I can use because they do not shred with my close teeth!</li>
            <li> Only floss picks I will EVER use. They make me enjoy flossing... such a daunting task... but I keep them with me in my car, purse, etc</li>
            <li> Love the picks - HATE the price.: $7.52 per pack is outrageous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I have been using this for years. Really like the product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I like this particular type of floss/pick because it is sturdy and lasts a while.  I can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore in my local stores, but the ones in this order seem in every manner to be authentic and good.  I&#x27;d recommend them if this is the type you like.</li>
            <li> This floss is wonderful.  It slides in between teeth smoothly allowing for less gum irritation.  I have a small mouth (anatomically that is) so the design of this floss pick allow me to clean between the back molars.  The flat pick design did not work in that my fingers were having to hold the pick in such a way that it made my back molars inaccessible.  I tried other brands with this particular design but it was not nearly as good as the Glide floss. I was disappointed when my local big box store discontinued carrying this and only carried the flat Glide pick instead.  Luckily this seller offers this brand at a reasonable price and shipped them promptly.</li>
            <li> The Best Suff for easy Flossing • smooth slides easily between teeth&lt;br /&gt;Great for teeth in the back of your mouth</li>
            <li> Best floss picks you can buy bar none.</li>
            <li> Got them for my 80yo mother because she could not find them at the local store anymore. She cant live without them and my dad was a dentist so she still has good teeth.</li>
            <li> When this product was not available I tried other brands which were awkward, this is easy to use between the teeth and my hygienist does not spend a long time with me.  It has a pointed part where you can clean the base of the tooth instead of toothpicks.</li>
            <li> The shape of these is different than other flossers, and this is the only one that works for me.  I can&#x27;t find these in the store any more, so I buy a 6-month supply from Amazon twice a year.  I hate holding the floss in my hand - call me a baby, but I hate how it cuts into my fingers.  I feel like I have a lot of control with the Crest flossers, and it&#x27;s the only thing that gets me to floss consistently.  I try to recycle everything I can, so yeah, I don&#x27;t feel great throwing out the flosser every night, but I&#x27;m making an exception for this.</li>
            <li> Best toothpick on the planet!  Also the fork and angled to really get back there comfortable.  You can adjust the tension of the floss by squeasing the grip between thumb and fore-finger.  A well engineered product!!</li>
            <li> Since discovering these Crest Glide Floss Picks, we don&#x27;t use regular floss any more.  They are so convinent and effective!</li>
            <li> FLOSSING,  for most people,  is a miserable, yet essential personal hygiene activity, among the most onerous ever innovated by man. (I know, I know, \\&quot;only floss the teeth you want to keep.\\&quot;)  Glide has taken this messy, awkward task and made it EASY with the Y-shaped floss holder pre-strung with their unique super-thin floss TAPE, which (as their brand name suggests) glides between even the most tightly-spaced teeth. The Y-shape, with an ergonomic arch,  allows you to easily reach behind your wisdom teeth (if you kept them) and between molars and between all the other pearly-whites. Competing designs, C-shaped or D-shaped, which look like tiny coping saws,  are threaded with standard thick flossing string, too thick to get between those awkwardly tight spaces.  Glide&#x27;s super thin, flat, practically unbreakable tape floss does the trick.  I ordered these from Amazon after not finding them a Walgreens, CVS or my local grocery stores. Serving suggestion: floss while you shower, the obvious solution to offset a fairly gross daily chore.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without these!</li>
            <li> These are the only floss picks that work for me and I can never find them over recent years in any retail stores. SO happy to be able to find these here and would recommend them to anyone who has trouble with normal dental floss or other types of floss sticks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these arent&#x27; sold in drug stores anymore, Amazon is the only source I know of. The only ones in the drug store have a different configuration and are awkward to use especially in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered the floss picks from this seller, specifically because I wanted the Crest and not the OralB version of the floss picks. There were other cheaper options for the OralB picks had I wanted those. Very disappointed to see that despite what the picture leads you to believe, you actually only get the OralB version.</li>
            <li> Unlike the blue glide floss sticks, there are the best.  The floss lasts beyond one use, and you can squeeze the handle a little bit to temporarily increase the tension of the floss a bit more, making it easier to get the floss between some teeth; stop squeezing and the tension relaxes back to normal.  I&#x27;ve thrown out the blue, minty ones, and gone back to these!</li>
            <li> The BEST floss picks EVER!!!  Who ever knew being able to tighten a thread to get into tight spots could be so AMAZING?!?</li>
            <li> I started buying these online because my local stores are always sold out.  If you teeth are crowded, this floss pick will work much better for you than any others.  They cost a little more, but they are worth it if you don&#x27;t want to use a floss threader to pick shredded floss out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> These floss picks work great. They are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love these, my gums, love the !!!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with several tight teeth that make flossing in the back difficult. no other pick seems to be able to get back there consistently, comfortably and without easily breaking. the variable tension really helps, you can squeeze it to make it loose and you can wrap it around the tooth well. I only started ordering these through amazon because my local walgreens and CVS stopped carrying them. I frequently bought out their supplies so it certainly wasn&#x27;t from lack of sales.</li>
            <li> Crest no longer makes this product, it is now made by OralB. Seems to work OK but not as well as I remember when it was made by Crest. Floss seems a little different althought the handle does appear to be the same.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Glide Floss Picks.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years, and sometimes can&#x27;t find them.  They are the only picks that don&#x27;t break or shred on me, and I love that you can squeeze the handle and tighten the floss.</li>
            <li> This are the best flossers I have ever used.  The ability to pinch the sides to increase tension in the floss is fantastic.  Other floss picks break too easily or become loose and won&#x27;t fit between my teeth.  I will never use anything else again.  The only downside is that this item was a little pricey.  It was much cheaper to just purchase them at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Buy them often they are my favorite floss picks.</li>
            <li> These are just the very best. I have tried others and the floss keeps breaking, but not with these. I keep some in my purse, home and office.</li>
            <li> As the dentist says, &amp;#34;Only floss the teeth you want to keep&amp;#34;. Following this sage advice, these floss picks make the hard-to-get-to-places easily accessible and speed up the process for all teeth. If you rinse them after use they can each last a while.</li>
            <li> Best floss sticks on the market!  I can no longed find them in the stores, so must order, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Flossing can be a real pain. I was never great at keeping up with it until I found this style Glide Floss Picks. Now I floss just about every day and it isn&#x27;t a chore at all. I can&#x27;t use regular floss string because trying to get two hands in my mouth to reach my back teeth is just ridiculous. The straight across style floss picks don&#x27;t make it any easier to get to your back teeth, which are really the most difficult to deal with, because your cheeks are still in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why these floss picks are great. The design of these Glide Floss Picks are perfect because it makes reaching your back teeth very easy going straight into your mouth, and not having to come in from the side where your cheeks are in the way. Since your front teeth are easy to reach, the design is still easy to use there. Basically this design works perfectly for all your teeth. If you haven&#x27;t tried these, you should give them a shot, because it will make flossing so much easier to keep up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, these Glide Floss Picks are sold on many different Amazon listings and in various quantities, so make sure to shop around for the best price.</li>
            <li> I was instructed by my dental hygienist to get these, and boy was she right. I actually am okay with flossing now.</li>
            <li> The design they use on these allows you to get into your back teeth without wrangling a loose bit of floss. You pinch the thing together and the floss is as taut or loose as you like. Way better than any of those floss picks you&#x27;ll find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Love these flossers, never go without them.  Think they are easy for kids to use also so it helps them to floss.  Can&#x27;t find them in the store so happy I can still get through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Crest floss picks are the only ones that have a &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; I can hold onto to floss my teeth. Also being able to tighten the floss helps helps pull the floss from tight spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended. I have really liked the floss picks. I like the Glide floss also.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the fast ordering and delivery  It was exactly like shown and priced very well.  I will order again and tell my friends who like using these also and can&#x27;t find them anymore.  Thank you for your fast service</li>
            <li> I cannot find these in stores anymore and continue to order them online because I like them so much. They are gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Crest discontinued selling these as they actually make flossing enjoyable.  I am very happy that someone still has some available</li>
            <li> I love the Crest Glide Picks. I have tried other brands and they do not compare. I carry a few in my purse for when I go out to eat or go to the movies (great for getting out popcorn between teeth!). When caught without floss or a toothbrush, these are the perfect solution. Don&#x27;t bother with the cheaper brands. They are flimsy and do not work any where near as well.</li>
            <li> not flimsy. Very strong string! Great for kids, especially, who can&#x27;t handle floss. The cheaper kid version of these floss picks totally suck. The cheaper version of these for adults suck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT for teeth which are very tight/close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse the string in between teeth. We use the same one for a week or 2 at a time if we rinse the pick after any goo is on it. So, it saves money in the long run.</li>
