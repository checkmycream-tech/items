            <li>I can&#x27;t say more good things about this!</li>
            <li>Very good economical buy for me!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice tingly feeling which I also like.</li>
            <li>Great for dry &amp; itchy scalp, the tingle is awesome!</li>
            <li>Smell is kind of strong going on but after rinsing I think it leaves a clean, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks, leaves my hair smooth and feeling healthy!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li>and I think the bottles are more slender now (</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got both products.</li>
            <li>Oh one more thing, please don&#x27;t let it get into your eyes :)</li>
            <li>I love avlon products</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time in the Salon I just love it works Great on controlling scalp and skin dermatitis such as psoriasis and others!</li>
            <li>Since my first usage of these products, my scalp has began to experience great relief from an overly sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my scalp feeling cool (literally), clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo and conditioner, I can go a full 2 weeks without washing my hair without the fear of looking like I have snow on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me is these products are not drying and can be used weekly even though I also use Soft and Beautiful to relax my hair every other month.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a tingling cool feeling in my scalp and smells great (no chemical smell like other brands).</li>
            <li>Great scalp itch relief due to chemicals, dryness or product build up.</li>
            <li>but nothing works as good as this duo getting rid of the dry scalp and the flakiness.  </li>
            <li>but when I applied the conditioner next, my scalp was on fire (in a good way) the tingling intensified and after the final rinse, my scalp felt cool and clean and the itching was all gone.</li>
            <li>but it leaves their hair soft and light.</li>
            <li>But why is the conditioner bottle as large as the shampoo bottle?  </li>
            <li>and it would damage it to much to wash it that much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and so I needed a solution fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and now my hair is growing like a weed.</li>
            <li>I am often sceptical of miracle cures but this really is one.  </li>
            <li>I use it about once a week now and my hair still is itch free and is not so dry.</li>
            <li>It last me quite a while so the price is well worthy it.</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and spent the money on the huge bottles.</li>
            <li>With some, I would be itching two days later and most made my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is powerful enough to clear your sinuses, however, and you don&#x27;t want to get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive, but it&#x27;s better to pay for something that works, than to keep wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work - no matter how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>(same tingle sensation I love and same peppermint like fragrance) but bigger</li>
            <li>My hair always feels soft after using this, and also gets detangled.</li>
            <li>Like the results so far.</li>
            <li>With regular shampoo and conditioner my scalp would CONSTANTLY itch, even right after I washed it.  </li>
            <li>I was using Neutrogena T-Gel for about 6+ months with no results, then got tired of it and tried Avlon due to the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Completely got rid of my intense scalp itch and dry flakes.</li>
            <li>Do your first shampoo with the dry and itchy scalp, second with the hydrating then put on the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I generally use it in between using my WEN products.</li>
            <li>Product came fast, even before the expected delivery time frame.</li>
            <li>my head is back to normal and i only need to use it 3 times a week now to keep it up</li>
            <li>As long as I use it consistently (at least once a week my scalp stays clear and itch free.</li>
            <li>and I have tried 3 other products that did not do as much to stop the itch.</li>
            <li>I have long and natural 4c hair and this conditioner works wonders during detangling.</li>

            <li> It takes a few shampoos to clear up clacking and itching any time I go longer than two weeks without using...</li>
            <li> It works wonders for dry itchy scalp, dandruff, and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Keracare is a life saver for dry, itchy, scaly scalps.</li>
            <li> but I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo I got this tingling feeling that soothed my dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> It have a really dry itchy scalp and living in Denver does not help.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this when we feel like our scalp is dry and is itching a lot.  </li>
            <li> This helps with the itch and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> After 12 years of looking for a solution for my families extremely dry scalps we discovered this.</li>
            <li> I used this before but stopped for sometime to see if other cheaper dry scalp products would work, and they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I would recommend pairing it with the Keracare Hydrating shampoo because your hair does tend to get a little dry after while and may loose some of its luster.</li>
            <li> It actually made my dry scalp worse.</li>
            <li> AND THE ITCHING WENT DOWN .</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad dry scalp/flakes</li>
            <li> My scalp was a mess</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for my thick hair but dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This time around I had been using something else for a few months</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy mess in hair- hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> It has made a dramatic change, soothing their extremely dry and itchy scalps in ways nothing else has even come close to.</li>
            <li> What a waste of 50 bucks!</li>
            <li> and I was afraid of wearing anything dark because there will be flakes all over my dark shirts.</li>
            <li> There is no good alternative.</li>
            <li> It makes it worse and made my hair break.</li>
            <li> AND I WAS SOOOO BAD</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!</li>

            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner, once a week, for over 5 years.  The most important thing to me is these products are not drying and can be used weekly even though I also use Soft and Beautiful to relax my hair every other month.  Plus, the salon size (32 oz) works great for our family, since my husband began using it too!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner there is !!</li>
            <li> I tried everything and alternatives....but nothing works as good as this duo getting rid of the dry scalp and the flakiness.  This time around I had been using something else for a few months so it took 3-4 washes, on separate occasions, to get ride off the flakiness.  It last me quite a while so the price is well worthy it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product to me in 2001&#x27; and I&#x27;ve never used another shampoo not conditioner.  It works wonders for dry itchy scalp, dandruff, and psoriasis. I was very happy when I found it on amazon for this price. Each bottle cost $36.99 in the beauty supply stores. Thanks Amazon for quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner weekly on my relaxed hair for 2 years. It is the only thing that manages my itchy scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> Living in the desert of Arizona  Keracare is a life saver for dry, itchy, scaly scalps.</li>
            <li> Packaged arrived promptly but the lid was undone and the contents of the shampoo was spilled inside the box.</li>
            <li> Thought this might soothe allergy itching, and it did. The smell is powerful enough to clear your sinuses, however, and you don&#x27;t want to get it in your eyes. Should have bought a smaller size as it&#x27;s not for every-day use.</li>
            <li> Completely got rid of my intense scalp itch and dry flakes. With regular shampoo and conditioner my scalp would CONSTANTLY itch, even right after I washed it.  This product leaves my scalp feeling cool (literally), clean and refreshed. Smell is kind of strong going on but after rinsing I think it leaves a clean, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great scalp itch relief due to chemicals, dryness or product build up.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dandruff, and my doc actually recommended this! Works great and stops the itch, after 2weeks of using it my head is back to normal and i only need to use it 3 times a week now to keep it up</li>
            <li> Product came fast, even before the expected delivery time frame. I was very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s the same product I&#x27;m used to getting at the beauty stores (same tingle sensation I love and same peppermint like fragrance) but bigger and I think the bottles are more slender now (but still 32oz). I used this before but stopped for sometime to see if other cheaper dry scalp products would work, and they didn&#x27;t. With some, I would be itching two days later and most made my hair feel dry. My hair always feels soft after using this, and also gets detangled. I will continue buying this from this store.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews but it did not stop itchy scalp. I finally found a copper brush and Stoppit on amazon and my scalp finally stopped flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> Great for dry &amp; itchy scalp, the tingle is awesome! This combo pack leaves your scalp feeling revitalized. I would recommend this combo to anyone!</li>
            <li> Since my first usage of these products, my scalp has began to experience great relief from an overly sensitive and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> hello yes i like it and yes it&#x27;s works</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for multiracial people with flaky hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time in the Salon I just love it works Great on controlling scalp and skin dermatitis such as psoriasis and others!</li>
            <li> BEST EVER TOOK ALL MY FLAKES AWAY AND I WAS SOOOO BAD I WOULD MOVE MY HEAD AND IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IT SNOWED ALL OVER MY SHIRT, THEN I TRIED THIS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS, MIRACLE WORKER NO FLAKES AT ALL AND THE ITCHING WENT DOWN .</li>
            <li> wished it would last longer to stop the itch, would have to wash my hair every day but I have really dry hair and it would damage it to much to wash it that much.  But it is the best product that I have used so fare and I have tried 3 other products that did not do as much to stop the itch.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.  But why is the conditioner bottle as large as the shampoo bottle?  I always use up the shampoo before the conditioner runs out.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo I got this tingling feeling that soothed my dry itchy scalp but when I applied the conditioner next, my scalp was on fire (in a good way) the tingling intensified and after the final rinse, my scalp felt cool and clean and the itching was all gone. I&#x27;m glad I got both products. Oh one more thing, please don&#x27;t let it get into your eyes :)</li>
            <li> bought for my husband...he loves and always has it stocked</li>
            <li> I love avlon products</li>
            <li> This shampoo/combo set is pricey but it works. When I use it, I have no scalp dryness. It has a nice tingly feeling which I also like. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair and scalp feels great always.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I had pretty bad dry scalp/flakes and I was afraid of wearing anything dark because there will be flakes all over my dark shirts. I was using Neutrogena T-Gel for about 6+ months with no results, then got tired of it and tried Avlon due to the great reviews. I can&#x27;t say more good things about this! It leaves a tingling cool feeling in my scalp and smells great (no chemical smell like other brands). I saw results in just one use. I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks, leaves my hair smooth and feeling healthy!</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for my thick hair but dry scalp. Makes a total difference in my hair that you can see instantly. I would recommend pairing it with the Keracare Hydrating shampoo because your hair does tend to get a little dry after while and may loose some of its luster. Do your first shampoo with the dry and itchy scalp, second with the hydrating then put on the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Used this product twice.  Like the results so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  My stylist uses the same,  so I went and got some.  It&#x27;s a great scalp treatment!</li>
            <li> Love this!  My scalp was a mess and I had to wash my hair often to try to keep the flakes away.  With this shampoo and conditioner, I can go a full 2 weeks without washing my hair without the fear of looking like I have snow on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product till it stops working!  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive, but it&#x27;s better to pay for something that works, than to keep wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work - no matter how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis of the scalp and this is the only product that has cleared my scalp and controlled the itching. As long as I use it consistently (at least once a week my scalp stays clear and itch free. It takes a few shampoos to clear up clacking and itching any time I go longer than two weeks without using...</li>
            <li> It is a very excellent product.i have advise my friends to purchase it also. One of my friends told me</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It have a really dry itchy scalp and living in Denver does not help. It makes it worse and made my hair break. I am growing my hair out and so I needed a solution fast. My friends mom suggested this product to me and let me try it. It worked well so I went ahead and spent the money on the huge bottles. I use it about once a week now and my hair still is itch free and is not so dry. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a dry scalp issue. This stuff really works and now my hair is growing like a weed. Very happy with my results.</li>

            <li> After 12 years of looking for a solution for my families extremely dry scalps we discovered this. It has made a dramatic change, soothing their extremely dry and itchy scalps in ways nothing else has even come close to. I am often sceptical of miracle cures but this really is one.  It not only cured their dry scalps in a week but it leaves their hair soft and light. We&#x27;ve talked about stalking up on this just in case they ever discontinue it. There is no good alternative. This is the best.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have long and natural 4c hair and this conditioner works wonders during detangling.</li>
            <li> Very good economical buy for me!</li>
