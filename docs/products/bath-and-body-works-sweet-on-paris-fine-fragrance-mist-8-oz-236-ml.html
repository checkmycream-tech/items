            <li>Im glad</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>

            <li>Thanks Donna!!!</li>
            <li>At first it reminds me of cotton candy (delicious and minus the calories!)</li>
            <li>This has light sweet scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much though ;D</li>
            <li>Best smelling perfume I have ever smelled and had the joy of owning too bad</li>
            <li>Save some money this is $14usd at bath and body works at full price.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t find a smell as sweet as this one.</li>
            <li>i ordered sweet on paris...</li>
            <li>its a sweet but not over powering scent.</li>
            <li>It smells like oh so sweet.</li>
            <li>I found this to be sweet smelling but not as sweet as a cotton candy body spray.</li>
            <li>I deem this appropriate for all ages its not too sweet for as an older woman (depending her taste sweet vs. flowery or musks) and also appropriate for tweens, teens and older.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this fragrance from a nurse at a doctor&#x27;s office [the light, sweet scent permeated the reception area].  </li>
            <li>it smells amazing O.O</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, good or bad, but I was sooooo impressed when I got my order in the mail.</li>
            <li>Love the light smell &amp; really hope they bring it back.</li>
            <li>, i think this is my new signature scent!!!</li>
            <li>After some searching I got exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>more for younger people.</li>
            <li>The lotion is what I bought first</li>
            <li>Was so sad when they discontinued it, but so happy when i found it online!!!</li>
            <li>SMELL EXACTLY LIKE THE BODY LOTION.......</li>
            <li>the first thing the guy said to me was, &amp;#34;You smell really</li>
            <li>very cotton candy-like.</li>
            <li>I LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Now I have two full bottles of the perfume, so that should last me the rest of forever, haha.</li>
            <li>oh well at least it smells nice.</li>
            <li>its a cotton candy sweet smell, but yet a light femine marshmallowy subtle mimosa like smell.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase from Amazon and my first from the Splurge Shop</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this fragrance, its hard to find a scent that&#x27;s going to work on me and this one does</li>
            <li>I first found this item at Bath and Body Works a year or so ago but it was only sold for a limited time and discontinued.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favourite BBW scents. I was so sad when they stopped selling them in the store. Now I have two full bottles of the perfume, so that should last me the rest of forever, haha.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere but I can&#x27;t find a smell as sweet as this one. Like living in a cotton candy dream.</li>

The packaging was superb, everything was well made and just awesome!!! Definetly a re-purchase!!!! it  smells like cotton candy too!</li>

            <li> I had my roommate spray this once on me before a date and the first thing the guy said to me was, &amp;#34;You smell really good.&amp;#34; Every time I wear it I always get compliments from guys saying I smell like cotton candy, sugar cookies or just plain sugar.</li>
            <li> very cotton candy-like. more for younger people. It&#x27;s very nice and sweet. I like it alot and im glad i bought it</li>
            <li> When bath &amp; body works gets a fragrance that even men enjoy smelling on you, it is a shame that they discontinued it. Love the light smell &amp; really hope they bring it back. The lotion is what I bought first so I thought I would give this a try.</li>

            <li> I THINK THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING THING ON THIS PLANET! ITS VERY CHEAP FOR 8 OZ AND IT LOOKS NICE. I WANT IT REALLY BADLY , BECAUSE MY FRIEND HAS IT AND I ALWAYS SPRAY IT WHEN I GO TO HER HOUSE! I TOTALLY 100% RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> This body spray&#x27;s scent is so wonderful and soft that I absolutely love it.  It stays on you all day and I will always recommend this product.  You will not regret this!!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that this is a discontinued scent and I looked everwhere for it because I had gottten two of the lotions.  Found it and got it shipped.  Everything was good!!  Remeber though, if you are ordering items in the winter and they could freeze.....bear that in mind.  These didn&#x27;t but I had something unrelated that did.....lol.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite scent at bath and body works but unfortunately they discontinued it. i hope they bring it back again. its a sweet but not over powering scent. it reminds me of cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I could bathe in it enough said yummy! Going to wear it when I  go up to visit my boyfriend whose in basic training for the Canadian forces!</li>
            <li> I first heard of this fragrance from a nurse at a doctor&#x27;s office [the light, sweet scent permeated the reception area].  When I told her how great the fragrance was, she told me she loved it but that it was discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works.  She suggested I check with Amazon.com ... I was able to get it, and have had many compliments.  It&#x27;s a very light, &#x27;sweet&#x27; fragrance ... which I think would be best during the warmer, summer months, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance makes me feel as though I had just been violated by a gang of unicorns, and was left in the gutter covered in their ejaculate.  This stuff really smells that good!</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume I have ever smelled and had the joy of owning too bad it&#x27;s way over priced now</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law and she was very happy with the Fragrance.  It is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, good or bad, but I was sooooo impressed when I got my order in the mail. Very cute packaging. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Im glad I found it.  This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite body spray and Bath &amp; Body Works is not selling it anymore.</li>
            <li> She loves the smell of this and I find it rather a good smell as well. When Bath &amp; Body works stopped selling it, she was sad. So I searched for some and found this. Excellent price and quick service.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! Was so sad when they discontinued it, but so happy when i found it online!!!(:</li>
            <li> One of the most delicious and intoxicating scents I have ever worn. It is like chocolate doughnuts and raspberry! Who doesn&#x27;t love that!?</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO SWEET AND LIGHT, LOVE IT AND WILL REORDER WHEN COMING CLOSE TO RUNNING OUT.  SAVES ME THE TRIP TO THE MALL.</li>
            <li> It had sort of an alcohol after sent but you could still smell the candy like sent. I liked it very much though ;D</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I&#x27;m a sucker for cotton candy smells. This is definitely a good thing to buy.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase from Amazon and my first from the Splurge Shop and I&#x27;m so pleased! I&#x27;ve never smelled this fragrance before but the reviews made me want to try it. It came in a timely manner and oh  my gosh the smell! It&#x27;s beautiful! I&#x27;m so sad that Bath and Body Works retired this scent as it&#x27;s seriously addicting! It smells like oh so sweet. At first it reminds me of cotton candy (delicious and minus the calories!) but then other scents such as vanilla and I think a hint of berry come out, yet the cotton candy is always there. I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and I just got this one today, that&#x27;s how amazing it is! If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying it, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s worth every penny and it&#x27;s also quite a deal as even with shipping it&#x27;s still way less than what Bath &amp; Body Works sold it for! Love!</li>
            <li> I purchased this originally at bath and body works, and I love it! It smells like candy! You will love it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this today and I am taken aback to being like 17! Im 27 its a cotton candy sweet smell, but yet a light femine marshmallowy subtle mimosa like smell. I deem this appropriate for all ages its not too sweet for as an older woman (depending her taste sweet vs. flowery or musks) and also appropriate for tweens, teens and older. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I recieved all the products in time, and like i was thinking. All the products are very good quality. I LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li> SMELL EXACTLY LIKE THE BODY LOTION.......IT IS ORIGINAL, BEST SMELL EVER.....DONT LAST LONG. PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION</li>
            <li> This scent is also weak, not what I was expecting but it&#x27;s still nice.. I would buy it again. love</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SMELL OF COTTONCANDY BUT HEARD A LOT OF REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE REGARDING THIS ONE AND HONESTLY ITS MORE FOR LIKE ANYONE UNDER 10 CAN USE THIS BUT FOR ME I WONT BE WEARING THIS I PURCHASED TWO AND GAVE THEM TO MY DAUGHTERS WHICH THEY LOVE IT SO 3 STARS FROM ME, AND 5 STARS FROM MY DAUGHTERS.</li>
            <li> The product was not new as advertised</li>
            <li> So I popped by Bath and Body Works and just had to try this out. I like the bottle. I found this to be sweet smelling but not as sweet as a cotton candy body spray. This has light sweet scent that is not overpowering. I give this four stars for the scent and five for the look of the product.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing O.O i fell in love with it!! it&#x27;s like a liquid version of a cupcakes and i just can&#x27;t have enough</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Like cotton candy vanilla and marshmallows. Very sweet, but not childish/fruity sweet. Been complimented on it many times since wearing it.</li>
