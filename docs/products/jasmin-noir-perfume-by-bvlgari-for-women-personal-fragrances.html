            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> So very sexy it almost verges on vulgar, and I like that.</li>
            <li> Was not the same as I have gotten in the past</li>
            <li> I had purchased this from virtually any other retailer on the planet, I could return it, but not Amazon.</li>

            <li> 2nd time it&#x27;s a fake, smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This is huge because some people hate patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of $$</li>
            <li> Seems a little stale, meaning strength is not the same as tester at dept store.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re selling a fake perfume it only lowers your credibility in my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal amazon customer, and I am really disappointed to discover that this perfume is completely fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a problem because perfume names are very confusing.</li>
            <li> Now i return to Viet Nam and feel sad because Amazon do not ship goods to Viet Nam.</li>
            <li> and it was fake.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed that it does not stay long.</li>
            <li> It was fake!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I received this</li>
            <li> If you had the EDP and order the EDT by mistake you will be very disappointed, and vice versa.</li>

            <li> My wife loves it and wears it all the time, she has had many compliments when she wears this spray.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume for the first time. But at that time I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s name. Watching for a year, finally I&#x27;ve got it. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. The price on Amazon is very pleased me. I save 100$ for this item when I bought it on Amazon.  I love Amazon very much. Now i return to Viet Nam and feel sad because Amazon do not ship goods to Viet Nam. I hope that Amazon will change policy to Vietnam market.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when I use this cologne.  My daughter liked it so much that I bought a bottle for her birthday.</li>
            <li> A friend asked me to order this, they love the fragrance. it was a great buy.  They are happy. Its the real thing.</li>
            <li> genuine, new, as described, fast shipping, recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worse product I have ever bought from amazon, it&#x27;s obviously not the genuine product. The smell is week and after couple minutes no one will smell nothing.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal amazon customer, and I am really disappointed to discover that this perfume is completely fake. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the real thing. The cap is not the same. I demand a refund or a correction of this order. If you&#x27;re selling a fake perfume it only lowers your credibility in my eyes. Please correct the matter. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance! I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  Next day in fact. Jasmine Noir smells very much like Opium before they changed the scent. A lot of sandlewood.  Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this from dept stres for years and love it.  I was so disappointed when I received this and it was fake. It smells like a bottle of rubbing alcohol instead of jasmine.</li>
            <li> It was fake! They diluted the product with alcohol. I was so embarrassed when I gave it to my sister for Christmas. Never again! I couldn&#x27;t even return it becaus it was considered a flammable product so I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> It ok!! Not a fan of this sent on me</li>
            <li> 1st time buying was perfect!!! 2nd time it&#x27;s a fake, smell doesn&#x27;t last. Waste of $$</li>
            <li> The sample that I had was much better , the smell of this perfume is no where close to this bottle. I waisted $55.00.</li>
            <li> This perfume scent is good, was not disappointing, just as expected. but it doesn&#x27;t last long as other great perfume.</li>
            <li> Seems a little stale, meaning strength is not the same as tester at dept store. I use a bit more than normal. Scent is correct.</li>
            <li> The aroma of jasmin gives this perfume an exquisite scent. It is refreshing and at the same time exciting. Good packaging, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this scent but I was very disappointed that it does not stay long. I am not totally unhappy since I got a great deal through Amazon</li>
            <li> Le gusto a mi esposa, tiene muy buen aroma. llego a tiempo y sin ning&amp;uacute;n problema el empaque sin ning&amp;uacute;n problema</li>
            <li> My wife smells beautiful wearing it / Just use it sparingly :  Nice Container  and nice fragrance :  Right on !</li>
            <li> Was not the same as I have gotten in the past</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price and the speedy delivery</li>
            <li> dreamy, intoxicating , I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife truly love this. I will continue to purchase from your site for myself and for gifts for my entire family.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Wednesday receive the product on Friday couldn&#x27;t ask for more what a great company</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  Always get compliments when I where it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product, but be warned that this is non-returnable if ordered through Amazon fulfillment. It&#x27;s easy to miss those notices when you have one-click turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a problem because perfume names are very confusing. The EDT is a completely different scent from the EDP. If you had the EDP and order the EDT by mistake you will be very disappointed, and vice versa. The biggest difference is that the EDP is a patchouli scent and the EDT is not. This is huge because some people hate patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had purchased this from virtually any other retailer on the planet, I could return it, but not Amazon. It&#x27;s my fault, but I need to rethink the wisdom of using one-click.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong, in a good way. So very sexy it almost verges on vulgar, and I like that. The name is very apt, it&#x27;s all night blooming jasmine. I could see men responding very favorably to this stuff, but this is not a first date fragrance or even for someone you are casually seeing. This is something for a romantic evening when you&#x27;re re-igniting the spark. The almond and licorice are detectable but mainly they just boost the jasmine.</li>
            <li> Very light  - smells yummy</li>
            <li> sophisticated, evening, elegance. Jasmine entoxicats me. the woodsy base holds a great aroma that lasts and sheds sweet exotic smells of mandarin, sandle wood, and of course jasmine. a bit musky mystery. but it lasts forrrever so just a spritsz here and there is all you need allll day</li>
