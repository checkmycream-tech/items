            <li>The best part was it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric razor for in-between shaves for 15 years and this one is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>However, it is wonderful for legs.  </li>
            <li>It just takes time and practice to get the best results I think.  </li>
            <li>The best reviews have shaving habits, so here are mine.</li>
            <li>I picked this one because it seemed to be the best shaver for my money, based on reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been wonderful!</li>
            <li>and this is great for going over my shins.</li>
            <li>I bought this model 2 years ago, and I was happy with it.</li>
            <li>Buy it, read the instructions, try it, treat it well, and it&#x27;ll give you great results, and maybe even make you look forward to shaving.</li>
            <li>I get a very smooth shave &amp; the best part-\\&quot;no</li>
            <li>I:ve had good luck with&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It worked great even after being dropped many times on our tile floors.</li>
            <li>Many people just dive into using this razor without reading the instruction manual--stupid move!</li>
            <li>Be patient-It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>This razor is by far the greatest razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>, i never cut myself, most non electric shavers cut and leave scars.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.....</li>
            <li>Out of the shower it did OK.  </li>
            <li>the legs aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth and it takes longer!  </li>
            <li>It took me about a week, and my legs are SO smooth!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>If you want a close, smooth, comfortable, shave without any nicks BUY THIS!</li>
            <li>However,  I had no problem getting a good, smooth shave the first time, without any irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Remington is easy to take care of and maintain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never been so easy to shave.</li>
            <li>have had it for quite awhile, its easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>(a razor always sliced me no matter how lightly i used it)Great for bikini and underarms, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It feels more powerful than the others.</li>
            <li>It has a nice concept, but I found it did not shave very well.  </li>
            <li>It was no longer available</li>
            <li>and I find the unit easy to disassemble and to clean.</li>
            <li>A reasonable effective product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it has just shaved right on good as new!  </li>
            <li>The item I received did not do a good job and pulled as if the blades were not sharp.  </li>
            <li>It takes awhile for your skin to get used to, but once it does it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Whatever the givers paid for it, it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Another feature I liked was that the foil heads on the unit move independently of one another--giving you a better chance getting at those odd-shaped places like the knee and ankle areas.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I have ever used, on my first try it was smooth slick and easy to handle and glide.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job: close enough without being TOO close.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m delighted with my shaver</li>
            <li>This is worth it for me, and I find the fact that I can do a quick dry shave with no irritation very handy, too.</li>
            <li>I gave it a quick trial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various models of Remington electric razors for many years, and I was pleased when I saw this model.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I am still as amazed with it&#x27;s performance as I was the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new shaver.</li>
            <li>This is my third electric razor and I liked it immediately.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t cut my legs in weeks, as I used to do with my old manual razor--that one that many women have, y&#x27;know, named after a goddess,</li>
            <li>It is easy and quick and is good for those hard to get areas.</li>
            <li>I would say that if you want the closest shave possible, stick with a razor, but if you are willing to settle for the next best thing (electric), this shaver does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it both wet and dry, and it&#x27;s very effective both ways, but it&#x27;s more effective wet with a bit of shave gel.</li>
            <li>I tried several more times and it finally came on but it acted as if it needed more chargins.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t the razor that i thought that i had purchased at first.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on parts of the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth and soft to the touch AND feel SHAVED when the sheets of my bed touch them.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully before using this product, and found that using it with warm water and shaving gel was optimal.</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would find an electric razor that shaved my legs so close that they felt as smooth and soft as with a straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s probably every bit as good as the more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and using an electric razor has really been my only means of getting a rash free, clean, close</li>
            <li>I bought this and was loving it, but it broke when I had it less than a month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a new kit for it now, but I may not need to install it for several more months.  </li>
            <li>and this works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut very close</li>
            <li>When I saw the Remington WDF-5000 Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Plus Body Contour Shaver this was THE last resort.  </li>
            <li>Fast re-charge.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>In the shower, it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to start shaving, like all of my friends.</li>
            <li>I much prefer not having to take a shower and shave.</li>
            <li>Its much easier to shave in my  room, wearing a bra.</li>
            <li>There are three levels for shaving, depending on the length of hair- which is a very accommodating feature to have.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that I didn&#x27;t charge the shaver for a full 24 hours (only 12) before my first use, and the battery died right as I was finishing my first shave.</li>
            <li>What makes this one unique is that it has three settings for different length of hair growth.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as clean of a shave as with a razor but your legs will pass the visual inspection every time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews here and luckily have not experienced any kind of problem with the razor or my skin.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time...and leaves your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Other than being short lived, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was mild irritation, but that was only because it was my first time, and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>that it wasn&#x27;t brand new.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price, I was expecting brand new.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it, though it is running slower that when it was new.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a new one on ebay.</li>
            <li>I will get a new one and see how that one does.</li>
            <li>Remington customer and have always been very satisfied with their products, having purchased multiple Remington Women&#x27;s Razors over the course of the past 10 + years.  </li>
            <li>It was very loud compared to her&lt;BR&gt;old razor &amp; didn,t even seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold unlike the previous \\&quot;boxy\\&quot; one I used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do have uneven skin highly prone to nicks and cuts, and suffer from a great deal of post-shaving itching that lotion and moisturizers only slightly alleviate.</li>
            <li>$9.99 (so far)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 years</li>
            <li>My old one was just about gone, so I bought this and precharged it for the recommended 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>My mother bought this for me to replace my 10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Well-I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I might consider other Remington products in the future, but most definitely NOT this razor.</li>
            <li>I have an older shaver bearing the same model number which I have used for years to clear the hair on my face, chin and throat.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it especially for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The razor is a bit louder than my previous electric razor, but this unit has more options than what I had been using such as three settings for short (stubble), short &amp;amp; long (2 or more days since shaving last), and long hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions carefully, fully aware that it might take 2-3 weeks for my skin to adjust.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I had an awesome, almost painless shave (only a small stinging behind my knees, and that was only the first time), no nicks or cuts, no razor burn, and no itching at all (I DID apply lotion, as usual, after my shave).</li>
            <li>Unlike my previous razor, it made my legs feel smooth as if I shaved in the shower with a regular razor only without the itch and rash afterwards.</li>
            <li>She says it is OK and is a tough grader.</li>
            <li>Each stroke then becomes uncomfortable and I&#x27;m left with a very patchy result (anything BUT smooth or silky!).  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I am a 13 year old girl, and it is such a hassel to shave.</li>
            <li>From day one, this razor has never provided me with the close, clean shave I&#x27;ve become accustomed to with prior Remington products, and as the battery has significantly diminished, it has essentially rendered the product completely useless.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the battery even slowing down since that first shave.</li>
            <li>The shave didn&#x27;t last very long, and in some areas it really hurt.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a bad razor, but I must say that I&#x27;m unimpressed, especially after being so happy with earlier Remington shavers.</li>
            <li>The battery life has been marginal from the day I took it out of the box, just barely sufficient enough to finish both legs.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this shaver a few years ago.</li>
            <li>This model is exactly like my old one that I&#x27;ve had for at least 15 -20 years</li>
            <li>I liked this razor very much, but the day the battery wore out and could no longer hold a charge, the entire razor was worthless.  </li>

            <li> My mother bought this for me to replace my 10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Well-I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I might consider other Remington products in the future, but most definitely NOT this razor.</li>
            <li> I have an older shaver bearing the same model number which I have used for years to clear the hair on my face, chin and throat.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it especially for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit louder than my previous electric razor, but this unit has more options than what I had been using such as three settings for short (stubble), short &amp;amp; long (2 or more days since shaving last), and long hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions carefully, fully aware that it might take 2-3 weeks for my skin to adjust.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had an awesome, almost painless shave (only a small stinging behind my knees, and that was only the first time), no nicks or cuts, no razor burn, and no itching at all (I DID apply lotion, as usual, after my shave).</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous razor, it made my legs feel smooth as if I shaved in the shower with a regular razor only without the itch and rash afterwards.</li>
            <li> She says it is OK and is a tough grader.</li>
            <li> Each stroke then becomes uncomfortable and I&#x27;m left with a very patchy result (anything BUT smooth or silky!).  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I am a 13 year old girl, and it is such a hassel to shave.</li>
            <li> From day one, this razor has never provided me with the close, clean shave I&#x27;ve become accustomed to with prior Remington products, and as the battery has significantly diminished, it has essentially rendered the product completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the battery even slowing down since that first shave.</li>
            <li> The shave didn&#x27;t last very long, and in some areas it really hurt.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad razor, but I must say that I&#x27;m unimpressed, especially after being so happy with earlier Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> The battery life has been marginal from the day I took it out of the box, just barely sufficient enough to finish both legs.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this shaver a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This model is exactly like my old one that I&#x27;ve had for at least 15 -20 years</li>
            <li> I liked this razor very much, but the day the battery wore out and could no longer hold a charge, the entire razor was worthless.  </li>
            <li> In the last few months (it&#x27;s only 4 months old!)</li>
            <li> Until that fateful day my 2 year old threw it down and it broke.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t lose...and you&#x27;ll save money in the long run with this little baby!</li>
            <li> The charge does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I only used it dry, because if I wanted to shave in the tub, I&#x27;d just use a razor.</li>
            <li> but once you use it a few times, WOW!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it: you can&#x27;t rake an electric shaver over your skin and expect it to do the same job as a plain old razor.</li>
            <li> It takes a little gettibg used to in sensitive areas (under arms and bikini)</li>
            <li> The only thing I can recommend:  Be CAREFUL if you use this on your underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;takes a long time\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and he confirmed that once the battery dies, your whole razor is worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the Remington WDF-5000 Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Plus Body Contour Shaver has been a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I also always have to go over my skin two or three times to get a clean shave, so those complaints were irrelevant to me as well.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was how long it took to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I did find it a bit rough and will not be trying that again.  </li>
            <li> I put it back on the base to charge some more.</li>
            <li> No electric razor I&#x27;ve tried gives the same close shave as using a blade razor (hence 4/5 stars), but I&#x27;ll take slightly less closeness over the irritation and razor rash from a blade shave any time!</li>
            <li> Sadly, my friend bought the same razor as myself at the same time at my suggestion (based on my prior satisfaction with other products) and she, too, has been unable to ever obtain a close, clean shave with this product.  </li>
            <li> The problem was, once I used it, it cut less than half the hair, even after going over the same area of skin repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> She asked me to buy it for her while I was getting other stuff from amazon.</li>
            <li> When I first thought I would use an electric shaver I thought it w0uld be complicated.  </li>
            <li> I tried two other razors, both of wich did not compare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several razors over the past 18 years...  </li>
            <li> A little loud, but better than my screams from cutting myself!!</li>
            <li> But I went to use it the other day and even though it had been charging for a couple of days, it just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This shaver was hard to get used to, and it took a while to get my skin used to it, since it tends to be very sensitive, but eventually I got the hang of it, and finally - no more CUTS!</li>
            <li> Also the blade in it seems to get dull fast, as the shaving got worse, not better.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you are thinking about purchasing this one or using it esp around delicate areas like under arms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> I got a close shave by pressing down a little hard and got myself a cut a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for that drop of blood to be shed, but this little wonder doesn&#x27;t seem to want to hurt me!</li>
            <li> Despite being fully charged, the battery regularly lasts a mere 90 seconds to 2 minutes before losing steam.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it takes at least a few hours to charge it fully</li>
            <li> I have owned electric women&#x27;s shavers in the past and have never had one cut me when I used it.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to waxing since it is overall less painful for me.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on the underarm area and produces terrible, painful cuts in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and this razor gave me razor burn and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I have thin legs</li>
            <li> Scary thought, eh?</li>
            <li> complaints were irrelevant to me.</li>
            <li> As everyone else is I&#x27;m sure,I was skeptical about a close shave,etc.</li>
            <li> But then again, electric shavers typically don&#x27;t leave you with painful nicks and razor burn!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to shave the underarms and bikini area with this.</li>
            <li> This electric razor was one of the worst things I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have always used a blade razor, and often ended up with cuts, nicks, and some even nasty gouges!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know until I saw the package saying this was factory reconditioned that it wasn&#x27;t brand new.  Considering the price, I was expecting brand new.  I gave it a quick trial and it seems to work okay.  I haven&#x27;t yet put it in the charger or used it.</li>
            <li> She asked me to buy it for her while I was getting other stuff from amazon. She says it is OK and is a tough grader.</li>
            <li> I received the purchase and charged it for 24 hours. When I pushed the button to turn it on it didn&#x27;t go on! I tried several more times and it finally came on but it acted as if it needed more chargins. I put it back on the base to charge some more. Two days later I tried it again and It never would come on. I will return it! This model is exactly like my old one that I&#x27;ve had for at least 15 -20 years and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it, though it is running slower that when it was new.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor very much, but the day the battery wore out and could no longer hold a charge, the entire razor was worthless.  I called a Remington tech support guy and he confirmed that once the battery dies, your whole razor is worthless.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used, on my first try it was smooth slick and easy to handle and glide.  The only problem I had was mild irritation, but that was only because it was my first time, and my skin is sensitive.  Remington is easy to take care of and maintain.  When I first thought I would use an electric shaver I thought it w0uld be complicated.  I read the instructions and it was simple.&lt;BR&gt;The best part was it didn&#x27;t hurt, i never cut myself, most non electric shavers cut and leave scars.  This one did none of that.</li>
            <li> arrived on time.  haven&#x27;t used it yet -- was a gift.  wasn&#x27;t the razor that i thought that i had purchased at first.</li>
            <li> I love this razor... have had it for quite awhile, its easy to use, easy to clean and I would recommend this to any women out there that like to use an electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric razor and I liked it immediately. Unlike my previous razor, it made my legs feel smooth as if I shaved in the shower with a regular razor only without the itch and rash afterwards. What makes this one unique is that it has three settings for different length of hair growth. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold unlike the previous \\&quot;boxy\\&quot; one I used. It feels more powerful than the others. I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews here and luckily have not experienced any kind of problem with the razor or my skin.  I have been using an electric razor for in-between shaves for 15 years and this one is wonderful.  I take it to the beach with me.  The only thing I can recommend:  Be CAREFUL if you use this on your underarms.  I did find it a bit rough and will not be trying that again.  However, it is wonderful for legs.  It isn&#x27;t as clean of a shave as with a razor but your legs will pass the visual inspection every time.  It works pretty well on parts of the bikini area.  It just takes time and practice to get the best results I think.  I would definitely recommend this razor to women who prefer to use an electric every now and again.</li>
            <li> It takes a little gettibg used to in sensitive areas (under arms and bikini) but once you use it a few times, WOW! I first bought this shaver a few years ago. It worked great even after being dropped many times on our tile floors. Until that fateful day my 2 year old threw it down and it broke. I tried two other razors, both of wich did not compare. I am ordering a new one on ebay. $9.99 (so far) Nothing compares, you get a close shave every time without the hassel of doing it in the shower (you could if you wanted)</li>
            <li> This electric razor was one of the worst things I ever purchased. It doesn&#x27;t cut very close and I advise you just to use a regular razor. It&#x27;s impossible to shave the underarms and bikini area with this.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the greatest razor I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 years &amp; I am still as amazed with it&#x27;s performance as I was the very first time I used it.  I never thought that I would find an electric razor that shaved my legs so close that they felt as smooth and soft as with a straight edge razor.  I&#x27;ve owned several razors over the past 18 years...  They all performed about the same, and they cut the hair so that it didn&#x27;t show, and that was it.  I decided to try ONE LAST TIME to buy electric... When I saw the Remington WDF-5000 Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Plus Body Contour Shaver this was THE last resort.  My legs feel smooth and soft to the touch AND feel SHAVED when the sheets of my bed touch them.  I am a mother of SIX children, and I only shave between Once a week and Once a month!  This razor does the Job EVERY TIME!  Each time I have thought it was time to replace the razore I&#x27;ve brushed it with it&#x27;s brush &amp; it has just shaved right on good as new!  I&#x27;m ordering a new kit for it now, but I may not need to install it for several more months.  If you want a close, smooth, comfortable, shave without any nicks BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver, however, I had to use it almost everyday. I wanted and hoped for a close shave. I got a close shave by pressing down a little hard and got myself a cut a few times. My fault on that one! It is easy and quick and is good for those hard to get areas. I have thin legs and this is great for going over my shins. (a razor always sliced me no matter how lightly i used it)Great for bikini and underarms, easy to clean. A little loud, but better than my screams from cutting myself!! Fast re-charge. I really like this , I just wish it was a closer shave and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.....Charge lasts a long time...and leaves your skin smooth.  I would highly recommend it especially for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Remington customer and have always been very satisfied with their products, having purchased multiple Remington Women&#x27;s Razors over the course of the past 10 + years.  I have very sensitive skin, and using an electric razor has really been my only means of getting a rash free, clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the Remington WDF-5000 Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Plus Body Contour Shaver has been a big disappointment.  The battery life has been marginal from the day I took it out of the box, just barely sufficient enough to finish both legs.  In the last few months (it&#x27;s only 4 months old!), the razor has become virtually unusable.  Despite being fully charged, the battery regularly lasts a mere 90 seconds to 2 minutes before losing steam.  Each stroke then becomes uncomfortable and I&#x27;m left with a very patchy result (anything BUT smooth or silky!).  From day one, this razor has never provided me with the close, clean shave I&#x27;ve become accustomed to with prior Remington products, and as the battery has significantly diminished, it has essentially rendered the product completely useless.  Sadly, my friend bought the same razor as myself at the same time at my suggestion (based on my prior satisfaction with other products) and she, too, has been unable to ever obtain a close, clean shave with this product.  I might consider other Remington products in the future, but most definitely NOT this razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit louder than my previous electric razor, but this unit has more options than what I had been using such as three settings for short (stubble), short &amp;amp; long (2 or more days since shaving last), and long hair growth.  Another feature I liked was that the foil heads on the unit move independently of one another--giving you a better chance getting at those odd-shaped places like the knee and ankle areas.  No electric razor I&#x27;ve tried gives the same close shave as using a blade razor (hence 4/5 stars), but I&#x27;ll take slightly less closeness over the irritation and razor rash from a blade shave any time!</li>
            <li> This Razor was bought for my mom. She tried it for about 3 weeks &amp; it didn,t shave well at all. It was very loud compared to her&lt;BR&gt;old razor &amp; didn,t even seem to do anything. I would not recommend it at all to anyone. .... Look for another Brand. I:ve had good luck with&lt;BR&gt;some of the Panasonic Brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this model 2 years ago, and I was happy with it. I only used it dry, because if I wanted to shave in the tub, I&#x27;d just use a razor. It did a good job: close enough without being TOO close. But I went to use it the other day and even though it had been charging for a couple of days, it just didn&#x27;t work! Instead of going Rrrrrrrrr, it went click,click,click,click.........   For the price, I thought it would last longer than 2 years.   Other than being short lived, I really liked it. I would buy one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various models of Remington electric razors for many years, and I was pleased when I saw this model.  My old one was just about gone, so I bought this and precharged it for the recommended 24 hours.  The problem was, once I used it, it cut less than half the hair, even after going over the same area of skin repeatedly.  Experimenting with the &#x27;hair length&#x27; settings made no difference.  Maybe I just got a bad razor, but I must say that I&#x27;m unimpressed, especially after being so happy with earlier Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> My mother bought this for me to replace my 10 year old Norelco.  It has a nice concept, but I found it did not shave very well.  In the shower, it did absolutely nothing.  Out of the shower it did OK.  The shave didn&#x27;t last very long, and in some areas it really hurt.  The charge does not last very long.  It seems like it takes at least a few hours to charge it fully and you have to charge it after every use.  I have gone back to my old Norelco.  This shaver is not for me.</li>
            <li> This razor does produce a close shave on the legs.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on the underarm area and produces terrible, painful cuts in the bikini area.  Ouch!</li>
            <li> I am not one to primp, but this shaver does all the work for me.  It takes awhile for your skin to get used to, but once it does it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I am a 13 year old girl, and it is such a hassel to shave. I really wanted to start shaving, like all of my friends. A couple of weeks after I started, it became like such a chore. I much prefer not having to take a shower and shave. All the bending over in the shower hurts my back and my breasts get in the way. Its much easier to shave in my  room, wearing a bra.</li>
            <li> I have always used a blade razor, and often ended up with cuts, nicks, and some even nasty gouges! This shaver was hard to get used to, and it took a while to get my skin used to it, since it tends to be very sensitive, but eventually I got the hang of it, and finally - no more CUTS! This is worth it for me, and I find the fact that I can do a quick dry shave with no irritation very handy, too.</li>
            <li> I bought it and when i used it it gave me stuble hair and didnt work well at all. i would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and this razor gave me razor burn and ingrown hairs every time I used it over the course of three months. Also the blade in it seems to get dull fast, as the shaving got worse, not better. I specuale that this is because I have senstive skin and coarse hair. I have since switched to waxing since it is overall less painful for me.</li>
            <li> I had one before and it died. It was no longer available so I had to settle for something else. When I saw this one, I had to get it. I have very sensitive skin and this works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I have an older shaver bearing the same model number which I have used for years to clear the hair on my face, chin and throat.  The item I received did not do a good job and pulled as if the blades were not sharp.  Also after use my skin was red and irritated.  I had no choice but to return the shaver and look for something else.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I decided to buy an electric razor in the hopes of saving money, since blades are so expensive.  So...I read all the reviews and decided this was the one for me.  I read the instructions carefully, fully aware that it might take 2-3 weeks for my skin to adjust.  However,  I had no problem getting a good, smooth shave the first time, without any irritation whatsoever.  My biggest disappointment was how long it took to get a smooth shave.  You have to shave alot slower with the electric than with blades.  I shave my legs every day, and with a blade I can finish in 5 minutes.  The electric razor took 20 minutes!  Unacceptable!!!  I&#x27;ll continue to spend the bucks on blades rather than spending 2 hours a week to shave.  I returned the product for a refund.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because of some reviews I had read. Let me tell you..I have owned electric women&#x27;s shavers in the past and have never had one cut me when I used it. This one drew blood!! I have tried this shaver 3 times and 3 times it has cut my skin and drawn blood. Please be careful if you are thinking about purchasing this one or using it esp around delicate areas like under arms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have never cut myself with a manual razor and I managed to cut my underarm with this... the legs aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth and it takes longer!  What&#x27;s the use?</li>
            <li> I recently received this shaver as a gift--and yes, it was on my list. Whatever the givers paid for it, it was worth it! I haven&#x27;t cut my legs in weeks, as I used to do with my old manual razor--that one that many women have, y&#x27;know, named after a goddess, *hint hint*. I&#x27;m waiting for that drop of blood to be shed, but this little wonder doesn&#x27;t seem to want to hurt me! Many people just dive into using this razor without reading the instruction manual--stupid move! If you read it properly, it tells you to give it a couple of weeks for your skin/hair to get used to it. It took me about a week, and my legs are SO smooth! It&#x27;s never been so easy to shave. I&#x27;ve tried it both wet and dry, and it&#x27;s very effective both ways, but it&#x27;s more effective wet with a bit of shave gel. Try it out--Remington gives you a 30 day &amp;quot;no questions asked&amp;quot; $$$ back guarantee. You really can&#x27;t lose...and you&#x27;ll save money in the long run with this little baby! Buy it, read the instructions, try it, treat it well, and it&#x27;ll give you great results, and maybe even make you look forward to shaving. Scary thought, eh?</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it: you can&#x27;t rake an electric shaver over your skin and expect it to do the same job as a plain old razor. But then again, electric shavers typically don&#x27;t leave you with painful nicks and razor burn! I read the directions carefully before using this product, and found that using it with warm water and shaving gel was optimal. I have had no problems with the charge running out and I find the unit easy to disassemble and to clean. There are three levels for shaving, depending on the length of hair- which is a very accommodating feature to have. I would say that if you want the closest shave possible, stick with a razor, but if you are willing to settle for the next best thing (electric), this shaver does the job very well.</li>
            <li> The best reviews have shaving habits, so here are mine. I shave once a week, give or take. Since I shave so infrequently, it always takes me about 20 minutes, so the \\&quot;takes a long time\\&quot; complaints were irrelevant to me. I also always have to go over my skin two or three times to get a clean shave, so those complaints were irrelevant to me as well. I&#x27;m not concerned with my bikini area. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I do have uneven skin highly prone to nicks and cuts, and suffer from a great deal of post-shaving itching that lotion and moisturizers only slightly alleviate. I&#x27;d used razors from cheapest to most expensive, and had only found moderate relief as I improved my razor. So, I thought - to help my budget - that I&#x27;d give an electric shaver ONE try. I picked this one because it seemed to be the best shaver for my money, based on reviews. The first time I used it, I had an awesome, almost painless shave (only a small stinging behind my knees, and that was only the first time), no nicks or cuts, no razor burn, and no itching at all (I DID apply lotion, as usual, after my shave). The only problem I had was that I didn&#x27;t charge the shaver for a full 24 hours (only 12) before my first use, and the battery died right as I was finishing my first shave. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the battery even slowing down since that first shave. Overall, I&#x27;m delighted with my shaver, I think it&#x27;s probably every bit as good as the more expensive shavers. It&#x27;s been wonderful!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new shaver.As everyone else is I&#x27;m sure,I was skeptical about a close shave,etc. Well-I was pleasantly surprised. I get a very smooth shave &amp; the best part-\\&quot;no cuts\\&quot;. My bigggest advice to all who purchase it is:give yourself 2-3 weeks for your skin,etc to adjust. Be patient-It&#x27;s worth it!!! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this and was loving it, but it broke when I had it less than a month, now I am going through the hassle of trying to return it. I will get a new one and see how that one does.</li>
            <li> A reasonable effective product.  Although, it&#x27;s somewhat noisy, it still does the job.</li>
