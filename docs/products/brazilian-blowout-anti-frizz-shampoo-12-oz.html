    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This venture proved to me that Acai works best for maintaining my blowout.  </li>
            <li>&quot; But after using the products and the iron I was so happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great smoothing shampoo for anyone looking to keep their hair tamed, not just those who got the treatment before hand.</li>
            <li>but it is not as great as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>Got the BB and LOVED the treatment.  </li>
            <li>Good luck ladies</li>
            <li>my hair is both healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>These products are absolutely AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>THIS SHAMPOO AND THE CONDITIONER AND SERUM ARE AMAZING PRODUCTS FOR THE HAIR.  </li>
            <li>My hair responds well to most good shampoos.</li>
            <li>products smell good, but they don&#x27;t leave my hair looking/feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many others and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I am choosing to use it to preserve my Brazilian Blowout which has done wonderful things for my curly, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>But I wish that the shampoo did a better job of cleaning my scalp.</li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans my hair but does not appear to do anything more.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I got a Brazilian Blowout and love it.  </li>
            <li>At almost $40 per bottle (in the salon) I&#x27;d expect a lot more.</li>
            <li>started using the Moroccan Oil line and my hair is looking, feeling, and smelling much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying my Brazilian Blowout much more and will keep doing it, but won&#x27;t use their products.</li>
            <li>The Brazilian Blowout shampoo is great for maintaining the results of the Brazilian Blowout you paid so much for.</li>
            <li>June of 2010, I had my Brazilian Blowout and have been using these products since, I love them.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a 2-in one shampoo/conditioner... but one that has about 70% conditioner to 30% shampoo.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ending up having to wash it much more often than I did before.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need more than about a nickel to quarter sized amount</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to do a light wash, rinse some out and lather a second time.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic, and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner smells great, and makes the treatment last longer, and I absolutely love it.   </li>
            <li>Both the Acai shampoo, conditioner, and daily smoothing serum work great.  </li>
            <li>a year ago I was happy when I left the salon</li>
            <li>They recommend using products that are sulfate free to extend the life of the blowout.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was using tis product after a Brazillian Blowout.  </li>
            <li>I know the Brazilian Blowout is very trendy right now, but I simply didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I should have paid the full price at my salon, but unforntunately did not.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so easy to style, and now I can even just let it airdry straight!  </li>
            <li>For me, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>While I love my brazilian blowout (it&#x27;s been fabulous not having to straighten my frizzy hair daily!)</li>
            <li>I only use a very small amount of the smoothing serum, concentrating it more on my ends where it works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Using too much will make the hair at the top of my head look a little greasy, so I do go real easy there...</li>
            <li>I purchased the shampoo and conditioner that were supposed to be new and the shampoo is only 3/4 full!!!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried a sulfate free shampoo like this, or like Wen, this might be a new experience for you.</li>
            <li>Using this product has kept my blowout in good condition well over 12 weeks (a real plus, since the blowout process is costly and you certainly want to keep it in top form for as long as possible).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very light citrus smell (think Citre Shine from the drug store) which didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>and my hair is straight!</li>
            <li>For the first time EVER my hair has flakes..</li>
            <li>I first started using this product after getting a Brazillian blowout.</li>
            <li>shampoo is required after a blowout service because it is sodium chloride free, sodium chloride is a salt type compound that will break down the keratin coating that is keeping the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I just take my time and work in the product really well.  </li>
            <li>If you want products that really work search for HER STYLER products, they have a website.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>After getting The Brazilian Blowout treatment, my stylist really pushed this shampoo/conditioner/serum on me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you use this along with the Brazilian Blowout conditioner to keep your hair smooth and shiny until time for your next Blowout.</li>
            <li>I use about a quarter size of both the shampoo and conditioner to help make the product last, and have never had any problem with my hair not feeling clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It extends the color - the red color in my hair lasts a full six weeks instead of looking washed out after three - and controls frizz like a pro.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and my blowout lasts much longer.   </li>
            <li>Not of fan of these products and will switch to some other sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>The other two were securely taped up, but the shampoo was not.</li>
            <li>First and LAST purchase at amazon!</li>
            <li>I explain to my clients, without the sodium chloride and other sulfates the lather is not as dense or rich.</li>
            <li>I have now used the entire bottle of this Brazilian Blowout shampoo and watched for results that would indicate less frizz and more manageabiltiy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like a thin laminate layer over each hair that will wear off more quickly with a typical shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never waste my money getting a brazillian blow out again.</li>
            <li>so far my hair still has the effects of the Blowout of a month.  </li>
            <li>BB Shampoo helps keep my BB hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>I am AA and after receiving this treatment going natural has been a breeze.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is this shampoo, which my salon gave me for free after my first treatment.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is incredibly coarse, full of natural curl that I used to have to flat iron daily, and prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>but after that it was back to normal.</li>
            <li>Try lathering after the hair is very well rinsed and is completely sopping wet.</li>
            <li>I was less concerned about the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean because I thought it was just the added product, but then my scalp started grossly flaking (which has NEVER happened to me before).</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, but the strands are fine.</li>
            <li>Like I said the products left my hair sooooo soft</li>
            <li>I want my hair to smell like a nice product, otherwise it picks up random smells like coffee or smoke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may not live up to your expectations if they are too high.</li>
            <li>People with thinner hair or finer hair may find this weighs their hair down too much.</li>
            <li>I have very thick fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a new straigtening iron, curling iron, and hair care products and spent a forth of the price as I did on the Brazillina</li>
            <li>I have very course,thick, frizzy, and tight curls</li>

            <li> I have very course,thick, frizzy, and tight curls</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not lather very well in my hard water.  </li>
            <li> I dreaded straightening my hair before these products because it just took so long</li>
            <li> Long story:</li>
            <li> It took two days using Acai after trying this other product to get back my luster!!!!  </li>
            <li> all I do is dry my hair with a blowdryer for 10 min</li>
            <li> Also it feels very very dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I used only these types of products and my treatment lasted longer than expected and only got worse when I went back to using sulfate products.</li>
            <li> Lesson Learned: I tried another popular, less expensive sulfate free product and was quite disappointed, since it actually seemed to change the texture of my blowout, making it look quite dull.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly and the bottle will last around 10 weeks - even for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> so the bottle can last well past six month, and that is washing your hair every day.</li>
            <li> I was at the Mall and a salesman asked me to let him try his straitening iron on me, he took 17 minutes to straigten my hair that took me on average an hour and a half to straighten with my Chi Iron.</li>
            <li> just a little dab worked in.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for my hair.</li>
            <li> I swear by this shampoo and treatment now - but would warn someone who can&#x27;t take a heavy product on their hair that this could be problematic.</li>
            <li> I was reading these reviews and as a stylist that performs this service on clients and myself it seemed there was some missing info.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have hair like mine that is constantly moisture starved, I think you won&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> usually was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more chemical perms and sulfate products for me.</li>
            <li> I do wash my hair every day, only because the blowout does make my hair look dirty if I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My daughter still uses this product and her hair is just flat and dirty looking in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> With this stuff, my hair felt dirty and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I was actually afraid this other product destroyed my blowout, but thankfully Acai revived it!  </li>
            <li> which equals 45 minutes of flat iron damage :(   </li>
            <li> (I have to wash it everyday or my scalp becomes absolutely {disgustingly} caked with oil), and while it seems to lather well, it (strangely enough) doesn&#x27;t remove any oil from my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Acai shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> or it is difficult to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> leaves our hair feeling and looking greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> My BAD review is for the shampoo/conditioner/</li>
            <li> I have always hated my hair</li>
            <li> This was awful; it made my scalp flake, and the texture of my hair felt greasy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Both the Acai shampoo, conditioner, and daily smoothing serum work great.  Using this product has kept my blowout in good condition well over 12 weeks (a real plus, since the blowout process is costly and you certainly want to keep it in top form for as long as possible).  I do wash my hair every day, only because the blowout does make my hair look dirty if I don&#x27;t.  I use about a quarter size of both the shampoo and conditioner to help make the product last, and have never had any problem with my hair not feeling clean afterwards.  I just take my time and work in the product really well.  I only use a very small amount of the smoothing serum, concentrating it more on my ends where it works best for me.  Using too much will make the hair at the top of my head look a little greasy, so I do go real easy there...just a little dab worked in.  Lesson Learned: I tried another popular, less expensive sulfate free product and was quite disappointed, since it actually seemed to change the texture of my blowout, making it look quite dull.  It took two days using Acai after trying this other product to get back my luster!!!!  I was actually afraid this other product destroyed my blowout, but thankfully Acai revived it!  This venture proved to me that Acai works best for maintaining my blowout.  For me, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> These products are absolutely AMAZING.  I have curly/wavey hair, and ever since my Brazilian Blowout- all I do is dry my hair with a blowdryer for 10 min and my hair is straight! It used to take 45 min to straighten my hair...which equals 45 minutes of flat iron damage :(   But ever since the BB- my hair is both healthy and shiny! The shampoo/conditioner smells great, and makes the treatment last longer, and I absolutely love it.   FIVE STARS!!!!</li>
            <li> Got the BB and LOVED the treatment.  My hair is so easy to style, and now I can even just let it airdry straight!  My BAD review is for the shampoo/conditioner/serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products smell good, but they don&#x27;t leave my hair looking/feeling clean. For the first time EVER my hair has flakes.. Also it feels very very dry to the touch.  Not of fan of these products and will switch to some other sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not lather very well in my hard water.  I am choosing to use it to preserve my Brazilian Blowout which has done wonderful things for my curly, coarse hair.  But I wish that the shampoo did a better job of cleaning my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile.  I have very thick fine wavy hair.  Originally, I was using tis product after a Brazillian Blowout.  The blowout has worn off, but I continue to use this shampoo and conditioner because my hair looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner that were supposed to be new and the shampoo is only 3/4 full!!!  I should have paid the full price at my salon, but unforntunately did not.  First and LAST purchase at amazon!</li>
            <li> I had a this done a year ago I was happy when I left the salon but after I washed my hair I was not, Yes it left my hair softer for about 2 weeks but after that it was back to normal. It was a waste of money for my hair. I recently bought a new straigtening iron, curling iron, and hair care products and spent a forth of the price as I did on the Brazillina blow out and my hair is softer than it has ever been in my life. I was at the Mall and a salesman asked me to let him try his straitening iron on me, he took 17 minutes to straigten my hair that took me on average an hour and a half to straighten with my Chi Iron. I went ahead and purchased the products thinking in the back of my head \\&quot;man I just got taken\\&quot; But after using the products and the iron I was so happy. It took me 20 minutes to straighten my hair this has never happened for me. Like I said the products left my hair sooooo soft I can even run my hands through my hair and I can not stop. I am amazed. I would never waste my money getting a brazillian blow out again. If you want products that really work search for HER STYLER products, they have a website. You can also buy them on Amazon which is a lot cheaper. I have very course,thick, frizzy, and tight curls I have always hated my hair but now I love it. I dreaded straightening my hair before these products because it just took so long so I only did it about once a month or so but now I do it all the time. Good luck ladies I hope you take my advice</li>
            <li> I have now used the entire bottle of this Brazilian Blowout shampoo and watched for results that would indicate less frizz and more manageabiltiy. I have not seen any such results. The shampoo cleans my hair but does not appear to do anything more. I know the Brazilian Blowout is very trendy right now, but I simply didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I got a Brazilian Blowout and love it.  Unfortunately the Acai shampoo, conditioner, etc. leaves our hair feeling and looking greasy and dirty.  I decided to go back to using Pantene and so far my hair still has the effects of the Blowout of a month.  My daughter still uses this product and her hair is just flat and dirty looking in my opinion.  Since she was told to only use this product, my daughter is going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after getting a Brazillian blowout. They recommend using products that are sulfate free to extend the life of the blowout. I used only these types of products and my treatment lasted longer than expected and only got worse when I went back to using sulfate products. This is a great smoothing shampoo for anyone looking to keep their hair tamed, not just those who got the treatment before hand. You don&#x27;t need much so the bottle can last well past six month, and that is washing your hair every day. I am already on my second bottle and at some point will go to a third!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried a sulfate free shampoo like this, or like Wen, this might be a new experience for you. People with thinner hair or finer hair may find this weighs their hair down too much. However, my hair is incredibly coarse, full of natural curl that I used to have to flat iron daily, and prone to frizz. Having the BB treatment in the salon and following up with the shampoo, conditioner, and serum has made such a difference in my hair! I can go longer between shampoos. It extends the color - the red color in my hair lasts a full six weeks instead of looking washed out after three - and controls frizz like a pro. I swear by this shampoo and treatment now - but would warn someone who can&#x27;t take a heavy product on their hair that this could be problematic. On the other hand, if you have hair like mine that is constantly moisture starved, I think you won&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> BB Shampoo helps keep my BB hair soft.  The packaging for shipment to me was lacking.  I bought three items.  The other two were securely taped up, but the shampoo was not. Some of it leaked out into the packing container.</li>
            <li> I was reading these reviews and as a stylist that performs this service on clients and myself it seemed there was some missing info.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is required after a blowout service because it is sodium chloride free, sodium chloride is a salt type compound that will break down the keratin coating that is keeping the hair smooth. It&#x27;s very much like a thin laminate layer over each hair that will wear off more quickly with a typical shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;As I explain to my clients, without the sodium chloride and other sulfates the lather is not as dense or rich. Try lathering after the hair is very well rinsed and is completely sopping wet. When you have gone 2,3,4 days without shampooing it&#x27;s best to do a light wash, rinse some out and lather a second time. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> After getting The Brazilian Blowout treatment, my stylist really pushed this shampoo/conditioner/serum on me. At almost $40 per bottle (in the salon) I&#x27;d expect a lot more. My hair is thick, but the strands are fine. It gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t flat-iron, but isn&#x27;t curly. My hair responds well to most good shampoos. With this stuff, my hair felt dirty and weighed down. It wasn&#x27;t even shiny like it usually was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light citrus smell (think Citre Shine from the drug store) which didn&#x27;t last. I want my hair to smell like a nice product, otherwise it picks up random smells like coffee or smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Moroccan Oil line and my hair is looking, feeling, and smelling much better. I&#x27;m enjoying my Brazilian Blowout much more and will keep doing it, but won&#x27;t use their products.</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Blowout shampoo is great for maintaining the results of the Brazilian Blowout you paid so much for. Use sparingly and the bottle will last around 10 weeks - even for long, thick hair like mine. I would recommend you use this along with the Brazilian Blowout conditioner to keep your hair smooth and shiny until time for your next Blowout.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAMPOO AND THE CONDITIONER AND SERUM ARE AMAZING PRODUCTS FOR THE HAIR.  YOU WILL NOT WANT TO BE WITHOUT THESE BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT PRODUCTS!!!</li>
            <li> This was awful; it made my scalp flake, and the texture of my hair felt greasy.  I was less concerned about the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean because I thought it was just the added product, but then my scalp started grossly flaking (which has NEVER happened to me before).</li>
            <li> This product definitely prolongs the life of the BB treatment. It may leave your hair oiliy especially by the next day, but that may be the price to pay for this type of shampoo. Ive tried many others and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> June of 2010, I had my Brazilian Blowout and have been using these products since, I love them.    My hair is soft and my blowout lasts much longer.   Love them!</li>
            <li> Short story: It&#x27;s not a shampoo. It&#x27;s more like a 2-in one shampoo/conditioner... but one that has about 70% conditioner to 30% shampoo.   Long story: While I love my brazilian blowout (it&#x27;s been fabulous not having to straighten my frizzy hair daily!) my only complaint is this shampoo, which my salon gave me for free after my first treatment. I have naturally oily hair (I have to wash it everyday or my scalp becomes absolutely {disgustingly} caked with oil), and while it seems to lather well, it (strangely enough) doesn&#x27;t remove any oil from my hair. If it actually does, then it immediately replaces my hair&#x27;s oil with whatever super-conditioning ingredient it contains. I&#x27;m ending up having to wash it much more often than I did before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after a brazillian blowout.  It is fantastic, and my hair has never looked better.  One word of advice- you don&#x27;t need more than about a nickel to quarter sized amount or it is difficult to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have use this shampoo, conditioner and serum since getting the BKT and I have nothing but raves reviews.  I am AA and after receiving this treatment going natural has been a breeze. I only wish they had a leave in conditioner and scalp balm. No more chemical perms and sulfate products for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product becuase I had heard all of the hype but it is not as great as I had anticipated. It may not live up to your expectations if they are too high.</li>
