            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like the Fekkai line.</li>

            <li> My hair is very dry</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this with the shampoo and the hair mask.  It smells great and it truly is for dry hair.  Thanks for the wonderful product and great price, these products are very pricy.</li>
            <li> This is the best kept secret from the Fekkai line.  I have been using this product for more than 12 years and it is the best conditioner period! It works and smells wonderful.  It is a little pricey but worth the money trust me on this one!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Pity now you can only buy online.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and sometimes dry, sometime oily and slightly damaged. I like this conditioner because it moisturizes my hair without weighing it down. My hair is medium length.  A little of this conditioner goes a long way, which is great, the bottle lasts me about 4 months. This is the second time I purchased it and I love the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;My FAVORITE conditioner ever.&lt;br /&gt;this is the Epitome of the word CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt SOFTER.&lt;br /&gt;love love love</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and very damaged, this product really saved my hair. Well worth what I paid for. and it last a long time. I love this product will not use nothing else on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really keeps my hair moisturized without weighing it down. I have naturally curly hair and this product prevents frizz and keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Pricey but great moisturizer</li>
            <li> This product  came in old packaging.  Fekkai changed the bottle style over a year a go or possibly longer.</li>
            <li> The brand name sold me on this product since I buy their hair slicking product and I love it.  The shampoo and conditioner both left me disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair and silkier or smoother than Suave products. I&#x27;ll continue to use it till it&#x27;s gone but won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is.  I first bought it at COSTCO because it seemed like a great deal and I&#x27;m always looking for better hair products.  My hair gets fuzzy in humidity and I don&#x27;t care which product I tried, nothing seemed to tame it.  This stuff does.  I&#x27;ve had compliments on my hair, how shiny it is and healthy looking.  I bought some for my daughter, but she has not tried it yet.  Unless something changes, this is now my new hair product.</li>
            <li> I once heard &amp;#34;If you&#x27;re going to spend any money on hair care products, spend it on your conditioner.&amp;#34; So I do. This softens and sleekifies my frizzy, fine hair and has a nice unobtrusive scent. It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way. Big fan.</li>
            <li> I considered purchasing this product for a few reasons.  The first reason was that fact that you could subscribe to it and have it sent to you whenever you wanted after it was empty.  The second reason was because I have used Fekkai products prior to my purchase.  I loved the scent and how it felt in my hair.  It definitely was worth the price, but then again the price was not great for the small.  Although, I would recommend it if you are willing to pay the price for it.  Again, if you like the brand and do not mind subscribing for the product, it will save you some money that way.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! I love the smell and the results. My hair gets very smooth with it. Love it, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo/conditioner together and it makes my hair so much softer than any other ones I&#x27;ve tried, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my Mother and she adores it!  She loves the way her hair is cleansed- and comes out soft and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair either, so it is a great mild shampoo and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and this is the best conditioner I have found for calming and smoothing my hair.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair oily. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Works really well on dry brittle hair, and does not leave a residue!! It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny!! Definitely get the shampoo to compliment it.</li>
            <li> In my rounds of switching to different shampoos this one really wokeup some dead look strands.I first tried this one at a friends house then bought my own.Make your hair soft.Im going to try the apple one next!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years. It makes my hair soft and gets out all the tangles in the shower. And it smells nice. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other conditioners at different times, but I always come back to this.</li>
            <li> I have very soft, curly, hair that requires alot of moisturizer and detangler. I used to use Nexxus Humectress but I wanted to see if there was something better out there for my hair.  When I tried this product it did not moisturize my hair, actually, it dried it out a bit. It DOES however keep my hair shiny and gives it a good amount of volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love the price and he way it makes your haif feel full and luxcurious!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price! paid moree at stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be short and sweet.  I was thisclose to getting this in a store locally but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend as much as they were asking.  A quick search online showed me this.  I purchased based on price (I already smelled it in the store).  AWESOME!  Price was right.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I really like the Fekkai line. My hair is very dry and course and this is the only shampoo and conditioner that makes a big difference. I wish it wasnt quite so costly but have found it is worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair which equals UNRULY&amp;#62;  This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, silky, and manageable.  I don&#x27;t have to weight it down with product to combat the frizz.  I love this product!  My husband has started using it as well and says that it gives him &amp;#34;rock star hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Fekkai fan.I have many Fekkai products and I absolutely love this conditioner.My dry,fine,relaxed hair turns out perfect after using this conditioner.My hair is soft,well moisturized,and looks like I just came from the salon.I also have to mention the wonderful smell.I have purchased this over the years and will continue to do so.It&#x27;s expensive,but worth it.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny. I get so many compliments on how soft and healthy my hair looks. I truly love this product and don&#x27;t plan on using any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely conditioner I always use pureology but I wanted a change for a little it leaves your hair super smooth and soft. The only thing is is that it leaves over a residue probably the Shea butter which is like oily and thickens the hair I like it but my stylist was like this is bad your hair needs to breathe go back on pureology lol but I love it</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to think that price is indicative of product quality... and this just isn&#x27;t it.  My hair is not very thick, it&#x27;s long, and slightly wavy.  I have used this condition for about three weeks now and I see no improvement in my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel soft, silky, and luxurious- and I have great hair.  It looks dry and damaged.  However, I don&#x27;t use this conditioner in conjunction with any other Fekkai products.  I would never buy this product again- I&#x27;ll stick to my Sleek Look.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair due to coloring and chemicals. This shampoo did a great job hydrating my hair also smells great!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner at reasonable price. Leaves hair feely silky without weighing it down. Don&#x27;t need a ton, just a little is plenty.</li>
            <li> It makes my curly hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great, just like shea butter moisturizing shampoo. What I liked more was that this conditioner kept my hair very moisturized but not greasy. My hair was so easy to style, without using much of other product and hair straighter iron.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner. I have thick, wavy/curly, coarse hair. It detangled and made my hair soft. As I do not heat style my hair it was just right. Maybe too much for someone with limp, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using these products since I met her 13yrs ago and loves all of them!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of few that really moisturizes my hair. I live in a very dry environment, Colorado and I desperately need moisture.</li>
            <li> Received a sample in the mail and had to buy it after one use.  This is the best product ever.  Price is worth i!</li>
            <li> see my shampoo review  all goes the same for the conditioner.  it is pricy but seems to be well worth it.</li>
