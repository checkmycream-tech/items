    <ol>
            <li>Besides the good manufacturing practices of Weleda (and they are biodynamic!!)</li>
            <li>It creates a wonderful moisture barrier on my skin that lasts until I wash my face.</li>
            <li>The best face cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>

            <li>Great cream skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>Also has a nice rose scent.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but the rose oil still irritates my eyes.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re outdoors a lot, like me, you&#x27;ll love the nice protection against dryness.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream and have used it for 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>Others may love it, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>and it is magical.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to so many of my friends and they all swear by it now.  </li>
            <li>Very rich but absorbed to skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This is the most fabulous cream I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is light and does not make my face feel oily after using.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and floral.</li>
            <li>It is light but lots of moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the brand for a while now and am very happy to have found this particular product.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY MANY mositure creams over the years and the Weleda Everon Cold Cream is the best one I have come across.  </li>
            <li>This cream is extremely light and velvety smooth, yet doesn&#x27;t contain too much water.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t love the lavender scent, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for rose petal soft skin after endless plane travel (and it fits just perfectly in my TSA</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of different.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exceptional compared to other moisturizing products as far as results go, but as far as the ingredient lists go, this one is superior.  </li>
            <li>almond oil is AMAZING for dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>My face is very thankful!</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is much softer, and I am seeing a reduction in early fine lines, which I was not expecting.</li>
            <li>No big deal for me because I use it in the winter, but I would recommend additional protection if this product is used as day cream in the strong sun.</li>
            <li>I like Windrift Hill Body Butter for Very Dry Skin better.</li>
            <li>But, it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>always hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like all the Weleda products I have tried except this one, but perhaps I was using it incorrectly.  </li>
            <li>I still like it but will pull out my real guns with Skin Food.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing but not greasy like an oil.&lt;br /&gt;gf42</li>
            <li>Everon Cold Cream is thinner in consistency than Skin Food, and has a nice rose scent.</li>
            <li>Weleda is my favorite personal care brand by far, it&#x27;s so nourishing and wholesome.</li>
            <li>It is ok, not very rich and creamy</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products for mature, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It protects my face during the harsh New England winter and is also the perfect remedy for raw winter hands.</li>
            <li>Not a bad facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it to women over 40.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is nice and thick and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream I use it as a daily cream because my skin is so dry from being hyperthyroid</li>
            <li>I live in northern california, but wear it in any climate I go.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And I like the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>This cream has saved my children&#x27;s sensitive skin every winter since they were born.</li>
            <li>Works on adult faces and winter hands as well.</li>
            <li>when i wake up in the morning, my skin is suuuper soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it after washing with Ann Webb&#x27;s Coconut Cleanser and my skin is not tight or irritated.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive, dry, aging skin and nothing has come close to gently moisturizing my face like this.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Weleda is all natural and does not use petroleum products, which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin (despite following a paleo diet) and live in a very dry climate, and this is the only face cream I buy any more.</li>
            <li>Finally a facial cream that is rich and nourishing enough for my dry winter skin, with no ifs or buts.</li>
            <li>So I bought this cream and instantly the flaky areas went back to being normal.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin give this a shot, it&#x27;s certainly inexpensive enough, and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this very thick cream is the strong rose-y scent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My face had been breaking out worse than ever in my life right before I started chemotherapy last month, so I used an acne face wash which fixed the break out but ended up drying out a few patches on my face on either side of my mouth so much that they were flaking.</li>
            <li> It does seem somewhat thick when you first apply it to your face, but it melted into my skin without a greasy look.  </li>
            <li> I am a long term avene user that made the switch to this cream after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> My husband is from New Zealand, I am from the New England in the US, which means visiting his family involves a 24 hours in planes, which means that normally my skin looks mummified when I touch down at the other end of my journey, however this very traditional cold cream keeps my complexion looking silky on these long flights.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your skin moist for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin because of the heating in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smoothing and excelelent for very dry ski.</li>
            <li> This cream stands up to the very dry conditions here in the desert.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the container is quite small and doesn&#x27;t last very long, especially if you use the cream for your hands as well.</li>
            <li> it away from the nose though and other places that are on the oily side</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers suggested, I use it ad eye and lip cream.</li>
            <li> I just remove my makeup when I board the plane with a makeup wipe, and then apply a little dab of this all over my face and let it sink in, reapplying if I feel myself getting dry.</li>
            <li> I am in search for another natural, unscented, cold cream/heavy moisturizer, because I have extra dry skin and scents irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got a scare a year or so back when they changed the name to Cold Cream, but make no mistake, it is a very thick, rich, divine moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it feels a little greasy</li>
            <li> It might feel a little heavy going on, but stays with me all day and seals in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a face lotion that is truly moisturizing, this is the closest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The formula is thick and waxy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the face wash or the chemo kept my skin that dry, but either way, it looked awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I felt like it gave me breakouts, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> However, I still think Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food beats them all, especially in cold weather and for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> will be at a calendula and that will lead a cold cream depending on amount of moisture</li>
            <li> This cold cream moisturizes my face without causing rashes or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I bought an unscented cold cream at a farmer&#x27;s market this summer</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this cold cream. I feel like my skin is much softer, and I am seeing a reduction in early fine lines, which I was not expecting. The formula is thick and waxy. I use it every night before bed, after I shower. I have dry skin because of the heating in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it away from the nose though and other places that are on the oily side....it&#x27;ll cause pimples there.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream and have used it for 10+ years.  The name has changed but it&#x27;s still the same.  I like it because it is nice and thick and doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.  If you&#x27;re outdoors a lot, like me, you&#x27;ll love the nice protection against dryness.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY MANY mositure creams over the years and the Weleda Everon Cold Cream is the best one I have come across.  It keeps your skin moist for a very long time.  I highly reccomend it to women over 40.</li>
            <li> Not a bad facial moisturizer. Unfortunately, I felt like it gave me breakouts, so I stopped using it. But, it was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this cream I use it as a daily cream because my skin is so dry from being hyperthyroid I switch out between those will be at a calendula and that will lead a cold cream depending on amount of moisture I use never clog my pores always hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I wear it at night in combination with Weleda&#x27;s Smoothing Facial Lotion.  The combination of the two creates a perfect consistency for a potent night cream.</li>
            <li> My husband is from New Zealand, I am from the New England in the US, which means visiting his family involves a 24 hours in planes, which means that normally my skin looks mummified when I touch down at the other end of my journey, however this very traditional cold cream keeps my complexion looking silky on these long flights.  I just remove my makeup when I board the plane with a makeup wipe, and then apply a little dab of this all over my face and let it sink in, reapplying if I feel myself getting dry. it feels a little greasy and I don&#x27;t love the lavender scent, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for rose petal soft skin after endless plane travel (and it fits just perfectly in my TSA enforced liquids baggie)</li>
            <li> Very rich but absorbed to skin quite nicely. Like other reviewers suggested, I use it ad eye and lip cream.</li>
            <li> smoothing and excelelent for very dry ski.</li>
            <li> I really like all the Weleda products I have tried except this one, but perhaps I was using it incorrectly.  I use the Almond face cream day and night and even around my eyes and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is ok, not very rich and creamy</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.  This cold cream moisturizes my face without causing rashes or breakouts.  It is light and does not make my face feel oily after using.  I highly recommend it.  Additionally, Weleda is all natural and does not use petroleum products, which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> Great cream skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> This cream stands up to the very dry conditions here in the desert. My face is very thankful!</li>
            <li> This cream has saved my children&#x27;s sensitive skin every winter since they were born. We play outdoors a lot, and even bike when it is below 32°F. This cream is extremely light and velvety smooth, yet doesn&#x27;t contain too much water. That&#x27;s why it keeps the skin protected in freezing temperatures. Works on adult faces and winter hands as well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin (despite following a paleo diet) and live in a very dry climate, and this is the only face cream I buy any more. It might feel a little heavy going on, but stays with me all day and seals in the moisture. If you have dry skin give this a shot, it&#x27;s certainly inexpensive enough, and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Besides the good manufacturing practices of Weleda (and they are biodynamic!!), this cream just gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 and have been using this cream for 4 years now. It creates a wonderful moisture barrier on my skin that lasts until I wash my face. The smell is light and floral. I have very very sensitive, dry, aging skin and nothing has come close to gently moisturizing my face like this. I appreciate that the cream also does not come in plastic which even many expensive moisturizers do. I got a scare a year or so back when they changed the name to Cold Cream, but make no mistake, it is a very thick, rich, divine moisturizer. I believe it is the thickest of the line they carry. I live in northern california, but wear it in any climate I go. I just put a thinner coating of it on my face when I know I will be sweating or in a humid place. Love it!</li>
            <li> i have been smothering my face with this stuff at night, immediately after i shower/wash my face.  when i wake up in the morning, my skin is suuuper soft.  it&#x27;s great.  i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exceptional compared to other moisturizing products as far as results go, but as far as the ingredient lists go, this one is superior.  almond oil is AMAZING for dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My face had been breaking out worse than ever in my life right before I started chemotherapy last month, so I used an acne face wash which fixed the break out but ended up drying out a few patches on my face on either side of my mouth so much that they were flaking. I stopped using the acne face wash and tried using my facial scrub on the flaky spots plus lots of moisturizer, but they just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I&#x27;m not sure if the face wash or the chemo kept my skin that dry, but either way, it looked awful. So I bought this cream and instantly the flaky areas went back to being normal. Amazing! I only wish it didn&#x27;t contain beeswax because I aim to buy only vegan products (I forgot to check the ingredients when I bought it - total brain fart)...</li>
            <li> The only downside to this very thick cream is the strong rose-y scent.  Others may love it, I&#x27;m sure.  Not sure why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34;.  I use it after washing with Ann Webb&#x27;s Coconut Cleanser and my skin is not tight or irritated.  I recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am a long term avene user that made the switch to this cream after reading the reviews. It is light but lots of moisture for your skin. The smell is kind of different. I use mineral powder and this doesn&#x27;t cause the make up to cake.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and I LOVE this product.  It does seem somewhat thick when you first apply it to your face, but it melted into my skin without a greasy look.  Like I said &amp;#34;best ever cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too greasy.  I like Windrift Hill Body Butter for Very Dry Skin better.</li>
            <li> This cream is good and does do what it&#x27;s supposed to. However, I still think Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food beats them all, especially in cold weather and for very dry skin. Everon Cold Cream is thinner in consistency than Skin Food, and has a nice rose scent. I still like it but will pull out my real guns with Skin Food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It is one of my favorite products for mature, dry skin.  I often put it on after washing my face in the morning.  I sometimes use it before applying foundation.  It is very moisturizing but not greasy like an oil.&lt;br /&gt;gf42</li>
            <li> Hard to find a face lotion that is truly moisturizing, this is the closest I&#x27;ve found. Also has a nice rose scent. Actually, it smells like gin - literally.</li>
            <li> I bought an unscented cold cream at a farmer&#x27;s market this summer and I loved it. The seller made it from all essential oils and also goats milk from the goats she raised. She has since retired and doesn&#x27;t make it anymore. I am in search for another natural, unscented, cold cream/heavy moisturizer, because I have extra dry skin and scents irritate my eyes. I like this product, but the rose oil still irritates my eyes.  The consistency is quite a bit thicker than I was looking for, but it has good moisturizing qualities. And I like the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous cream I have ever tried.  I use it as an eye cream only and it is magical.  I have recommended it to so many of my friends and they all swear by it now.  I also used it around my mouth.</li>
            <li> The best face cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the brand for a while now and am very happy to have found this particular product. Finally a facial cream that is rich and nourishing enough for my dry winter skin, with no ifs or buts. It protects my face during the harsh New England winter and is also the perfect remedy for raw winter hands. The smell is very pleasant even though the cream is fragrance free. Weleda is my favorite personal care brand by far, it&#x27;s so nourishing and wholesome. \\&quot;The company is fundamentally opposed to the use of animal testing.\\&quot; \\&quot;NO chemical preservatives, fragrances or petrochemicals.\\&quot; My only complaint is that the container is quite small and doesn&#x27;t last very long, especially if you use the cream for your hands as well. The product itself is just heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This product does not protect against UVA/UVB rays to the best of my knowledge. No big deal for me because I use it in the winter, but I would recommend additional protection if this product is used as day cream in the strong sun.</li>
