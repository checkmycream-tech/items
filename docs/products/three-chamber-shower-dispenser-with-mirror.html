            <li> it&#x27;s kind of difficult</li>
            <li> This unit is very convenient in the typically small shower of an RV.</li>
            <li> hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> , however, when I mounted it against the white shower stall it has a pink tint to it.  </li>
            <li> It is also easier for the younger one to push the button that to pick up a wet slippy bottle and try to squeeze out soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li> let it dry.</li>
            <li> The mirror was not broke but came loose from the frame.</li>
            <li> So this little guy comes with silicone gel and 4 double sided tape to attach to the wall.  </li>
            <li> When I received this item I was wearing a pink shirt and thought it was just reflecting onto the&lt;br /&gt;surface</li>
            <li> The thing stood on the wall for about 4 days then came crashing down.  </li>
            <li> fell down AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> but it seems its a bit too heavy to stay in one spot.</li>
            <li> it became too heavy for the suction cups to hold it up.</li>
            <li> it will fall off in a few days.</li>
            <li> When I received it, the mirror has a little damage and i am so lazy to return it</li>
            <li> No more bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash around the tub.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with a broken mirror, and the dispenser was tinted pink.  </li>
            <li> Not more bottles everywhere.  </li>
            <li> well at least for me!!</li>
            <li> so it makes it difficult for my husband to use it for shaving, which was the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed about the reviews I read online about the mirror being broke when it arrived,but decided to order anyway.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed with the mirror as it fogs up</li>

            <li> We originally ordered this product because we needed it in a bathroom for a disabled person.  It was to sit low enough so that when sitting in the shower chair it was reachable.  Well it is such a fantastic product it is now going in all our bathrooms.  My wife will love it.  I suggest ordering a roll of the UGlu MTR703 Multi-purpose Industrial Strength Adhesive Strip.  They do provide adequate adhesive but just to be on the safe side I got extra.  GET THIS ITEM IN YOUR BATHROOM!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t put it on my shower wall yet, but it seems to be exactly what I wanted and need.The color is more a off white color, but as long as it does whats needed I will be happy.i will update after its been up. Sturdy, solid material so far.</li>
            <li> I super love this product! No more bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash around the tub. When I received it, the mirror has a little damage and i am so lazy to return it so i just kept it. The silicon glue or the adhesive tape included didn&#x27;t work for me, it fell a lot of times (So quality is really really good, didn&#x27;t break at all). I have to buy another waterproof glue. But overall. I like it so much.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have idea how to put it in my washroom it&#x27;s kind of difficult well at least for me!!</li>
            <li> Love all the features it comes with. Was disappointed about the reviews I read online about the mirror being broke when it arrived,but decided to order anyway. The mirror was not broke but came loose from the frame. Luckly I had some waterproof adhesive and fixed it better than it was. Have not put it up yet but love the idea of cleaning up the bottles and my husband loves to shave in the shower as this I a gift for him actually. I hope it meets up to all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is very good and is the second I buy, but the mirror arrived broken ...I hope to answer for this</li>
            <li> Love this shower dispenser! we have a large walk-in shower with the seat and we didn&#x27;t want to clutter it with all of our shampoos and conditioners so I ordered this from Amazon. I installed it, put in the conditioner and shampoo and body wash. took a shower the next morning and it wouldn&#x27;t dispense. I had to take them out, take the caps off to get everything out to wash my Hair and whatnot. So I went on YouTube and looked up how to prime it. Very simple to prime once done all of the shampoo conditioner body wash dispensed. Very happy with the product so far. hoping it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower product I got!! It installed easily (everything included), and I was able to get rid of all the bottles cluttering my shower.  Mirror is fog free and pumps work very well. For the price I paid this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> So this little guy comes with silicone gel and 4 double sided tape to attach to the wall.  The thing stood on the wall for about 4 days then came crashing down.  Went out and got some more tape... fell down AGAIN.  Granted nothing broke when it fell both tomes (kudos on the durability) but it seems its a bit too heavy to stay in one spot.</li>
            <li> The idea was good but after filling up all 3 chambers it became too heavy for the suction cups to hold it up.</li>
            <li> When I received this item I was wearing a pink shirt and thought it was just reflecting onto the&lt;br /&gt;surface, however, when I mounted it against the white shower stall it has a pink tint to it.  I was&lt;br /&gt;expecting guests, so kept it, but would otherwise have returned it because of its color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as function goes, it does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with a broken mirror, and the dispenser was tinted pink.  I expected white and really thought the pink was hideous.  Returned it and bought the one at Home Depot.</li>
            <li> This unit is very convenient in the typically small shower of an RV. IT is very resistant and well made.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you put a bit more of double side it tape to reinforce.</li>
            <li> The dispenser works well and holds a lot. Just disappointed with the mirror as it fogs up so it makes it difficult for my husband to use it for shaving, which was the purpose I bought it for.</li>
            <li> My shower is clutter free!  YEA !!!  Easy to install, looks great and so easy for my daughter to use!  No more bottles all around the tub. : )</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the adhesive that comes with the product. Once setup the product fell off the wall in only 7 hrs. The mirror looked great until it shattered into hundreds of little fragments that not litter the floor.</li>
            <li> Keep the boys bathroom clutter free.  Not more bottles everywhere.  It is also easier for the younger one to push the button that to pick up a wet slippy bottle and try to squeeze out soap or shampoo.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have to open bottles in the shower. I used a larger one for years but like the smaller size of this one.</li>
            <li> Purchased this dispenser for my shower thinking it would be just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but upon receiving it and installing and adding my soaps, I now have a really convenient, good loking denspenser for my bath products.  The mirrir does fog up when in the shower but I have some defogging gel I placed on it and all is good.  My wife wants one now for her shower.</li>
            <li> first of all tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well to wallpaper. it will fall off in a few days. it works well on any kind of tile, or painted surfaces. first thing clean wall. let it dry. Make whatever object you plan on mounting on wall as light as you can. don&#x27;t fill up bottles, take them out. take paper off tape. now hold your shower dispenser to the wall for 1 min. don&#x27;t fill unit for 1hr. now the tape is ready.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It was easy to install and already came with tons of labels! We use ours for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. There is now NO clutter in my bathroom! Great purchase!</li>
