            <li>Honestly, these transfer like nothing you would believe.</li>
            <li>make sure to moisturize your lips before application because this can be drying like all matte products, but the color is beautiful and application is so easy.</li>
            <li>Color is perfect arrived early a plus</li>

            <li>I love Lime Crime and this lipstick is everything.</li>
            <li>Love the color and quality</li>
            <li>Didnt like it at all, it gets all over your face et teeth, its challenging to put on without getting it everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but this is sure replacing that.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE Co</li>
            <li>cant wait to officially use it  :)</li>
            <li>Love my all time</li>
            <li>I love love this bel velvetine</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>The shade is actually more maroony.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Its cheaper than when i bought @limecrime when i needed more than two velvetines at a time</li>
            <li>Love it how It looks need more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be and more.</li>
            <li>I probably just end up keeping it and figure some way to sanitize it to make myself feel better using it.</li>
            <li>Favorite lip color.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this color.</li>
            <li>Love the color, very true to color.</li>
            <li>The lip stick is great and last all day, one of the best I have used so far, don&#x27;t mind purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast the process was good.</li>
            <li>It lasted a full day at work and survived all of my meals (including coffee)!</li>
            <li>Keep your lips hydrating and you can easily rock this.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a Beautiful color</li>
            <li>Best purchase I have made yet, went to the beach and they stayed on, wear it absolutely everywhere now bought a lot more in different colors, and the mat finish is devine</li>
            <li>Love love love velvetines, and Wicked is no different than the others I own.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is a bit funky but once it dries it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>They are drying and settle into the fine lines of the lips.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many long wear lipsticks and stains and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>Buyer beware, this price is a huge rip off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to apply it evenly.</li>
            <li>is so light</li>
            <li>The velvetines are fantastic lip products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve eaten and drank while wearing them and they remain pretty intact on my lips (and touching up is easy).</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product and it was finally available to order again.</li>
            <li>Love my new Velvetine!!!</li>
            <li>Lasts long and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Crumbles with long wear, but great concept and color.</li>
            <li>I love all LimeCrime Velvetinea Lipstick, love the matte look it creates, and how fast it dries off after I applied it, so I can kiss my husband immediately without living a lipstick mark on his face :) my favorite colour has been the Pink Velvetines, but this Wicked colour has got me hooked to it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought the red velvet color too :)</li>
            <li>So true to color.</li>
            <li>True to the picture.</li>
            <li>The staying power is about 8 full hours.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and I highly recommend it for anyone like me who doesn&#x27;t like constantly reapplying lip products throughout the day.</li>
            <li>it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li>Lining the lips first can make it easier to achieve a clean look.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Was it worth the $30 I paid for it?</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s my fault for not Investing more on other places any ways I love this color</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast really enjoy it</li>
            <li>The colour is very strong and dynamic.</li>
            <li>Resisted paying this much for lipstick for my daughter, but she is thrilled now that she finally got it.</li>
            <li>but the color is pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when first tried this  </li>
            <li>The picture is exactly what the color appears to be.</li>
            <li>but I think it is rediculouse to sell it for $75 or more when you can get from the actual limecrime website for $20</li>
            <li>Wish I can purchase more similar colors of this brand.</li>
            <li>Please, Please, make sure this does not get on your teeth and use a liner for the ultimate perfection with this product.</li>
            <li>Lovely product, only issue I find it that it isn&#x27;t quite as &#x27;transfer-proof&#x27; as they lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color, and the formula is pretty high quality, but given recent events, I would not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The lips stick lasts for hours but dries out when it sets, as most long wear lipsticks do.</li>
            <li>Love the rich deep red</li>
            <li>The matte lipstick was amazing, it somewhat comes off when I would eat something but barely and only on the inside of my lip</li>
            <li>If you are a makeup junkie, or just want a bold, lush look for your pout, try one of the Velvetine shades.</li>
            <li>But over all I do love what&#x27;s in the little tube and how the sender shipped it quick.</li>
            <li>Nice matte color &amp; long lasting, bleeds easily when applying if not careful .</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>plus I used a 25$ gift card this are so much cheaper at limecrime.com there</li>
            <li>Very beuatifull colour</li>
            <li>it is the shade i always want thanks.</li>
            <li>Not the same color but a far better matte finish.</li>
            <li>just a mess, color is cheap and nothing special.  </li>
            <li>After applying it won&#x27;t dry and comes off quite easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase this lipstick here, they&#x27;ve highly inflated the price it&#x27;s supposed to be much cheaper</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of small.</li>
            <li>Be aware it old cost $20 on the official website</li>
            <li>There are many other liquid lippies of equal or better quality that you can buy for cheaper or similar prices-</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than other products!</li>
            <li>the picture looks more red than it actually is.</li>
            <li>I love this color very dark</li>
            <li>I normally wear Ruby Woo by MAC</li>
            <li>Just got the lime crime velvetines and I love the color and how it&#x27;s so long lasting</li>
            <li>Super dark just like I wanted and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m going to be ordering other colors from this collection because the texture is fantastic</li>
            <li>nothing new feels like a new product that needs lots of improvement, don&#x27;t waist your money.  </li>
            <li>No other lipstick I use (matte or otherwise) smears this much.</li>
            <li>The only things I felt were a tad unsatisfactory was the product container came a lot smaller than I thought it would be and the lipstain was about 75% full.</li>
            <li>If you use  just the lipstick it does dry out and looks very matte but doesn&#x27;t transfer to drinks and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>this lipstick is epic.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented and lon lasting!</li>
            <li>Thought outrageously expensive, I figured it was a good product.</li>
            <li>As her mom, I would definitely be too old for the color, but it works well for a young person.</li>
            <li>but they stay wet for a super long time.</li>
            <li>The color stays and doesn&#x27;t smear much after it drys if one is careful.</li>
            <li>But a bare lip makes it stay longer.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the dark red color but my only minor problem with it is that it&#x27;s not as big as I thought</li>
            <li>No...I am still trying to find a lipstick that comes close to the 90&#x27;s dark burgundy that I see trending right now similar to this!</li>
            <li>It goes well with an skin color and its not  a dry lipstick.</li>
            <li>Did not dry my lips.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve eaten and drank while wearing them and they remain pretty intact on my lips (and touching up is easy).</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product and it was finally available to order again.</li>
            <li> Love my new Velvetine!!!</li>
            <li> Lasts long and the colors are great.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Crumbles with long wear, but great concept and color.</li>
            <li> I love all LimeCrime Velvetinea Lipstick, love the matte look it creates, and how fast it dries off after I applied it, so I can kiss my husband immediately without living a lipstick mark on his face :) my favorite colour has been the Pink Velvetines, but this Wicked colour has got me hooked to it.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought the red velvet color too :)</li>
            <li> So true to color.</li>
            <li> True to the picture.</li>
            <li> The staying power is about 8 full hours.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and I highly recommend it for anyone like me who doesn&#x27;t like constantly reapplying lip products throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> Lining the lips first can make it easier to achieve a clean look.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Was it worth the $30 I paid for it?</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my fault for not Investing more on other places any ways I love this color</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast really enjoy it</li>
            <li> The colour is very strong and dynamic.</li>
            <li> Resisted paying this much for lipstick for my daughter, but she is thrilled now that she finally got it.</li>
            <li> but the color is pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when first tried this  </li>
            <li> The picture is exactly what the color appears to be.</li>
            <li> but I think it is rediculouse to sell it for $75 or more when you can get from the actual limecrime website for $20</li>
            <li> Wish I can purchase more similar colors of this brand.</li>
            <li> Please, Please, make sure this does not get on your teeth and use a liner for the ultimate perfection with this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, only issue I find it that it isn&#x27;t quite as &#x27;transfer-proof&#x27; as they lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the color, and the formula is pretty high quality, but given recent events, I would not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The lips stick lasts for hours but dries out when it sets, as most long wear lipsticks do.</li>
            <li> Love the rich deep red</li>
            <li> The matte lipstick was amazing, it somewhat comes off when I would eat something but barely and only on the inside of my lip</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup junkie, or just want a bold, lush look for your pout, try one of the Velvetine shades.</li>
            <li> But over all I do love what&#x27;s in the little tube and how the sender shipped it quick.</li>
            <li> Nice matte color &amp; long lasting, bleeds easily when applying if not careful .</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> plus I used a 25$ gift card this are so much cheaper at limecrime.com there</li>
            <li> Very beuatifull colour</li>
            <li> it is the shade i always want thanks.</li>
            <li> Not the same color but a far better matte finish.</li>
            <li> just a mess, color is cheap and nothing special.  </li>
            <li> After applying it won&#x27;t dry and comes off quite easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this lipstick here, they&#x27;ve highly inflated the price it&#x27;s supposed to be much cheaper</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of small.</li>
            <li> Be aware it old cost $20 on the official website</li>
            <li> There are many other liquid lippies of equal or better quality that you can buy for cheaper or similar prices-</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s better than other products!</li>
            <li> the picture looks more red than it actually is.</li>
            <li> I love this color very dark</li>
            <li> I normally wear Ruby Woo by MAC</li>
            <li> Just got the lime crime velvetines and I love the color and how it&#x27;s so long lasting</li>
            <li> Super dark just like I wanted and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m going to be ordering other colors from this collection because the texture is fantastic</li>
            <li> nothing new feels like a new product that needs lots of improvement, don&#x27;t waist your money.  </li>
            <li> No other lipstick I use (matte or otherwise) smears this much.</li>
            <li> The only things I felt were a tad unsatisfactory was the product container came a lot smaller than I thought it would be and the lipstain was about 75% full.</li>
            <li> If you use  just the lipstick it does dry out and looks very matte but doesn&#x27;t transfer to drinks and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> this lipstick is epic.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented and lon lasting!</li>
            <li> Thought outrageously expensive, I figured it was a good product.</li>
            <li> As her mom, I would definitely be too old for the color, but it works well for a young person.</li>
            <li> but they stay wet for a super long time.</li>
            <li> The color stays and doesn&#x27;t smear much after it drys if one is careful.</li>
            <li> But a bare lip makes it stay longer.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with the dark red color but my only minor problem with it is that it&#x27;s not as big as I thought</li>
            <li> No...I am still trying to find a lipstick that comes close to the 90&#x27;s dark burgundy that I see trending right now similar to this!</li>
            <li> It goes well with an skin color and its not  a dry lipstick.</li>
            <li> Did not dry my lips.</li>
            <li> The application is not easy, a lip brush may be useful if you don&#x27;t regularly apply heavily pigmented lipsticks.</li>
            <li> hard to put on, dries fast as well as makes your lips so dry they actually crave moister.  </li>
            <li> You can find this product for $20.00 regular price on various other sites including Lime Crimes website.</li>
            <li> If you put chapstick or lip gloss over it the long wear aspect fades and it tends to get a bit sticky and transfers to everything when you drink or eat.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lips dry and wears for a long a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time and doesn&#x27;t smear once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> It does however dry your lips but just a touch of vasoline does not take away from the matte look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your lips dry in fact</li>
            <li> but if you allow to dry stays on all night.</li>
            <li> They are supposed to dry matte</li>
            <li> The texture can be slightly drying, but it does last all day.  </li>
            <li> The color was a bit darker than I expected, also it seemed to last way less than my other velvetines ( I don&#x27;t know why).</li>
            <li> Just as i expected.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other matte lipsticks and when it dries it makes my lips feel dry and cracked!</li>
            <li> You should use it over previously mosturized lips, as these mat formulas tend to dry out the skin and make them look chapped.</li>
            <li> The tip to making this product work is a sharp and neat application.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order other colors.</li>
            <li> Color is also not as dark as pictured</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous but the formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> You have to know what youre getting into with a matte liquid lipstick as they can be slightly drying and settle in the cracks</li>
            <li> Too expensive and don&#x27;t last so long as people say</li>
            <li> A little too pricey if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> It does bleed a little but just line your lips with concealer to prevent that.</li>
            <li> it look messy around the lid and applicator.</li>
            <li> but so so sooo pigmented, as usual lime crime</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but overall I think everyone should try it &amp; if you&#x27;re skeptical about buying it</li>
            <li> but it dried up making it look even HOTTER ! ...</li>
            <li> But after taken it for long hours, it seems like a bloody mood...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ADDICTED!</li>
            <li> Very dramatic.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why everyone&#x27;s obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to apply and starts to smear around the edges within just an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Did I get a bad batch?</li>
            <li> CRAZY PRICE!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> JUST HATE THE SMELL&#x27;</li>
            <li> Terrible product</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the owner of this company is absolutely awful and has stolen money from the company.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love my new Velvetine!!! It arrived on time and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Best lip product ever! Super dark just like I wanted and fast shipping! The color is amazing! I&#x27;m ADDICTED!</li>
            <li> Resisted paying this much for lipstick for my daughter, but she is thrilled now that she finally got it. It literally doesn&#x27;t smudge or fade. Pretty impressive. As her mom, I would definitely be too old for the color, but it works well for a young person.</li>
            <li> make sure to moisturize your lips before application because this can be drying like all matte products, but the color is beautiful and application is so easy. The color stays and doesn&#x27;t smear much after it drys if one is careful. I loved it so much I bought the red velvet color too :)</li>
            <li> it dries out quickly. then you have that chapped look. but the color is pretty</li>
            <li> My wife says this is some of the best lipstick she has ever used. And she gets a lot of compliments on her lipstick.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, you can these on http://limecrime.com/lips/velvetines-39.html for $20</li>
            <li> Love love love velvetines, and Wicked is no different than the others I own. very pretty color. so happy I was able to get this when the Lime Crimes site was OoS</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love all LimeCrime Velvetinea Lipstick, love the matte look it creates, and how fast it dries off after I applied it, so I can kiss my husband immediately without living a lipstick mark on his face :) my favorite colour has been the Pink Velvetines, but this Wicked colour has got me hooked to it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, this price is a huge rip off. Double the price kinda rip off. You can find this product for $20.00 regular price on various other sites including Lime Crimes website.</li>
            <li> A little too pricey if you ask me.  Love the way it glides on and dries matte.  Absolutely love the color and it stays in place.</li>
            <li> the lipstick was great.&lt;br /&gt;The price i paid was overrated, as it did not come in the beautiful packaging that lime crime sends it for. However, LimeCrime always runs out. the shipping was fast the process was good.</li>
            <li> Very dramatic. Great for the holidays or valentines. Love the rich deep red</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Color is perfect arrived early a plus</li>
            <li> Why would anyone pay 80 bucks for this when you can get it on limecrime for 20 bucks.. what a rip off... 5 stars for the color though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lip product quite like this one. Whenever I wear Velvetines (regardless of the color), I get loads of stares, compliments, and questions about the brand of lipstick I have on. I was so impressed with the richness, boldness, and luminosity of the colors that I even emailed the company to tell them!  Although it isn&#x27;t smear-proof, I find that these colors are fairly long-lasting. I&#x27;ve eaten and drank while wearing them and they remain pretty intact on my lips (and touching up is easy). The potency of the hues is impressive.  The tip to making this product work is a sharp and neat application. Since it is liquid, it can be trickier to apply. Lining the lips first can make it easier to achieve a clean look. It&#x27;s also important to apply it evenly. The texture can be slightly drying, but it does last all day.  If you are a makeup junkie, or just want a bold, lush look for your pout, try one of the Velvetine shades. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely. It smells like vanilla frosting and looks lovely :) I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Shipped quickly. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It was the red I had been looking for</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;ve never purchased any lime crime makeup before but I am EXTREMELY impressed with this matte lipstain. It lasted a full day at work and survived all of my meals (including coffee)! I didn&#x27;t even feel the need to reapply. The only things I felt were a tad unsatisfactory was the product container came a lot smaller than I thought it would be and the lipstain was about 75% full. Also, the smell is a bit funky but once it dries it was perfectly fine. Overall, five stars and I am definitely purchasing another one in a different color!</li>
            <li> I love Lime Crime and this lipstick is everything. It does however dry your lips but just a touch of vasoline does not take away from the matte look. For a even richer color fill in lips with a brown lip pencil then watch out your lips are going to explode with color. I went to a dinner party and slightest of transfer. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Came in before estimated time and it is so perfect. I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t put my finger on it.  I just didn&#x27;t like the way it looked.</li>
            <li> My first lime crime purchase and great one.  this lipstick is epic.  You have to know what youre getting into with a matte liquid lipstick as they can be slightly drying and settle in the cracks but you can use a primer or lipbalm and deal with it.  Keep your lips hydrating and you can easily rock this.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> Did I get a bad batch? After applying it won&#x27;t dry and comes off quite easily. Color is also not as dark as pictured</li>
            <li> Terrible product and if you&#x27;re a lip product junky you would agree.  hard to put on, dries fast as well as makes your lips so dry they actually crave moister.  just a mess, color is cheap and nothing special.  nothing new feels like a new product that needs lots of improvement, don&#x27;t waist your money.  can&#x27;t return it either.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when first tried this  it feels like if you don&#x27;t have makeup at all on your lips is so light but so so sooo pigmented, as usual lime crime never dissapoints they&#x27;re customers im in love &lt;3</li>
            <li> Love the color and quality</li>
            <li> So true to color. Must moisturize before you apply color. But a bare lip makes it stay longer.  Came fast.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how soon it came. I am in love with the dark red color but my only minor problem with it is that it&#x27;s not as big as I thought, it&#x27;s kind of small. But over all I do love what&#x27;s in the little tube and how the sender shipped it quick.</li>
            <li> Didnt like it at all, it gets all over your face et teeth, its challenging to put on without getting it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! Doesn&#x27;t make my lips dry and wears for a long a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I normally wear Ruby Woo by MAC but this is sure replacing that. Not the same color but a far better matte finish. I also have tried NYX matte cream and that does not come close to this. It does bleed a little but just line your lips with concealer to prevent that. I can wear one application all day. The picture is exactly what the color appears to be. It doesn&#x27;t leave your lips dry in fact you forget you are even wearing it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT MY FAVORITE Co to buy my matte lip stick from</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast really enjoy it</li>
            <li> I have tried it on and its lovely! cant wait to officially use it  :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product and it was finally available to order again. Thought outrageously expensive, I figured it was a good product. I was pretty disappointed. No other lipstick I use (matte or otherwise) smears this much. It&#x27;s very difficult to apply and starts to smear around the edges within just an hour or two. Not to mention that the owner of this company is absolutely awful and has stolen money from the company. I will never purchase anything from Lime Crime again and I urge you not to either.</li>
            <li> Love my all time Favorite lip Gloss 100% fine quality!</li>
            <li> CRAZY PRICE! go to the website for this product and a lot cheaper! 20$ only!</li>
            <li> I love love this bel velvetine but I think it is rediculouse to sell it for $75 or more when you can get from the actual limecrime website for $20</li>
            <li> Love it..love the color!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this lipstick here, they&#x27;ve highly inflated the price it&#x27;s supposed to be much cheaper</li>
            <li> The matte lipstick was amazing, it somewhat comes off when I would eat something but barely and only on the inside of my lip but overall I think everyone should try it &amp; if you&#x27;re skeptical about buying it I&#x27;m here to tell you not to be, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and don&#x27;t last so long as people say</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it 2stars it&#x27;s cause I feel I got robbed even though I only paid 16$ plus I used a 25$ gift card this are so much cheaper at limecrime.com there only 20$ but that&#x27;s my fault for not Investing more on other places any ways I love this color it&#x27;s such a Beautiful color I could wear it ever day love it</li>
            <li> Love!!! Color is amazingly beautiful! Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Wish I can purchase more similar colors of this brand.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why everyone&#x27;s obsessed with this stuff! It makes lips look like Marilyn Monroe lips in seconds! Lasts long and the colors are great. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The velvetines are fantastic lip products.  If you are looking for a deep red purplish tone, that looks matt, this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Thank you for the good quality of the product it is really great</li>
            <li> I like this lip stain!! Was it worth the $30 I paid for it? No...I am still trying to find a lipstick that comes close to the 90&#x27;s dark burgundy that I see trending right now similar to this! Please, Please, make sure this does not get on your teeth and use a liner for the ultimate perfection with this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, only issue I find it that it isn&#x27;t quite as &#x27;transfer-proof&#x27; as they lead you to believe. While it doesn&#x27;t smear everywhere, it does bleed and wipe off. So be warned. That being said, I&#x27;m going to be ordering other colors from this collection because the texture is fantastic and so is the smell (it smells like red velvet cake imo).</li>
            <li> I love this color very dark the picture looks more red than it actually is. The shade is actually more maroony. The lips stick lasts for hours but dries out when it sets, as most long wear lipsticks do. If you put chapstick or lip gloss over it the long wear aspect fades and it tends to get a bit sticky and transfers to everything when you drink or eat. If you use  just the lipstick it does dry out and looks very matte but doesn&#x27;t transfer to drinks and lasts much longer. Very much worth the price</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!! Love this color. True to the picture. Arrived earlier than expected. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Becaus im happy : so fast shipping the best velvetine lime crime ever i recommend this seller</li>
            <li> omg yesss . i love it</li>
            <li> Crumbles with long wear, but great concept and color.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is amazing. The staying power is about 8 full hours. The application is not easy, a lip brush may be useful if you don&#x27;t regularly apply heavily pigmented lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Its really nice. When I applied it I though it was going to stay shiny but it dried up making it look even HOTTER ! ...JUST HATE THE SMELL&#x27;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect lipstick for fall! It goes well with an skin color and its not  a dry lipstick. Ive tried other matte lipsticks and when it dries it makes my lips feel dry and cracked! Not this lipstick! Definitely going to buy more!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many long wear lipsticks and stains and this is by far the best one! The color is beautiful and I highly recommend it for anyone like me who doesn&#x27;t like constantly reapplying lip products throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Just as i expected. Its cheaper than when i bought @limecrime when i needed more than two velvetines at a time</li>
            <li> Very beuatifull colour it is the shade i always want thanks.</li>
            <li> Be aware it old cost $20 on the official website</li>
            <li> The colour is very strong and dynamic. But after taken it for long hours, it seems like a bloody mood... Just for 4-5 hours. But it&#x27;s better than other products! I&#x27;m from Germany; the shipping time was earlier and i&#x27;m very pleased to received this lipi.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get this product here!!!! Go to the lime crime website and they have all the colors for $20 not $30</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It goes on so evenly and stays on for hours. I will be buying this in more colors!</li>
            <li> Love the color, very true to color. Did not dry my lips. Sticky but if you allow to dry stays on all night.</li>
            <li> No words! I love this line!</li>
            <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t wait to order other colors.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and stay I can eat and drink</li>
            <li> Love it how It looks need more</li>
            <li> Just got the lime crime velvetines and I love the color and how it&#x27;s so long lasting it&#x27;s everything I wanted it to be and more. I have always bought my lime crime products through amazone and I have never had any issue with them before. But this time when I open my velvetine it had look like someone had open it already, it look messy around the lid and applicator. I probably just end up keeping it and figure some way to sanitize it to make myself feel better using it.</li>
            <li> I have all of the colors and they are all amazing!</li>
            <li> The lip stick is great and last all day, one of the best I have used so far, don&#x27;t mind purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these transfer like nothing you would believe. They are supposed to dry matte but they stay wet for a super long time. They are drying and settle into the fine lines of the lips. The color is gorgeous but the formula is terrible. I would not re-purchase this! Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Favorite lip color. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this color. It&#x27;s a great matte color. Stays on for a long time and doesn&#x27;t smear once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Best formulation for a matte lip. You should use it over previously mosturized lips, as these mat formulas tend to dry out the skin and make them look chapped. Still, this is the best looking mat lip colour I&#x27;ve ever worn, texture and colour wise.</li>
            <li> Best matte lipstick ever!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I have made yet, went to the beach and they stayed on, wear it absolutely everywhere now bought a lot more in different colors, and the mat finish is devine</li>
            <li> I purchased this before the recent limecrime scandal.  I love the color, and the formula is pretty high quality, but given recent events, I would not recommend this product.  There are many other liquid lippies of equal or better quality that you can buy for cheaper or similar prices- I would recomment lasplash cosmetics, anastasia beverly hills, jeffree star, or kat von d.</li>
            <li> One of my favs!! Very pigmented and lon lasting!</li>
            <li> Nice matte color &amp; long lasting, bleeds easily when applying if not careful .</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! I want to buy more!</li>
            <li> The color was a bit darker than I expected, also it seemed to last way less than my other velvetines ( I don&#x27;t know why).</li>
