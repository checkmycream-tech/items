    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The vanilla scent is excellent, one of the best smell saturations in a product in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Also makes an excellent after the beach moisturizer, after your skin has taken a saltwater, sand and sun beating.</li>
            <li>Would make a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li>Best beeswax out there.  </li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>And best of all, I can carry it on an airplane without TSA getting on my case for carrying liquid lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is the best hand cream and protectant ever.  </li>

            <li>Great for softening sirrious flaky skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for friction areas during and after working out,  hiking,  gardening, biking,</li>
            <li>Thought it would be great for traveling to eliminate one liquid in my carry on.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works great.</li>
            <li>This product smells good.</li>
            <li>: The vanilla scent is good - not overpowering but not underwhelming.</li>
            <li>The vanilla bar smells really good (people often will ask me &amp;#34;what are you wearing?  </li>
            <li>After hoarding it all these times I started researching and was delighted to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it feels good on my hands.  </li>

            <li>This scent is just amazing.</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved it and my husband bought me a couple more as gifts.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what makes it so effective</li>
            <li>My package also came with a sample of their vanilla lip butter, which is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>I had seen it over at a friend&#x27;s house and ordered my own as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The smell is great and leaves you with nice smeeling for whole day</li>
            <li>The scent is great, but a little too great - very strong!  </li>
            <li>It smells beautiful and is great for dry skin..</li>
            <li>The tin is a nice way of holding the lotion, can be easily placed in a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li>and why I keep buying more.</li>
            <li>The shape and design on the bar is really cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making sure I start from the bottom of the bar</li>
            <li>Would be better to use overnight.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Needles to say I love these.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion bar.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for three years and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>They itch, hurt, bubble, crack, bleed, crust up --- it&#x27;s a really sexy thing that brings all the boys to the yard.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hands feel INSTANTLY better -- relieves the itching and hurting -- and seems to speed the healing process better than anything else I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled across it in a hospital gift shop and have made sure I never run out of it since then.  </li>
            <li>One last awesome thing about it--</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this and just love love love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the concept of the bar</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as pleased with the product as I thought I would be.  </li>
            <li>At my best estimate, those 3 bars should last me close to 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>A GREAT natural product!!!</li>
            <li>it has a very pleasant and last scent.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This product is very great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Just a wonderful smelling, waxy emollient for dry hands that cant be beat...</li>
            <li>The packaging is super nice, too.</li>
            <li>The vanilla is just barely scented which is perfect and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent and is great for a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Price wise, this is about dollar (or two) more than most of the Lush lotion bars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely light scent and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much richer than lotions and smells soooo good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s two fold; the feel on your skin is better than liquid lotions and the scent is natural and extremely pleasant.  </li>
            <li>love the understated scent of the original honey,  bit haven&#x27;t tried their scented items yet.  </li>
            <li>Best when used at bedtime since product leaves an initial film before it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, very dry skin</li>
            <li>This is the best hand balm...hands down!</li>
            <li>If you enjoy beeswax candles, you&#x27;ll like the smell.  </li>
            <li>give them away as presents and so far, everyone else has loved them too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the moisture properties of the beeswax are excellent and seems to be the only thing that really works for me during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>It simply isn&#x27;t as rich and smooth as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this Lotion, the first was given to me, by a friend 6 Years ago</li>
            <li>but this is a great brand.and I for one will keep patronizing their business as long as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A vanilla Bee Bar was the first I ever bought, and I had to have more to share with friends.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t lost me longer than 4 months, but that&#x27;s definitely more than most Lush bars I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>I thought that this might be a great option when flying, to have lotion in a travel bag without carrying another liquid, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, it is just different from the liquid products.</li>
            <li>I found my Bee Bar several years ago while on my honeymoon and have bought many more since.  </li>
            <li>Good product for cracked fingers and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Because of its richness, however, it does have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel until absorbed,  </li>
            <li>Unlike Lush bars, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue that sits on top of my skin for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to pay for something that actually works for a change.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel and very pretty packaging, but the smell is a little bit more plastic-y than I had hoped - not bad, just not quite the natural beeswax and vanilla</li>
            <li>Smell heavenly with healthy good for you natural ingredients that do not hurt my very dry and fickle insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the silky feeling left on the skin when using the product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It feels pretty waxy.</li>
            <li>Love the solid lotion bars from Honey house.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this vanilla bee bar made by Honey House since 2004 when I was only able to find it in one boutique is west Seattle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite greasy when you first put it on, but it will soak in eventually.  </li>
            <li>If you really like waxy products, this is for you!</li>
            <li>I hate that greasy sticky feeling that most lotions leave on my skin, but the Bee Bar soaks in very quickly and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I love this for my dry heels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure heaven.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product has really been a blessing for him and me.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a nature center and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>They really moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>it makes a fantastic present and hostess gift.  </li>
            <li>Rather than being smooth and gliding on, it left a sticky coating all over my hands.</li>
            <li>It has very yummy smell but</li>
            <li>makes applying it very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Got here fast, and was as described.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought it initially, but now it will be my primary hand moisturizer product, even when I&#x27;m not traveling.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>If I knew of a retail store around my area that sold these products I would definitely buy them more often than Lush lotion bars.</li>
            <li>I prefer the almond oil yet will still be buying this year after year because it&#x27;s still 1000x better than any other lotion on the market</li>
            <li>The Bee Bar is harder to apply, it doesn&#x27;t melt as easily in your hands or on your skin.</li>
            <li>I now have my third order of Bee Bar and a number of un-used tubes of Super Glue.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it doesn&#x27;t get too greasy like some of the other solid lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It takes a while getting used to rubbing a solid lotion on, but it won&#x27;t take long and you will love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lotion.</li>
            <li>If you set it out in the sun it softens up, but the bees wax content is just too high to use it as intended at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the other scents you have, but the vanilla is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Cannot use perfumes in my professions, but this is enough of a scent to make you feel pretty!</li>
            <li>The bar was too hard to be effective.</li>
            <li>I own a lot, and I do mean a lot, of lotions.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>We have shared this product with friends, including my doctor, who, up until using this product, resorted to Super Gluing the cracks in his hands closed.</li>
            <li>It smelled old, moldy and like very old cigar butts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Size is bit underwhelming, hard to apply, would probably be better used at night before bed.</li>
            <li>He noticed the rash immediately started to clear up.  </li>
            <li>It continued to clear the areas up that he had not had anything work before, even prescription meds.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and leaves skin feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li>Lush tends to have an overpowering scent on their lotion bars.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like an old ashtray - I could not even imagine walking around all day smelling like this.  </li>
            <li>product arrived early and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just got a bad bar given all the reviews praising the scent, but I can tell you there was absolutely nothing vanilla, natural or pleasant about the scent of this bar.  </li>
            <li>I am not ever close to running out of my first order, however, this product works so well that I wanted to ensure that I had enough on hand to last another year.  </li>
            <li>would only recommend this for very dry skin, though, as it IS very rich and may be a little too much for oily</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this solid lotion bar.  </li>
            <li>When the bar is large it is a bit awkward to use, but it is great for rough knees, elbows, feet and hands.</li>
            <li>I will admit that this moisturizer may be too heavy for many people, but for those of us with really dry skin</li>
            <li>Really helps moisturize my dry hands.  </li>
            <li>The only lotion bars I&#x27;ve ever used were from Lush, so I&#x27;m going to compare the Bee Bar to that</li>
            <li>I gave them to loved them as well--even my father who was very difficult to shop for.</li>
            <li>This is the first solid moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used, so I found it a bit odd initially.  </li>

            <li> Unlike Lush bars, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue that sits on top of my skin for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to pay for something that actually works for a change.</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel and very pretty packaging, but the smell is a little bit more plastic-y than I had hoped - not bad, just not quite the natural beeswax and vanilla</li>
            <li> Smell heavenly with healthy good for you natural ingredients that do not hurt my very dry and fickle insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feeling left on the skin when using the product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It feels pretty waxy.</li>
            <li> Love the solid lotion bars from Honey house.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vanilla bee bar made by Honey House since 2004 when I was only able to find it in one boutique is west Seattle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite greasy when you first put it on, but it will soak in eventually.  </li>
            <li> If you really like waxy products, this is for you!</li>
            <li> I hate that greasy sticky feeling that most lotions leave on my skin, but the Bee Bar soaks in very quickly and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I love this for my dry heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure heaven.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product has really been a blessing for him and me.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a nature center and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> They really moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> it makes a fantastic present and hostess gift.  </li>
            <li> Rather than being smooth and gliding on, it left a sticky coating all over my hands.</li>
            <li> It has very yummy smell but</li>
            <li> makes applying it very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Got here fast, and was as described.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought it initially, but now it will be my primary hand moisturizer product, even when I&#x27;m not traveling.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> If I knew of a retail store around my area that sold these products I would definitely buy them more often than Lush lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I prefer the almond oil yet will still be buying this year after year because it&#x27;s still 1000x better than any other lotion on the market</li>
            <li> The Bee Bar is harder to apply, it doesn&#x27;t melt as easily in your hands or on your skin.</li>
            <li> I now have my third order of Bee Bar and a number of un-used tubes of Super Glue.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it doesn&#x27;t get too greasy like some of the other solid lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It takes a while getting used to rubbing a solid lotion on, but it won&#x27;t take long and you will love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion.</li>
            <li> If you set it out in the sun it softens up, but the bees wax content is just too high to use it as intended at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other scents you have, but the vanilla is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use perfumes in my professions, but this is enough of a scent to make you feel pretty!</li>
            <li> The bar was too hard to be effective.</li>
            <li> I own a lot, and I do mean a lot, of lotions.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> We have shared this product with friends, including my doctor, who, up until using this product, resorted to Super Gluing the cracks in his hands closed.</li>
            <li> It smelled old, moldy and like very old cigar butts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Size is bit underwhelming, hard to apply, would probably be better used at night before bed.</li>
            <li> He noticed the rash immediately started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> It continued to clear the areas up that he had not had anything work before, even prescription meds.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and leaves skin feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li> Lush tends to have an overpowering scent on their lotion bars.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like an old ashtray - I could not even imagine walking around all day smelling like this.  </li>
            <li> product arrived early and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just got a bad bar given all the reviews praising the scent, but I can tell you there was absolutely nothing vanilla, natural or pleasant about the scent of this bar.  </li>
            <li> I am not ever close to running out of my first order, however, this product works so well that I wanted to ensure that I had enough on hand to last another year.  </li>
            <li> would only recommend this for very dry skin, though, as it IS very rich and may be a little too much for oily</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this solid lotion bar.  </li>
            <li> When the bar is large it is a bit awkward to use, but it is great for rough knees, elbows, feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I will admit that this moisturizer may be too heavy for many people, but for those of us with really dry skin</li>
            <li> Really helps moisturize my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> The only lotion bars I&#x27;ve ever used were from Lush, so I&#x27;m going to compare the Bee Bar to that</li>
            <li> I gave them to loved them as well--even my father who was very difficult to shop for.</li>
            <li> This is the first solid moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used, so I found it a bit odd initially.  </li>
            <li> It is mild, and non irritating, but long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It is also very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> My feet were all dry with some deep creases when my foot doctor recommended this to me.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hands often at work and is a problem all year long.  </li>
            <li> Have spent too many winters in the upper midwest with dry and cracked skin - this stuff is amazing and if used regularly, won&#x27;t have grotesque hands that are flaky and bloody.  </li>
            <li> I rub it between my hand a little to warm it on cold days and then glide it all over, even my face.</li>
            <li> It has somewhat of a dry waxy feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell is decadent, a mix between subtle vanilla and honey, very calming and sort of an \\</li>
            <li> It can be used on dry skin anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion bar all the time now and it has helped a lot with my dry hands this winter.</li>
            <li> Having dry hands I have tried a lot of lotions and this one is a pass.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot &amp; therefore, they become dry.  </li>
            <li> Have dry hands</li>
            <li> If you are struggling with dry hands, throw out all of the chemical infused products you are using and buy these bars.  </li>
            <li> Very waxy feeling left behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is since the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> Even in the deep of winter it makes my skin feel so soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit to moisten my hands when my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it, definitely every winter and have bought it for friends whose hands were a mess.</li>
            <li> My hands get VERY dry and will crack and bleed due to the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands dozens of times a day due to my occupation and this product is one of the only things that calms them down in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> :  The lotion bar itself was a little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> My main complaint was the slight vanilla scent is overpowered by the smell of beeswax.  </li>
            <li> I have tried approximately one million kinds of lotions (and prescription steroid creams as well) and really nothing does diddly squat for me when the eczema pops up.  </li>
            <li> My package also came in a few days earlier than expected (4 business days vs. a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and lasts a long time on your hands, even after a few washings!</li>
            <li> It is subtle, yet enough.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used every day and whittled down to less than half within a few weeks).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems a little pricey, I know</li>
            <li> maybe a little too think when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little under 2.5 inches wide and a little under an inch thick.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and bought the small ones as stocking stuffers for my family.</li>
            <li> I have people stop me all the time and ask what perfume I wear, and I show them (the small can I carry in my purse).</li>
            <li> like but somewhat hard to apply</li>
            <li> Alas, I don&#x27;t and was hoping for vanilla.</li>
            <li> There is a waxy coat on my skin that it leaves behind, but my skin absorbs it well.</li>
            <li> I hate change as you may have noticed from my dedication to the same product year after year.</li>
            <li> Weird scent as well.</li>
            <li> Bar is difficult to maneuver over knuckles and is somewhat greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked, pathetic hands, you HAVE to try this!</li>
            <li> The stickiness does fade after a few minutes, but until then it is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product smells good. The product is hydrating , capture moisture when used after the bath. This product is very great for dry skin. The smell is great and leaves you with nice smeeling for whole day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of solid lotion, but this was not one of my favorites.  It simply isn&#x27;t as rich and smooth as I had hoped.  It has somewhat of a dry waxy feel.  My main complaint was the slight vanilla scent is overpowered by the smell of beeswax.  If you enjoy beeswax candles, you&#x27;ll like the smell.  Alas, I don&#x27;t and was hoping for vanilla.</li>
            <li> like but somewhat hard to apply</li>
            <li> Excellent bar and a lovely scent! Lasts a long time. Perfect before bed after a nice hot bath. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Just a wonderful smelling, waxy emollient for dry hands that cant be beat...</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is excellent, one of the best smell saturations in a product in my opinion.  This is the first solid moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used, so I found it a bit odd initially.  It does a good job, it is just different from the liquid products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Lotion, the first was given to me, by a friend 6 Years ago and I have kept on buying it ever since. I have very fair, very dry skin and this Lotion is a dream. Even in the deep of winter it makes my skin feel so soft and subtle. I rub it between my hand a little to warm it on cold days and then glide it all over, even my face. The smell is decadent, a mix between subtle vanilla and honey, very calming and sort of an \\&quot; I&#x27;m home\\&quot; kind of scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this for very dry skin, though, as it IS very rich and may be a little too much for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little pricey, I know but even with daily use one bar lasts me about 3-4 months, I also carry one in my purse I use as hand lotion.Saw some people say it melted in heat, but I used to have one in the glovebox and it never melted. Also makes an excellent after the beach moisturizer, after your skin has taken a saltwater, sand and sun beating. It takes a while getting used to rubbing a solid lotion on, but it won&#x27;t take long and you will love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;I give them away as presents and so far, everyone else has loved them too.&lt;br /&gt;I did find them a lot cheaper at [...], sorry to say, as much as I love Amazon,  they are 8.99 there for the big ones.</li>
            <li> Great product.  We can not be without this product now.  My husband has suffered for years with a rash that nothing cleared it up.  I was given this product as a present.  I loved it and my husband bought me a couple more as gifts.  One scent did not suit me, so he started using it.  He noticed the rash immediately started to clear up.  It continued to clear the areas up that he had not had anything work before, even prescription meds. I love the silky feeling left on the skin when using the product.  I have to wash my hands often at work and is a problem all year long.  This product has really been a blessing for him and me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a local store in my area several months ago. It has a very nice scent and is great for a heavy moisturizer. My hands get VERY dry and will crack and bleed due to the dry winter air. If I put this on every night I don&#x27;t have that problem.  I will admit that this moisturizer may be too heavy for many people, but for those of us with really dry skin it is a godsend.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for me as a gift. It arrived in 2 days and did NOT melt, which is a surprise in our Arizona summer temperatures! Excellent product, smells and feels great on my hands. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am a returning customer of Honey House and have been using Bee Bar for several years now.  It&#x27;s much richer than lotions and smells soooo good.  Because of its richness, however, it does have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel until absorbed,  But that&#x27;s what makes it so effective and why I keep buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a nature center and am so glad I did. I own a lot, and I do mean a lot, of lotions. This is the only solid lotion I have ever used. I like that I can carry it in my bag or luggage and know it won&#x27;t spill. When the bar is large it is a bit awkward to use, but it is great for rough knees, elbows, feet and hands.</li>
            <li> The only lotion bars I&#x27;ve ever used were from Lush, so I&#x27;m going to compare the Bee Bar to that brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The lotion bar itself was a little smaller than expected. It&#x27;s a little under 2.5 inches wide and a little under an inch thick. The Bee Bar is harder to apply, it doesn&#x27;t melt as easily in your hands or on your skin. It feels pretty waxy. Price wise, this is about dollar (or two) more than most of the Lush lotion bars. Probably won&#x27;t lost me longer than 4 months, but that&#x27;s definitely more than most Lush bars I&#x27;ve bought (I&#x27;ve used every day and whittled down to less than half within a few weeks). Some sticky residue on my fingers hand palms, however, they don&#x27;t leave a greasy trail when I touch my phone/other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The vanilla scent is good - not overpowering but not underwhelming. It gives just a hint of vanilla perfume when used. Lush tends to have an overpowering scent on their lotion bars. The tin is a nice way of holding the lotion, can be easily placed in a purse or backpack. The shape and design on the bar is really cute. I&#x27;m making sure I start from the bottom of the bar so I don&#x27;t ruin the bee mold! Unlike Lush bars, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue that sits on top of my skin for a while. There is a waxy coat on my skin that it leaves behind, but my skin absorbs it well. Would be better to use overnight. My package also came with a sample of their vanilla lip butter, which is a nice addition. My package also came in a few days earlier than expected (4 business days vs. a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Size is bit underwhelming, hard to apply, would probably be better used at night before bed. But scent and moisturizing properties win me over. Would make a wonderful gift. If I knew of a retail store around my area that sold these products I would definitely buy them more often than Lush lotion bars. I would buy it again and try the &amp;#34;Sweet Honey&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Love the solid lotion bars from Honey house.  They really moisturize your skin.  I wash my hands dozens of times a day due to my occupation and this product is one of the only things that calms them down in the winter time.  It can be used on dry skin anywhere.  It is mild, and non irritating, but long lasting.  I love the scent.  It is subtle, yet enough.  Cannot use perfumes in my professions, but this is enough of a scent to make you feel pretty!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a gift, but may have to order another one just for me.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff speaks for its self</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more! Great for softening sirrious flaky skin</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like an old ashtray - I could not even imagine walking around all day smelling like this.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe I just got a bad bar given all the reviews praising the scent, but I can tell you there was absolutely nothing vanilla, natural or pleasant about the scent of this bar.  It smelled old, moldy and like very old cigar butts.  Pee-yew!</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel and very pretty packaging, but the smell is a little bit more plastic-y than I had hoped - not bad, just not quite the natural beeswax and vanilla I was looking for. I&#x27;m not sure why this is since the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vanilla bee bar made by Honey House since 2004 when I was only able to find it in one boutique is west Seattle. I drove to get one a month forever until I could purchase online. That&#x27;s 12 a year for well over a decade. Needles to say I love these. They&#x27;re a can&#x27;t live without and I&#x27;ve gotten dozens of relatives coworkers &amp; friends hooked too. Smell heavenly with healthy good for you natural ingredients that do not hurt my very dry and fickle insanely sensitive skin. These have been a godsend. Now a few months back they changed their formula substituting the expensive &amp; fickle almond oil for the cheaper yet still natural &amp; effective coconut oil. I hate change as you may have noticed from my dedication to the same product year after year. I prefer the almond oil yet will still be buying this year after year because it&#x27;s still 1000x better than any other lotion on the market</li>
            <li> Best beeswax out there.  The vanilla is just barely scented which is perfect and not too sweet.  It&#x27;s a lovely light scent and the moisture properties of the beeswax are excellent and seems to be the only thing that really works for me during the winter months.  It is also very long lasting.  I&#x27;ve used mine going on three years now.  it makes a fantastic present and hostess gift.  I always keep a couple extra on hand.  The packaging is super nice, too.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion bar. I had seen it over at a friend&#x27;s house and ordered my own as soon as I got home. I use this lotion bar all the time now and it has helped a lot with my dry hands this winter. It smells great, and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it doesn&#x27;t get too greasy like some of the other solid lotions that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this bar! It smells amazing and works great. Plan to buy this again and use as gifts!</li>
            <li> This is my second multiples order.  I have been using this product for three years and LOVE it.  Please do not quit  offering it.  Judith</li>
            <li> as a nurse, I have had severe eczema on my hands for years.  They itch, hurt, bubble, crack, bleed, crust up --- it&#x27;s a really sexy thing that brings all the boys to the yard.  I have tried approximately one million kinds of lotions (and prescription steroid creams as well) and really nothing does diddly squat for me when the eczema pops up.  This stuff makes my hands feel INSTANTLY better -- relieves the itching and hurting -- and seems to speed the healing process better than anything else I have ever found.  I stumbled across it in a hospital gift shop and have made sure I never run out of it since then.  The vanilla bar smells really good (people often will ask me &amp;#34;what are you wearing?  it smells fantastic!&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s quite greasy when you first put it on, but it will soak in eventually.  One last awesome thing about it-- you can take it through the airport security without having it count as one of your liquids-- since it is solid.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this and just love love love it. It&#x27;s also great for friction areas during and after working out,  hiking,  gardening, biking, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;I love the understated scent of the original honey,  bit haven&#x27;t tried their scented items yet.  They may seem overpriced,  and maybe they are,  but this is a great brand.and I for one will keep patronizing their business as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion. Thought it would be great for traveling to eliminate one liquid in my carry on. Having dry hands I have tried a lot of lotions and this one is a pass. Very waxy feeling left behind. I worked to rub it in and it still left my hands oily. Weird scent as well.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked, pathetic hands, you HAVE to try this! I use it, definitely every winter and have bought it for friends whose hands were a mess. A GREAT natural product!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff! Smells heavenly and lasts a long time on your hands, even after a few washings! 🌼🐝</li>
            <li> I bought this on a suggestion from my friend who is a ER nurse. She swears by this stuff based on how much she washes her hands everyday. Bee Bar worked immediately! I use it everyday and bought the small ones as stocking stuffers for my family.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Have spent too many winters in the upper midwest with dry and cracked skin - this stuff is amazing and if used regularly, won&#x27;t have grotesque hands that are flaky and bloody.  Smells wonderful, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot by plane and I its annoying when I cant take my lotions because they are liquid, this is a great solution to that. Very creamy and leaves skin feeling extra soft.</li>
            <li> I thought that this might be a great option when flying, to have lotion in a travel bag without carrying another liquid, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Rather than being smooth and gliding on, it left a sticky coating all over my hands. The stickiness does fade after a few minutes, but until then it is awful. I won&#x27;t be using this.</li>
            <li> It has very yummy smell but maybe a little too think when you put it on.  I only used it once and it has sat in my vanity since.  If you really like waxy products, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand balm...hands down!</li>
            <li> We have shared this product with friends, including my doctor, who, up until using this product, resorted to Super Gluing the cracks in his hands closed. I followed his advice until trying your product. I now have my third order of Bee Bar and a number of un-used tubes of Super Glue.</li>
            <li> Soothing.  Love the smell and the concept of the bar makes applying it very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Got here fast, and was as described. My wife loves it. WIll be back in the future for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
            <li> I love this for my dry heels. Put it on then put on spa socks and let it soak in.... It&#x27;s pure heaven.</li>
            <li> My feet were all dry with some deep creases when my foot doctor recommended this to me.  I put it on after a shower, or when I think about it, and it lasts for several days without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> Really helps moisturize my dry hands.  Nice smell too.  Can pack in my carry-on luggage when traveling.  Will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells nice, and it feels good on my hands.  I only need a little bit to moisten my hands when my skin is dry.  And best of all, I can carry it on an airplane without TSA getting on my case for carrying liquid lotion.  That&#x27;s why I bought it initially, but now it will be my primary hand moisturizer product, even when I&#x27;m not traveling.</li>
            <li> This bee bar is the Bomb! it has a very pleasant and last scent. It really keeps your skin hydrated. I would buy it over and over again. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought a container of this five years ago in Alaska at the Taku Wilderness Lodge girl store.  It is the best hand cream and protectant ever.  After hoarding it all these times I started researching and was delighted to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived early and was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as pleased with the product as I thought I would be.  I wash my hands a lot &amp; therefore, they become dry.  Bar is difficult to maneuver over knuckles and is somewhat greasy.  The scent is great, but a little too great - very strong!  It is not the panacea I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> The bar was too hard to be effective. If you set it out in the sun it softens up, but the bees wax content is just too high to use it as intended at room temperature.</li>
            <li> These are the best thing ever! Finally found something that actually works!  Have dry hands and I wash them a lot.  This bar is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am not ever close to running out of my first order, however, this product works so well that I wanted to ensure that I had enough on hand to last another year.  I have 3 bars and use them multiple times a day.  At my best estimate, those 3 bars should last me close to 2 years.  If you are struggling with dry hands, throw out all of the chemical infused products you are using and buy these bars.  The results have been close to miraculous.  It&#x27;s nice to pay for something that actually works for a change.</li>
            <li> A vanilla Bee Bar was the first I ever bought, and I had to have more to share with friends.</li>
            <li> Good product for cracked fingers and dry skin.  Best when used at bedtime since product leaves an initial film before it is absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this solid lotion bar.  It&#x27;s two fold; the feel on your skin is better than liquid lotions and the scent is natural and extremely pleasant.  I recommend this product for both women AND men.</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful and is great for dry skin..</li>
            <li> I found my Bee Bar several years ago while on my honeymoon and have bought many more since.  I hate that greasy sticky feeling that most lotions leave on my skin, but the Bee Bar soaks in very quickly and leaves my skin feeling great. I also love the scent. I bought these as Christmas gifts and everyone I gave them to loved them as well--even my father who was very difficult to shop for. I use it on my hands, feet and even my chapped lips. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other scents you have, but the vanilla is by far my favorite.  I have people stop me all the time and ask what perfume I wear, and I show them (the small can I carry in my purse).</li>
