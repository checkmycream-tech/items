            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that Wahl continues to make good barbering products.</li>
            <li>I get best results by washing my face before and after shaving, and I don&#x27;t use this razor on more than a day&#x27;s beard growth, as it is designed to shave stubble, not hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best and most convenient shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good price great product</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors however this one is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This razor provides a  nice smooth,very close shave, no bumps no worries!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he is loving it!</li>
            <li>Nice close shave!</li>
            <li>Best shaver in the market for years this been in the top seller&#x27;s by barber shop</li>
            <li>nice close shave!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how it works and honestly don&#x27;t care!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that i achieved a razor shave with this electric shaver, with no bumps!</li>
            <li>I have stubborn bristle-like neck hair that refuses the best efforts of most shavers.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s easy to hold and gives him the best shave of his life!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to charge and compact for traveling, awesome product.</li>
            <li>I strongly consider watching youtube videos on how to use this but when used correctly it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you need to spend a ton of money on a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works good beter them the Spencers ones.</li>
            <li>The price was a good value.</li>
            <li>It is a good finisher.</li>
            <li>This shaver is good for everything but your face.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>I tried this one a year ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>But the product was so good I had to have another one.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.  </li>
            <li>, I forgot they don&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a good hand razor.  </li>
            <li>Product does not do a good job shaving it is easier and quicker to use a razor</li>
            <li>and you are good for another year or so.</li>
            <li>That is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is a good value though.</li>
            <li>I could not get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>It work great nice close shave in 3 - 5 mins.</li>
            <li>good skin shaving machine</li>
            <li>it shave me good except the neck area.</li>
            <li>or so I began to get some really good results,and now plan to keep</li>
            <li>Does good job shaving.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day it is good but it will not shave you if you skip a day  </li>
            <li>You need the trimmer, shaver doesn&#x27;t do good job on sideburns.</li>
            <li>All in all it seems to be a good product for my needs, and</li>
            <li>Whilst thIs shaver does a good job, there is still room for improvement.</li>
            <li>I always read that no electric razor would be as good as razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Well, this one is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>and when it comes to this shaver my clients have LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>and my face felt good.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this until it broke</li>
            <li>He is a barber and loved it.</li>
            <li>He definitely loved that it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Good product, it still does not remove my hair the way that I thought it was going to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Another good wahl product.</li>
            <li>I tried using it on my head but either I didn&#x27;t have the patience to do a good job</li>
            <li>Good razer delivered on time</li>
            <li>Good Luck.  </li>
            <li>and he said wahl is good choice and when i asked why he told me thats a brand that barbers trust.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver, holds a good charge, no need to recharge as often.</li>
            <li>Car exceeded my expectations, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves GREAT but is kind of loud.&lt;br /&gt;😊</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine told me about this product</li>
            <li>Experience was good however the product was not what I thought.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about it is that it is portable</li>
            <li>If expectations are set accordingly, it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>does a good job.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
            <li>Good Performing Shaver in my opinion</li>
            <li>Once again i cant stress how good of a product this is.</li>
            <li>Works good.  </li>
            <li>It worked good for a month.</li>
            <li>Good tool use it at work for balding dudes that can&#x27;t take a blade</li>
            <li>Still using with good results</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Everything I heard is Absolutely true the 5 star shaver shaper is a good product and I rate it (5 STARS!!!)</li>
            <li>As I have said before I would try to talk my best friend into useing this razor as I have had several and it is the best of the group.</li>

            <li>5-star Series Deluxe Rechargeable Shaver Shaper&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it, works so good</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to give me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver seemed nice</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair as well.</li>
            <li>Still nice for a barber though.</li>
            <li>Its not a problem if you have a nice \\&quot;shape up\\&quot; trimmer tho.</li>
            <li>Neat, effective and efficient</li>
            <li>Nice product, Wahl.</li>
            <li>I have to use a razor there which kind of defeats the purpose of using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>i honestly believed that nothing would work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, just what the doctor ordered, awesome shaver, buy one today, its a home run, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li>Did not shave as close as I would of liked.  </li>
            <li>but I find it does a good job on my neck if I don&#x27;t go more than a day between uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is good because for the most part your skin doesn&#x27;t make contact with the cutter bar, that&#x27;s where the foil comes into play.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy when he&#x27;s driving over the road.</li>
            <li>he loves it and is loving the difference in his skin when he uses it.</li>
            <li>You may try it if you are looking for a nice looking shaver.</li>
            <li>It has surpassed another shaver, and that one is also a popular brand, which I no longer use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Impressed very close shave.</li>
            <li>Took the wrapper off and turn it own without the charger and started shaving...............</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and Shaves nice and close</li>
            <li>nice shaver.</li>
            <li>I have had my head and beard exposed to this tool by my barber and loved the results then and now that I own one, I remain in love with the tool.</li>
            <li>When it worked it was very strong and gave an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding performance, close and clean shave, good product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, great gift!</li>
            <li>I really love the super close shave with no bumps or irritation!!!</li>
            <li>precisely what it&#x27;s meant to, and cuts remarkably close.</li>
            <li>MORE IMPORTANT is the GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I got from Wahl.</li>
            <li>A good close shaver - easy to use, charge, portable...</li>
            <li>does a great job quickly and no razor bumps</li>
            <li>The battery life is not that great but adequate.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and could not tolerate using it on his face but uses it on his head and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to</li>
            <li>Very easy to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Very strong motor.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle and</li>
            <li>This very good to use when you want to get really close.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be good to prevent ingrown hairs and help keep bikini area smooth like the reviews stated, but no go.</li>
            <li>This is the best professional shaver you can buy.  </li>
            <li>This is the very best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>He explained to me that it perfumed well and did an excellent job leaving his face as soft as the skin on your arm or hand.</li>
            <li>But from a professional standpoint, the power is awesome.</li>
            <li>I wished instructions guided me better on how to effectively use the product.  </li>
            <li>This thing is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Best experience I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver by far.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional Shaver is excellent!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Wahl Professional 8061.</li>
            <li>This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li>Really surprised  because I thought they are had an excellent shave</li>
            <li>By far the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li>By far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>this is the most amazing shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It will not but it is a good supplementary shaver and will keep the head smooth.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have tried to shave off these curly hairs before the become ingrown.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>this is your best bet by far.</li>
            <li>, I am hispanic with very fine hair and it also did not do anything...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping , I bought a five star wahl and is good with a close shave!</li>
            <li>I ordered the shaver and have been using it for my head and beard, it is wonderful ,smooth and fast no nicks or rash</li>
            <li>We thought that by buying this machine he would be able to get rid of his razors, but he still needs them because the machine won&#x27;t give him a nice finish, making it more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; colored shaver doesn&#x27;t even have a side burn trimmer, makes rattling noises, and doesn&#x27;t provide a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver works perfect for men of color who are wanting a very close, bump free shave.</li>
            <li>First couple of use were great but after that</li>
            <li>It worked great the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li>This is great, but the foils came apart the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li>He was pretty happy with the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li>Good quality not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Very light and portable!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Just do as it says -- use a VERY light touch (which keeps your face from getting irritated)</li>
            <li>Once you get use to the shaver it leaves your face very smooth.</li>
            <li>and my first use was great better than a disposable razor to me</li>
            <li>dang it works great, my head is clean and smooth after 7-8 minutes,  Works better if your hair is</li>
            <li>Good product and quick shipping, no issues at all.</li>
            <li>shaves well, nice size , easy to handle.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s elderly and this was so easy for him to use on his own</li>
            <li>When used in tandem with the great classic Andis T-Outliner you&#x27;ll be the smoothest guy at the party!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a defective unit bot sure.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>You can buy a $20 Remington from Walmart and it will give a better shave.</li>
            <li>He gets a close shave with it, almost as close as with a safety razor, so he is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This shaver worked okay for about a month.  </li>
            <li>He uses it to shave his face mostly.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Noisy as all hell :-)</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Glad I noticed</li>
            <li>Probably save me 30 minutes or more over that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li>My son was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl Shavers for many years and never had a problem.</li>
            <li>No stubble! :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love my bald fader.</li>
            <li>This shaver gets closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and has more power.</li>
            <li>This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased that one for about $20 more in a retail beauty store.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelcos most of my life.</li>
            <li>But I like this razor better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited two weeks and instead of using this item, I&#x27;ve reverted to Magic Power.  </li>
            <li>This is the most commonsense shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>i have tried many electric razors before.</li>
            <li>many of them seemed to yank out the hair moreso than cut it.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and I have the Braun which I thought was a close shave</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>You will love it too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let the battery fully discharge before recharging, to prolong battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a razor because you don&#x27;t need shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Use in my barber shop and love it</li>
            <li>I have only shaved with it twice, but it was the best shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li>This actually works best on thicker hair, but also gets the thinner hair.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not use it on my beard.</li>
            <li>Magic Shaver is the ticket.</li>
            <li>Beware of this cheap product!</li>
            <li>Oh, I started using the BIC Soleil on my head and as you can guess as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I am going to give it one more try.</li>
            <li>have had many over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend just tapping the top part when cleaning it, dont brush it or you might break it.</li>
            <li>Most people would probably not even notice it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried this shaver and it was ok.</li>
            <li>Please be sure that the ones that he uses on his clients work.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li>Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash/burn or bumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Remington Electric Razor for years and this one is much better.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>It does and excellent job if you shave daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so much better than the hundreds of bumps I used to get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok trimmer still get bumps here and there</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Better that a blade....</li>
            <li>The foil top started to rip after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>He seems to like it alot and is glad that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Works great and shaves very close.</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple days I dont even notice it touching me when I shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, great unit!</li>
            <li>I love this and it will go with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li>I love how it works.</li>
            <li>so i tried one more despearte attempt at this shaver.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper and does a better job clearing my undergrowth.</li>
            <li>can I say Top of the line shaver.</li>
            <li>If you let your hair go more than a couple days between cuts, you might as well not even pull it out of the drawer.</li>
            <li>I have been using a safety razor for many, many years, except after wilderness trips on which I couldn&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several razors, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>One day my barber pulled out the shaver and the love affair with this razor</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It came with three different heads, to provide the type of shave that worked best for you.  </li>
            <li>Youre better of with a gillette mach 5</li>
            <li>foils that you see on the top are there to protect your face.</li>
            <li>Once I read to reverse and go and upward strokes, I was greatly satisfied with the close shave.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My son love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, Ive had it for a month and the top metal thing frayed and broke easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth shaves!</li>
            <li>You should be able to see the pictures I uploaded to see the condition of my face.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver,  I bought</li>
            <li>You are going to love shaving after using Wahl shaver shaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, OK.</li>
            <li>I love this equipment.</li>
            <li>Choose another product and make sure you have a return policy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no picnic using this shaver over using razor blades, but I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s more docile on one&#x27;s face than a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember to moisturize afterwards! :)</li>
            <li>Love it, better priced than going to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>see many barbers and beauty salons use this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Had hoped for better shave.  </li>
            <li>Okay for quickie</li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x60;ll revert to the razor when I want a better shave.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]].  </li>
            <li>I always either wash my face or take a shower after I shave and then apply the Bump Rescue by Magic</li>
            <li>G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]].    </li>
            <li>Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for travelling and the battery holds about a week with daily use.</li>
            <li>work great and fast...</li>
            <li>Glad I got this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is wireless.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for a couple months, but have not been able to use it longer than a week at a time without having to replace the foil which keeps tearing and scratching my head up.</li>
            <li>But the foil on top also ripped apart one day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Schick Hydro 5 since then and love it.</li>
            <li>Anything Wahl I will be glad to avoid and inform friends and relatives to avoid also.</li>
            <li>Worked well, just needs to cut more than stubble.</li>
            <li>Iam sure its the blade.</li>
            <li>Its Recommended by barbers and the best part it actually gives a CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE!</li>
            <li>Although WAHL could replace it or fix it, I was able to fix it myself by opening it up.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this shaver</li>
            <li>and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver, but still can&#x27;nt figure out how to use the cleaner.</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave with great battery and electric power.  </li>
            <li>Buy it and be glad.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied after using this product for a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hair removal powders which actually provided the best results</li>
            <li>I must say that it looks a lot better</li>
            <li>or I have too many nooks and crannies on my scalp because there were too many patches of hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t do more to promote the product.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love the way his face feels.</li>
            <li>This shaver will leave you babyface smooth!</li>
            <li>I love Wahl shavers and this one produces a great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My husband has never been really satisfied with any shavers but this.</li>
            <li>they love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I will probably get more items from Wahl.</li>
            <li>Wish I stockpiled more of those.</li>
            <li>and I love that he loves the shaver.</li>
            <li>Delivered promptly, looks, works, and operates as advertised, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I had it used on me when I was driving a semi several years ago and was impressed and now that I found it and have it</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>but without the razor bumps :-)</li>
            <li>your bald, you will love it</li>
            <li>just wanted to ssay that i&#x27;m glad i purchased this shaver.</li>
            <li>Priced OK.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Braun for many years and never had this problem.</li>
            <li>but he paid about 30 dollars more than I.</li>
            <li>It cuts most of my beard, but undoubtedly there will always be some remaining hairs.  </li>
            <li>(I paid $50 for this and it is much better than the $200 Braun).</li>
            <li>I have so many electric razors and money invested</li>
            <li>I have used and worn out many electric shavers over the years and was looking for one that would be durable, reasonably priced and of course, give me a great shave, so enter Wahl.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used ones that were about 200+ dollars more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it have been using wahl products for over 20 years</li>
            <li>This is a great machine, powerful and precise.</li>
            <li>Husband is pleased with results.</li>
            <li>The close shave more than makes up for that.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my barber does something to make it work better, but out of the box, I did not care for this shaver and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I had for several years and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver a must have !</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say than just don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I brought one because they all were pleased with it.</li>
            <li>a good smooth, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>So far so good !</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s got my clean shaven, liked it</li>
            <li>I cut and clean my own hair now.</li>
            <li>It gives him a nice clean shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li>the price is pretty good also.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this shaver and it did what it promoted.</li>
            <li>None made today are as good as the first Sunbeam that got me started using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Could do a better job shaving, but not bad!</li>
            <li>Shaver is still going Strong, I think I&#x27;m more dependent on it now than before.</li>
            <li>love it just the foil is easy to damage</li>
            <li>I’ve used both the Close and Super Close combs and liked them both.</li>
            <li>Shaver is quite good product, it works good but does not shave close enough.</li>
            <li>much more powerful than a Braun 3 series which I also own.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE it .. if you are like me and want to keep you head or face smooth</li>
            <li>Close and clean shave!</li>
            <li>Then used the shaver to clean everything up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine but the top is keeping break</li>
            <li>, It was amazing ,smooth and clean .When</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best product for a very, very close shave and yet no razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, gets a really close shave and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>It works great with sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>They also said the shaver is still available, too, though they sell more often to barber shops with this product than to end users.  </li>
            <li>So after stumbling upon this Wahl bump free shaver I was somewhat optimistic that maybe I&#x27;ll finally be able to get</li>
            <li>perfect no shaving bumps use this before wet shaving</li>
            <li>is agreat product, for many years I wore a light beard because shaving close resulted in razor bumps: even with that stinky paste.</li>
            <li>Powerful, efficient and effective.</li>
            <li>Loved this electric razor so much I bought one for my Father who loves it as well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it much maybe 10 times doesn&#x27;t cut Aa good Aa</li>
            <li>, this is a great shaver which is easy on your sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Surely that omission should have been given in the description, so I would call that description a little misleading at best.</li>
            <li>Sweet savings!</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for $50!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>I took it easy, just as the instructions suggested, and let the shaver do all the work.  </li>
            <li>He has been looking for a good, smooth shaving, gentle razor for years.  </li>
            <li>Easily comparable to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>and to be honest most shavers were made for caucasians,not minorities who really doesnt suffer from razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Shipped and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This razor is very quick and convenient, however a bit on the noisy side.</li>
            <li>head comes off easy for cleaning, and the replacement parts are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it can easily get to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Easily buy with confidence.</li>
            <li>EASY</li>
            <li>I prefer a clean cut close shaved look, but like most African-American men I suffer from razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The one flaw this product has is that the foil breaks or flakes off to easy</li>
            <li>Strong motor and efficient.</li>
            <li>i am not a barber, but wanted something for quick clean ups when i couldnt reach my own barber.</li>
            <li>Plug in and strong</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong after a week.  </li>
            <li>but my beard seems to grow softer to teh touch not as strong kinky after using this</li>
            <li>Very good quality much better then other shavers used.</li>
            <li>The aluminum was damaged quickly from the pressure applied, but it STILL works fine!</li>
            <li>Great for touch ups or for general shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is ok but not as good asy $20 norelco especially normal use leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>works great for giving your skin a nice break as well of getting extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>Its power is so strong it cuts super close!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and extremely close shave!  </li>
            <li>It is super powerful and if there is one thing you can bet on with Wahl is that this thing will surely hold a charge!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product works just fine.</li>
            <li>great product for the price, close shave and the item arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Shaver excellent, previous shavers had a trimmer and case included in the order.</li>
            <li>We returned it, I am not sure how there are so many comments on how great this works when IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li>BEST FOIL SHAVER IN THE BUSINESS FOR BLACK MEN.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, shipped fast and works great as intended.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, works best on hair that is less than 1/16\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and gives me the smooth shaven head I&#x27;ve craved without the bumps.  </li>
            <li>if you do that then it would work fine</li>
            <li>Everything else was fine: the delivery, the packaging, the service...</li>
            <li>but it cuts right through it easily!</li>
            <li>and PURE PURE PURE PURE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a cheap replacement for the fine quality product we used to get from Germany.</li>
            <li>I have owned my wahl 8061 for a little over 3 months now and can say without a doubt the best electric shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>I am Very Pleased with the Wahl Professional 8061!!</li>
            <li>Other then that its a perfect shaver for quick buzz</li>
            <li>This is literally the best $50 I have ever spent!!!  </li>
            <li>The multi- blade shavers are great for smooth looks and up close shaving but the irritation afterwards and ever facial killer razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to clean</li>
            <li>The close shave is almost as smooth as razor shaving.</li>
            <li>but this will get you that smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I works great as a daily shaver.</li>
            <li>While a two year warranty on the product, which I was told by customer service is made in the U.S.A. weighed favorably toward the purchase, I find that the product seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and then this shaver to get it smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave, but it looks, feels and sounds like a cheap device.  </li>
            <li>razor to get close and smooth.</li>
            <li>leaves skin smooth ...</li>
            <li>The shaver is not razor smooth yet gives a close shaved look.</li>
            <li>granted my skin is smooth....</li>
            <li>Close shave, comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Then the bump free made sense to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber and after trying many electric shavers its obvious that you don&#x27;t have to spend tons of money to get the best product.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close and comfortable with no razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>It gets the skin silky smooth without leaving bumps or a rash.  </li>
            <li>It is light, all plastic (what isn&#x27;t these days?)</li>
            <li>Close\\&quot; foils are available separately--and inexpensively--from Amazon.)  </li>
            <li>I just hope parts are still available as it&#x27;s no longer listed in Wahl&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>this shaver it leaves the skin feeling smooth and the bonus</li>
            <li>Great Solid Product, hopefully it stands the test of time!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I receive a smooth pain free shave every time I use this product.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and Bump free.</li>
            <li>It is not bump free.</li>
            <li>Go ahead and feel free to buy it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m buying another because I know it&#x27;s going to give me a hassle-free smooth shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the $100 ones that they show on TV where you get a couple of days of smooth skin and then a razor bumb nightmare.</li>
            <li>This is my second one of these and it works great.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave after using a clipper.</li>
            <li>Face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth and close.  </li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions, it works great but the foil is broke already on its 3rd use!</li>
            <li>No razor bumps, rechargeable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The closest shave you will ever enjoy.</li>
            <li>My barber uses the same and it works great.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be the best shaving equipment instead it gives me bumps after few hours of using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me with any bumps and it gives a smooth feel of skin after using it.</li>
            <li>Cut was not as smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok so i rarely ever write any type of reviews for anything, but this was a must.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt as smooth as i wanted it to be as if i came from the barber</li>
            <li>smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why people would use this over a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Hair must be real short before you use it, its great blade to bald your head.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth close shave, without any bumps or irritations.</li>
            <li>compact, easy to clean, works well with or without cord.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean &amp; close shave.</li>
            <li>It gives you a smooth shave and you don&#x60;t even have to press it on your body.  </li>
            <li>Yes bump free.</li>
            <li>I like that replacement blades and foil heads are inexpensive and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>One month of light use, the foil tore.</li>
            <li>This thing is great for the face and upper neck</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, clean, and use this often.</li>
            <li>great for this White guy.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>My wife has even commented on how smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li>Great for a regular maintenance of my beard and  shaved head.     </li>
            <li>It leaves my head feeling smooth though.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s light and prone to nicks, scratches, and cuts.  </li>
            <li>it makes it smooth</li>
            <li>His skin is always so smooth after he uses it with no bumps and he can use it on his clients.</li>
            <li>As an African-American man, I&#x27;ve always wanted a smooth shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth face with no bumps.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s important for him to have that Independence</li>
            <li>I have struggled for years to find a shaving method that provides for a close bump free shave.  </li>
            <li>Finally I apply an aftershave balm and I&#x27;m done...looking as fly as</li>
            <li>This shaver is a very close shave and works quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Your clients will really enjoy this product too.</li>
            <li>I will admit that the foil is somewhat cheap and may need to be replace every now and then (maybe in 1-2 years, depends on your care of product)</li>
            <li>Glad to pay the money again, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Price was great but the produced didn&#x27;t cut me close enough.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Bump Free Shave&amp;#34; not a chance.</li>
            <li>Fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, besides a few stubborn hairs here</li>
            <li>It is slightly more powerful plugged in.</li>
            <li>but its not bump free as described.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and replace blades.</li>
            <li>it get&#x27;s your face and head as smooth as if you had used a razor on it</li>
            <li>I did not know these were still available.</li>
            <li>I noticed how smooth my face felt.  </li>
            <li>This Wahl does give a close shave, but greatly irritated my skin and left my face burning.</li>
            <li>It was a close shave ( the two I got out of it ) and cheap price</li>
            <li>Its a great product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is easy to maintain and clean as well.</li>
            <li>Works great on face as well, same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to it as I really liked the feel of it at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this because my barber used, and I got a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product recommended by my barber.</li>
            <li>which I know its not from it cheap feel</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>but this is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Not up to par for Me , good price but loud  </li>
            <li>The only feature it lacks, to make it an all-around excellent shaver, is an edge trimmer like on the model 4000.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because so many guys &amp;#34;of color&amp;#34; loved it and was worried that it may not work for a white dude.</li>
            <li>the cut is so far so good</li>
            <li>But this particular shaver has his face looking amazing, smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li>And the exact amount of money!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful....</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean because the head comes off, and water can be used to clean the foil and cutters.</li>
            <li>My barber suggested it for my head shaving, and I think it&#x27;s the best electric shaver, powerful, giving a very close shave, easy to clean, a little noisy but not the end of the world, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves him with a clean smooth Shave.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and use it with 1 day of growth and you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>This process works, but these clippers still don&#x27;t make my face smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>during those four days i had an important event and went to the barber to clean my face up .</li>
            <li>/&gt;3) SUPER lightweight and easy to hold and manuever.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, very nice trimmer long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>cleans everything right up close and quick with very light pressure.</li>
            <li>It works well with all of them (a tad better than dry with a good pre-shave).</li>
            <li>I find that if I shave and edge my face with my normal electric trimmer this works AMAZINGLY well to get me</li>
            <li>you are getting what I think is worth $100+ for this type of shaver!</li>
            <li>No brothers want that look unless you are rich like Billy Gates.</li>
            <li>After my barber recommend that I purchase this specific shaver, I was more than pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my head but, soon found out that I can also use it for my face without it causing bumps.</li>
            <li>This is my first use of an electric shaver for many years and it performs admirably.</li>
            <li>It has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say if your beard is more than 1/32 of an inch use trimmer first.</li>
            <li>, i didn&#x27;t keep the original packing that&#x27;s why i had to toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of electric razors and they all seem to leave that &#x27;&#x27;need a shave&#x27;&#x27; feeling; however, this Wahl does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li>and he was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>No skin irritation or bumbs, this is an awesome product, when using don&#x27;t press too hard just lightly smooth strokes.</li>
            <li>I can live without it, but it would be nice to have for sideburns.  </li>
            <li>The reviews said it would be great for sensitive skin areas that need the closer shave like the pubic area for real close smoothness.</li>
            <li>Helps me keep my face clean faster than with a razor.  </li>
            <li>If he skips a day, the shaver will not give him a clean shave and he has to use another one as well.</li>
            <li>I must say it doesn&#x27;t cut clean as I thought.</li>
            <li>a smooth shave, almost as good as a regular manual</li>
            <li>If i want to shave after a day or two, i have to use razorless products to get clean cut and then use this machine to keep it clean cut every day and that makes it work and leaves no bump.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean up razor.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean my clients&#x27; neck area, and for one I use it for a bald fade.</li>
            <li>This is what I bought this razor for- a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>so you have to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>Makes him super smooth and never gives him any bumps or breakouts.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I even use it twice a day since I like a clean shaved head.  </li>
            <li>He gets a clean close shave with no issues from this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Its rechargeable, portable, and gives him the clean close look he desires.  </li>
            <li>to get the clean shave...</li>
            <li>When it was working it did give me a clean shave with no bumps.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean, polished look and it doesn&#x27;t snag skin or hair.</li>
            <li>I do the outline with an Andis outliner, clean up with this, and then moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I must admit it does handle the wrinkled face and gives him a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT A CLEAN SHAVE</li>
            <li>The reason why I bought this was because my barber used it to clean up my face when I got a haircut</li>
            <li>clean shave and no razor bumps</li>
            <li>And I thought I paid enough to safely insure this product had that kind of merit?</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as a recommendation from my barber who uses it to clean up my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>I would think the original ni-cad battery would last longer than 3 years, but it might be good for others to know that replacing this battery is NOT a user friendly task.</li>
            <li>The Wahl 8061 5-star is exactly what I have been searching for and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great all-around razor that will shave your face as well as your head.</li>
            <li>Even the replacement foil &amp; blade is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;There may be other shavers that shave as close -- but, for me, the Wahl shaver is a quality, well-built product that gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric razor; Braun, Norelco, Remington.  </li>
            <li>Close shaving, specially for an A.American as I am.</li>
            <li>A clean smooth shave, worth the price.</li>
            <li>very good shaver, i did have to replace the head after a few times used.</li>
            <li>Very good at fighting bumps, but....it is advertised as a shaver shaper, and the shaper for this product is missing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit louder than I expected, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>Works as it was expected to do, great.</li>
            <li>Great shaver for those of you who like to not only remove the hair from your neck and face, but also the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>the shaving experience is so much superior to my last panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>(i have a full shaped beard tho)    </li>
            <li>(I think the device is better suited for straight hair.)</li>
            <li>I was able to save money and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>With out any doubt the Wahl is a true 5 star shaver.  </li>
            <li>The true test will be the results of my face after 2 days to see if I in fact DO NOT bump.  </li>
            <li>i  love this tool very reliable</li>
            <li>, that wasn&#x27;t true, my face was sore with bumps.</li>
            <li>you cannot shave with a full beard and think that it was take it away.</li>
            <li>began as my wife was loving how close the shave was compared to the old trimmer.    </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my father who is currently a patient and it was so noisy and did not do a good job either.</li>
            <li>Love it so much had to get family member one.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price and its very solid.</li>
            <li>Again, overall good shaver</li>
            <li>So I went  to trim my beard with my full size</li>
            <li>I figured they probably know what is a good product since it is a &amp;#34;tool of the trade.&amp;#34;  I have used it several times on my face and head.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it and is satisfied w it.</li>
            <li>A true test of a product is how well that your clients like the results of it,</li>
            <li>Next I used the Wahl and I got a really good shave.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and offered a better shave than what I&#x27;ve gotten with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All in all, amazon allowed me to return both for a full refund, and I received an email from them stating that they would look into the product discription.</li>
            <li>i love these they cut even closer then a straight razor.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back to my good ole razor</li>
            <li>like to keep my hair short and my beard close, this works good on shaving the neck, and around your beard if you have one.</li>
            <li>I had heard of the company but didn&#x27;t realize they made shavers and since they are a domestic company and this model has a slew of good reviews,</li>
            <li>Still not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li>Not bad on my face and chin.  </li>
            <li>It is strong in his hand yet very gentle and thorough on his face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after a while the stubborn hairs are easily eliminated, so have patientience and enjoy a very close shave without the bumps.</li>
            <li>A must have for those men that break out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I had an older version Wahl before and liked it; this one is even better thus far.  </li>
            <li>A bit loud and has no trimmer but overall, a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver shaper in my opinion and use it every other day to keep my line up looking clean.</li>
            <li>At first it work fine</li>
            <li>looked into this as an alternative because I wanted to be clean shaven or near clean shaving most days</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t say in the product description, it does come with the super close foil.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>shaves super close and quick.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional 8061 5-Star Series Deluxe is a great shaver for Black men.  </li>
            <li>As mine grows in quickly, I cannot skip two days in a row.</li>
            <li>This cuts so close that it gets super close</li>
            <li>It is very efficient and is also easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>The foil to broke quickly causing it to snag my face.  </li>
            <li>Cuts super close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>reviews\\&quot; on amazon (I wonder if REAL customers actually gave this product great ratings).</li>
            <li>it arrived really quick</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I love it too because after shaving, his skin is baby soft and ultra smooth.</li>
            <li>reference, I also have a Braun 5 series and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as quickly as this Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shaver foils for these electric razors come in close, super close, and</li>
            <li>Product is adequate.</li>
            <li>My older Braun had worked OK, but it eventually wore out.  </li>
            <li>Not near as good or as quick as my shaver with a blade.  </li>
            <li>the shaver is all right: it shaves close and clean.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it out, I had a light beard going on</li>
            <li>Gold mesh cracked after the very first use.</li>
            <li>the product broke after the very first use</li>
            <li>My faces feels as smooth as if I used a straight razor against the grain!  </li>
            <li>gives a fast, clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>He really likes the close shave for a smooth, clean, look.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, it is quick and easy and works really really well.</li>
            <li>Great for military!!</li>
            <li>As a black man, I have been in search of a great shave since puberty.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shaver because I am deployed to Iraq and I lost my previously used electric shaver(the great Remington ES-1000 Bump Control Shaver, I do not know why they discontinued this model).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the box covered in black guys intimidate you, still works great on all skin types and colors.</li>
            <li>TO ANYONE THAT ENJOYS A CLOSE SHAVE, WITE EASY CLEANING ITS VERY CONVENANT</li>
            <li>Even with this minor problem he is the most satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I have to believe the reviewers who&#x27;ve left some pretty good comments regarding its performance.</li>
            <li>Very close shave and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a large surface shaving screen, two floating blades, the motor is more powerful and moves the blades at a higher speed.  </li>
            <li>Even if they say that you can press lightly to get a good shave, I did press down on the skin with it.</li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use.</li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use.</li>
            <li>The local beauty and barber supply store wanted a mint for it however Amazons price was much better!</li>
            <li>got it exactly a month ago and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a really clean bump free shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is super powerful and gets a very close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>You can rinse the blades under hot water to clean them.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver that could.  </li>
            <li>Works great holds a long charge easy to clean and it great on the skin real close without irritating the skin definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is great for a quick shave or for doing skin tight fades and tapers!</li>
            <li>The last one I used prior to buying this one -- a Braun with a cleaning fluid/charging station -- seemed very good for awhile, but eventually it started with the neck irritation and the process of shaving</li>
            <li>After reading some other good reviews here I decided to give this Wahl Super Close shaver a try.  </li>
            <li>it has a smooth cut and its very close.</li>
            <li>This is for the guy who wants the smooth razor cut face but doesn&#x27;t want to use a razor.</li>
            <li>A very close and smooth shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a very high-quality product, made in USA, smooth and powerful.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a smooth shave and REALLY leaves NO BUMPS.</li>
            <li>I really think the ingrowns removal check before shaving is really important.</li>
            <li>loudness accompanies what appears to be a substantially powerful</li>
            <li>Glad i didnt throw away my old shaver yet.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>well worth the money...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful shaver.</li>
            <li>I have the most coarse hair texture of anyone I know and somehow this shaver gets me baby smooth.</li>
            <li>They all love this razor and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li>since I liked the way it shaved, I gave it a second chance) and both had faulty charging mechanisms.</li>
            <li>my 10 year old norelco works better then this</li>
            <li>Better than some but not heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But Im glad I did cause my skin ahs been clear for 2 days after using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I rarely get any at all with this shaver.</li>
            <li>The best shaver in the game.  </li>
            <li>Yes the motor is powerful.  </li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>is not Pressing TOO-HARD and just letting the Shaver do the work for you)&lt;br /&gt;Definately Worth the $$$&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is worth it .</li>
            <li>just tried it out this morning on about 5 days worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this product is only good for 24 hours worth of stubble, as it was too weak/dull to do anything on real scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it will prove useful on finer hair for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for a high-quality product.</li>
            <li>i suggest a nice clean razor blade shave the first day to get everything flat and even...</li>
            <li>Very powerful and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>OHHHH, the trimer on the back IS the best thing about the shaver so far....gives sharp lines.</li>
            <li>Charger port goes out and you have to replace the whole thing but other than that its a great product</li>
            <li>He used it for the first time and while it didn&#x27;t give him the super close shave on his head, it did the job and didn&#x27;t leave razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>Now you know what all the smart looking clean shaven heads got their look from.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this for those men who need a clean shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Gotta clean it more regularly than the instructions indicate.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a try because of other good reviews that it had.</li>
            <li>The razor was in its original package, charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>It glides right over the hairs on my neck like they&#x27;re not even there, leaving them fully</li>
            <li>It will just bounce right off of my side burns as if there&#x27;s no blade at all.</li>
            <li>I can run this right up to my beard without messing up the trim lines.</li>
            <li>Remington had it right.</li>
            <li>Saw my barber use it and bought right away.</li>
            <li>Serves me right for not sticking to what i know.</li>
            <li>It said no bump right on the package</li>
            <li>He can get a shave in right in the semi.</li>
            <li>Luckily...it was on my face but happened right before I was about to use it.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>well, I bought another one, since I had to travel right away.....</li>
            <li>5-Star is right ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also faster and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I got a full refund most likely because I tried the razor probably two or three times.</li>
            <li>No razor stubble, just very close clean shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lacks power &amp; misses many hairs, especially when using it unplugged with a full charge.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wahl Professional 8061 shavers for the past 6 years because it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I found this item reasonably alright, but nothing outstandingly special.</li>
            <li>The 4000 is still going strong with no problems, I just wanted a back up/travel shaver and this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>My elderly vision impaired husband finds this very easy to use &amp; I appreciate the absence of stubble on his cheeks.</li>
            <li>Although it barely lasted one year, I&#x27;m about to stock up with 3 more.</li>
            <li>, I learned many things on how to make it more effective, but sadly, it won&#x27;t be your one-step solution for shaving your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re like most men, when you go to use this on the third day, it&#x27;ll do nothing on its own as it only works on stubble...</li>
            <li>This shaver is great for an everyday use!</li>
            <li>the battery is long duration, it is nice.</li>
            <li>I then went to clean it and took top off by pressing button stayed pressed in which obviously did not allow me to put top back on..</li>
            <li>have a full beard and have to work a bit to clean the edges, but other than that I like it better than the Wahl shaver</li>
            <li>Performance is not as good as advertised leaves face irritated motor or power switch keeps slowing down Poorley made product</li>
            <li>It does a little better than most but still not as close as we want</li>
            <li>Cuts amazingly close BUT not for very long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried many shavers none really work for me.</li>
            <li>This shaver works well but is fairly noisy as compared to my old Norelco, which recently fell apart on me.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use shaver that gives you a razor close clean cut without the razor like after effects.</li>
            <li>So I started searching for a different brand that gives a great shave, is a quality razor, and won&#x27;t require big bucks for purchase.  </li>
            <li>I can only say that it works wonders for me maybe a slightly different for everyone else but great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I recommend this product for any African American.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Im biracial with very sensitive light skin</li>
            <li>Fully charged it works for days, very very close shave and fast much better than my old Remington triple header</li>
            <li>This does a fantastic job on old baldy!</li>
            <li>The stand is kind of loose, I never know if I&#x27;m charging it or not.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think the trick is this machine doesnt pull the hair and doesnt cut it too short below skin BUT use very light pressure.</li>
            <li>on a lighter note the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African-American male and always wanted the clean smooth bald head but couldn&#x27;t get it because with a razor I would get bumps everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase because now I don&#x27;t have to shave every day as before, as you might know, shaving everyday can be pretty expensive and this shaver saves that money because it provides a nice clean shave all you do</li>
            <li>When I saw the reviews for this shaver I expected it to be something amazing people commented on how well it removed hair and gave you a  close shave.</li>
            <li>they do exactly what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Or find another product from another company with hopes that someone still makes a quality shaver that will last for more than two months.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more item...</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing to shave your head, you will need to use clippers first</li>
            <li>You must shave first.</li>
            <li>first time user of electric shavers.    </li>
            <li>first few days had MINOR irritation but with lighting my pressure and pre-shave powder sticks its been perfect ever since.    </li>
            <li>but this items comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>I also am not heavy bearded and my hair is light to gray.</li>
            <li>My barber first introduced this item to me</li>
            <li>My first shaver died on me after about 2 years.</li>
            <li>This is the first buyer remorse I have in my experiences with Ebay.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, but only when facial hair is short.</li>
            <li>I dropped my first one.</li>
            <li>Very close shave!</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Baby bottom effect, soft and smooth face after shaving.</li>
            <li>This shaving machine is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the shaver does not cut hair thats more than a stubble.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my first shaver shaper.  </li>
            <li>The product broke within its first two days of use.</li>
            <li>my first close shave, it was a learning lesson.</li>
            <li>Is better than razors but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I got burned the first time and it did not cut as close as i would like it to....</li>
            <li>Maybe my next one will be more durable, or maybe I&#x27;ll give the Andis razor a go.</li>
            <li>So would give it 5 stars but cannt because the top did not last.</li>
            <li>First foil shaver i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this week.  </li>
            <li>The foils &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; me on the first day and wanted to return them with no luck.</li>
            <li>i first used it</li>
            <li>that first night it didnt do a thing.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving I at first was unsure the correct way to shave using it.</li>
            <li>Very close shave!</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>The foil top is very fragile.  </li>
            <li>One of the nicest shavers he has purchased and he has purchased a number of different brands and has never been satisfied til now.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to return it at first, but since I had already opened the box, I said why not give him a chance.</li>
            <li>but I like close shaving even though I have sensitive skin, and I can guaranty you that it is bump free.</li>
            <li>I will add more later if I experience any problems.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for the prompt receipt!</li>
            <li>I have the Wahl Hero trimmer which I pass first and in between as I see hairs remain because of their length.</li>
            <li>NO RAZOR BURN at all first electric razor not to give it to me</li>
            <li>Gets pretty darn close to the skin.</li>
            <li>After I got out the shower I applied a daily cream treatment called Bump Rescue made by Magic</li>
            <li>This product performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>In just a week of shaving the foil on top tore open and the inside machinery made contact.  </li>
            <li>Shave feels pretty close to skin</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my razor and therefore have a better chance of shaving without having bumps 24 hours later.</li>
            <li>Well made sturdy great for course and thick hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to donate it to someone who would be pleased with not such a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Wahl fits that job description exactly.  </li>
            <li>During the first 1-2 months, the product worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything I could read (hot shower, tea tree oil, fancy shave sets, etc).</li>
            <li>Just as described, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>more  than  what  i  consider  to  be often  enough  .....</li>
            <li>hot  </li>
            <li>It definitely is an upgrade from a razor and it doesn&#x27;t give me as many bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>I used this once and INSTANTLY fell in love.</li>
            <li>Zero razor bumbs on my head or neck after the first month of usage.</li>
            <li>When I first got these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a replacement after many years of daily service, my kids knocked it on the floor and the foil broke and plug receptacle was damaged.</li>
            <li>The 5 Star and 4000 are interchangeable a far as the foil heads and cutter blades, so when I buy replacements, they fit both shavers, which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first Razor that I&#x27;ve ever had to cut as close as this pair does.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I used to have a Remington shaver of much better quality for a third this price.</li>
            <li>He said that his barber uses this exact one and it doesn&#x27;t give him bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave because of ingrown hairs,however this Wahl shaver misses so many hairs I have to use a trimmer prior to using it.</li>
            <li>this is my first shaver...</li>
            <li>said it is exactly what he wanted, and item lives up to its expectations.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t find this first.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the shaver will NOT cut whiskers or any longer hairs, that&#x27;s not what this product is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver worked well upon first use.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to take the top layer of skin off and still left a lot of beard.  </li>
            <li>its okay if you live alone, but if your waking up early for a shave ur going to wake up everyone else in the house --</li>
            <li>The new one is quieter and the battery life so far has been better.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, helps clear all razor bumps, and very durable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to clean, close dry shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it&#x27;s a little loud, I recommend this machine to all who want to have a clean smooth cut but make sure you do it right</li>
            <li>You can also shave right up to your beard, mustache, sideburn lines as longer hairs wont be cut hardly much at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this electric shaver to anyone who has problem with ingrown hairs and wants a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t really need to go over areas numerous times which makes for a quick and easy shave.</li>
            <li>Normal, steady light pressure against the skin.  </li>
            <li>its not bad and a decent value for the price/does not have a trimer and gives a reasonable shave/</li>
            <li>The whole thing is made of cheap plastic, the foil piece on top split in half from me just turning it on for it the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I might use it to clean up cheeks/sideburns if I miss a spot with my old shaver, but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave if you go over it often enough and in many directions..  </li>
            <li>I bought this Electric Razor Purely off the reviews that others have posted, and man am I not Sorry, this shaver Performs and it can all be heard in the \\&quot;Buzz\\&quot; as soon as you turn it on.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to drop this razor because the foil seems to break/rip very easily.</li>
            <li>The blade and screen combination is fair to poor when it is new and gets worn out rather quickly with repeated use, and just doesn&#x27;t work as well as their original shaver did.</li>
            <li>The main reason I wanted this shaver is that it was assembled in the USA, which is very important to me; even forgoing a shaver with a built in trimmer to have an American made shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this based on all the positive reviews but he had to call his barber to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>He has used magic shave for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.  </li>
            <li>Now the shipping was pretty fast on the sellers part so props to them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to forgive that because it shaves very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gold foil broke pretty fast.</li>
            <li>With time, however, you&#x27;ll learn exactly how much pressure to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other reason for my purchase was the more economical screen replacements.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works well enough, but no where near as good as the old Wahl&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It does a good (not great) job on trimming the facial hairs, about 90% effective.</li>
            <li>The design is kind of old school, maybe they haven’t change the design in 30 years, and it is loud, it is like riding an old tractor, also buy some aftershave cream you will need it.</li>
            <li>The old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; rang true for me.</li>
            <li>and this one is by far is superior to ANY OTHER .for</li>
            <li>OK for the money, does a decent job when used to shave your head, however I would spend the extra money and get the Bald Eagle Smart, it&#x27;s in a league all by</li>
            <li>This shaver made it possible to maintain a very close face shave and clean bald head without any aweful breakouts!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my buy and if about 2-3 years when this one needs to be replace, I will likely come back here to get another one.</li>
            <li>And its case is relatively easy to open (or so I&#x27;ve read) to allow you to change batteries yourself.  </li>
            <li>Gets nice and close in about half the time of a blade shave.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this shaver is NOT a super close shaver.</li>
            <li>I understand that the battery may not last too long, surprising except that this unit is under $40</li>
            <li>Batery Last a Long time good product</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it does shave very well for my type of beard and from a shaving perspective</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - specially for black men because our hair tend to be more curly and prone to grow inwardly.</li>
            <li>So far I am very well pleased and would highly recommend for others with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>At less than 25% of what I paid for the Arcitec, this provides a far superior shave.</li>
            <li>So much kinder to my head than regular razors and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a least a week and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>If you use it when the beard is low, say 1-2 days growth it&#x27;ll work fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, works well on short hairs on my face</li>
            <li>Pretty simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li>THE Remington F-4 790 SHAVER is the way to go great quality shaver with a pop up sharp trimmer, cord/cordless long battery life, flexible foil head, can stationary the head if you want to, had it for three yrs.</li>
            <li>well  It my 5 times using this little machine , I liked it but after 5 time using it</li>
            <li>This shaver is just a little noisy but it gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a nice compact little razor.</li>
            <li>So far, the shaver seems to be working fine, but it&#x27;s still early.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li>This thing does a good job,just follow the YouTube,instructions,and not press to hard against your skin,and it works well.</li>
            <li>It is little loud, but does a good job and very close cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if a professional shop did the replacement, it would cost half the original price of the shaver to get it done.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Works great and battery last for a few days without being recharged, tried Andis profoil  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Leave my face feeling smooth although sometimes a bit sore in spots but not enough to complain much.</li>
            <li>and I noticed how smooth it left my skin.</li>
            <li>As close as a straight edge</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this shaver.</li>
            <li>I am almost ready to declare that it shaves as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>You will spend too much time trimming hair.</li>
            <li>and this is the only way for me to shave comfortably</li>
            <li>and decided to get another shaver, so when this one wears out, as I thought it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>So my options are to be without a shaver for two or three weeks and pay for shipping or the same and purchase a cheap shaver to use in the interim.</li>
            <li>everthing went very well</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to use because shave cream is not needed.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave than the rotary blade shavers.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GLADE IT BACK AND FROTH AGAINST THE    FACE AND YOU&#x27;LL GET THE SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It does the job it is designed to do very well.</li>
            <li>My Husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>But once I got it, not so much.</li>
            <li>It cuts really close.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close save.</li>
            <li>You also should stretch your skin taut if you really want that close shave.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil&#x27;s and blades are very inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Seems to cut much closer and blades / screen have lasted longer.</li>
            <li>This foil shaver shaves VERY close.</li>
            <li>Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]], and use the Shaver/Shaper inbetween</li>
            <li>Very close shave; would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>so much I went ahead and bought one.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>As I said in the review of the replacement foil and cutter bar, the razor does a wonderful job of cutting close without producing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves how close it shaves his head.  </li>

            <li>grate shipping fast.</li>
            <li>Equipment more noisy than I expected.</li>
            <li>When I use it on family &amp; friends, they all rave about how much they like it, and how close it gets.</li>
            <li>or when i did not have the time to use my straight razor.</li>
            <li>I will say that since i have purchased this shaver i have used my straight razor maybe 3 times.</li>
            <li>shaver works very well, gets a rather close shave almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>and it is a very close and</li>
            <li>I am really please with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Really the reason why I purchased.  </li>
            <li>It is very noisy and really doesn&#x27;t shave as close as claimed.</li>
            <li>really doesn&#x27;t grab everything</li>
            <li>He no longer uses a disposable razor on his face because this shaver gives such a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>it shaves very close</li>
            <li>This razor gives me the shave I&#x27;ve been looking for very close.</li>
            <li>It really served my purpose.</li>
            <li>Using this product along with my clippers gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>absolutely gone.</li>
            <li>thing doesnt affect any detailed facial hair designs.</li>
            <li>but I expected more than a month for the price.</li>
            <li>A real cop out in my opinion.</li>
            <li>HEY THESE SHAVE REALLY CLOSE</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand this razor.</li>
            <li>Also cuts very close to the skin</li>
            <li>It does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>, I get NO razor bumps and the shave is very close.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a so called, &amp;#34;black male&amp;#34; (brown really), that has issues with razor bumps</li>
            <li>This product is very unreliable.</li>
            <li>I am very upset that I can not return this product and will think twice before ordering from here again.</li>
            <li>Very noisy!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li>fits well in the hand, shaves close enough, shaves comfortably.</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair at all much.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves really close ( kissably close) and does not cut or scratch him.</li>
            <li>but as I do have to cut close to maintain that fresh shaved look, and have highly sensitive skin that gets ingrown hairs often, I must say this shaver blows the competition out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves very close with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Really close, like a baby&#x27;s but close</li>
            <li>really Amazon????</li>
            <li>He is very picky</li>
            <li>cordless battery is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Gives shaving bumps very painfull</li>
            <li>Cuts very close without burning.  </li>
            <li>the whole even without the trimmer I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>&amp; ships fast</li>
            <li>very close shave on your head</li>
            <li>goo dproduct really close shave</li>
            <li>The razor shaves very well and close (no electric razor will ever come as close to hand razor).</li>
            <li>Even though it broke again, however I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>so much i&#x27;ve purchased two for my sons.</li>
            <li>This shaver won&#x27;t do much for hair longer than that...</li>
            <li>but I need and want a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My son the barber is very happy with this purchase and uses it all the time while working and cutting hair</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>As expected, it delivers an outstandingly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Shaves my head very well.</li>
            <li>Post shaving with any razor (electric, safety, cartridge, straight)</li>
            <li>Great when the foil is broken.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I may not dance very well</li>
            <li>suggestion I have for those of you who want the ultimate in a smooth close shave, buy the gold plated Wahl hypoallergenic shaver foils.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close</li>
            <li>I tried a Norelco for a while and find the Wahl gives a much closer shave and works much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot simpler, lasts a life time, and doesn&#x27;t require much money for replacement pieces.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Wahl, but don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% bump free, it depends on your hair/skin, everyone is different.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>However, the 5 star shaver will take off all your facial hair and leave you with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shave was very sporatic.  </li>
            <li>However, ultimately the coils feel cheap.</li>
            <li>There is much wisdom in our elders</li>
            <li>Very pricey for what you get,</li>
            <li>but i dont know much about shavers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It works well, and fast.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the same as a smooth bald head.  </li>
            <li>Dosent work fast</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all.</li>
            <li>My face dose&#x27;nt bump up like it use 2 thanks 2 this product.</li>
            <li>it gives a very close shave .</li>
            <li>This is a very narrowly-focused product.</li>
            <li>He really has no hair bumps at all.</li>
            <li>and I read some of the reviews that claimed that very thing, but my husband wanted to try it and thought just maybe that person had gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li>I work in an office that is very formal</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very noisy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;M a barber and use these machines a lot and know quality when I see it, very overrated shaver.</li>
            <li>Junk razor, screen is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>It gets Very close as a razor, without the razor irritation...</li>
            <li>i had expected it to work better based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>You only have to change your blade ($16.65) every six months which is pretty cool becuase</li>
            <li>later.&lt;br /&gt;The product might or might not be a good one, but at least for me, it didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>I wanted a corded shaver to have a strong, steady power supply and found that in the woman&#x27;s shaving world, they simply don&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li>bought this because my barber used this shaver on me a few times and it provides a close nice shave.</li>
            <li>My bald head is smooth, I mean really smooth!</li>
            <li>It is so loud!!!</li>
            <li>I am a black man that bumps very easily and as a result do not shave more often than once every other day.  </li>
            <li>Just your plain soap and warm water will</li>
            <li>I use the old one for the trimmer only, sure which the new one had a trimmer too!</li>
            <li>So, I asked him, and he advised, you have to clip facial hair very short with clippers, then use these to clean up face, make it smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since took the whole \\&quot;Clean Shave\\&quot; prior to, out of the Equation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more powerful than the other two units I&#x27;ve owned, a Remington Microscreen (10 years) and my norelco (10 years) both of which cost over $100 and were of decent quality and service life.  </li>
            <li>OK, so it is not pretty, does not have a sideburn trimmer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30+ years, and the Wahl 5-Star gives me a better shave than any other I&#x27;ve found, including $200+ premium shavers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to open and clean and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used my Wahl Dynaflex shaver for years, and it worked better than any other shaver I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is an edit to my original review because, after only 5 months this razor is junk!</li>
            <li>I had one of these before several dozen years ago so I was familiar with the product if I had one question</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure whites, other ethnics would benefit also.&lt;br /&gt;Update - it&#x27;s doesnt have the pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know if his barber knows something we don&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other shaver to me.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY Recommend this product to anyone who shaves very often and in a hurry who doesn&#x27;t always have time to lather heir face with shaving cream and use a straight razor every morning.</li>
            <li>One of the things that I did to help me along was to use the Andis Style Liner first to get rid of the the long hairs and get the beard area trimmed down to a level that is good for the Wahl.  </li>
            <li>When I called them to complain, they not only sent me a replacement free of charge but they went so far as to send TWO !!</li>
            <li>The shave is OK, but gets dull quickly, and the replacement head  cost is as much as the unit.</li>
            <li>Works excellent, try not to push down hard though because goil foil can tear.</li>
            <li>This is designed to clean up the stubble left after shaving.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I think it goes back to the adage: there is no shortcut when it comes to a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>. . until you turn it on. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of shavers (Ronson, Braun, Panasonic, Remington, Grundig), but this is the first one so powerful as to actually feel \\&quot;torque-y\\&quot; in my hand.   </li>
            <li>My Barber&#x27;s razor shaves clean and no hair is left.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
            <li>As long as you can close the bathroom door you should be fine, otherwise you may wake up the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offers a great cut but it does me no good if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, the merchant was very understanding and took it back with a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used to use the gray colored Wahl Shaver and it was a high quality product that shaved very well and</li>
            <li>I was really excited about buying this shaver since it&#x27;s the same one my barber uses and he highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit bulky, and the head cover is easy to loose; but a close shave is what&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a smooth, close, NO BUMP, shaver for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard anything good or bad about the Andis razor, but I&#x27;d only heard good things about the Wahl.</li>
            <li>I shave my full head and beard daily.</li>
            <li>The shaver was extremely noisy, and more importantly, it did not cut my facial hair anywhere near as close as my older shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, just learn how to use it properly, which isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li>the product: I finally bought it after reading the positive reviews by other African Americans and watching various videos, and there are some very good ones out there.  </li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave, however just after one use we had to buy a new head for it because it cracked.</li>
            <li>Barely cuts it right.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it shaves the corners near the nose and the corner of the mouth without cutting them like the razors.</li>
            <li>The latest I&#x27;ve owned for less than 60 days</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be a quick shave either because you have to keep hitting the same spots</li>
            <li>(This is with the standard \\&quot;Close\\&quot; foil. \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blk male and my Norelco does a better job at shaving short hairs.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;barber\\&quot; had suggested this when my once a decade attempt at maintaining facial hair was at its inception during my most recent trim.</li>
            <li>I bought this reading the reviews saying that this particular shaver did not irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it advertised incorrectly, the first one I recieved had a defective foil guard, that came apart during the first use.  </li>
            <li>Decent shaver.  </li>
            <li>After about 20 years of trying different shaving methods, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found the answer.  </li>
            <li>The main reason for me to try again this shaver was my clipper running out of charge.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver performs better than most expensive electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the search continues for a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>and I may have gotten a decent shave out of it, but my face would have looked like WWIII after.  </li>
            <li>, so I let the servants have the week off and let me beard grow to give the Wahl a decent test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and a bid type razor really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>, its better then using a razor and constantly hurting your skin, its fast and efficient for those who have to be clean shaved for their jobs EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li>its really that loud!</li>
            <li>So long as you use it daily depending on how fast your hair grows, this shaver will grind through all but the most stubborn hairs, all without the slightest irritation, tugging, or scratching.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver gives you a quick shave and is pretty close to a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your looking for a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; shaver keep looking.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a distinctive sound it makes when it is cutting hair and a much quieter sound when it encounters an already smooth surface.   </li>
            <li>I still Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend the Wahl peanut clippers.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a close shave without using a blade.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>were too high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to ANY man.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use with very little maintenance.</li>
            <li>So far it is better   than any other electric razor I have used</li>
            <li>After first 2 shaves, no red marks like most other shavers.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy.  </li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t sure, we were replacing a $200 electric razor so spending so little worried me.</li>
            <li>yes yes you pretty much have to shave everyday if u want a clean look.</li>
            <li>As an African American male looking to get into law enforcement and has a job that requires a clean shave; this product was a huge help.</li>
            <li>I bought an andis liner and it was pretty ok until the blade got dull</li>
            <li>even the so called sensitive skin razors that wasnt much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave and so far on razor bumps</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing because unless the hair is pointing straight out (which only stubble does), this will do absolutely nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and minimal irratation.  </li>
            <li>an then give a fast shave with this with no pressuer at all.youll be surprised.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, but my skin was sensitive to this shaver.</li>
            <li>any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, read your directions if you decide to buy it.</li>
            <li>But that might be normal with the amount of use it has seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first few times I have light hair on face don&#x27;t recamend junk</li>
            <li>A few years ago I tried shaving with Magic Shaving Powder like my father and that didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a few weeks now and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is the only way to make shave so well as I have had many quiet shavers that didn&#x27;t shave nearly so close.</li>
            <li>I can go over areas more than a few times.</li>
            <li>Other brands just don&#x27;t shave as clean and fast as the Wahl.</li>
            <li>This device was pictured differently than what was actually received; specifically the one pictured has a trimmer on the back and the one received does not making the shaver less than ideal.</li>
            <li>was recommended this product, at first it wasnt any better but after using it regularly my skin started to soften and noticed much less irritation.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine for me shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li>I have spent far too much on a certain \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; brand razor&#x27;s latest models claiming the closest and gentlest shave only to still have</li>
            <li>He promised that I could shave right up to the beard margin without altering it as it would only cut the 1-2 day stubble and not the longer beard hairs.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut my moles and the battery charges quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Very helpful product, but be careful - do not use it for a long beard, in this case you won&#x27;t be satisfied</li>
            <li>This razor worked very well from the first time I used it (no break-in period required, as suggested in instructions:but I have smooth skin and beard grows slowly).  </li>
            <li>Works like a champ used this to shave my head and it&#x27;s just as smooth as a razor and doesn&#x27;t irirtate my skin like all the other electrics I have tried</li>
            <li>The contents were not packed securely and when I opened the box containing the shaver, it had been tossed around and displaced due to not being secured within the box it was shipped in.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased, not only was he correct, I have not had a single bump in over 2 mos!</li>
            <li>am trying to get get a new one or a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to write this review until I had forgone the trial and tribulations of using a new shaver...</li>
            <li>Ordered a new foil.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thinking of buying a new Wahl soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying him a new screen now.  </li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t locate anyone with a new model 4000 in stock, I settled on this model 8061.</li>
            <li>This model 8061 will become my new travel razor.</li>
            <li>My husband needed a new one of these.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Braun in February that ran, but didn&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li>now still running like new bought the wahl shaver 6 months ago already went out on me.</li>
            <li>Being in the military, we have to keep a clean and neat appearance and this shaver works if you give it time.  </li>
            <li>I have to actually use a straight blade and a Gel shaving cream to get the hair to stand up straight, then cut it.  </li>
            <li>When charging, the red indicator light was always lit (but razor worked well for several shaves between charges).</li>
            <li>The product is advertised as a bump free shaver for African American skin.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be able to substitute it for my regular wahl balding clippers and andis shaver.</li>
            <li>I cant use razor and my skin is very sensitive and this does the trick</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very professional shaver, cuts close and don&#x27;t leave bumps or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>The motor also very loud.</li>
            <li>However, its also very loud.  </li>
            <li>Just the weight of your hand back and forth with very gentle strokes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other electric shavers and I pretty much got \\&quot;Burnt\\&quot; by them all either being Poorly made, or leaving my face sore and full of Ingrowns, but that&#x27;s not the case</li>
            <li>Its a clean shave you just have to go over certain areas a few times.</li>
            <li>not usually a fan of electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second shaver however since the first one stopped working because the on/off switch broke.  </li>
            <li>My barber uses this same exact shaver when he gives me a haircut.</li>
            <li>I am an African-American male and I have had problems with ingrown hairs while shaving with other electric shavers, razors, and magic shave.</li>
            <li>Since my first facial hair that started to grow in the 6th grade</li>
            <li>due to work (thankfully) i wasnt able to send it back for about 4 days.</li>
            <li>I only gave 3 stars because the clippers broke the first week</li>
            <li>Unfortunately i do not think he put everything back in the box</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this razor by my brother who had an extra one.</li>
            <li>My brother told me at first, don&#x27;t keep going over the same area over and over and over again</li>
            <li>While it is on the loud side, the bottom line is performance and for that I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I charged it only once when I first got the product</li>
            <li>I used my T-outliner&#x27;s first to fet it low and then finished with the 8601&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but it is too damn loud!</li>
            <li>This is my second Wahl shaver; the first one I bought is the Wahl 4000 shaving system which I also purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My fiancé has sensitive skin and will not buy anything else!</li>
            <li>I first learned of this shaver when my barber used it to trim my facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>It was the exact same one</li>
            <li>My first one had a retractable trimmer on the back.</li>
            <li>I have use many rechargeable shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get some canned air to clean it, brushes are a little too harsh for cleaning,</li>
            <li>what i really love about it is that i can shave right up to AND into my beard lines without shaving any of my beard at all (the holes on the foil are designed to shave very short hairs/stubble without cutting longer hairs) which allows me to get a clean daily shave right up to my beard lines.    </li>
            <li>This is definitely on the professional level and works so much better than any other 1 I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>He called Wahl and they are suppose to be sending new foils, but so far have to received.</li>
            <li>And work it does--clearing up four days&#x27; stubble in less than five minutes, and leaving my face as smooth as a blade shave.</li>
            <li>The first stopped taking a charge and would only work while plugged in - then completely stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li>Overall it has good reviews but for every customer that has a different face, different kinds of facial hair there will be different results.</li>
            <li>It works fine as long as you trim it down close with a trimmer first.  </li>
            <li>Heck, make the same exact product and model a purple-colored plastic version if you want to &amp;#34;girl-ify it&amp;#34; and not offend the men that we&#x27;re really using the same shaver.  </li>
            <li>more Braun, no more blades -- this shaver has a powerful motor and shaves very close with little effort.  </li>
            <li>However, after the very first use, my husband doesn&#x27;t get the results that we expected.  </li>
            <li>That kind of sucks!</li>
            <li>Clearly, how it looks is less important to Wahl than how it works.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of its promise of a super close shave and it does the job, but only if your beard is short, if you have a 3 day beard</li>
            <li>As I said, if your facial hair is more than 1/8 of inch long, use the Andis Style Liner/Trimmer first to get the hair down to a shaveable length and then just let the Wahl Shaver Shaper do the work.  </li>
            <li>Good enough to shave head daily, although the hair needs to be trimmed down short for it to work.</li>
            <li>I can skip a day here and there, but this shaver is designed to only cut hairs that are a certain length.</li>
            <li>pure garbage, if i had not used it i would have sent it back, but they would re-boxed resold it.</li>
            <li>I believe the item is giving the service expected, cannot give a first hand review as the purchase was for a friend.!...</li>
            <li>This is only ment for fine hairs to get you a close shave only after shaving with one of the above mentioned.</li>
            <li>A reasonable length of time, however, re-engineered with a replaceable battery and these shavers might last for ten years before needing to be replaced and at that point would then certainly rate FIVE STARS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for cutting bald...</li>
            <li>This is a shaver for guys who want a great shave without a lot of questionable add-ons and doo-dads that contribute nothing except extra cost.  </li>
            <li>May take a few times for skin to adjust, then it&#x27;s smooth shaving,strong motor,a lil  loud</li>
            <li>it I expected to have me smooth but just makes me look smooth to the common eye.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing based on some negative feedback.</li>
            <li>then the old razor did.</li>
            <li>and man was I surprised.</li>
            <li>my surprise he took out the Wahl professional and shaved my head</li>
            <li>but it is loud.</li>
            <li>The shaver also provides a close shave and so far for me no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li>far-</li>
            <li>My old one I had for over 10 years</li>
            <li>IT DOES&#x27;NT HAVE A POPUP TRIMER like my old one.</li>
            <li>So far no bumps.</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>Start on your face with a pair of Andis Outliners and finish to complete smoothness with the Wahl 8061.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber &amp; i</li>
            <li>use these frequently.</li>
            <li>Wahl Professional 8061</li>
            <li>He has used another Wahl product for years but this product outshines the old one for him.</li>
            <li>Professional?  </li>
            <li>I brought this for my 18 year old son.</li>
            <li>This is a must have tool, because it makes his skin so soft.</li>
            <li>If you get bumps from shaving or have sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy another one in a flash, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a week so far and no bumps.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised</li>
            <li>I used a Braun electric razor before, and would always have to make multiple passes when shaving heads for razor fades or whole head shaves, trying to not leave any stubble.</li>
            <li>returned for refund, its really loud and obnoxious.</li>
            <li>But as much as not getting so close to cause ingrown hairs, this is the only thing ever that is doing the trick.  </li>
            <li>Did some research and bought this as a gift for my 91 year old father.</li>
            <li>i nearly had tears in my eyes when i saw this.</li>
            <li>By far the closest shave of any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My barber used them on my head, so when I decided to shave the whole thing, it was an obvious choice.</li>
            <li>I had an old one and used it for this.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>When I received this shaver, I was like &amp;#34; Wahl tricked  me for $50.00, it is too much&amp;#34; because it was just too lite, had a 2V battery, and does not look professional.</li>
            <li>Many people have complained of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>While riding in the car on 95 I ordered it and thanks to Prime he had a replacement the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The gold overlay/foil that protects your skin from the blades has completely come off.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is wow...</li>
            <li>Thus far..</li>
            <li>Can you imagine what the images for the reviews would be for straight razors by people who didn&#x27;t learn how to use something properly?</li>
            <li>think it is a bit noisy, mines a couple of years old</li>
            <li>Loud it gives you a headache&lt;br</li>
            <li>The back side should have a straight edge shaper, and it is not there.</li>
            <li>(the cord would fall out with vibration of the unit, to the point where I needed to hold the cord in place, while shaving), at four months, it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>That model is really built to last.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll share what has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>Big thanks to Wahl for addressing the issue and providing an affordable solution.  </li>
            <li>an very curly african hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate shave with a clipper</li>
            <li>I reall Like this shaver, I have been looking for a shaver that will help my sensitive condition.  </li>
            <li>A professional shaver that can be used for you face as well as your head.</li>
            <li>Once this is don you can shave every day and if you skip a couple of days of shaves use T-outliner&#x27;s and complete with the 8601&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use it early mornings when I wake up for fear of not waking my roommate with this noisy shaver.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 50 years old and have tried just about  every shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Had to go back to straight razor.</li>
            <li>One day I used the personal groomer, with the shaving attachment, to shave my whole face.  </li>
            <li>That is when I picked out the Wahl Professional 8061</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to loud</li>
            <li>We got this shaver recommended by a professional.</li>
            <li>The man using this razor is 83 years old.</li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>But smooth shave, takes few weeks to get used to  skin</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 19 yr old son.</li>
            <li>and I have to shave just about every day in order to look professional.</li>
            <li>This shaver takes me about 1 minute to completely shave my face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It performed admirably, a bit loud, as others have noted but gave me a close shave.</li>
            <li>No scratches and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver -</li>
            <li>thing looks like its something you&#x27;d find in your grandfather&#x27;s attic after he dies.&lt;br /&gt;Its about as loud as a chainsaw.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have perfectly straight hair and some hairs curl inwards, this will simply not get them and thus not cut them.</li>
            <li>Another reason I dislike this is that it&#x60;s posted as professional</li>
            <li>Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver Shaper]]</li>
            <li>However, it is unlikely it will be useful with a week-long beard (instructions suggest beard should be at most 1/32&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In fact, the shaver seems powerful enough to mow the back 40</li>
            <li>I was hoping something made in the USA would be good unfortunately this one was not.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it is easy to use (if your beard is not to long), gives a very close shave and the battery lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li>To be fair, it&#x27;s possibel there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing right, but this has been a bad experience.</li>
            <li>I am a black man, first of all, and bumps are something that I am very prone to having.</li>
            <li>keeps it tight and clean inbetween haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many African American men do not like shaving due to the  increase of irratating hair bumps.</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp and it really is the closest thing to a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>It is small and easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li>jus have to make sure your hair is already trimmed (cant be long at all) and go over skin gently.. if you press hard youll get razor bumps</li>
            <li>Based on the many positive reviews, and the affordable price, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, loud, and can be harsh if you use it wrong.  </li>
            <li>I am in African American male without a full beard</li>
            <li>It works better in those cases if one does NOT mash down on the face but rather simply shave repeatedly in different directions.</li>
            <li>Immediately, I sent the item back to the seller who has yet to refund the amount paid for a new product!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;R.R. Harris, author of Double Take, An Island Travel Mystery of Lively Romance and Deadly Betrayal, available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As a 35 year old black man I never thought I could achieve such a smooth shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>If I shave with it everyday, I get a clean 100 cut.</li>
            <li>The only shave i had close to this was with the older phillips with the goo.</li>
            <li>Overall I would suggest that people look for a source for the older style Wahl shavers and get one of those instead of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of Hispanic decent and my facial hair grows</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched for and used numerous electric razors and all work decent on my skin.</li>
            <li>I shaved for the first time with this Wahl shaver last Thursday night the same day</li>
            <li>My only regret is it does not have a mustasche trimmer as my older model did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extremely close shave right off the bat</li>
            <li>I have to say I had such high expectations for this shaver.</li>
            <li>I wonder how others consumers could rate this product as highly as they did in the reviews that I read prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>From reading other reviews I guess maybe other black males have tougher skin than mine and maybe thats why they had better success with this shaver.</li>
            <li>i checked on the reviews and seen other african american reviews and were happy i found something.but the pricing point and some of the negative reviews swayed me away for a week or too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years (thanks to my old barber) and it definitely works - BUT only for stubble-length hair.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time and seems very durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had used Norelco razors all my life and this only became an issue the last few years and probably relates to my age more then the razor.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it in that mode normally as it would likely kill the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just be mindful, it is for very short stubble.. not for normal shaving.</li>
            <li>I reverted back to my old style-- using blades and my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white but my facial hair tends to curl right back into my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried being super gentle and applying barely any pressure, but it couldn&#x27;t pick up any hairs that were lying down and required multiple passes to pick up regular stubble.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I had the proper tools and a little bit of knowledge on how to use a soldering gun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to send it back and see if I can get a new one.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver and after looking at various products decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>However, I will probably order a new Wahl model 4000, once they are back in stock for my every day razor.</li>
            <li>It is critical that every black man struggling with razor bumps understand that FOIL ELECTRIC RAZORS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ALLEVIATE RAZOR BUMPS IN BLACK MEN.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it has become harder and harder to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve completely razor bump free I am an african American male and the military</li>
            <li>I am an African American &amp; I havea very stubborn beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50+ yr old white guy with sensitive skin, so I approached this purchase with skepticism.</li>
            <li>Your facial hair that grown out straight will actually stick through the foils and get cut by the razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, I&#x27;d say just as close as a blade, but it will only work on stubble or very short beard growth.  </li>
            <li>long as you keep your hair pretty short (which I always do)</li>
            <li>Still have to go over my neck with a blade occasionally, and the fact that the whole shaver isn&#x27;t washable is why it only has a 4 star and not 5 from me.</li>
            <li>, that also arrived quickly, but it too was missing the shaper.</li>
            <li>and I realize it only cost $50, but I truly expected higher quality and did not expect to need repair this early after purchase.</li>
            <li>Big ups to Wahl for putting this product out, not usually a fan of Wahl but this one takes the Cake..</li>
            <li>The problem I am having is the power switch wont keep the razor running, I have to hold the switch in and up to the on position to shave which is a major pain.  </li>
            <li>The first week did get razor bumps or burns however using aloe vera gel and exfoliating head just about every other day cleared everything up.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you are cutting srubble it does not cut moderate to full length beards.</li>
            <li>With my other grooming tools, I&#x27;ve always found Andis to be of higher quality than Wahl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much gone with a beard or a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow since I was a teen due to my first few encounters with razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>First it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that other reviews gave it, I have only used this product twice because before I ever put it on my head it used it on my beard and it barely removed any hair.</li>
            <li>The very next day my face was super sensitive and would sting a little if I touched my face or under my neck.</li>
            <li>You have to shave down the beard to a low level before you use it, and then use the shaver to just make it super close.</li>
            <li>It did wonderful shaving around the sides of my face but often completely missed slightly longer hairs on my neck and painfully pulled on the mustache ones.</li>
            <li>but not as expected not really close to a clean shave</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to razor bumps, but this thing has not left me with a rash of ingrowns or irritated skin like the older electrics occasionally did.  </li>
            <li>This is the scond one I used, so I like it very much, I will buy an other one, if I should live so long</li>
            <li>also it is pretty noisy but unless you live inside a library, it shouldnt be that big of a problem to hear for less than 5 minutes a day</li>
            <li>But if you go slowly and do not press hard -- let the razor do the work -- you will get a remarkably close shave.</li>
            <li>Must be careful with it especially when carrying the device in a bag with other things because the case can come off and get lost easily.</li>
            <li>Generally, I use my Andies t-liner to line everything up.</li>
            <li>recharges fast &amp; last a long time</li>
            <li>it is way too small to fit a fully grown facial hair.</li>
            <li>This Wahl razor is about the same cost as replacement heads on the old razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, after about two months it barely cuts at all.  </li>
            <li>WOW, THEY FINALLY CAME OUT WITH A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR USERS THAT DON&#x27;T WANNA USE RAZOR BLADES.</li>
            <li>Was surprised how close of a shave it actually gives</li>
            <li>even though they didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as I would like, it was neat enough for a professional appearance.</li>
            <li>The unit cuts very close without causing bumps that African American people get religiously.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re currently processing your review and we will emaias soon as this is complete.</li>
            <li>You may have an occasional ingrown hair that you can pull out with the tweezers, but this beats the \\&quot;old bumpy bump\\&quot; face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an italian guy with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Pros: Can be used as a revenge tool to disturb your neighbors if their loud sex wakes you up in the middle of the night&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downsides are that there is no trimmer and it is loud.  </li>
            <li>This was purchased for my 92 year old father in law who insist Wahl is the only product that can give him the shave he likes.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement to his current one that got old.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have clients who want that close shave, but there skin can&#x27;t handle the razor directly on there skin.</li>
            <li>In reality, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true but for around $50 and 90% as close, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this shaver, but alas I can not.  </li>
            <li>I even used my manual razor to get it all the way down first.</li>
            <li>I still use the clippers first to cut down any growth, but then I use the Wahl shaver to get close.</li>
            <li>but you do have to trim it down first.  </li>
            <li>These razors are not easy to find, and I&#x27;m mystified that they are not more popular.</li>
            <li>I have tried it dry, with a liquid pre-shave called Kyoku (GREAT stuff, by the way, albeit expensive), and with Remington&#x27;s dry wax pre-shave sticks.  </li>
            <li>reason black males get razor bumps in the first place is because our hair is too curly.</li>
            <li>Your hair has to be pretty short when using this razor because it DOES NOT have a Pop-Up Trimmer like other Electric</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver for the African American male to use to closely shave the head.</li>
            <li>Now, my other son wants the razor, his birthday is coming up</li>
            <li>One day, my son told me about the Wahl dry razor the barber used on him while in New York.</li>
            <li>Everytime i went to the barber for a complete haircut and shave of a shapeup it will begin to grow back on the beginning of the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got some &#x27;crazy&#x27; whiskers that have to be cut from several directions and this shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li>It is a little tender at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little funny that the instruction says to give it a couple of weeks for my body to get used to the shaver.  </li>
            <li>removed all my ingrowns with tweezers first, then used the Andis Outliner edgers, then the Wahl shavers to clean any remaing stubbles (going over areas no more than twice, excessive usages in the same area irritates the skin), rubbing alcohol, finally applyin bumpstopper sensitive skin twice</li>
            <li>It does not get all the hairs, especially if you have Patches that usually grow longer than others, but if you start w/ a clean shave, and use the shaver daily \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>I say not a lot of bumps because during the second week of use I got a few bumps under my chin and right by the jaw line, hence the 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li>I found immediately that you must NOT push hard on this shaver like you do with most of the other ones.  </li>
            <li>The product came very fast, when using this product remember that your facial hair needs to be very short to trim down with this machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that I still have not found anything that can give me a closer shave than the Andis trimmer I use, but I guess I just have to accept it for now and be happy not to have any in-grown hairs or bumps after I shave.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to return the item but decided the time needed to do so was not worth it.</li>
            <li>I am a young 19 year african american male.</li>
            <li>Specs: 30 year old African American male who shaves every day.  </li>
            <li>I have very coarse facial hair and this thing cuts it down pretty close for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery</li>
            <li>When purchasing an item, it is expected that I would receive an item in brand new conditon.</li>
            <li>It was never able to get the hair right beneath my nose or under my chin or on my neck, but it did alright on the mustache and around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes right past it without a hair shaved.</li>
            <li>but if it similar to mine pretty much everyday once a day in the night or morning.</li>
            <li>electric shaver will ever compare to the smoothness you can get from a razor when you want to have soft, &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; legs with your guy, but I believe this is as close as I can get for normal, everyday &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; use.  </li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old black male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my young adult with down syndrome to teach him how to shave himself.  </li>
            <li>I have used clippers and other electric shavers, but they didn&#x27;t shave close enough and as I got older</li>
            <li>Sadly, the place on the back where the trimmer *was* on older models, has been filled in with a blank piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional, with a little effort, gives me a smoother neck than any razor I have yet tried (but I&#x27;m only 86 years old)!  </li>
            <li>The shaver works very well with short hairs not a full beard.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Professional 8061 5 Star dry razor should be in every African Americans bathroom medicine cabinet as well as for different nationalities.</li>
            <li>Another thing lacking is that with the old Wahl&#x27;s you use to get several choices of shaving heads to use, this one only has the single one it comes with.</li>
            <li>At times a little touch up is need with a trimmer (I have some very stubborn gray hairs).  </li>
            <li>I have to purchase a new screen every other month.</li>
            <li>it costs me a little less than it would to buy mens razors if I was clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>It was such a depressing fact, comming from someone who dresses nicely but my facial hair would mess up the whole outfit.</li>
            <li>Loved this razor to bad</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have the challenge with bumps that many African-American men have (I am white), I do have crazy sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I get best results by washing my face before and after shaving, and I don&#x27;t use this razor on more than a day&#x27;s beard growth, as it is designed to shave stubble, not hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good price great product</li>

            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> I tried this one a year ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> But the product was so good I had to have another one.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.  </li>
            <li> , I forgot they don&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a good hand razor.  </li>
            <li> Product does not do a good job shaving it is easier and quicker to use a razor</li>
            <li> and you are good for another year or so.</li>
            <li> That is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It is a good value though.</li>
            <li> I could not get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> It work great nice close shave in 3 - 5 mins.</li>
            <li> good skin shaving machine</li>
            <li> it shave me good except the neck area.</li>
            <li> or so I began to get some really good results,and now plan to keep</li>
            <li> Does good job shaving.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day it is good but it will not shave you if you skip a day  </li>
            <li> You need the trimmer, shaver doesn&#x27;t do good job on sideburns.</li>
            <li> All in all it seems to be a good product for my needs, and</li>
            <li> Whilst thIs shaver does a good job, there is still room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I always read that no electric razor would be as good as razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Well, this one is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> and when it comes to this shaver my clients have LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> and my face felt good.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved this until it broke</li>
            <li> He is a barber and loved it.</li>
            <li> He definitely loved that it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Good product, it still does not remove my hair the way that I thought it was going to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Another good wahl product.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on my head but either I didn&#x27;t have the patience to do a good job</li>
            <li> Good razer delivered on time</li>
            <li> Good Luck.  </li>
            <li> and he said wahl is good choice and when i asked why he told me thats a brand that barbers trust.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver, holds a good charge, no need to recharge as often.</li>
            <li> Car exceeded my expectations, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves GREAT but is kind of loud.&lt;br /&gt;😊</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine told me about this product</li>
            <li> Experience was good however the product was not what I thought.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about it is that it is portable</li>
            <li> If expectations are set accordingly, it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> does a good job.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
            <li> Good Performing Shaver in my opinion</li>
            <li> Once again i cant stress how good of a product this is.</li>
            <li> Works good.  </li>
            <li> It worked good for a month.</li>
            <li> Good tool use it at work for balding dudes that can&#x27;t take a blade</li>
            <li> Still using with good results</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> Everything I heard is Absolutely true the 5 star shaver shaper is a good product and I rate it (5 STARS!!!)</li>
            <li> As I have said before I would try to talk my best friend into useing this razor as I have had several and it is the best of the group.</li>

            <li> 5-star Series Deluxe Rechargeable Shaver Shaper&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it, works so good</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to give me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver seemed nice</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair as well.</li>
            <li> Still nice for a barber though.</li>
            <li> Its not a problem if you have a nice \\&quot;shape up\\&quot; trimmer tho.</li>
            <li> Neat, effective and efficient</li>
            <li> Nice product, Wahl.</li>
            <li> I have to use a razor there which kind of defeats the purpose of using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> i honestly believed that nothing would work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, just what the doctor ordered, awesome shaver, buy one today, its a home run, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Did not shave as close as I would of liked.  </li>
            <li> but I find it does a good job on my neck if I don&#x27;t go more than a day between uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is good because for the most part your skin doesn&#x27;t make contact with the cutter bar, that&#x27;s where the foil comes into play.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when he&#x27;s driving over the road.</li>
            <li> he loves it and is loving the difference in his skin when he uses it.</li>
            <li> You may try it if you are looking for a nice looking shaver.</li>
            <li> It has surpassed another shaver, and that one is also a popular brand, which I no longer use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Impressed very close shave.</li>
            <li> Took the wrapper off and turn it own without the charger and started shaving...............</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and Shaves nice and close</li>
            <li> nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had my head and beard exposed to this tool by my barber and loved the results then and now that I own one, I remain in love with the tool.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was very strong and gave an amazingly close shave.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding performance, close and clean shave, good product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, great gift!</li>
            <li> I really love the super close shave with no bumps or irritation!!!</li>
            <li> precisely what it&#x27;s meant to, and cuts remarkably close.</li>
            <li> MORE IMPORTANT is the GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I got from Wahl.</li>
            <li> A good close shaver - easy to use, charge, portable...</li>
            <li> does a great job quickly and no razor bumps</li>
            <li> The battery life is not that great but adequate.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and could not tolerate using it on his face but uses it on his head and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to</li>
            <li> Very easy to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Very strong motor.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle and</li>
            <li> This very good to use when you want to get really close.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be good to prevent ingrown hairs and help keep bikini area smooth like the reviews stated, but no go.</li>
            <li> This is the best professional shaver you can buy.  </li>
            <li> This is the very best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> He explained to me that it perfumed well and did an excellent job leaving his face as soft as the skin on your arm or hand.</li>
            <li> But from a professional standpoint, the power is awesome.</li>
            <li> I wished instructions guided me better on how to effectively use the product.  </li>
            <li> This thing is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Best experience I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver by far.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Shaver is excellent!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Wahl Professional 8061.</li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> Really surprised  because I thought they are had an excellent shave</li>
            <li> By far the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> By far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> this is the most amazing shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It will not but it is a good supplementary shaver and will keep the head smooth.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have tried to shave off these curly hairs before the become ingrown.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> this is your best bet by far.</li>
            <li> , I am hispanic with very fine hair and it also did not do anything...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , I bought a five star wahl and is good with a close shave!</li>
            <li> I ordered the shaver and have been using it for my head and beard, it is wonderful ,smooth and fast no nicks or rash</li>
            <li> We thought that by buying this machine he would be able to get rid of his razors, but he still needs them because the machine won&#x27;t give him a nice finish, making it more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; colored shaver doesn&#x27;t even have a side burn trimmer, makes rattling noises, and doesn&#x27;t provide a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver works perfect for men of color who are wanting a very close, bump free shave.</li>
            <li> First couple of use were great but after that</li>
            <li> It worked great the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li> This is great, but the foils came apart the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li> He was pretty happy with the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> Good quality not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Very light and portable!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Just do as it says -- use a VERY light touch (which keeps your face from getting irritated)</li>
            <li> Once you get use to the shaver it leaves your face very smooth.</li>
            <li> and my first use was great better than a disposable razor to me</li>
            <li> dang it works great, my head is clean and smooth after 7-8 minutes,  Works better if your hair is</li>
            <li> Good product and quick shipping, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> shaves well, nice size , easy to handle.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s elderly and this was so easy for him to use on his own</li>
            <li> When used in tandem with the great classic Andis T-Outliner you&#x27;ll be the smoothest guy at the party!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a defective unit bot sure.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> You can buy a $20 Remington from Walmart and it will give a better shave.</li>
            <li> He gets a close shave with it, almost as close as with a safety razor, so he is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked okay for about a month.  </li>
            <li> He uses it to shave his face mostly.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Noisy as all hell :-)</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Glad I noticed</li>
            <li> Probably save me 30 minutes or more over that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> My son was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl Shavers for many years and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> No stubble! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love my bald fader.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and has more power.</li>
            <li> This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased that one for about $20 more in a retail beauty store.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos most of my life.</li>
            <li> But I like this razor better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited two weeks and instead of using this item, I&#x27;ve reverted to Magic Power.  </li>
            <li> This is the most commonsense shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> i have tried many electric razors before.</li>
            <li> many of them seemed to yank out the hair moreso than cut it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and I have the Braun which I thought was a close shave</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> You will love it too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to let the battery fully discharge before recharging, to prolong battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a razor because you don&#x27;t need shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Use in my barber shop and love it</li>
            <li> I have only shaved with it twice, but it was the best shave i have ever had.</li>
            <li> This actually works best on thicker hair, but also gets the thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not use it on my beard.</li>
            <li> Magic Shaver is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Beware of this cheap product!</li>
            <li> Oh, I started using the BIC Soleil on my head and as you can guess as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I am going to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> have had many over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend just tapping the top part when cleaning it, dont brush it or you might break it.</li>
            <li> Most people would probably not even notice it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver and it was ok.</li>
            <li> Please be sure that the ones that he uses on his clients work.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash/burn or bumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Remington Electric Razor for years and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> It does and excellent job if you shave daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so much better than the hundreds of bumps I used to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer still get bumps here and there</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Better that a blade....</li>
            <li> The foil top started to rip after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> He seems to like it alot and is glad that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Works great and shaves very close.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple days I dont even notice it touching me when I shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, great unit!</li>
            <li> I love this and it will go with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> I love how it works.</li>
            <li> so i tried one more despearte attempt at this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper and does a better job clearing my undergrowth.</li>
            <li> can I say Top of the line shaver.</li>
            <li> If you let your hair go more than a couple days between cuts, you might as well not even pull it out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for many, many years, except after wilderness trips on which I couldn&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several razors, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> One day my barber pulled out the shaver and the love affair with this razor</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It came with three different heads, to provide the type of shave that worked best for you.  </li>
            <li> Youre better of with a gillette mach 5</li>
            <li> foils that you see on the top are there to protect your face.</li>
            <li> Once I read to reverse and go and upward strokes, I was greatly satisfied with the close shave.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My son love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, Ive had it for a month and the top metal thing frayed and broke easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smooth shaves!</li>
            <li> You should be able to see the pictures I uploaded to see the condition of my face.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver,  I bought</li>
            <li> You are going to love shaving after using Wahl shaver shaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, OK.</li>
            <li> I love this equipment.</li>
            <li> Choose another product and make sure you have a return policy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no picnic using this shaver over using razor blades, but I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s more docile on one&#x27;s face than a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember to moisturize afterwards! :)</li>
            <li> Love it, better priced than going to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> see many barbers and beauty salons use this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Had hoped for better shave.  </li>
            <li> Okay for quickie</li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x60;ll revert to the razor when I want a better shave.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s for sure.</li>

            <li> I always either wash my face or take a shower after I shave and then apply the Bump Rescue by Magic</li>
            <li> G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]].    </li>
            <li> Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for travelling and the battery holds about a week with daily use.</li>
            <li> work great and fast...</li>
            <li> Glad I got this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is wireless.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a couple months, but have not been able to use it longer than a week at a time without having to replace the foil which keeps tearing and scratching my head up.</li>
            <li> But the foil on top also ripped apart one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schick Hydro 5 since then and love it.</li>
            <li> Anything Wahl I will be glad to avoid and inform friends and relatives to avoid also.</li>
            <li> Worked well, just needs to cut more than stubble.</li>
            <li> Iam sure its the blade.</li>
            <li> Its Recommended by barbers and the best part it actually gives a CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE!</li>
            <li> Although WAHL could replace it or fix it, I was able to fix it myself by opening it up.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver</li>
            <li> and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver, but still can&#x27;nt figure out how to use the cleaner.</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave with great battery and electric power.  </li>
            <li> Buy it and be glad.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied after using this product for a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair removal powders which actually provided the best results</li>
            <li> I must say that it looks a lot better</li>
            <li> or I have too many nooks and crannies on my scalp because there were too many patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t do more to promote the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love the way his face feels.</li>
            <li> This shaver will leave you babyface smooth!</li>
            <li> I love Wahl shavers and this one produces a great shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My husband has never been really satisfied with any shavers but this.</li>
            <li> they love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and I will probably get more items from Wahl.</li>
            <li> Wish I stockpiled more of those.</li>
            <li> and I love that he loves the shaver.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly, looks, works, and operates as advertised, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had it used on me when I was driving a semi several years ago and was impressed and now that I found it and have it</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> but without the razor bumps :-)</li>
            <li> your bald, you will love it</li>
            <li> just wanted to ssay that i&#x27;m glad i purchased this shaver.</li>
            <li> Priced OK.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun for many years and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> but he paid about 30 dollars more than I.</li>
            <li> It cuts most of my beard, but undoubtedly there will always be some remaining hairs.  </li>
            <li> (I paid $50 for this and it is much better than the $200 Braun).</li>
            <li> I have so many electric razors and money invested</li>
            <li> I have used and worn out many electric shavers over the years and was looking for one that would be durable, reasonably priced and of course, give me a great shave, so enter Wahl.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used ones that were about 200+ dollars more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it have been using wahl products for over 20 years</li>
            <li> This is a great machine, powerful and precise.</li>
            <li> Husband is pleased with results.</li>
            <li> The close shave more than makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my barber does something to make it work better, but out of the box, I did not care for this shaver and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I had for several years and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver a must have !</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say than just don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I brought one because they all were pleased with it.</li>
            <li> a good smooth, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> So far so good !</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s got my clean shaven, liked it</li>
            <li> I cut and clean my own hair now.</li>
            <li> It gives him a nice clean shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> the price is pretty good also.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this shaver and it did what it promoted.</li>
            <li> None made today are as good as the first Sunbeam that got me started using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Could do a better job shaving, but not bad!</li>
            <li> Shaver is still going Strong, I think I&#x27;m more dependent on it now than before.</li>
            <li> love it just the foil is easy to damage</li>
            <li> I’ve used both the Close and Super Close combs and liked them both.</li>
            <li> Shaver is quite good product, it works good but does not shave close enough.</li>
            <li> much more powerful than a Braun 3 series which I also own.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE it .. if you are like me and want to keep you head or face smooth</li>
            <li> Close and clean shave!</li>
            <li> Then used the shaver to clean everything up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but the top is keeping break</li>
            <li> , It was amazing ,smooth and clean .When</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best product for a very, very close shave and yet no razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, gets a really close shave and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> It works great with sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> They also said the shaver is still available, too, though they sell more often to barber shops with this product than to end users.  </li>
            <li> So after stumbling upon this Wahl bump free shaver I was somewhat optimistic that maybe I&#x27;ll finally be able to get</li>
            <li> perfect no shaving bumps use this before wet shaving</li>
            <li> is agreat product, for many years I wore a light beard because shaving close resulted in razor bumps: even with that stinky paste.</li>
            <li> Powerful, efficient and effective.</li>
            <li> Loved this electric razor so much I bought one for my Father who loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much maybe 10 times doesn&#x27;t cut Aa good Aa</li>
            <li> , this is a great shaver which is easy on your sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Surely that omission should have been given in the description, so I would call that description a little misleading at best.</li>
            <li> Sweet savings!</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for $50!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I took it easy, just as the instructions suggested, and let the shaver do all the work.  </li>
            <li> He has been looking for a good, smooth shaving, gentle razor for years.  </li>
            <li> Easily comparable to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> and to be honest most shavers were made for caucasians,not minorities who really doesnt suffer from razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This razor is very quick and convenient, however a bit on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> head comes off easy for cleaning, and the replacement parts are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it can easily get to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Easily buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> EASY</li>
            <li> I prefer a clean cut close shaved look, but like most African-American men I suffer from razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The one flaw this product has is that the foil breaks or flakes off to easy</li>
            <li> Strong motor and efficient.</li>
            <li> i am not a barber, but wanted something for quick clean ups when i couldnt reach my own barber.</li>
            <li> Plug in and strong</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong after a week.  </li>
            <li> but my beard seems to grow softer to teh touch not as strong kinky after using this</li>
            <li> Very good quality much better then other shavers used.</li>
            <li> The aluminum was damaged quickly from the pressure applied, but it STILL works fine!</li>
            <li> Great for touch ups or for general shaving.  </li>
            <li> This is ok but not as good asy $20 norelco especially normal use leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> works great for giving your skin a nice break as well of getting extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Its power is so strong it cuts super close!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and extremely close shave!  </li>
            <li> It is super powerful and if there is one thing you can bet on with Wahl is that this thing will surely hold a charge!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product works just fine.</li>
            <li> great product for the price, close shave and the item arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Shaver excellent, previous shavers had a trimmer and case included in the order.</li>
            <li> We returned it, I am not sure how there are so many comments on how great this works when IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> BEST FOIL SHAVER IN THE BUSINESS FOR BLACK MEN.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, shipped fast and works great as intended.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, works best on hair that is less than 1/16\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and gives me the smooth shaven head I&#x27;ve craved without the bumps.  </li>
            <li> if you do that then it would work fine</li>
            <li> Everything else was fine: the delivery, the packaging, the service...</li>
            <li> but it cuts right through it easily!</li>
            <li> and PURE PURE PURE PURE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap replacement for the fine quality product we used to get from Germany.</li>
            <li> I have owned my wahl 8061 for a little over 3 months now and can say without a doubt the best electric shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> I am Very Pleased with the Wahl Professional 8061!!</li>
            <li> Other then that its a perfect shaver for quick buzz</li>
            <li> This is literally the best $50 I have ever spent!!!  </li>
            <li> The multi- blade shavers are great for smooth looks and up close shaving but the irritation afterwards and ever facial killer razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to clean</li>
            <li> The close shave is almost as smooth as razor shaving.</li>
            <li> but this will get you that smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I works great as a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> While a two year warranty on the product, which I was told by customer service is made in the U.S.A. weighed favorably toward the purchase, I find that the product seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and then this shaver to get it smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, but it looks, feels and sounds like a cheap device.  </li>
            <li> razor to get close and smooth.</li>
            <li> leaves skin smooth ...</li>
            <li> The shaver is not razor smooth yet gives a close shaved look.</li>
            <li> granted my skin is smooth....</li>
            <li> Close shave, comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Then the bump free made sense to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber and after trying many electric shavers its obvious that you don&#x27;t have to spend tons of money to get the best product.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close and comfortable with no razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> It gets the skin silky smooth without leaving bumps or a rash.  </li>
            <li> It is light, all plastic (what isn&#x27;t these days?)</li>
            <li> Close\\&quot; foils are available separately--and inexpensively--from Amazon.)  </li>
            <li> I just hope parts are still available as it&#x27;s no longer listed in Wahl&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> this shaver it leaves the skin feeling smooth and the bonus</li>
            <li> Great Solid Product, hopefully it stands the test of time!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I receive a smooth pain free shave every time I use this product.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and Bump free.</li>
            <li> It is not bump free.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and feel free to buy it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m buying another because I know it&#x27;s going to give me a hassle-free smooth shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the $100 ones that they show on TV where you get a couple of days of smooth skin and then a razor bumb nightmare.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these and it works great.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave after using a clipper.</li>
            <li> Face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth and close.  </li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, it works great but the foil is broke already on its 3rd use!</li>
            <li> No razor bumps, rechargeable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The closest shave you will ever enjoy.</li>
            <li> My barber uses the same and it works great.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be the best shaving equipment instead it gives me bumps after few hours of using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me with any bumps and it gives a smooth feel of skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Cut was not as smooth.</li>
            <li> Ok so i rarely ever write any type of reviews for anything, but this was a must.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt as smooth as i wanted it to be as if i came from the barber</li>
            <li> smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why people would use this over a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Hair must be real short before you use it, its great blade to bald your head.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth close shave, without any bumps or irritations.</li>
            <li> compact, easy to clean, works well with or without cord.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean &amp; close shave.</li>
            <li> It gives you a smooth shave and you don&#x60;t even have to press it on your body.  </li>
            <li> Yes bump free.</li>
            <li> I like that replacement blades and foil heads are inexpensive and available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One month of light use, the foil tore.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for the face and upper neck</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, clean, and use this often.</li>
            <li> great for this White guy.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> My wife has even commented on how smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li> Great for a regular maintenance of my beard and  shaved head.     </li>
            <li> It leaves my head feeling smooth though.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s light and prone to nicks, scratches, and cuts.  </li>
            <li> it makes it smooth</li>
            <li> His skin is always so smooth after he uses it with no bumps and he can use it on his clients.</li>
            <li> As an African-American man, I&#x27;ve always wanted a smooth shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth face with no bumps.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s important for him to have that Independence</li>
            <li> I have struggled for years to find a shaving method that provides for a close bump free shave.  </li>
            <li> Finally I apply an aftershave balm and I&#x27;m done...looking as fly as</li>
            <li> This shaver is a very close shave and works quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Your clients will really enjoy this product too.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the foil is somewhat cheap and may need to be replace every now and then (maybe in 1-2 years, depends on your care of product)</li>
            <li> Glad to pay the money again, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Price was great but the produced didn&#x27;t cut me close enough.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Bump Free Shave&amp;#34; not a chance.</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, besides a few stubborn hairs here</li>
            <li> It is slightly more powerful plugged in.</li>
            <li> but its not bump free as described.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and replace blades.</li>
            <li> it get&#x27;s your face and head as smooth as if you had used a razor on it</li>
            <li> I did not know these were still available.</li>
            <li> I noticed how smooth my face felt.  </li>
            <li> This Wahl does give a close shave, but greatly irritated my skin and left my face burning.</li>
            <li> It was a close shave ( the two I got out of it ) and cheap price</li>
            <li> Its a great product and especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is easy to maintain and clean as well.</li>
            <li> Works great on face as well, same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to it as I really liked the feel of it at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my barber used, and I got a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product recommended by my barber.</li>
            <li> which I know its not from it cheap feel</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> but this is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Not up to par for Me , good price but loud  </li>
            <li> The only feature it lacks, to make it an all-around excellent shaver, is an edge trimmer like on the model 4000.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because so many guys &amp;#34;of color&amp;#34; loved it and was worried that it may not work for a white dude.</li>
            <li> the cut is so far so good</li>
            <li> But this particular shaver has his face looking amazing, smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li> And the exact amount of money!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful....</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean because the head comes off, and water can be used to clean the foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> My barber suggested it for my head shaving, and I think it&#x27;s the best electric shaver, powerful, giving a very close shave, easy to clean, a little noisy but not the end of the world, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves him with a clean smooth Shave.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean and use it with 1 day of growth and you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> This process works, but these clippers still don&#x27;t make my face smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> during those four days i had an important event and went to the barber to clean my face up .</li>
            <li> /&gt;3) SUPER lightweight and easy to hold and manuever.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, very nice trimmer long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> cleans everything right up close and quick with very light pressure.</li>
            <li> It works well with all of them (a tad better than dry with a good pre-shave).</li>
            <li> I find that if I shave and edge my face with my normal electric trimmer this works AMAZINGLY well to get me</li>
            <li> you are getting what I think is worth $100+ for this type of shaver!</li>
            <li> No brothers want that look unless you are rich like Billy Gates.</li>
            <li> After my barber recommend that I purchase this specific shaver, I was more than pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my head but, soon found out that I can also use it for my face without it causing bumps.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of an electric shaver for many years and it performs admirably.</li>
            <li> It has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say if your beard is more than 1/32 of an inch use trimmer first.</li>
            <li> , i didn&#x27;t keep the original packing that&#x27;s why i had to toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of electric razors and they all seem to leave that &#x27;&#x27;need a shave&#x27;&#x27; feeling; however, this Wahl does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li> and he was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> No skin irritation or bumbs, this is an awesome product, when using don&#x27;t press too hard just lightly smooth strokes.</li>
            <li> I can live without it, but it would be nice to have for sideburns.  </li>
            <li> The reviews said it would be great for sensitive skin areas that need the closer shave like the pubic area for real close smoothness.</li>
            <li> Helps me keep my face clean faster than with a razor.  </li>
            <li> If he skips a day, the shaver will not give him a clean shave and he has to use another one as well.</li>
            <li> I must say it doesn&#x27;t cut clean as I thought.</li>
            <li> a smooth shave, almost as good as a regular manual</li>
            <li> If i want to shave after a day or two, i have to use razorless products to get clean cut and then use this machine to keep it clean cut every day and that makes it work and leaves no bump.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean up razor.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my clients&#x27; neck area, and for one I use it for a bald fade.</li>
            <li> This is what I bought this razor for- a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> so you have to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> Makes him super smooth and never gives him any bumps or breakouts.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I even use it twice a day since I like a clean shaved head.  </li>
            <li> He gets a clean close shave with no issues from this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Its rechargeable, portable, and gives him the clean close look he desires.  </li>
            <li> to get the clean shave...</li>
            <li> When it was working it did give me a clean shave with no bumps.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean, polished look and it doesn&#x27;t snag skin or hair.</li>
            <li> I do the outline with an Andis outliner, clean up with this, and then moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I must admit it does handle the wrinkled face and gives him a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A CLEAN SHAVE</li>
            <li> The reason why I bought this was because my barber used it to clean up my face when I got a haircut</li>
            <li> clean shave and no razor bumps</li>
            <li> And I thought I paid enough to safely insure this product had that kind of merit?</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a recommendation from my barber who uses it to clean up my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I would think the original ni-cad battery would last longer than 3 years, but it might be good for others to know that replacing this battery is NOT a user friendly task.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 8061 5-star is exactly what I have been searching for and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great all-around razor that will shave your face as well as your head.</li>
            <li> Even the replacement foil &amp; blade is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;There may be other shavers that shave as close -- but, for me, the Wahl shaver is a quality, well-built product that gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric razor; Braun, Norelco, Remington.  </li>
            <li> Close shaving, specially for an A.American as I am.</li>
            <li> A clean smooth shave, worth the price.</li>
            <li> very good shaver, i did have to replace the head after a few times used.</li>
            <li> Very good at fighting bumps, but....it is advertised as a shaver shaper, and the shaper for this product is missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit louder than I expected, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> Works as it was expected to do, great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for those of you who like to not only remove the hair from your neck and face, but also the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> the shaving experience is so much superior to my last panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> (i have a full shaped beard tho)    </li>
            <li> (I think the device is better suited for straight hair.)</li>
            <li> I was able to save money and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> With out any doubt the Wahl is a true 5 star shaver.  </li>
            <li> The true test will be the results of my face after 2 days to see if I in fact DO NOT bump.  </li>
            <li> i  love this tool very reliable</li>
            <li> , that wasn&#x27;t true, my face was sore with bumps.</li>
            <li> you cannot shave with a full beard and think that it was take it away.</li>
            <li> began as my wife was loving how close the shave was compared to the old trimmer.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father who is currently a patient and it was so noisy and did not do a good job either.</li>
            <li> Love it so much had to get family member one.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price and its very solid.</li>
            <li> Again, overall good shaver</li>
            <li> So I went  to trim my beard with my full size</li>
            <li> I figured they probably know what is a good product since it is a &amp;#34;tool of the trade.&amp;#34;  I have used it several times on my face and head.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it and is satisfied w it.</li>
            <li> A true test of a product is how well that your clients like the results of it,</li>
            <li> Next I used the Wahl and I got a really good shave.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and offered a better shave than what I&#x27;ve gotten with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All in all, amazon allowed me to return both for a full refund, and I received an email from them stating that they would look into the product discription.</li>
            <li> i love these they cut even closer then a straight razor.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now back to my good ole razor</li>
            <li> like to keep my hair short and my beard close, this works good on shaving the neck, and around your beard if you have one.</li>
            <li> I had heard of the company but didn&#x27;t realize they made shavers and since they are a domestic company and this model has a slew of good reviews,</li>
            <li> Still not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li> Not bad on my face and chin.  </li>
            <li> It is strong in his hand yet very gentle and thorough on his face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after a while the stubborn hairs are easily eliminated, so have patientience and enjoy a very close shave without the bumps.</li>
            <li> A must have for those men that break out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I had an older version Wahl before and liked it; this one is even better thus far.  </li>
            <li> A bit loud and has no trimmer but overall, a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver shaper in my opinion and use it every other day to keep my line up looking clean.</li>
            <li> At first it work fine</li>
            <li> looked into this as an alternative because I wanted to be clean shaven or near clean shaving most days</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t say in the product description, it does come with the super close foil.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> shaves super close and quick.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8061 5-Star Series Deluxe is a great shaver for Black men.  </li>
            <li> As mine grows in quickly, I cannot skip two days in a row.</li>
            <li> This cuts so close that it gets super close</li>
            <li> It is very efficient and is also easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> The foil to broke quickly causing it to snag my face.  </li>
            <li> Cuts super close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> reviews\\&quot; on amazon (I wonder if REAL customers actually gave this product great ratings).</li>
            <li> it arrived really quick</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I love it too because after shaving, his skin is baby soft and ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> reference, I also have a Braun 5 series and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as quickly as this Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaver foils for these electric razors come in close, super close, and</li>
            <li> Product is adequate.</li>
            <li> My older Braun had worked OK, but it eventually wore out.  </li>
            <li> Not near as good or as quick as my shaver with a blade.  </li>
            <li> the shaver is all right: it shaves close and clean.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it out, I had a light beard going on</li>
            <li> Gold mesh cracked after the very first use.</li>
            <li> the product broke after the very first use</li>
            <li> My faces feels as smooth as if I used a straight razor against the grain!  </li>
            <li> gives a fast, clean and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> He really likes the close shave for a smooth, clean, look.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it is quick and easy and works really really well.</li>
            <li> Great for military!!</li>
            <li> As a black man, I have been in search of a great shave since puberty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver because I am deployed to Iraq and I lost my previously used electric shaver(the great Remington ES-1000 Bump Control Shaver, I do not know why they discontinued this model).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the box covered in black guys intimidate you, still works great on all skin types and colors.</li>
            <li> TO ANYONE THAT ENJOYS A CLOSE SHAVE, WITE EASY CLEANING ITS VERY CONVENANT</li>
            <li> Even with this minor problem he is the most satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have to believe the reviewers who&#x27;ve left some pretty good comments regarding its performance.</li>
            <li> Very close shave and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a large surface shaving screen, two floating blades, the motor is more powerful and moves the blades at a higher speed.  </li>
            <li> Even if they say that you can press lightly to get a good shave, I did press down on the skin with it.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use.</li>
            <li> The local beauty and barber supply store wanted a mint for it however Amazons price was much better!</li>
            <li> got it exactly a month ago and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a really clean bump free shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is super powerful and gets a very close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> You can rinse the blades under hot water to clean them.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver that could.  </li>
            <li> Works great holds a long charge easy to clean and it great on the skin real close without irritating the skin definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is great for a quick shave or for doing skin tight fades and tapers!</li>
            <li> The last one I used prior to buying this one -- a Braun with a cleaning fluid/charging station -- seemed very good for awhile, but eventually it started with the neck irritation and the process of shaving</li>
            <li> After reading some other good reviews here I decided to give this Wahl Super Close shaver a try.  </li>
            <li> it has a smooth cut and its very close.</li>
            <li> This is for the guy who wants the smooth razor cut face but doesn&#x27;t want to use a razor.</li>
            <li> A very close and smooth shave, without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a very high-quality product, made in USA, smooth and powerful.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a smooth shave and REALLY leaves NO BUMPS.</li>
            <li> I really think the ingrowns removal check before shaving is really important.</li>
            <li> loudness accompanies what appears to be a substantially powerful</li>
            <li> Glad i didnt throw away my old shaver yet.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> well worth the money...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful shaver.</li>
            <li> I have the most coarse hair texture of anyone I know and somehow this shaver gets me baby smooth.</li>
            <li> They all love this razor and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li> since I liked the way it shaved, I gave it a second chance) and both had faulty charging mechanisms.</li>
            <li> my 10 year old norelco works better then this</li>
            <li> Better than some but not heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But Im glad I did cause my skin ahs been clear for 2 days after using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I rarely get any at all with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The best shaver in the game.  </li>
            <li> Yes the motor is powerful.  </li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> is not Pressing TOO-HARD and just letting the Shaver do the work for you)&lt;br /&gt;Definately Worth the $$$&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is worth it .</li>
            <li> just tried it out this morning on about 5 days worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this product is only good for 24 hours worth of stubble, as it was too weak/dull to do anything on real scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it will prove useful on finer hair for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> i suggest a nice clean razor blade shave the first day to get everything flat and even...</li>
            <li> Very powerful and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> OHHHH, the trimer on the back IS the best thing about the shaver so far....gives sharp lines.</li>
            <li> Charger port goes out and you have to replace the whole thing but other than that its a great product</li>
            <li> He used it for the first time and while it didn&#x27;t give him the super close shave on his head, it did the job and didn&#x27;t leave razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> Now you know what all the smart looking clean shaven heads got their look from.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this for those men who need a clean shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Gotta clean it more regularly than the instructions indicate.</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try because of other good reviews that it had.</li>
            <li> The razor was in its original package, charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> It glides right over the hairs on my neck like they&#x27;re not even there, leaving them fully</li>
            <li> It will just bounce right off of my side burns as if there&#x27;s no blade at all.</li>
            <li> I can run this right up to my beard without messing up the trim lines.</li>
            <li> Remington had it right.</li>
            <li> Saw my barber use it and bought right away.</li>
            <li> Serves me right for not sticking to what i know.</li>
            <li> It said no bump right on the package</li>
            <li> He can get a shave in right in the semi.</li>
            <li> Luckily...it was on my face but happened right before I was about to use it.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> well, I bought another one, since I had to travel right away.....</li>
            <li> 5-Star is right ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also faster and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I got a full refund most likely because I tried the razor probably two or three times.</li>
            <li> No razor stubble, just very close clean shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lacks power &amp; misses many hairs, especially when using it unplugged with a full charge.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wahl Professional 8061 shavers for the past 6 years because it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I found this item reasonably alright, but nothing outstandingly special.</li>
            <li> The 4000 is still going strong with no problems, I just wanted a back up/travel shaver and this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> My elderly vision impaired husband finds this very easy to use &amp; I appreciate the absence of stubble on his cheeks.</li>
            <li> Although it barely lasted one year, I&#x27;m about to stock up with 3 more.</li>
            <li> , I learned many things on how to make it more effective, but sadly, it won&#x27;t be your one-step solution for shaving your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re like most men, when you go to use this on the third day, it&#x27;ll do nothing on its own as it only works on stubble...</li>
            <li> This shaver is great for an everyday use!</li>
            <li> the battery is long duration, it is nice.</li>
            <li> I then went to clean it and took top off by pressing button stayed pressed in which obviously did not allow me to put top back on..</li>
            <li> have a full beard and have to work a bit to clean the edges, but other than that I like it better than the Wahl shaver</li>
            <li> Performance is not as good as advertised leaves face irritated motor or power switch keeps slowing down Poorley made product</li>
            <li> It does a little better than most but still not as close as we want</li>
            <li> Cuts amazingly close BUT not for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried many shavers none really work for me.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well but is fairly noisy as compared to my old Norelco, which recently fell apart on me.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use shaver that gives you a razor close clean cut without the razor like after effects.</li>
            <li> So I started searching for a different brand that gives a great shave, is a quality razor, and won&#x27;t require big bucks for purchase.  </li>
            <li> I can only say that it works wonders for me maybe a slightly different for everyone else but great for me.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I recommend this product for any African American.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Im biracial with very sensitive light skin</li>
            <li> Fully charged it works for days, very very close shave and fast much better than my old Remington triple header</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job on old baldy!</li>
            <li> The stand is kind of loose, I never know if I&#x27;m charging it or not.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think the trick is this machine doesnt pull the hair and doesnt cut it too short below skin BUT use very light pressure.</li>
            <li> on a lighter note the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American male and always wanted the clean smooth bald head but couldn&#x27;t get it because with a razor I would get bumps everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase because now I don&#x27;t have to shave every day as before, as you might know, shaving everyday can be pretty expensive and this shaver saves that money because it provides a nice clean shave all you do</li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews for this shaver I expected it to be something amazing people commented on how well it removed hair and gave you a  close shave.</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Or find another product from another company with hopes that someone still makes a quality shaver that will last for more than two months.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more item...</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing to shave your head, you will need to use clippers first</li>
            <li> You must shave first.</li>
            <li> first time user of electric shavers.    </li>
            <li> first few days had MINOR irritation but with lighting my pressure and pre-shave powder sticks its been perfect ever since.    </li>
            <li> but this items comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> I also am not heavy bearded and my hair is light to gray.</li>
            <li> My barber first introduced this item to me</li>
            <li> My first shaver died on me after about 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is the first buyer remorse I have in my experiences with Ebay.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, but only when facial hair is short.</li>
            <li> I dropped my first one.</li>
            <li> Very close shave!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Baby bottom effect, soft and smooth face after shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaving machine is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the shaver does not cut hair thats more than a stubble.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first shaver shaper.  </li>
            <li> The product broke within its first two days of use.</li>
            <li> my first close shave, it was a learning lesson.</li>
            <li> Is better than razors but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I got burned the first time and it did not cut as close as i would like it to....</li>
            <li> Maybe my next one will be more durable, or maybe I&#x27;ll give the Andis razor a go.</li>
            <li> So would give it 5 stars but cannt because the top did not last.</li>
            <li> First foil shaver i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this week.  </li>
            <li> The foils &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; me on the first day and wanted to return them with no luck.</li>
            <li> i first used it</li>
            <li> that first night it didnt do a thing.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving I at first was unsure the correct way to shave using it.</li>
            <li> Very close shave!</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> The foil top is very fragile.  </li>
            <li> One of the nicest shavers he has purchased and he has purchased a number of different brands and has never been satisfied til now.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return it at first, but since I had already opened the box, I said why not give him a chance.</li>
            <li> but I like close shaving even though I have sensitive skin, and I can guaranty you that it is bump free.</li>
            <li> I will add more later if I experience any problems.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for the prompt receipt!</li>
            <li> I have the Wahl Hero trimmer which I pass first and in between as I see hairs remain because of their length.</li>
            <li> NO RAZOR BURN at all first electric razor not to give it to me</li>
            <li> Gets pretty darn close to the skin.</li>
            <li> After I got out the shower I applied a daily cream treatment called Bump Rescue made by Magic</li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> In just a week of shaving the foil on top tore open and the inside machinery made contact.  </li>
            <li> Shave feels pretty close to skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my razor and therefore have a better chance of shaving without having bumps 24 hours later.</li>
            <li> Well made sturdy great for course and thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to donate it to someone who would be pleased with not such a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Wahl fits that job description exactly.  </li>
            <li> During the first 1-2 months, the product worked as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything I could read (hot shower, tea tree oil, fancy shave sets, etc).</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> more  than  what  i  consider  to  be often  enough  .....</li>
            <li> hot  </li>
            <li> It definitely is an upgrade from a razor and it doesn&#x27;t give me as many bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> I used this once and INSTANTLY fell in love.</li>
            <li> Zero razor bumbs on my head or neck after the first month of usage.</li>
            <li> When I first got these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a replacement after many years of daily service, my kids knocked it on the floor and the foil broke and plug receptacle was damaged.</li>
            <li> The 5 Star and 4000 are interchangeable a far as the foil heads and cutter blades, so when I buy replacements, they fit both shavers, which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first Razor that I&#x27;ve ever had to cut as close as this pair does.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Remington shaver of much better quality for a third this price.</li>
            <li> He said that his barber uses this exact one and it doesn&#x27;t give him bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave because of ingrown hairs,however this Wahl shaver misses so many hairs I have to use a trimmer prior to using it.</li>
            <li> this is my first shaver...</li>
            <li> said it is exactly what he wanted, and item lives up to its expectations.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t find this first.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the shaver will NOT cut whiskers or any longer hairs, that&#x27;s not what this product is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver worked well upon first use.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to take the top layer of skin off and still left a lot of beard.  </li>
            <li> its okay if you live alone, but if your waking up early for a shave ur going to wake up everyone else in the house --</li>
            <li> The new one is quieter and the battery life so far has been better.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, helps clear all razor bumps, and very durable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to clean, close dry shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it&#x27;s a little loud, I recommend this machine to all who want to have a clean smooth cut but make sure you do it right</li>
            <li> You can also shave right up to your beard, mustache, sideburn lines as longer hairs wont be cut hardly much at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this electric shaver to anyone who has problem with ingrown hairs and wants a clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t really need to go over areas numerous times which makes for a quick and easy shave.</li>
            <li> Normal, steady light pressure against the skin.  </li>
            <li> its not bad and a decent value for the price/does not have a trimer and gives a reasonable shave/</li>
            <li> The whole thing is made of cheap plastic, the foil piece on top split in half from me just turning it on for it the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I might use it to clean up cheeks/sideburns if I miss a spot with my old shaver, but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave if you go over it often enough and in many directions..  </li>
            <li> I bought this Electric Razor Purely off the reviews that others have posted, and man am I not Sorry, this shaver Performs and it can all be heard in the \\&quot;Buzz\\&quot; as soon as you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop this razor because the foil seems to break/rip very easily.</li>
            <li> The blade and screen combination is fair to poor when it is new and gets worn out rather quickly with repeated use, and just doesn&#x27;t work as well as their original shaver did.</li>
            <li> The main reason I wanted this shaver is that it was assembled in the USA, which is very important to me; even forgoing a shaver with a built in trimmer to have an American made shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this based on all the positive reviews but he had to call his barber to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> He has used magic shave for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.  </li>
            <li> Now the shipping was pretty fast on the sellers part so props to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to forgive that because it shaves very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gold foil broke pretty fast.</li>
            <li> With time, however, you&#x27;ll learn exactly how much pressure to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other reason for my purchase was the more economical screen replacements.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works well enough, but no where near as good as the old Wahl&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It does a good (not great) job on trimming the facial hairs, about 90% effective.</li>
            <li> The design is kind of old school, maybe they haven’t change the design in 30 years, and it is loud, it is like riding an old tractor, also buy some aftershave cream you will need it.</li>
            <li> The old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; rang true for me.</li>
            <li> and this one is by far is superior to ANY OTHER .for</li>
            <li> OK for the money, does a decent job when used to shave your head, however I would spend the extra money and get the Bald Eagle Smart, it&#x27;s in a league all by</li>
            <li> This shaver made it possible to maintain a very close face shave and clean bald head without any aweful breakouts!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my buy and if about 2-3 years when this one needs to be replace, I will likely come back here to get another one.</li>
            <li> And its case is relatively easy to open (or so I&#x27;ve read) to allow you to change batteries yourself.  </li>
            <li> Gets nice and close in about half the time of a blade shave.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this shaver is NOT a super close shaver.</li>
            <li> I understand that the battery may not last too long, surprising except that this unit is under $40</li>
            <li> Batery Last a Long time good product</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it does shave very well for my type of beard and from a shaving perspective</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - specially for black men because our hair tend to be more curly and prone to grow inwardly.</li>
            <li> So far I am very well pleased and would highly recommend for others with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> At less than 25% of what I paid for the Arcitec, this provides a far superior shave.</li>
            <li> So much kinder to my head than regular razors and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a least a week and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If you use it when the beard is low, say 1-2 days growth it&#x27;ll work fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, works well on short hairs on my face</li>
            <li> Pretty simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> THE Remington F-4 790 SHAVER is the way to go great quality shaver with a pop up sharp trimmer, cord/cordless long battery life, flexible foil head, can stationary the head if you want to, had it for three yrs.</li>
            <li> well  It my 5 times using this little machine , I liked it but after 5 time using it</li>
            <li> This shaver is just a little noisy but it gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact little razor.</li>
            <li> So far, the shaver seems to be working fine, but it&#x27;s still early.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li> This thing does a good job,just follow the YouTube,instructions,and not press to hard against your skin,and it works well.</li>
            <li> It is little loud, but does a good job and very close cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if a professional shop did the replacement, it would cost half the original price of the shaver to get it done.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Works great and battery last for a few days without being recharged, tried Andis profoil  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave my face feeling smooth although sometimes a bit sore in spots but not enough to complain much.</li>
            <li> and I noticed how smooth it left my skin.</li>
            <li> As close as a straight edge</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this shaver.</li>
            <li> I am almost ready to declare that it shaves as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> You will spend too much time trimming hair.</li>
            <li> and this is the only way for me to shave comfortably</li>
            <li> and decided to get another shaver, so when this one wears out, as I thought it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> So my options are to be without a shaver for two or three weeks and pay for shipping or the same and purchase a cheap shaver to use in the interim.</li>
            <li> everthing went very well</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to use because shave cream is not needed.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave than the rotary blade shavers.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GLADE IT BACK AND FROTH AGAINST THE    FACE AND YOU&#x27;LL GET THE SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It does the job it is designed to do very well.</li>
            <li> My Husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> But once I got it, not so much.</li>
            <li> It cuts really close.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close save.</li>
            <li> You also should stretch your skin taut if you really want that close shave.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil&#x27;s and blades are very inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Seems to cut much closer and blades / screen have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver shaves VERY close.</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]], and use the Shaver/Shaper inbetween</li>
            <li> Very close shave; would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> so much I went ahead and bought one.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> As I said in the review of the replacement foil and cutter bar, the razor does a wonderful job of cutting close without producing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves how close it shaves his head.  </li>
            <li> up side is that, because it is not irritating, I can shave with it every day.</li>
            <li> grate shipping fast.</li>
            <li> Equipment more noisy than I expected.</li>
            <li> When I use it on family &amp; friends, they all rave about how much they like it, and how close it gets.</li>
            <li> or when i did not have the time to use my straight razor.</li>
            <li> I will say that since i have purchased this shaver i have used my straight razor maybe 3 times.</li>
            <li> shaver works very well, gets a rather close shave almost as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> and it is a very close and</li>
            <li> I am really please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really the reason why I purchased.  </li>
            <li> It is very noisy and really doesn&#x27;t shave as close as claimed.</li>
            <li> really doesn&#x27;t grab everything</li>
            <li> He no longer uses a disposable razor on his face because this shaver gives such a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> it shaves very close</li>
            <li> This razor gives me the shave I&#x27;ve been looking for very close.</li>
            <li> It really served my purpose.</li>
            <li> Using this product along with my clippers gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> absolutely gone.</li>
            <li> thing doesnt affect any detailed facial hair designs.</li>
            <li> but I expected more than a month for the price.</li>
            <li> A real cop out in my opinion.</li>
            <li> HEY THESE SHAVE REALLY CLOSE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand this razor.</li>
            <li> Also cuts very close to the skin</li>
            <li> It does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> , I get NO razor bumps and the shave is very close.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a so called, &amp;#34;black male&amp;#34; (brown really), that has issues with razor bumps</li>
            <li> This product is very unreliable.</li>
            <li> I am very upset that I can not return this product and will think twice before ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> Very noisy!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li> fits well in the hand, shaves close enough, shaves comfortably.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair at all much.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves really close ( kissably close) and does not cut or scratch him.</li>
            <li> but as I do have to cut close to maintain that fresh shaved look, and have highly sensitive skin that gets ingrown hairs often, I must say this shaver blows the competition out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves very close with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Really close, like a baby&#x27;s but close</li>
            <li> really Amazon????</li>
            <li> He is very picky</li>
            <li> cordless battery is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Gives shaving bumps very painfull</li>
            <li> Cuts very close without burning.  </li>
            <li> the whole even without the trimmer I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> &amp; ships fast</li>
            <li> very close shave on your head</li>
            <li> goo dproduct really close shave</li>
            <li> The razor shaves very well and close (no electric razor will ever come as close to hand razor).</li>
            <li> Even though it broke again, however I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> so much i&#x27;ve purchased two for my sons.</li>
            <li> This shaver won&#x27;t do much for hair longer than that...</li>
            <li> but I need and want a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My son the barber is very happy with this purchase and uses it all the time while working and cutting hair</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> As expected, it delivers an outstandingly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Shaves my head very well.</li>
            <li> Post shaving with any razor (electric, safety, cartridge, straight)</li>
            <li> Great when the foil is broken.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I may not dance very well</li>
            <li> suggestion I have for those of you who want the ultimate in a smooth close shave, buy the gold plated Wahl hypoallergenic shaver foils.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close</li>
            <li> I tried a Norelco for a while and find the Wahl gives a much closer shave and works much faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot simpler, lasts a life time, and doesn&#x27;t require much money for replacement pieces.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Wahl, but don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% bump free, it depends on your hair/skin, everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> However, the 5 star shaver will take off all your facial hair and leave you with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave was very sporatic.  </li>
            <li> However, ultimately the coils feel cheap.</li>
            <li> There is much wisdom in our elders</li>
            <li> Very pricey for what you get,</li>
            <li> but i dont know much about shavers.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It works well, and fast.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the same as a smooth bald head.  </li>
            <li> Dosent work fast</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all.</li>
            <li> My face dose&#x27;nt bump up like it use 2 thanks 2 this product.</li>
            <li> it gives a very close shave .</li>
            <li> This is a very narrowly-focused product.</li>
            <li> He really has no hair bumps at all.</li>
            <li> and I read some of the reviews that claimed that very thing, but my husband wanted to try it and thought just maybe that person had gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li> I work in an office that is very formal</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very noisy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;M a barber and use these machines a lot and know quality when I see it, very overrated shaver.</li>
            <li> Junk razor, screen is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> It gets Very close as a razor, without the razor irritation...</li>
            <li> i had expected it to work better based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> You only have to change your blade ($16.65) every six months which is pretty cool becuase</li>
            <li> later.&lt;br /&gt;The product might or might not be a good one, but at least for me, it didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I wanted a corded shaver to have a strong, steady power supply and found that in the woman&#x27;s shaving world, they simply don&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li> bought this because my barber used this shaver on me a few times and it provides a close nice shave.</li>
            <li> My bald head is smooth, I mean really smooth!</li>
            <li> It is so loud!!!</li>
            <li> I am a black man that bumps very easily and as a result do not shave more often than once every other day.  </li>
            <li> Just your plain soap and warm water will</li>
            <li> I use the old one for the trimmer only, sure which the new one had a trimmer too!</li>
            <li> So, I asked him, and he advised, you have to clip facial hair very short with clippers, then use these to clean up face, make it smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since took the whole \\&quot;Clean Shave\\&quot; prior to, out of the Equation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more powerful than the other two units I&#x27;ve owned, a Remington Microscreen (10 years) and my norelco (10 years) both of which cost over $100 and were of decent quality and service life.  </li>
            <li> OK, so it is not pretty, does not have a sideburn trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30+ years, and the Wahl 5-Star gives me a better shave than any other I&#x27;ve found, including $200+ premium shavers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to open and clean and battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used my Wahl Dynaflex shaver for years, and it worked better than any other shaver I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is an edit to my original review because, after only 5 months this razor is junk!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before several dozen years ago so I was familiar with the product if I had one question</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure whites, other ethnics would benefit also.&lt;br /&gt;Update - it&#x27;s doesnt have the pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know if his barber knows something we don&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other shaver to me.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY Recommend this product to anyone who shaves very often and in a hurry who doesn&#x27;t always have time to lather heir face with shaving cream and use a straight razor every morning.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I did to help me along was to use the Andis Style Liner first to get rid of the the long hairs and get the beard area trimmed down to a level that is good for the Wahl.  </li>
            <li> When I called them to complain, they not only sent me a replacement free of charge but they went so far as to send TWO !!</li>
            <li> The shave is OK, but gets dull quickly, and the replacement head  cost is as much as the unit.</li>
            <li> Works excellent, try not to push down hard though because goil foil can tear.</li>
            <li> This is designed to clean up the stubble left after shaving.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I think it goes back to the adage: there is no shortcut when it comes to a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> . . until you turn it on. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of shavers (Ronson, Braun, Panasonic, Remington, Grundig), but this is the first one so powerful as to actually feel \\&quot;torque-y\\&quot; in my hand.   </li>
            <li> My Barber&#x27;s razor shaves clean and no hair is left.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
            <li> As long as you can close the bathroom door you should be fine, otherwise you may wake up the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offers a great cut but it does me no good if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, the merchant was very understanding and took it back with a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to use the gray colored Wahl Shaver and it was a high quality product that shaved very well and</li>
            <li> I was really excited about buying this shaver since it&#x27;s the same one my barber uses and he highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit bulky, and the head cover is easy to loose; but a close shave is what&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a smooth, close, NO BUMP, shaver for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything good or bad about the Andis razor, but I&#x27;d only heard good things about the Wahl.</li>
            <li> I shave my full head and beard daily.</li>
            <li> The shaver was extremely noisy, and more importantly, it did not cut my facial hair anywhere near as close as my older shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, just learn how to use it properly, which isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li> the product: I finally bought it after reading the positive reviews by other African Americans and watching various videos, and there are some very good ones out there.  </li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave, however just after one use we had to buy a new head for it because it cracked.</li>
            <li> Barely cuts it right.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it shaves the corners near the nose and the corner of the mouth without cutting them like the razors.</li>
            <li> The latest I&#x27;ve owned for less than 60 days</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be a quick shave either because you have to keep hitting the same spots</li>
            <li> (This is with the standard \\&quot;Close\\&quot; foil. \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blk male and my Norelco does a better job at shaving short hairs.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;barber\\&quot; had suggested this when my once a decade attempt at maintaining facial hair was at its inception during my most recent trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this reading the reviews saying that this particular shaver did not irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it advertised incorrectly, the first one I recieved had a defective foil guard, that came apart during the first use.  </li>
            <li> Decent shaver.  </li>
            <li> After about 20 years of trying different shaving methods, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found the answer.  </li>
            <li> The main reason for me to try again this shaver was my clipper running out of charge.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver performs better than most expensive electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Oh well, the search continues for a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> and I may have gotten a decent shave out of it, but my face would have looked like WWIII after.  </li>
            <li> , so I let the servants have the week off and let me beard grow to give the Wahl a decent test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin and a bid type razor really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> , its better then using a razor and constantly hurting your skin, its fast and efficient for those who have to be clean shaved for their jobs EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> its really that loud!</li>
            <li> So long as you use it daily depending on how fast your hair grows, this shaver will grind through all but the most stubborn hairs, all without the slightest irritation, tugging, or scratching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver gives you a quick shave and is pretty close to a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your looking for a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; shaver keep looking.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a distinctive sound it makes when it is cutting hair and a much quieter sound when it encounters an already smooth surface.   </li>
            <li> I still Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend the Wahl peanut clippers.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a close shave without using a blade.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> were too high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to ANY man.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use with very little maintenance.</li>
            <li> So far it is better   than any other electric razor I have used</li>
            <li> After first 2 shaves, no red marks like most other shavers.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy.  </li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t sure, we were replacing a $200 electric razor so spending so little worried me.</li>
            <li> yes yes you pretty much have to shave everyday if u want a clean look.</li>
            <li> As an African American male looking to get into law enforcement and has a job that requires a clean shave; this product was a huge help.</li>
            <li> I bought an andis liner and it was pretty ok until the blade got dull</li>
            <li> even the so called sensitive skin razors that wasnt much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave and so far on razor bumps</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing because unless the hair is pointing straight out (which only stubble does), this will do absolutely nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and minimal irratation.  </li>
            <li> an then give a fast shave with this with no pressuer at all.youll be surprised.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but my skin was sensitive to this shaver.</li>
            <li> any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, read your directions if you decide to buy it.</li>
            <li> But that might be normal with the amount of use it has seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first few times I have light hair on face don&#x27;t recamend junk</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried shaving with Magic Shaving Powder like my father and that didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few weeks now and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is the only way to make shave so well as I have had many quiet shavers that didn&#x27;t shave nearly so close.</li>
            <li> I can go over areas more than a few times.</li>
            <li> Other brands just don&#x27;t shave as clean and fast as the Wahl.</li>
            <li> This device was pictured differently than what was actually received; specifically the one pictured has a trimmer on the back and the one received does not making the shaver less than ideal.</li>
            <li> was recommended this product, at first it wasnt any better but after using it regularly my skin started to soften and noticed much less irritation.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine for me shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have spent far too much on a certain \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; brand razor&#x27;s latest models claiming the closest and gentlest shave only to still have</li>
            <li> He promised that I could shave right up to the beard margin without altering it as it would only cut the 1-2 day stubble and not the longer beard hairs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my moles and the battery charges quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very helpful product, but be careful - do not use it for a long beard, in this case you won&#x27;t be satisfied</li>
            <li> This razor worked very well from the first time I used it (no break-in period required, as suggested in instructions:but I have smooth skin and beard grows slowly).  </li>
            <li> Works like a champ used this to shave my head and it&#x27;s just as smooth as a razor and doesn&#x27;t irirtate my skin like all the other electrics I have tried</li>
            <li> The contents were not packed securely and when I opened the box containing the shaver, it had been tossed around and displaced due to not being secured within the box it was shipped in.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased, not only was he correct, I have not had a single bump in over 2 mos!</li>
            <li> am trying to get get a new one or a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write this review until I had forgone the trial and tribulations of using a new shaver...</li>
            <li> Ordered a new foil.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking of buying a new Wahl soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying him a new screen now.  </li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t locate anyone with a new model 4000 in stock, I settled on this model 8061.</li>
            <li> This model 8061 will become my new travel razor.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new one of these.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Braun in February that ran, but didn&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li> now still running like new bought the wahl shaver 6 months ago already went out on me.</li>
            <li> Being in the military, we have to keep a clean and neat appearance and this shaver works if you give it time.  </li>
            <li> I have to actually use a straight blade and a Gel shaving cream to get the hair to stand up straight, then cut it.  </li>
            <li> When charging, the red indicator light was always lit (but razor worked well for several shaves between charges).</li>
            <li> The product is advertised as a bump free shaver for African American skin.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be able to substitute it for my regular wahl balding clippers and andis shaver.</li>
            <li> I cant use razor and my skin is very sensitive and this does the trick</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very professional shaver, cuts close and don&#x27;t leave bumps or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> The motor also very loud.</li>
            <li> However, its also very loud.  </li>
            <li> Just the weight of your hand back and forth with very gentle strokes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other electric shavers and I pretty much got \\&quot;Burnt\\&quot; by them all either being Poorly made, or leaving my face sore and full of Ingrowns, but that&#x27;s not the case</li>
            <li> Its a clean shave you just have to go over certain areas a few times.</li>
            <li> not usually a fan of electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second shaver however since the first one stopped working because the on/off switch broke.  </li>
            <li> My barber uses this same exact shaver when he gives me a haircut.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American male and I have had problems with ingrown hairs while shaving with other electric shavers, razors, and magic shave.</li>
            <li> Since my first facial hair that started to grow in the 6th grade</li>
            <li> due to work (thankfully) i wasnt able to send it back for about 4 days.</li>
            <li> I only gave 3 stars because the clippers broke the first week</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i do not think he put everything back in the box</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this razor by my brother who had an extra one.</li>
            <li> My brother told me at first, don&#x27;t keep going over the same area over and over and over again</li>
            <li> While it is on the loud side, the bottom line is performance and for that I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I charged it only once when I first got the product</li>
            <li> I used my T-outliner&#x27;s first to fet it low and then finished with the 8601&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but it is too damn loud!</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl shaver; the first one I bought is the Wahl 4000 shaving system which I also purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My fiancé has sensitive skin and will not buy anything else!</li>
            <li> I first learned of this shaver when my barber used it to trim my facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was the exact same one</li>
            <li> My first one had a retractable trimmer on the back.</li>
            <li> I have use many rechargeable shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get some canned air to clean it, brushes are a little too harsh for cleaning,</li>
            <li> what i really love about it is that i can shave right up to AND into my beard lines without shaving any of my beard at all (the holes on the foil are designed to shave very short hairs/stubble without cutting longer hairs) which allows me to get a clean daily shave right up to my beard lines.    </li>
            <li> This is definitely on the professional level and works so much better than any other 1 I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> He called Wahl and they are suppose to be sending new foils, but so far have to received.</li>
            <li> And work it does--clearing up four days&#x27; stubble in less than five minutes, and leaving my face as smooth as a blade shave.</li>
            <li> The first stopped taking a charge and would only work while plugged in - then completely stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> Overall it has good reviews but for every customer that has a different face, different kinds of facial hair there will be different results.</li>
            <li> It works fine as long as you trim it down close with a trimmer first.  </li>
            <li> Heck, make the same exact product and model a purple-colored plastic version if you want to &amp;#34;girl-ify it&amp;#34; and not offend the men that we&#x27;re really using the same shaver.  </li>
            <li> more Braun, no more blades -- this shaver has a powerful motor and shaves very close with little effort.  </li>
            <li> However, after the very first use, my husband doesn&#x27;t get the results that we expected.  </li>
            <li> That kind of sucks!</li>
            <li> Clearly, how it looks is less important to Wahl than how it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of its promise of a super close shave and it does the job, but only if your beard is short, if you have a 3 day beard</li>
            <li> As I said, if your facial hair is more than 1/8 of inch long, use the Andis Style Liner/Trimmer first to get the hair down to a shaveable length and then just let the Wahl Shaver Shaper do the work.  </li>
            <li> Good enough to shave head daily, although the hair needs to be trimmed down short for it to work.</li>
            <li> I can skip a day here and there, but this shaver is designed to only cut hairs that are a certain length.</li>
            <li> pure garbage, if i had not used it i would have sent it back, but they would re-boxed resold it.</li>
            <li> I believe the item is giving the service expected, cannot give a first hand review as the purchase was for a friend.!...</li>
            <li> This is only ment for fine hairs to get you a close shave only after shaving with one of the above mentioned.</li>
            <li> A reasonable length of time, however, re-engineered with a replaceable battery and these shavers might last for ten years before needing to be replaced and at that point would then certainly rate FIVE STARS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for cutting bald...</li>
            <li> This is a shaver for guys who want a great shave without a lot of questionable add-ons and doo-dads that contribute nothing except extra cost.  </li>
            <li> May take a few times for skin to adjust, then it&#x27;s smooth shaving,strong motor,a lil  loud</li>
            <li> it I expected to have me smooth but just makes me look smooth to the common eye.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing based on some negative feedback.</li>
            <li> then the old razor did.</li>
            <li> and man was I surprised.</li>
            <li> my surprise he took out the Wahl professional and shaved my head</li>
            <li> but it is loud.</li>
            <li> The shaver also provides a close shave and so far for me no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li> far-</li>
            <li> My old one I had for over 10 years</li>
            <li> IT DOES&#x27;NT HAVE A POPUP TRIMER like my old one.</li>
            <li> So far no bumps.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Start on your face with a pair of Andis Outliners and finish to complete smoothness with the Wahl 8061.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber &amp; i</li>
            <li> use these frequently.</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8061</li>
            <li> He has used another Wahl product for years but this product outshines the old one for him.</li>
            <li> Professional?  </li>
            <li> I brought this for my 18 year old son.</li>
            <li> This is a must have tool, because it makes his skin so soft.</li>
            <li> If you get bumps from shaving or have sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another one in a flash, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin like myself.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a week so far and no bumps.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised</li>
            <li> I used a Braun electric razor before, and would always have to make multiple passes when shaving heads for razor fades or whole head shaves, trying to not leave any stubble.</li>
            <li> returned for refund, its really loud and obnoxious.</li>
            <li> But as much as not getting so close to cause ingrown hairs, this is the only thing ever that is doing the trick.  </li>
            <li> Did some research and bought this as a gift for my 91 year old father.</li>
            <li> i nearly had tears in my eyes when i saw this.</li>
            <li> By far the closest shave of any I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My barber used them on my head, so when I decided to shave the whole thing, it was an obvious choice.</li>
            <li> I had an old one and used it for this.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> When I received this shaver, I was like &amp;#34; Wahl tricked  me for $50.00, it is too much&amp;#34; because it was just too lite, had a 2V battery, and does not look professional.</li>
            <li> Many people have complained of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> While riding in the car on 95 I ordered it and thanks to Prime he had a replacement the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The gold overlay/foil that protects your skin from the blades has completely come off.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is wow...</li>
            <li> Thus far..</li>
            <li> Can you imagine what the images for the reviews would be for straight razors by people who didn&#x27;t learn how to use something properly?</li>
            <li> think it is a bit noisy, mines a couple of years old</li>
            <li> Loud it gives you a headache&lt;br</li>
            <li> The back side should have a straight edge shaper, and it is not there.</li>
            <li> (the cord would fall out with vibration of the unit, to the point where I needed to hold the cord in place, while shaving), at four months, it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> That model is really built to last.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll share what has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> Big thanks to Wahl for addressing the issue and providing an affordable solution.  </li>
            <li> an very curly african hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate shave with a clipper</li>
            <li> I reall Like this shaver, I have been looking for a shaver that will help my sensitive condition.  </li>
            <li> A professional shaver that can be used for you face as well as your head.</li>
            <li> Once this is don you can shave every day and if you skip a couple of days of shaves use T-outliner&#x27;s and complete with the 8601&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it early mornings when I wake up for fear of not waking my roommate with this noisy shaver.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 50 years old and have tried just about  every shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Had to go back to straight razor.</li>
            <li> One day I used the personal groomer, with the shaving attachment, to shave my whole face.  </li>
            <li> That is when I picked out the Wahl Professional 8061</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to loud</li>
            <li> We got this shaver recommended by a professional.</li>
            <li> The man using this razor is 83 years old.</li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> But smooth shave, takes few weeks to get used to  skin</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 19 yr old son.</li>
            <li> and I have to shave just about every day in order to look professional.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes me about 1 minute to completely shave my face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It performed admirably, a bit loud, as others have noted but gave me a close shave.</li>
            <li> No scratches and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver -</li>
            <li> thing looks like its something you&#x27;d find in your grandfather&#x27;s attic after he dies.&lt;br /&gt;Its about as loud as a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have perfectly straight hair and some hairs curl inwards, this will simply not get them and thus not cut them.</li>
            <li> Another reason I dislike this is that it&#x60;s posted as professional</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver Shaper]]</li>
            <li> However, it is unlikely it will be useful with a week-long beard (instructions suggest beard should be at most 1/32&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In fact, the shaver seems powerful enough to mow the back 40</li>
            <li> I was hoping something made in the USA would be good unfortunately this one was not.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it is easy to use (if your beard is not to long), gives a very close shave and the battery lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> To be fair, it&#x27;s possibel there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing right, but this has been a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I am a black man, first of all, and bumps are something that I am very prone to having.</li>
            <li> keeps it tight and clean inbetween haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many African American men do not like shaving due to the  increase of irratating hair bumps.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and it really is the closest thing to a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> It is small and easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li> jus have to make sure your hair is already trimmed (cant be long at all) and go over skin gently.. if you press hard youll get razor bumps</li>
            <li> Based on the many positive reviews, and the affordable price, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, loud, and can be harsh if you use it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am in African American male without a full beard</li>
            <li> It works better in those cases if one does NOT mash down on the face but rather simply shave repeatedly in different directions.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I sent the item back to the seller who has yet to refund the amount paid for a new product!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;R.R. Harris, author of Double Take, An Island Travel Mystery of Lively Romance and Deadly Betrayal, available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a 35 year old black man I never thought I could achieve such a smooth shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> If I shave with it everyday, I get a clean 100 cut.</li>
            <li> The only shave i had close to this was with the older phillips with the goo.</li>
            <li> Overall I would suggest that people look for a source for the older style Wahl shavers and get one of those instead of this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Hispanic decent and my facial hair grows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for and used numerous electric razors and all work decent on my skin.</li>
            <li> I shaved for the first time with this Wahl shaver last Thursday night the same day</li>
            <li> My only regret is it does not have a mustasche trimmer as my older model did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely close shave right off the bat</li>
            <li> I have to say I had such high expectations for this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wonder how others consumers could rate this product as highly as they did in the reviews that I read prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I guess maybe other black males have tougher skin than mine and maybe thats why they had better success with this shaver.</li>
            <li> i checked on the reviews and seen other african american reviews and were happy i found something.but the pricing point and some of the negative reviews swayed me away for a week or too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years (thanks to my old barber) and it definitely works - BUT only for stubble-length hair.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and seems very durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used Norelco razors all my life and this only became an issue the last few years and probably relates to my age more then the razor.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it in that mode normally as it would likely kill the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just be mindful, it is for very short stubble.. not for normal shaving.</li>
            <li> I reverted back to my old style-- using blades and my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white but my facial hair tends to curl right back into my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried being super gentle and applying barely any pressure, but it couldn&#x27;t pick up any hairs that were lying down and required multiple passes to pick up regular stubble.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I had the proper tools and a little bit of knowledge on how to use a soldering gun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to send it back and see if I can get a new one.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and after looking at various products decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> However, I will probably order a new Wahl model 4000, once they are back in stock for my every day razor.</li>
            <li> It is critical that every black man struggling with razor bumps understand that FOIL ELECTRIC RAZORS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ALLEVIATE RAZOR BUMPS IN BLACK MEN.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it has become harder and harder to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve completely razor bump free I am an african American male and the military</li>
            <li> I am an African American &amp; I havea very stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ yr old white guy with sensitive skin, so I approached this purchase with skepticism.</li>
            <li> Your facial hair that grown out straight will actually stick through the foils and get cut by the razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, I&#x27;d say just as close as a blade, but it will only work on stubble or very short beard growth.  </li>
            <li> long as you keep your hair pretty short (which I always do)</li>
            <li> Still have to go over my neck with a blade occasionally, and the fact that the whole shaver isn&#x27;t washable is why it only has a 4 star and not 5 from me.</li>
            <li> , that also arrived quickly, but it too was missing the shaper.</li>
            <li> and I realize it only cost $50, but I truly expected higher quality and did not expect to need repair this early after purchase.</li>
            <li> Big ups to Wahl for putting this product out, not usually a fan of Wahl but this one takes the Cake..</li>
            <li> The problem I am having is the power switch wont keep the razor running, I have to hold the switch in and up to the on position to shave which is a major pain.  </li>
            <li> The first week did get razor bumps or burns however using aloe vera gel and exfoliating head just about every other day cleared everything up.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you are cutting srubble it does not cut moderate to full length beards.</li>
            <li> With my other grooming tools, I&#x27;ve always found Andis to be of higher quality than Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much gone with a beard or a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow since I was a teen due to my first few encounters with razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> First it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that other reviews gave it, I have only used this product twice because before I ever put it on my head it used it on my beard and it barely removed any hair.</li>
            <li> The very next day my face was super sensitive and would sting a little if I touched my face or under my neck.</li>
            <li> You have to shave down the beard to a low level before you use it, and then use the shaver to just make it super close.</li>
            <li> It did wonderful shaving around the sides of my face but often completely missed slightly longer hairs on my neck and painfully pulled on the mustache ones.</li>
            <li> but not as expected not really close to a clean shave</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to razor bumps, but this thing has not left me with a rash of ingrowns or irritated skin like the older electrics occasionally did.  </li>
            <li> This is the scond one I used, so I like it very much, I will buy an other one, if I should live so long</li>
            <li> also it is pretty noisy but unless you live inside a library, it shouldnt be that big of a problem to hear for less than 5 minutes a day</li>
            <li> But if you go slowly and do not press hard -- let the razor do the work -- you will get a remarkably close shave.</li>
            <li> Must be careful with it especially when carrying the device in a bag with other things because the case can come off and get lost easily.</li>
            <li> Generally, I use my Andies t-liner to line everything up.</li>
            <li> recharges fast &amp; last a long time</li>
            <li> it is way too small to fit a fully grown facial hair.</li>
            <li> This Wahl razor is about the same cost as replacement heads on the old razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, after about two months it barely cuts at all.  </li>
            <li> WOW, THEY FINALLY CAME OUT WITH A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR USERS THAT DON&#x27;T WANNA USE RAZOR BLADES.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how close of a shave it actually gives</li>
            <li> even though they didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as I would like, it was neat enough for a professional appearance.</li>
            <li> The unit cuts very close without causing bumps that African American people get religiously.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re currently processing your review and we will emaias soon as this is complete.</li>
            <li> You may have an occasional ingrown hair that you can pull out with the tweezers, but this beats the \\&quot;old bumpy bump\\&quot; face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an italian guy with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Pros: Can be used as a revenge tool to disturb your neighbors if their loud sex wakes you up in the middle of the night&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downsides are that there is no trimmer and it is loud.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased for my 92 year old father in law who insist Wahl is the only product that can give him the shave he likes.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement to his current one that got old.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have clients who want that close shave, but there skin can&#x27;t handle the razor directly on there skin.</li>
            <li> In reality, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true but for around $50 and 90% as close, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this shaver, but alas I can not.  </li>
            <li> I even used my manual razor to get it all the way down first.</li>
            <li> I still use the clippers first to cut down any growth, but then I use the Wahl shaver to get close.</li>
            <li> but you do have to trim it down first.  </li>
            <li> These razors are not easy to find, and I&#x27;m mystified that they are not more popular.</li>
            <li> I have tried it dry, with a liquid pre-shave called Kyoku (GREAT stuff, by the way, albeit expensive), and with Remington&#x27;s dry wax pre-shave sticks.  </li>
            <li> reason black males get razor bumps in the first place is because our hair is too curly.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be pretty short when using this razor because it DOES NOT have a Pop-Up Trimmer like other Electric</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver for the African American male to use to closely shave the head.</li>
            <li> Now, my other son wants the razor, his birthday is coming up</li>
            <li> One day, my son told me about the Wahl dry razor the barber used on him while in New York.</li>
            <li> Everytime i went to the barber for a complete haircut and shave of a shapeup it will begin to grow back on the beginning of the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got some &#x27;crazy&#x27; whiskers that have to be cut from several directions and this shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li> It is a little tender at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little funny that the instruction says to give it a couple of weeks for my body to get used to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> removed all my ingrowns with tweezers first, then used the Andis Outliner edgers, then the Wahl shavers to clean any remaing stubbles (going over areas no more than twice, excessive usages in the same area irritates the skin), rubbing alcohol, finally applyin bumpstopper sensitive skin twice</li>
            <li> It does not get all the hairs, especially if you have Patches that usually grow longer than others, but if you start w/ a clean shave, and use the shaver daily \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> I say not a lot of bumps because during the second week of use I got a few bumps under my chin and right by the jaw line, hence the 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li> I found immediately that you must NOT push hard on this shaver like you do with most of the other ones.  </li>
            <li> The product came very fast, when using this product remember that your facial hair needs to be very short to trim down with this machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I still have not found anything that can give me a closer shave than the Andis trimmer I use, but I guess I just have to accept it for now and be happy not to have any in-grown hairs or bumps after I shave.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to return the item but decided the time needed to do so was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a young 19 year african american male.</li>
            <li> Specs: 30 year old African American male who shaves every day.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse facial hair and this thing cuts it down pretty close for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery</li>
            <li> When purchasing an item, it is expected that I would receive an item in brand new conditon.</li>
            <li> It was never able to get the hair right beneath my nose or under my chin or on my neck, but it did alright on the mustache and around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes right past it without a hair shaved.</li>
            <li> but if it similar to mine pretty much everyday once a day in the night or morning.</li>
            <li> electric shaver will ever compare to the smoothness you can get from a razor when you want to have soft, &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; legs with your guy, but I believe this is as close as I can get for normal, everyday &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; use.  </li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old black male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young adult with down syndrome to teach him how to shave himself.  </li>
            <li> I have used clippers and other electric shavers, but they didn&#x27;t shave close enough and as I got older</li>
            <li> Sadly, the place on the back where the trimmer *was* on older models, has been filled in with a blank piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional, with a little effort, gives me a smoother neck than any razor I have yet tried (but I&#x27;m only 86 years old)!  </li>
            <li> The shaver works very well with short hairs not a full beard.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8061 5 Star dry razor should be in every African Americans bathroom medicine cabinet as well as for different nationalities.</li>
            <li> Another thing lacking is that with the old Wahl&#x27;s you use to get several choices of shaving heads to use, this one only has the single one it comes with.</li>
            <li> At times a little touch up is need with a trimmer (I have some very stubborn gray hairs).  </li>
            <li> I have to purchase a new screen every other month.</li>
            <li> it costs me a little less than it would to buy mens razors if I was clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> It was such a depressing fact, comming from someone who dresses nicely but my facial hair would mess up the whole outfit.</li>
            <li> Loved this razor to bad</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have the challenge with bumps that many African-American men have (I am white), I do have crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For all those black men out there who are plagued with razor bumps and have tried everyway of shaving, here is a little advice: try the Andis outliner 2 trimmer and be sure you go to your local black barber and ask him to adjust the blades.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of electric shavers coming from shaving with a straight razor but needed something i could use right before work</li>
            <li> This shaver is by far above and beyond any other electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> I only shave every 5 days ago due to my skin being sensitive.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have to shave my head half way up then</li>
            <li> Then I apply a thin layer of baby powder on my face to ensure my face is dry and allow the shaver to glide easily across my face.</li>
            <li> Apart from the few individual strands of hair that the shaver refuses to clip this shaver does a decent job assisted by a clipper.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A LOUD MOTOR AND SHARP BLADES;;</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, this shaver is really loud.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to cut the deeper hairs, the ones run flat against my skin and eventually curl back under to create the bumps.</li>
            <li> This product does a poor job at giving you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to use it daily or the facial hairs get to long.</li>
            <li> I have never used a shaver that will not even cut my facial hair if it is long or short  </li>
            <li> Should have bought extra screens they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and it said your face needs to get used to a new shaver and to only use the Wahl shaver for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> ended up having to go back to conventional razors being careful of not cutting to close to the skin, it causes me less irritation and ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Even when I would get shaved with a straight razor at the barber shop, I would still end up with a few bumps and my skin would be dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> These shapers are absolutely what I&#x27;ve been looking for 5 stars all the way no more razors they shave close and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> And the battery doesnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> The battery last long without recharging and it gives you a close shave to remove stubble.</li>
            <li> Long lasting between charges.</li>
            <li> It also had a built-in pop-up trimmer, which is absolutely essential to cut those long hairs that the foil cannot remove.  </li>
            <li> charge does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I still have this set aside and will use every one in a long while on my face only.</li>
            <li> some extra long haird that I coulnt remove with my clipper.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is why they last so long for me.</li>
            <li> con is you must trim your facial hair or head with a trimmer/ clipper, otherwise hairs will be too long to cut.</li>
            <li> Long story short just get a DE razor.</li>
            <li> None with the close shave and long lasting battery life of this product!!  </li>
            <li> This must be true as my son has not experienced any irritation that I can see after shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving near the neck area is very hard and you don&#x27;t get that close of a shave, but everywhere else, it gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> and I had to turn to my barber to shave it down completely.</li>
            <li> Follow up your five star shave by gently swirling a wet tooth brush over your skin to remove little hair follices before they burrow into your face and give you bumps.</li>
            <li> Both involve standard military hair cut ( High and tight).</li>
            <li> the average person using this for their beard, or smaller sections of their head or neck, this probably won&#x27;t be as big a deal, as it will likely last a lot longer, but I go through a replacement screen and blade about once</li>
            <li> The new Braun 320s-4 is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am a black in a warmer climate with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dry shaver only, cannot use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old Black man.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my old razor causing severe irritation after shaving, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> A trimmer would be useful but it is not that much trouble to use a blade razor to outline and trim every few days.  </li>
            <li> Although noisy, this electric shaver provides a close shave with little irritation and only a few evident ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> but if you take the foil head off you&#x60;ll see the small writing in the hair pocket which tells you it&#x60;s for personal use only, so why is it advertised as professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to believe that I don&#x27;t have the original manufacturer razor and got the fake one I have read about.  </li>
            <li> A little loud.</li>
            <li> Did I say a little loud.</li>
            <li> First few uses, it did not clean my face.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is powerful and gives me a close shave on a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have never had razorburn with any shaver in the past, and I wasn&#x27;t used to any high end shavers.  </li>
            <li> 1st use, model shook so much, it was hard to use, and gave some skin irritation, but decide to follow advice and give it another try.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was a little reckless and saw what he meant and had a few bumps, not like what the guy in the customer pics has.</li>
            <li> I wish I had looked for one with a edger on it as well as it is hard to get a straight line with it</li>
            <li> However, if it&#x27;s your first time, be careful - press too hard</li>
            <li> I may have picked up the wrong size in his boots, but I definitely got this one gift right!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; the foil too hard on to your skin when shaving, and you actually have to use another shaver (like an outliner) to mov down your beard hairs first.</li>
            <li> summary;really ugly design,very loud,gets warm,no trimmer,cheap plastic...very effective for me after period of adaptation.</li>
            <li> And there are an abundance of missed hairs, even after going over my face multiple times (which is NOT GOOD practice for people who get razor bumps), but I really wanted this shaver to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> fade it up for the desired look, which left me with the most painful razor bumps and ingrown hairs that turned white and looked like zits!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them for as long as i have to shave.</li>
            <li> My husband has a lot of grey in his beard</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money and it disappoints as a gift.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t act on his word, \\&quot;long story short\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Since shaver batteries die long before shavers do, that would be quite a selling point.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> If the hairs grow out too long, the foil will not pick them up.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with sensitive skin since I began shaving over 42 years ago.</li>
            <li> the razor when it arrived, and had a dozen long shaves with it before it needed recharging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a Wahl hypoallergenic shaver for a long time.  </li>
            <li> So for a long time I used my hair trimmer clippers to groom my face and mustache.</li>
            <li> On my nest shave, in order to cut closer, I stretched my face in all directions while using the Wahl until the peach fuzz was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it still has tons of power and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not gonna cut long hair</li>
            <li> long).  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and I get the closest trim for beards</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t get long hairs that can&#x27;t feed trough the foil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a long time and it works.  </li>
            <li> Be careful where you buy it from, because this 3rd party merchants have a no return policy.</li>
            <li> razor has plenty of power and holds it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it messed up my bearld and didnt cut cut low and smoothly as I expected it wud be</li>
            <li> but for the quality of the shave - that&#x27;s minor.</li>
            <li> As an African-American military member, this is the closet shaver I have found that does not leave my face with ingrownhairs two days later.</li>
            <li> Long time and it works yet.  </li>
            <li> Runs a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> You really have to use it everyday, otherwise you need to trim your beard down beforehand.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter whether the hair was short or long, wet or dry - nothing but</li>
            <li> only drawback would be the foil needs to be replaced every few months due to heavy use ... highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> It is much easier than trying to use a blade on my head -- hopefully no more nicks and cuts!  </li>
            <li> Confused about the product I took it to my barber to ensure I purchase the right item.</li>
            <li> after seeing my facial hair mess in the mirror, i decided to take a chance with this believe its my last option</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery doesn&#x27;t last too long though, they last just a little bit over a year.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t cut quite close enough, and it gives me razorburn - irritating my skin far more than a blade.  </li>
            <li> Having been a dedicated electric shaving person for the past 20 years or so (save for a brief foray into old fashioned flat blade razors for a month or so), I&#x27;ve had all of the major shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt cut as low as other shavers.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers I find it does miss some neck hairs, probably because they grow in different directions</li>
            <li> what a strange and misfortunate choice of material!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a very solid shaver.</li>
            <li> AT OTHER PLACES THEY ARE 75.00 AND UP EVEN THE LOCAL BEAUTY AND BARBER SHOP.  </li>
            <li> Each person&#x27;s regimen will be different--personally I shave every other day, using quality clippers to get the longer stubble and then going back over with the Shaver.</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a very long time as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Well after letting the hair on my face grow out from last Thursday to today(Tuesday) I needed to shave again to look appropriate for work and decided not to chance it with the Wahl shaver and to just use the Andis Outliner trimmer instead and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my face looked, in-grown hairs and bumps everywhere on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Smoooooooooth dry shave with no bumps and no irritation.</li>
            <li> shaves very close, the closest I&#x27;ve seen, not good with long hairs, razor bumps are a problem</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done I wash my face with a cleanser and pat dry my face.  </li>
            <li> As for edge trimming use a blade, it takes all of 15 seconds and do it dry.  </li>
            <li> ONLY downside of foil shavers (i assume all of them with the smaller holes)  if you do happen to go a few days or miss a strand of hair here</li>
            <li> This allows me to get a very close shave almost everyday (if i shave everyday) without skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> The only negative so far is that it is noisy.</li>
            <li> I was never satisfied with other shavers that I had previously used because they always left visible hairs, but found this shaver to be very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Now it dont shave a single hair.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the loudness and although I agree that it is MUCH louder than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s bearable.  </li>
            <li> This razor offers the closest shave of any I&#x27;ve owned (rotary or foil) in the past 35 years.  </li>
            <li> My old Brauns were about every 2, though they usually didn&#x27;t quite make it that long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one was broken while I was traveling.  </li>
            <li> had to replace the heads twice in less than 6 months and then in less than 8 months quit working completely</li>
            <li> LIKE BACK AND FORTH, UP AND DOWN</li>
            <li> Secondly after using my clippers to bring my head hair down to a acceptable length to be cut with Wahl.</li>
            <li> my trimmer/edger to take the hair down very low on my head and to line up my beard.</li>
            <li> Once the battery inside it loses its ability to hold a charge, you have to throw it away and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It simply shaves faster and with less irritation</li>
            <li> I would say as close as what a half day after shaving with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Hopeing to get similar results, as I uses to from my Remington shaver design for black man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave heads everyday, all day long; maybe a couple a day, say ten to fifteen a week.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what, but it should still work less than 6 months after purchase, and for this i give it only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will note that I have been using this product for years, and it does typically have a shaper, and there is only one model number.</li>
            <li> Plus, those blades get expensive quick.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the shave quality, it shaves as close as an electric shaver can (allowing once, daily shaving), yet the foil is of poor quality and with daily shaving, needs to be replaced monthly in the best circumstances (due to dulling), however in the worst circumstances (it happened to me three times), the foil screen will crack, requiring replacement.</li>
            <li> The Wahl dry razor did leave a few stray hairs (3 to 4) which is relatively nothing.</li>
            <li> Anyway I made a bold move to buy it but got disappointed the first few days until I came up with a plan having realized what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used on the head after haircuts to remove little hairs and things such as that</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for two months, use a little morning and night</li>
            <li> , well I thought the Shaper part is this little trimmer piece on the back of the foil.</li>
            <li> I do have a little irritation and the shaver doesn’t totally remove all the hair from my face.</li>
            <li> it will give you a close shave for the little time it last you.</li>
            <li> The supplied power cord is very long and lightweight, so that is not exactly a problem for me at work, but if i had to travel or...</li>
            <li> Going back over those areas of my face that it misses with his shaver is futile, as the shaver appears unable to reach certain contours of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Wahl, please make a flat head shaver like the es 1000 remington stopped making and you can dump this foil shaver for black men which doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> As far as electric razors go it&#x27;s hard to beat the performance of this one.</li>
            <li> Half the weight of my Lady Remington due to plastic housing and no internal charging mechanism.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick, coarse facial hair like myself, it takes a few runs to achieve a close shave, but it definitely gets closer than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the product does not provide the shaper at the back of the shaver; at least the replacement I have does not.</li>
            <li> very short, long stble gives it a small problem, it cuts it, but takes longer...</li>
            <li> This shaver was not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I got tired of using a straight razor</li>
            <li> Gets close to the skin but has trouble with facial hair longer than stubble.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve spent the money for a Braun.</li>
            <li> The razor is performing as expected.</li>
            <li> but if you use it everyday it&#x27;s a step that you&#x27;ll only have to do once.</li>
            <li> but I have a harder time using it on my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working properly d expected.</li>
            <li> but I believe he really no longer uses it now.</li>
            <li> i was pissedd that i spent $50 on it.</li>
            <li> know shaving the head can be harder on a razor</li>
            <li> not what I expected AT ALL.</li>
            <li> The razors are under the foil so your face never really touches the razor.</li>
            <li> Lowest rating because I bought it for my husband who is Haitian, and in the military.</li>
            <li> (something not possible unless I shaved every 3 days which is not feasible as I&#x27;d destroy my face pursuing that</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> It is over hyped for that close shave I expected.</li>
            <li> I suffer from PFB and this was supposed to be a close shave minus the irritation.</li>
            <li> He is mentally challenged and this item is easier for him to use.</li>
            <li> it does not shave as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> Item had minimal use and the return was refused.</li>
            <li> mower  is  expected  to cut  the  grass  </li>
            <li> Just needed to get the pre electric shave and minimal bumps.</li>
            <li> My beard is not fast growing</li>
            <li> This shaver gets almost as close as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> It costs too much to work so poorly on my face/head.</li>
            <li> Like all foil razors though, if you skip shaving a day or two, got to be careful.</li>
            <li> This shaver never really cuts all of the hairs on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Instead it tries to polish my hide leaving it in a burning, stinging rage.</li>
            <li> I am involved in law enforcement as well as military.</li>
            <li> The key is to get on a manageable routine, brush your hair everyday so that you wont get the hair bumps.</li>
            <li> The foil covering wears out and needs replacement after only a few shaves, the foil lasted me about 2 weeks before it began showing holes.</li>
            <li> Over the next couple of nights i continued to shave to prevent my hair from comming back and the irritation slowly went away as my face got used to it.</li>
            <li> The new 8061 model comes with only one head, and no built-in trimmer (stupid) at a higher price.  </li>
            <li> I pushed a little too hard the first time I used it, and got a little bit of a rash.  </li>
            <li> : My barber was right, but my hair was wrong.</li>
            <li> My friend Wayne told me about Wahl shavers for black men a long time ago</li>
            <li> I see a lot of bad reviews and the main reason for this is because these people are not knocking down the hair with an Andis T-outliner, Superliner or Style Liner 1 or 2 FIRST .</li>
            <li> My barber uses these to give me a shave after he does my hair, I grow a very thick and coarse beard and razors just take too long as I&#x27;m constantly clogging the blades,</li>
            <li> Its only fault (and a small ones at that) is it&#x27;s LOUD, sounds like a two-cycle lawn mower and on a hard surface it&#x27;ll vibrate and move about like a drunken hamster.  </li>
            <li> You will need another shaver to clear the longer hairs, this shaver is for the very small, close stubble.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is, I am already replacing the foil head assembly.</li>
            <li> so I used DuDu Osun black soap and let my kneck air dry.</li>
            <li> This shaver barely clears stubble left behind by the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious I am not rich!</li>
            <li> have said this machine does not give close shave, let me say it will not give you a close shave if you leave your beard to grow a little longer and get curled as some of us black folks face such.</li>
            <li> This is my major complaint...</li>
            <li> But if the hairs are a little long it won&#x27;t cut them.</li>
            <li> but when my stubble does grow its curly and patches and it looks terrible  and is itchy.wanted to find something that I can use to keep my face smooth and keep my partial beard shaved without using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing it to use on your face, you would need to plan on using it everyday so that your beard growth doesn&#x27;t get too long</li>
            <li> i would try an other wahl type.</li>
            <li> other reviews</li>
            <li> and there due to being in a rush</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully!</li>
            <li> had a closer shave with any other electric...</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am a barber and after using a liner there is usually stubble left on the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been scared of using a razor due to acquiring razor bumps.</li>
            <li> your still saving money by not buying other grooming products.</li>
            <li> besides that DO NOT USE RAZORS OR ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS.</li>
            <li> I dont bump up, like when I used those other shavers like norelco or</li>
            <li> But bottom-line, this razor blows every other razor I&#x27;ve used out of the water with ease.</li>
            <li> this helped my son with the razor bumps he would get from other razors.</li>
            <li> and I would not use any other shaver except for this one.</li>
            <li> tips to other people:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> this is for me, other people hair growth rate varies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no post shave bumps or other irritation from using this device.</li>
            <li> Longer than other shavers I have had.</li>
            <li> I like to shave my head but don&#x27;t always like to have to use a Mach3 or other blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not buy one again due to the frailty of the foil on the head.</li>
            <li> I hope that this helps other African-American men as this shaver has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> Shaves my head extremely close with no irritation .</li>
            <li> Wish the foils were level with each other so I can hold it easier when shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the way it runs smoothe on my butt cheecks.....and other places.</li>
            <li> other than this, this shaver is everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> ishowever is comparable to other shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a couple of recommendations from a couple of barbers but the foil split in two within 2 weeks of shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> It helps to read the other reviews and remember to 1.</li>
            <li> Then the creams which include the issues above and they were simply weak and left patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> My other one lasted about 4 years but something broke on inside while traveling and stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have to replace the foil and cutter every 6 months or so, just like with my other razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned Phillips, Norelco and this Wahl is sharp.  </li>
            <li> It did not shave a hair on his face nor did it shave a hair on my arm or any other member of my family.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Cuts extremely close without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it did literally nothing.</li>
            <li> but I will probably postpone that for now as I have to repair the other mower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped the first pair  </li>
            <li> The foil failed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> maybe i got a defective product because my experience is not as the other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> Apparently the warranty does not cover the foil which is ridiculous because the line between the two foil heads was partially perforated at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> He is very careful with his shaving equipment, so it wasn&#x27;t from misuse.</li>
            <li> I would be very careful about purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> If only it cost a little less, I would like to buy them as a Xmas gift for every professinal black men in my family.</li>
            <li> It does its job of cutting super close</li>
            <li> I usually use my andis outliners to shave my facial hair down and then follow up with applying remington face saver</li>
            <li> but I had trouble with the screen coming loose from the housing.  </li>
            <li> Quality has gone down from the other Wahl shavers that I have had.</li>
            <li> ,I opened the package I was surprised that the Wahl was a hideous wine colored pice of cheap looking plastic and not the sleek looking black pictured on Amazon,in any event I gave it a try,and I hated it,</li>
            <li> The worst product i&#x27;ve ever bought in my life, a single star would be a complement, it disn&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> A little rough on the face.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, you have to be very careful not to press down too hard</li>
            <li> When I 1st tried it, I would push it hard on my face to try to get as close as possible.</li>
            <li> Even after pressing hard on my face (which is not recommended) it didn&#x27;t do anything but actually cut my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don’t press hard against my face while shaving and that seems to make the combs last for years.</li>
            <li> I contacted Wahl customer service and they indicated that the average turn around is three weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to use it everyday because after several days it can irritate but every 2-3 days has not been a problem.  </li>
            <li> I tried to wait 2 weeks for my face to get used to it, but it failed to cut enough hair to keep me within military standards on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have only one complaint...</li>
            <li> Sucks when youre trying to woo the opposite sex</li>
            <li> It helps to even out the skin tone and get rid of those unsightly dark spots from razor bumps.    </li>
            <li> skin was also irritated but they recommend sticking with it for a while before your skin gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth spending another penny on this shaver.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not a big negative</li>
            <li> It loses one star only because the battery is not replaceable.</li>
            <li> Wow, bought this as a replacement for my Phillips Arcitec figuring it would work just as poorly</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly facial hair, this may not be the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes picking in-grown hairs out and now my face will need a few weeks to recover and hopefully heal.</li>
            <li> Poorly built, loud product, that became inoperable within 6 months.  </li>
            <li> youll hair to cut those hairs down a bit with something else before the shaver will catch them    </li>
            <li> This shaver outdoes the rotary shavers hands down, and you dont have to keep going over and over your face with it.</li>
            <li> Now, I shave down every 3-4 days w/</li>
            <li> Gets the job down.</li>
            <li> You will have to trim down your beard a lot for this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, mashing down on the shaver while shaving tends to cause me to have some skin irritation.</li>
            <li> thumbs down</li>
            <li> Would recommend you take the lack of customer service into consideration before you drop the money down.</li>
            <li> Using hair trimmers or clippers keep the bumps down</li>
            <li> let us down on this one.</li>
            <li> I used to use Wahl beard trimmers turned upside down, and sometimes the BumpStopper razors.  </li>
            <li> I recmd that you dont press down on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver from Sally&#x27;s and was a little skeptic about an electric razor as I&#x27;d tried other electric razors before.  </li>
            <li> I wish the color of it is black, which is not very important otherwise its a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts well</li>
            <li> the product gets the job done but is not extraordinarily efficient.</li>
            <li> think I will stick to shaving with a razor which takes less time.</li>
            <li> But one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is less bumps, so it seems to be working for that.</li>
            <li> is already used to it in less than a week.    </li>
            <li> I then realized it was for a black man because of the pictures on the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with the honor of having ingrown hairs as a black man.</li>
            <li> Its consumables (cutters, foil) cost way less than anyone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with shaving bumps being a black man.</li>
            <li> I recommend this all Black males that have the bumping problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and Razor bumps have ALWAYS been and issue...</li>
            <li> Needs to be slightly retuned in order to receive 5 stars.</li>
            <li> but less than 5 minutes would be suffice&lt;</li>
            <li> I had the Skull previously and it lasted almost no time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to others, particularly Black men.  </li>
            <li> As a black man, i&#x27;ve tried all the products but still got razor bumps.</li>
            <li> top of that the customer service to get my money back was HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> Not super close</li>
            <li> Came in slightly opened.</li>
            <li> Heres&#x27; my problem: after six months or less the on/off switch stopped functioning.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the quality of the last two that I owned was nothing like the earlier razors.  </li>
            <li> Has the closest shave of all razors, and shaving time is less.</li>
            <li> I just let it glide slightly over my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done my head, neck and face in 20 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended for black men (which I am)</li>
            <li> My clippers gives me a closer shave and it costs less.</li>
            <li> thats .031 thousandths or less than 1mm.(WHAT)&lt;br</li>
            <li> ingrowns and less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Lastly after using the wahl for the first time the gold foils had two noticeable cracks in them so in conclusion I am disappointed by this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although everyone may experience different results with this item, unfortunately i was on the short end of the stick.</li>
            <li> Then I bought a Wahl personal groomer, that included a small screen for &amp;#34;tidy up&amp;#34; small jobs.  </li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband after he somehow broke the previous one.</li>
            <li> work at home and didn&#x27;t have any black tie dinner parties on my calendar</li>
            <li> I have thick Italian hair and have always had trouble finding a shaver that got it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not shine with quality as older Wahl products have.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t press it hard on your face and just let the razor do its job</li>
            <li> then I have to take my beard trimmer to the stubble to knock down the length a little for this razor to work well.</li>
            <li> but it grows sparsely all over my face as a mess.</li>
            <li> It barely does a thing unless mines is broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used it for a little less than a month and one of the foils</li>
            <li> I begin shaving by pulling my skin tight while gliding the shaver over my face.  </li>
            <li> however I have a major problem with the shaving foil: it is made of a metal that colors my skin: after I shave the skin simply looks dirty.</li>
            <li> it was loud,ugly,felt like really cheap plastic,and gave a really bad shave,I would have returned it that same day,but because of Panasonic&#x27; slow service, was forced to use it...</li>
            <li> Sadly the new ones don&#x27;t appear to have an edger.  </li>
            <li> The shaving was not clean and the product has not solved my ingrown hair problems.</li>
            <li> For the price I expect little.  </li>
            <li> You have to work a little</li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;ve seen trimmers in barber shops but never an electric razor, but with as little hair as I have, what do I know?  </li>
            <li> my little brother cause</li>
            <li> the little stubble that was growing was gone.</li>
            <li> When I did this, I would get little bumps.</li>
            <li> A little noisy</li>
            <li> It would be nicer if it was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> the hairs a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> oh and did I mention how noisy this little POS is?</li>
            <li> and I was a little apprehensive based on the price</li>
            <li> A little noisy but performance up to par.</li>
            <li> The hair is curled and if it won&#x27;t reach the blade, there is little it can do.</li>
            <li> feels like it cuts your skin a little or atleast for me.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice on holding on your scalp, but i can shave everyday no problem.</li>
            <li> Forrest Gump said it best, \\&quot;Stupid is as stupid does\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This shaver really works well for any man who suffers from Shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> BUT it was very time consuming and inconvenient</li>
            <li> My barber used it on me a few days ago</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> He has found that he must use it everyday though.</li>
            <li> the foil is breaking out after few months...</li>
            <li> ive been using this everyday now for almost a week now.  </li>
            <li> but like it says on the directions give it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> If you need to shave everyday than you need a Wahl.</li>
            <li> After several uses of this product I was not happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Have to say this was a waste.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is a nice product I have one from another supplier but DiscountJungle customer service is horrible.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth result at all.</li>
            <li> Women don&#x27;t care how you look all they see is green.</li>
            <li> so it gives me harsh bumps and rash on my skin.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, but the blades got ripped.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and hold its charge for a few days.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my head with razor blades and was never comfortable.</li>
            <li> Messy shave&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and travels with it as well.</li>
            <li> It does miss a few hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> Wider foil blade area; shaves my legs faster than a narrow &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s shaver&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money for me.am nt going to use it again.cus</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars for a few reason.</li>
            <li> Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Only buy from respected sellers and you wont get used or broken items.</li>
            <li> When I was done, I noticed there were patches of random hair that looked like they had been completely unshaven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Closest shave of any electric shaver, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out very easily, and as a black man, that can be devastating for your face.</li>
            <li> The trick I&#x27;ve found is slowing down a bit with each pass, not more pressure.  </li>
            <li> There are not many products like this on the market that work well for black men.</li>
            <li> As the other reviews stated, you don&#x27;t have to press hard</li>
            <li> Not a very good shaver for a black person to use to shave their head.</li>
            <li> Thin plastic and a little loose around the switch and plug port.</li>
            <li> It sucks don&#x27;t waste your money has no power and stopped working correctly less than a week after I got them.</li>
            <li> i tried single straight blades, but had terrible technique, electric shavers are pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad, my son had to keep rubbing it on one area of his face and still with all of that it didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li> i first I want to apologise cause I wrote a really bad review regarding this product.</li>
            <li> Basically have to rub my scalp raw just to get it to cut.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that with the amount of hair I have to remove every day or so, the gold foil wears out too fast, and when it splits (often without warning) the still sharp blades can give you a nasty pinch/scratch (haven&#x27;t drawn blood, but felt like</li>
            <li> Hello, This is one of the most sorry and bad shavers I ever bought in my life time  </li>
            <li> Actually after using this shaver for a couple of years, I can&#x27;t say enough bad about it.</li>
            <li> If I go without shaving for a couple days on the weekend this shaver really pulls and impossible to get anything but stubble without using my trimmer and shaving again.</li>
            <li> Motor is crazy powerful, I think it scares some customers who have not experienced it yet</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used it regularly but his face never adjusted to the cutting, it was too rough on his skin.</li>
            <li> only complaint is with the seller and the poor packing during shipping.</li>
            <li> (if it does shave very little hair)&lt;br</li>
            <li> All you need to do is run it on your face and apply very little to no pressure.</li>
            <li> Being a black man, having less bumps is a plus!!!</li>
            <li> What a sham!</li>
            <li> I been using the shaver about a month, no more problem with bumps.</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;have\\&quot; bumps now and am not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I also got a small amount of razor bumps</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of testing, it didn&#x27;t worked, at least for</li>
            <li> I usually have a bald head</li>
            <li> (the razor broke before 30 days had past).</li>
            <li> I Am not sure how to go about getting another grill.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they expect you to shave without a trimmer</li>
            <li> The areas just under the jaw bone and above the neck are extremely difficult for this razor to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It started as a small chip and within 2 days was unusable.  </li>
            <li> Battery usually lasts me a couple of weeks+ before needing a recharge.  </li>
            <li> Not safe to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, using a regular razor is out of the question.</li>
            <li> which made it an unrealistic option especially as my life became busier.</li>
            <li> I have been unfortunately blessed to have facial hair grow overnight!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> yourself the trouble - Trust Me!</li>
            <li> Five or six times over a small area</li>
            <li> The barber also said he has problems with the head cracking and has bought two heads in the past six months that he has had it......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it was merely okay on the sideburns and cheeks and gave me the worst razor burn on my neck, even a day or two after I stopped shaving with it.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used a couple lower end Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> The price on this shaver was not much more than a couple Braun screen replacements.  </li>
            <li> and I move in an up and down motion in the same area until I can no longer hear the razor cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> Since this shaver, he has very few ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of trying this machine based on past experiences with other machines.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hated to use a razor everyday, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I failed to operate when it&#x27;s off of the power cord - at least the last one did this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m really bummed I was so disappointed by this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that Wahl has tried to capitalize on its hair clipper popularity by putting out this very loud, ineffective foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing is the screen went bad in less than a dozen shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pop-up tripper is also quite dull.  </li>
            <li> SO HARD</li>
            <li> LIKE, #1 PRESSING TO HARD THINKING</li>
            <li> no bumps, no reddening (unless i press hard), no irritation anymore</li>
            <li> but I hardly see any hair come out when I shave even though I follow the instruction.  </li>
            <li> but I believe I was pressing too hard on my face.</li>
            <li> know if it is defective, I pushed to hard or</li>
            <li> I accidentally tore the GOLD FOIL and it made it hard to shave.</li>
            <li> Son has a hard time getting a close shave with all shavers.</li>
            <li> Barbers use this to get those hard to get hairs off of your face and go research it like I did and youtube or google and alot use this product.</li>
            <li> You had to press hard and hold in order to work.</li>
            <li> It hardly does its job.</li>
            <li> My fiancé had to press it really hard to his skin for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> You should not have to press extremely hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> bought the razor because i have sensitive skin and get bad razor bumps/burn.</li>
            <li> This shaver sucks.</li>
            <li> Too late to return.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is the cutting under the chin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying something besides a blade, or if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current electric razor, I suggest you get a Wahl rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> I was a couple of days late on making a return request to Beautymaster</li>
            <li> It is like men&#x27;s bathing suits, which are made without zipper flies (duh).</li>
            <li> Neither was included, must be cutting back on costs.  </li>
            <li> Terrible and cheap.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this product a negative star I would.</li>
            <li> COMPLAINT:  </li>
            <li> Ive used at least twice a wk for over 2months now.</li>
            <li> I am now getting a close shave without negative effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;definitely recommend giving this product at least 2 weeks to get the correct shave.</li>
            <li> If your stubble grows in slowly this is not an issue.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend for the thick curly beard types out there.</li>
            <li> I am black and thought that this shaver will be my ultimate solution :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with Remington on that note too.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my face, too, but the hair is apparently too thick there and this razor pulls, quite painfully.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again, and I hate how large and weak the switch is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated electric shavers and this is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For less than $50, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll seriously screw your face up and it&#x27;ll hurt.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it broke, stopped charging and stopped working after being used in less than 45days.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my husband was using a razor for his bald head for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious on this one.</li>
            <li> After years of skin irritation was a little skeptical that this would work.</li>
            <li> 2nd time, badly hurt my skin</li>
            <li> but the cord just when bad after several years so I will be using the Andis edgers and the five star.</li>
            <li> I thought this shaver would do the job and the price was not as bad as some local beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I wasted $48.00.</li>
            <li> Foil is no good after one month use</li>
            <li> it was painful to touch and had to wait until it went away a week later while my hair is still growing.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a stupid motorcycle early in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I used my Remington for years without missing random hairs and at a quarter of the time it takes to use this Wahl with no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> THIS shaver is crap as far as quality goes, the reason I give it 2 stars bc</li>
            <li> The base on rechargable stand broke for no odd reason.</li>
            <li> East of my hard earned money!</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that I have to purchase another blade head this soon!</li>
            <li> He too was amazed how the seller passed this items off as new when the blades had run its course and badly worn!</li>
            <li> I was tired of my heavy Lady Remington and VERY, VERY tired of rechargeable shavers because they HAVE NO POWER.  </li>
            <li> it could have been quite dangerous as the broken edges were sharp and could have cut my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed this is the only reason that you use ever.</li>
            <li> Ordering items from iPad has been difficult especially because amazons website makes it very difficult to order 1 item</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I used it one time and sent that crap back.</li>
            <li> but it does a rather poor job shaving the face.</li>
            <li> Just not happy with this Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, noisy, and after a months use it no longer takes a charge.  </li>
            <li> This may seem like an annoying extra step</li>
            <li> I have it broken</li>
            <li> My husband has purchased this shaver two times (because he&#x27;s broken them by dropping on tile).  </li>
            <li> Therefor, this razor is crap because it can not shave your facial hair.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> My fiancée was tired of razor irritation on his head from shaving.</li>
            <li> I just hate being back to buying blades now</li>
            <li> No scratching or irritating the skin like women&#x27;s shavers and their built-in &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; edges.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already broken.</li>
            <li> The shaper&#x27;s screen was defective and broken at the corner...</li>
            <li> I bought it because my barber recommended it as a way to keep my head bald but it gave poor results their as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s poor performance.</li>
            <li> No trimmer is a poor design.</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repackaging this Wahl shaver and calling Amazon tomorrow and argue with the rep about giving me a refund, I feel this is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning the product for false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Wahl should SERIOUSLY market these for women!  </li>
            <li> it just doesn’t work and it has the annoying tendency of leaving single hairs uncut that are very hard to shave.</li>
            <li> So far this is a horrible shaver</li>
            <li> I thought I would just have to cut my ties with the $52 dollars I spent on this crap.</li>
            <li> This is the worst purchase from amazon so far for me.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disgusted and not pleased with any other shaver that I have ever purchased  as with this product.    </li>
            <li> Been buying different shavers for decades - worst ever.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> Also sorry to say Remington does&#x27;nt make this shaver anymore.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> As an update to my review, I&#x27;ve had this razor for 3 years and the battery failed to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> , I did not have to purchase any expensive shaving creams or nothing.</li>
            <li> I can see this is going to be expensive maintaining this shaver.</li>
            <li> Maybe wrong choice.</li>
            <li> i was terrified that my face was going to break out terribly because it was such a close shave to the skin and that spells out doom for my face.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I never knew about this electric razor until another African-American man mentioned it about a month ago during a random conversation.</li>
            <li> They fail at trimming anything.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> to  shave  yourself  silly  </li>
            <li> sorry  </li>
            <li> was wrongly ordered</li>
            <li> And then I decided to go over my face with the Wahl shaver, and needless to say it was a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I just find it sad that the device broke.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT GO WRONG</li>
            <li> He said not to be fooled into all the marketing and expensive gimmiks or norelco and those expensive self-cleaning brands.  </li>
            <li> Im doing something wrong...?</li>
            <li> Gosh, gee whiz, weird beird?</li>
            <li> But it is just too uncomfortable, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Replacement foils are expensive compared to the over all cost.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I got tired of painful razor bumps</li>
            <li> Did a very poor job of cutting whiskers.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I had to down grade to the 8061 instead of the 8547 because of a terrible seller CBS express, but Amazon worked with me and got me this one the 8061.</li>
            <li> It may shave close, but will not prevent the razor from cutting beneath the skin, causing the bumps.  </li>
            <li> i was desperate, i tried nair on my face (disaster).</li>
            <li> , I had terrible in-grown hairs all over my face and neck a few days afterwards.</li>
            <li> This thing just dried my face out and gave one of the worst shaves ever!</li>
            <li> False adadvertisement, I hate when something doesn&#x27;t work the way it claims to.</li>
            <li> This would not be the one I talk up, sorry!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> im mad mouthing the item.</li>
            <li> It was annoying and expensive to go get a shapeup once a week to control my hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this Christmas, I&#x27;m getting some for some of my boys who use a blade and have bad razor bumps...    </li>
            <li> &gt; the quality is terribly bad though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> maybe I got a bad one out of that batch.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> but instead i got bad bumps.</li>
            <li> It gets caught on hair and painfully rips it out.  </li>
            <li> am so frustrated at how they market this product</li>
            <li> This has frustrated me for decades (I am in my 40s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> butt ugly.  </li>
            <li> painful pulling every time.  </li>
            <li> I gave up using electric shavers over 15 years ago because they were unable to give a close shave, and gave me terrible bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> So I am disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just received this shaver and let me tell you I love it. My barber used it on me a few days ago and I noticed how smooth it left my skin. The local beauty and barber supply store wanted a mint for it however Amazons price was much better!</li>
            <li> The base on rechargable stand broke for no odd reason.</li>
            <li> Works great and battery last for a few days without being recharged, tried Andis profoil  the battery did not last 10 mins.  Wahl is the best.</li>
            <li> Product did not.do as advertised, it doesnt shave the hair on my face correctly, after using product face is still hairy. Not happy</li>
            <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing based on some negative feedback. I unfortunately wasn&#x27;t able to get a close enough shave either. I even used my manual razor to get it all the way down first. I just could never even feel the razor trim me. Maybe I have a defective unit bot sure.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with my old razor causing severe irritation after shaving, especially on my neck. I had used Norelco razors all my life and this only became an issue the last few years and probably relates to my age more then the razor. This Wahl razor is about the same cost as replacement heads on the old razor so I gave it a try because of other good reviews that it had. It simply shaves faster and with less irritation then the old razor did. For the price especially, this is a 5 star item.</li>
            <li> I found this item reasonably alright, but nothing outstandingly special.</li>
            <li> I tried using this shaver for a month. It caused very bad razor bumps and wouldnt shave the hairs on my neck. And the battery doesnt last long at all. Garbage</li>
            <li> 1st use, model shook so much, it was hard to use, and gave some skin irritation, but decide to follow advice and give it another try.  2nd time, badly hurt my skin and I think the unit was leaking oil!  Sent it back.  Was I just unlucky?  Been buying different shavers for decades - worst ever.</li>
            <li> This is the scond one I used, so I like it very much, I will buy an other one, if I should live so long</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The best shaver on the market.  Very powerful and shaves very close.  I don&#x27;t think you need to spend a ton of money on a good shaver.  Here is the proof!</li>
            <li> Hi.  I bought this item from Amazon in 2013. This shaver did not shave anything, so I held it closer thinking I needed to on my leg to try it out, and got nicked. It does not shave anything off at all short hairs or a bit of length. The reviews said it would be great for sensitive skin areas that need the closer shave like the pubic area for real close smoothness. I am so sorry I wasted $48.00. I was hoping it would be good to prevent ingrown hairs and help keep bikini area smooth like the reviews stated, but no go. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor.  The close shave is almost as smooth as razor shaving. The skin is not irritated after shave. I recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Every single one of my staff now own a set of these, the best of the best in clipper. As close as a straight edge</li>
            <li> Great little shaver that could.  Helps me keep my face clean faster than with a razor.  Keep up with maintenance and cleaning cycles.</li>
            <li> Works good beter them the Spencers ones.</li>
            <li> Follow up your five star shave by gently swirling a wet tooth brush over your skin to remove little hair follices before they burrow into your face and give you bumps. It is a little tender at first but this will get you that smooth skin. I have been a user since 2004. If I need to cut longer hair I use my edgers and go back over it with the five star. My five star had an edger but the cord just when bad after several years so I will be using the Andis edgers and the five star. Sadly the new ones don&#x27;t appear to have an edger.  I am a black in a warmer climate with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they are suppose to do. I will continue to use them for as long as i have to shave.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this shaver. The price was a good value. The product was just as it was discribed.</li>
            <li> Have 2 use this daily on my face instead of razor shaving</li>
            <li> Wow, bought this as a replacement for my Phillips Arcitec figuring it would work just as poorly and man was I surprised. At less than 25% of what I paid for the Arcitec, this provides a far superior shave. It&#x27;s also faster and much easier to clean. I am almost ready to declare that it shaves as close as a blade. In reality, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true but for around $50 and 90% as close, it&#x27;s a bargain. Buy it.</li>
            <li> the product gets the job done but is not extraordinarily efficient. it does not shave as close as a disposable razor so unless one has a problem with bumps from the disposable razor, then the disposable will do.</li>
            <li> My husaband is very happy with this. He had it since fathers day and he has seen an improvement in his skin. He swears by this thing. Would purcahse again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have tried many shavers none really work for me. One day I got a hair cut and the barber asked me if I wanted my balding head shaved I said  o.k.to my surprise he took out the Wahl professional and shaved my head, It was amazing ,smooth and clean .When I got home I ordered the shaver and have been using it for my head and beard, it is wonderful ,smooth and fast no nicks or rash I just love it.</li>
            <li> This shaver sucks. You can buy a $20 Remington from Walmart and it will give a better shave. I used it one time and sent that crap back. You will spend too much time trimming hair. It won&#x27;t be a quick shave either because you have to keep hitting the same spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 3 years and this is the only way for me to shave comfortably</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  My husband has a lot of grey in his beard so it&#x27;s getting some worn spots on the head, which I need to replace, and they do have the replacements, so no problem there.  He did lose the charger, he has dementia, so had to replace that. and decided to get another shaver, so when this one wears out, as I thought it was reasonably priced.  He gets a close shave with it, almost as close as with a safety razor, so he is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked okay for about a month.  It was never able to get the hair right beneath my nose or under my chin or on my neck, but it did alright on the mustache and around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, after about two months it barely cuts at all.  It gets caught on hair and painfully rips it out.  It glides right over the hairs on my neck like they&#x27;re not even there, leaving them fully intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up tripper is also quite dull.  It will just bounce right off of my side burns as if there&#x27;s no blade at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my dome nice and bald. I works great as a daily shaver. Keep up on it though because it will not cut any hair that is longer than 1/32 of an inch. I can run this right up to my beard without messing up the trim lines. Though it doesn&#x27;t say in the product description, it does come with the super close foil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband.  He has been using it for about a month and he really likes it. It provides a close shave without irritation.  He has found that he must use it everyday though. If he skips a day, the shaver will not give him a clean shave and he has to use another one as well. Since this shaver, he has very few ingrown hairs.  Shipping was quick.  We are happy with the purchase and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my boyfriend who is african american.  He has used magic shave for as long as I&#x27;ve known him.  He finally decided to shave his head so he started going to the barber shop.  The barber used this shaver on his face and head and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or bumps.  He&#x27;s on the road 3 weeks a month so I decided to get him his own.  He uses it to shave his face mostly.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Wahl 8061 shaver in October of 2011 and within two months it ceased to charge. I believe others have had similar issues. It will still run while plugged in, but will not take a charge. I contacted Wahl customer service and they indicated that the average turn around is three weeks. That would be three weeks without a shaver and I realize it only cost $50, but I truly expected higher quality and did not expect to need repair this early after purchase. While a two year warranty on the product, which I was told by customer service is made in the U.S.A. weighed favorably toward the purchase, I find that the product seems cheaply made. Thin plastic and a little loose around the switch and plug port. On the positive side, it does shave very well for my type of beard and from a shaving perspective I am pleased. Unfortunately this product does not shine with quality as older Wahl products have. So my options are to be without a shaver for two or three weeks and pay for shipping or the same and purchase a cheap shaver to use in the interim. Or find another product from another company with hopes that someone still makes a quality shaver that will last for more than two months.</li>
            <li> worked immediately and it  is made in usa. very pleased with performance. the shaving experience is so much superior to my last panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> I received my product in about 4 dayz everthing went very well and they work GREAT!!! I will definitely be purchasing more item...</li>
            <li> Works really well but it is loud.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this based on all the positive reviews but he had to call his barber to figure out how to use it. What the directions don&#x27;t specify is that this is a FINISHING shaver. It does NOT cut anything longer than stubble. If you are purchasing to shave your head, you will need to use clippers first and then this shaver to get it smooth. If you are purchasing it to use on your face, you would need to plan on using it everyday so that your beard growth doesn&#x27;t get too long or it won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> A little rough on the face. Noisy as all hell :-)</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I have owned. It is very convenient to use because shave cream is not needed. The shaver also provides a close shave and so far for me no ingrown hairs. It is also easy to clean because the head comes off, and water can be used to clean the foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a replacement for the discontinued Remington ES-1000 Bump Control Shaver.  This product is vastly inferior.  It is critical that every black man struggling with razor bumps understand that FOIL ELECTRIC RAZORS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ALLEVIATE RAZOR BUMPS IN BLACK MEN.  I&#x27;m shocked that Wahl has tried to capitalize on its hair clipper popularity by putting out this very loud, ineffective foil shaver.  It may shave close, but will not prevent the razor from cutting beneath the skin, causing the bumps.  What a sham! Shame on Wahl! Avoid this product.  Remington had it right.</li>
            <li> the best shaver in the world , nice close shave easy to clean &amp; store. recharges fast &amp; last a long time</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  Much closer shave than the rotary blade shavers.</li>
            <li> Performance is excellent but durability is the worst of all barber and hair stylist products I ever used. I went through 4 in one year before refusing to purchase it anymore. Some of my customers really liked and looked forward to me using that but they had to either get over over it or find another barber. For $60, it&#x27;s a piece of crap</li>
            <li> Does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Burns my skin&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair on face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick to shaving with a razor which takes less time.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this shaver. It is a good finisher. You must shave first. This is designed to clean up the stubble left after shaving.</li>
            <li> The best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> its not bad and a decent value for the price/does not have a trimer and gives a reasonable shave/i would try an other wahl type.</li>
            <li> The mesh (gold grill) got torn with my second shave. Very poor quality. East of my hard earned money!</li>
            <li> Could do a better job shaving, but not bad!</li>
            <li> I been using the shaver about a month, no more problem with bumps. I recommend this product works just fine.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is made of cheap plastic, the foil piece on top split in half from me just turning it on for it the first time. It may not be foil, aluminum foil is actually thicker and stronger than whatever that is made from.  I&#x27;m Glad I noticed or I would have hacked someone skin up like a 1980&#x27;s horror movie. I will not buy a replacement head either. I will never trust this product. If it had decided to break while I was using it instead of when I turned it on, it would have been a trip to the hospital.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I bought it used.  It was in mint condition as stated.  It gives a very close shave.  I&#x27;m not able to use it everyday because after several days it can irritate but every 2-3 days has not been a problem.  Overall this is a good product.  I would give it a 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> WOW, THEY FINALLY CAME OUT WITH A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR USERS THAT DON&#x27;T WANNA USE RAZOR BLADES. FRIST TIME USERS DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PRESS SO HARD WHILE SHAVING WITH THE 5 STAR SHAVER SHAPERS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GLADE IT BACK AND FROTH AGAINST THE    FACE AND YOU&#x27;LL GET THE SMOOTH SHAVE. IF YOU GET RAZER BUMPS FROM THIS SHAVER SHAPERS, THATS BECAUSE YOU WAS DOING SOMETHING SOULD NOT BE DOING LIKE, #1 PRESSING TO HARD THINKING YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO GET THE CLOSEST SHAVE EVER AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST GLADE IT A CROSS THE SKIN IN A MOTION,LIKE BACK AND FORTH, UP AND DOWN AND SO ON.SO IF YOU DON&#x27;T WANNA USE A RAZOR BLADE, THSES 5 STAR SHAVERS IS THE BEST THING TO USE.</li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews for this shaver I expected it to be something amazing people commented on how well it removed hair and gave you a  close shave. I have yet to see it do that. This shaver is good for everything but your face. It can be used on the head after haircuts to remove little hairs and things such as that but it does a rather poor job shaving the face. If your looking for a \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; shaver keep looking.</li>
            <li> This unit was a surprise find.  My barber shop used it on my head and face once, finishing up on my zero-one-zero haircut.&lt;br /&gt;two passes and it was like they had used a razor.  It&#x27;s LOUD.  It looks like it belongs in a barber shop.  It sounds like it belongs in a barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;Before I realized they were using it they were done.  I had to see it.&lt;br /&gt;The loudness accompanies what appears to be a substantially powerful shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have one.  This thing just powers through facial hair.  It&#x27;s far more powerful than the other two units I&#x27;ve owned, a Remington Microscreen (10 years) and my norelco (10 years) both of which cost over $100 and were of decent quality and service life.  For the price I expect little.  Compare the cost of my disposable razors to this, it will pay for itself in 2 months.  Probably save me 30 minutes or more over that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a pasty white guy I can&#x27;t speak to razor bumps, but this thing has not left me with a rash of ingrowns or irritated skin like the older electrics occasionally did.  Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From other reviews I understand that the battery may not last too long, surprising except that this unit is under $40 AND it&#x27;s US made/assembled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far- it&#x27;s damn good!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the performance of this shaver. It was a gift to my son. My son was extremely pleased. It shaved just as it said it would. Fast shipping. Would buy from this company again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl Shavers for many years and never had a problem. My old one I had for over 10 years and the battery was getting wearing out so I got this one and it&#x27;s great. I overlooked one detail before ordering.... IT DOES&#x27;NT HAVE A POPUP TRIMER like my old one. I should have checked further.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap replacement for the fine quality product we used to get from Germany. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Best darn electric razor I have ever owned!!!</li>
            <li> Foil is no good after one month use</li>
            <li> 1. Very easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;2. Very easy to maintain!&lt;br /&gt;3. Very light and portable!&lt;br /&gt;4. Gets a close shave everytime!</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave, but it looks, feels and sounds like a cheap device.  It does the job it is designed to do very well.</li>
            <li> My son loves it. He tends to grow a beard a lot because he would get a rash from shaving. Now he shaves all the time keeps it in his car .</li>
            <li> Very helpful product, but be careful - do not use it for a long beard, in this case you won&#x27;t be satisfied</li>
            <li> I give it 5 star.people should invest in this product</li>
            <li> Nice close shave with no bumps. Wish it had a trimmer for longer hairs though.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  My barber told me about this product and I decided to purchase it.  It does a very good job of getting that close shave without a lot of bumps.  I say not a lot of bumps because during the second week of use I got a few bumps under my chin and right by the jaw line, hence the 4 star rating.  I like the closeness of the shaves.  My wife can now stroke my face without being scratched by my beard.  I recommend this product for guys of color like myself.</li>
            <li> My Husband really likes it. It leaves him with a clean smooth Shave. No stubble! :)</li>
            <li> Brutha&#x27;s.. it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave like I thought it would. Can&#x27;t get it to cut the deeper hairs, the ones run flat against my skin and eventually curl back under to create the bumps. This is even after I run the shaver multiple directions. Still have to finish with my Andis line trimmer to get a closer shave. But one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is less bumps, so it seems to be working for that. Another thing that&#x27;s helping is Kiehl&#x27;s Ultimate Man Razor Bump Relief. It costs a grip but I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for two months, use a little morning and night and it last a while. good luck</li>
            <li> Hey I have to say after reading some of the reviews I was looking forward to getting this and getting off the razor blades I was using now that I&#x27;m keeping a shaved head too.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the review from the guy going to barber school using it day in and day out, I was sold! But once I got it, not so much. First couple of use were great but after that&lt;br /&gt;it has become harder and harder to get a smooth finish. I find it hard to believe that I have to purchase another blade head this soon! I&#x27;m to the point that I still have to go back to&lt;br /&gt;my razor to get close and smooth. This would not be the one I talk up, sorry!</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best you can get for every day use as a barber ... leaves skin smooth ... only drawback would be the foil needs to be replaced every few months due to heavy use ... highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This product is great, gets a really close shave and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> This shaver was not what I expected it to be. The shaver was extremely noisy, and more importantly, it did not cut my facial hair anywhere near as close as my older shaver.</li>
            <li> I love my bald fader. I received it in the mail very quick and they work great. I would order them again any day.</li>
            <li> This shaver really works well for any man who suffers from Shaving bumps. I have used this shaver for 2 months and I don&#x27;t have any shaving bumps! It&#x27;s Great!</li>
            <li> Works great! Best close shave ever!</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! It cuts really close. Wireless or wired, your choice. Holds a charge for the longest time.</li>
            <li> the foil is breaking out after few months...i have to order another one.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my barber and folks it works!, its better then using a razor and constantly hurting your skin, its fast and efficient for those who have to be clean shaved for their jobs EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> After years of skin irritation was a little skeptical that this would work.So far no bumps. The shaver is not razor smooth yet gives a close shaved look.Goodbye beard!!!</li>
            <li> As a black man, I have been in search of a great shave since puberty. I am a big optimist....meaning, I havent given up on this shaver yet.  However, I went from using a wahl T-Outliner to shave with(with no bumps) to this, hoping to get a close shave.  I \\&quot;have\\&quot; bumps now and am not sure why.  granted my skin is smooth....meaning no stubble, however I now have bumps....go figure.  The manual that comes with the shaver states that you may have to give it time for your skin to get accustomed to it......so I&#x27;m gonna give it a week or 2 and see what happens. Glad i didnt throw away my old shaver yet.  OHHHH, the trimer on the back IS the best thing about the shaver so far....gives sharp lines.</li>
            <li> not usually a fan of electric shavers.  I tried this one a year ago and loved it.  Great for touch ups or for general shaving.  Close shave, comfortable.  I am on my second shaver however since the first one stopped working because the on/off switch broke.  But the product was so good I had to have another one.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well but is fairly noisy as compared to my old Norelco, which recently fell apart on me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver because I am deployed to Iraq and I lost my previously used electric shaver(the great Remington ES-1000 Bump Control Shaver, I do not know why they discontinued this model). I was hoping that after looking over the reviews it would be a good replacement, but it caused more bumps to appear on my face! I tried to wait 2 weeks for my face to get used to it, but it failed to cut enough hair to keep me within military standards on a daily basis. Finally, this model does not have the pop up trimmer as advertised. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor.  shaves almost as close as a blade without nicks or cuts.  Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I gotten too laser achievements by the time I got this product For my and beard area So I don&#x27;t know if it was this but I&#x27;ve completely razor bump free I am an african American male and the military</li>
            <li> Works great does not burn at all what&#x27;s so ever</li>
            <li> first time user of electric shavers.    ive been using this everyday now for almost a week now.  first few days had MINOR irritation but with lighting my pressure and pre-shave powder sticks its been perfect ever since.    shaves super close and quick. takes me about 5 minutes if that to shave my face and neck (i have a full shaped beard tho)    cleans everything right up close and quick with very light pressure. what i really love about it is that i can shave right up to AND into my beard lines without shaving any of my beard at all (the holes on the foil are designed to shave very short hairs/stubble without cutting longer hairs) which allows me to get a clean daily shave right up to my beard lines.    ONLY downside of foil shavers (i assume all of them with the smaller holes)  if you do happen to go a few days or miss a strand of hair here and there due to being in a rush youll hair to cut those hairs down a bit with something else before the shaver will catch them    i suggest a nice clean razor blade shave the first day to get everything flat and even...then from there on use the electric shaver daily.    they suggest 1-3 weeks for your skin to adjust to electric but with the help of a pre shave powder stick and daily use my skin is already used to it in less than a week.    no bumps, no reddening (unless i press hard), no irritation anymore</li>
            <li> When I looked at this razer it said it was a bumpless save. I didn&#x27;t know why it would say that. I ordered it and when I received it I then realized it was for a black man because of the pictures on the package.  Then the bump free made sense to me.  I used it anyway and I am so happy with it. It gives a very close save. Thank you.  Jerry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber and after trying many electric shavers its obvious that you don&#x27;t have to spend tons of money to get the best product.  This shaver gets closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used and has more power. very pleased</li>
            <li> Great product and would buy again if needed.This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad, my son had to keep rubbing it on one area of his face and still with all of that it didn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  We tried following all manufacturers directions from the start, either we received a defective product; or it simply didn&#x27;t work properly.  It was returned promptly.</li>
            <li> When purchasing an item, it is expected that I would receive an item in brand new conditon. I received the product within the estimated delivery time. However, when i opened the item the gold foil that covers the blades was ripped, which is obviously not usable. Also, there was a crack in the bottom of the item.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works like a charm.  This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again .</li>
            <li> Does a good job.  You have to work a little but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> This shaver works wonders. Even if they say that you can press lightly to get a good shave, I did press down on the skin with it. I got tired of using a straight razor so I bought this instead. It works great with sensitive skin too. You also should stretch your skin taut if you really want that close shave. It&#x27;s great that Wahl continues to make good barbering products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he shaves his head every couple days and I thought this machine would make things easier with a razor like finish. However, it takes longer to remove his hair with this machine because hair gets caught on the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; and it needs to constantly be removed. We thought that by buying this machine he would be able to get rid of his razors, but he still needs them because the machine won&#x27;t give him a nice finish, making it more of a hassle. He has now invested in a safety razor kit and he loves that.</li>
            <li> I purchased these shaver/shapers based on my barbers recommendation. The hair on my face is curly, and course. If I didn&#x27;t use this device every day, or so, the hair would curl and prove too unruly for the device to catch them. (I think the device is better suited for straight hair.) Moreover, I think it goes back to the adage: there is no shortcut when it comes to a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with the honor of having ingrown hairs as a black man. I&#x27;ve been fighting a never ending battle with shaving, plucking (no bueno), clippers. Wahl is a miracle! Gentlemen, follow the instructions per Wahl and YouTube videos. You will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8061 5-Star Series Deluxe is a great shaver for Black men.  It shaves close and comfortable with no razor bumps.  A great shaver!</li>
            <li> This is the best professional shaver you can buy.  I have one that I use for my face and my wife has one that she uses for her legs.  It gets the skin silky smooth without leaving bumps or a rash.  The replacement foil&#x27;s and blades are very inexpensive on Amazon.  I would definitely recommend this shaver to both men and women. A++</li>
            <li> This just did not work for me! I purchased this only after reading almost all the reviews and I decided to give s shot. I followed the instructions to the teeth and I continue to get bumps. I tried it for two months after my face and neck area got real horrible from all the bumps, my wife had to step in and force me to stop trying to make it work. I reverted back to my old style-- using blades and my face is back to normal!</li>
            <li> This product seems to do everything it says it does. Do not expect an electric shaver to do the same  job as a regular razor because it does not but this items comes pretty close. So far it is better   than any other electric razor I have used but like it says on the directions give it a few weeks.  Your beard has to get use to it. I also am not heavy bearded and my hair is light to gray.</li>
            <li> Very good electric shaver . Closest and best shave I&#x27;ve ever had .</li>
            <li> My barber first introduced this item to me so my expectations were over the top! Imagine the impact when the same item receive did not meet the standard!    Confused about the product I took it to my barber to ensure I purchase the right item. He too was amazed how the seller passed this items off as new when the blades had run its course and badly worn! There were finger-prints on the inside of what suppose to be a sealed package. Immediately, I sent the item back to the seller who has yet to refund the amount paid for a new product!    I&#x27;m walking away a very disappointed customer.....blah blah blah!</li>
            <li> This thing is so awesome. Recommended to me by my barber as it is the same one he uses.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver, overall.  But, not having had an electric shaver for years, I forgot they don&#x27;t give you as close a shave as a good hand razor.  Still, it serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> Works well so far. If you have thick, coarse facial hair like myself, it takes a few runs to achieve a close shave, but it definitely gets closer than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> BEST TOOL EVER!!!!!!!bGood for bald fades too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product. I must say it doesn&#x27;t cut clean as I thought.</li>
            <li> All it did was pull the hair on my chin and leave razor burn and ingrown hair. A complete waste of money and it disappoints as a gift.</li>
            <li> The aluminum was damaged quickly from the pressure applied, but it STILL works fine!</li>
            <li> Smoooooooooth dry shave with no bumps and no irritation. Amazing! Follow the instructions carefully! No short cuts!</li>
            <li> This shave is a great finisher. Start on your face with a pair of Andis Outliners and finish to complete smoothness with the Wahl 8061. Great because it can be used cordless or with cord.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. My first shaver died on me after about 2 years. I purchased that one for about $20 more in a retail beauty store. I was able to save money and the shipping was fast. The razor was in its original package, charged and ready to go. I have very sensitive skin and a bid type razor really irritates my skin. This allows me to get a very close shave almost everyday (if i shave everyday) without skin irritation. I also use a bump stopper cream  after i use the razor. I am very pleased with my buy and if about 2-3 years when this one needs to be replace, I will likely come back here to get another one.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave at all.  I am an African American &amp; I havea very stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos most of my life. But I like this razor better. Seems to cut much closer and blades / screen have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first buyer remorse I have in my experiences with Ebay. I&#x27;m planning to return this item..  it&#x27;s supposed to shave my hair but I hardly see any hair come out when I shave even though I follow the instruction.  It&#x27;s also a little funny that the instruction says to give it a couple of weeks for my body to get used to the shaver.  I&#x27;ve waited two weeks and instead of using this item, I&#x27;ve reverted to Magic Power.  Again, I notice the coil get crakced somewhat. To be fair, it&#x27;s possibel there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing right, but this has been a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 52 years. I have tried a lot of shavers and used the blades at times.  With out any doubt the Wahl is a true 5 star shaver.  After using it for 30 days I&#x27;ll say it compares to the close shave of a blade without any irration.  If you need to shave everyday than you need a Wahl.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, but only when facial hair is short. If I wait several days between shaves, the shaver will not cut well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase because now I don&#x27;t have to shave every day as before, as you might know, shaving everyday can be pretty expensive and this shaver saves that money because it provides a nice clean shave all you do is charge your machine.</li>
            <li> I am a black man that bumps very easily and as a result do not shave more often than once every other day.  I have been searching for a smooth, close, NO BUMP, shaver for a long time.  \\&quot;I CAN NOT use a razor!\\&quot;.  My friend Wayne told me about Wahl shavers for black men a long time ago but I didn&#x27;t act on his word, \\&quot;long story short\\&quot; one of the guys in the office recently mentioned them to me again and I took the plunge.  I just got them today (September 15, 2011) and shaved with them about an hour ago, it was the smoothest and closest shave I have had with a shaver ever.  The true test will be the results of my face after 2 days to see if I in fact DO NOT bump.  So far I am very well pleased and would highly recommend for others with sensitive skin.  B Blessed.</li>
            <li> The Wahl shaver is an excellent shaver. It is rechargable but can be used with the plug as well. This foil shaver shaves VERY close. I would say as close as what a half day after shaving with a regular razor. The unit has great power and you can hear when it is shaving stubble, so you know when your done as it gets quite, without using a mirror. The foil design does not nick the skin or pull your beard hair. You can also shave right up to your beard, mustache, sideburn lines as longer hairs wont be cut hardly much at all. This shaver outdoes the rotary shavers hands down, and you dont have to keep going over and over your face with it. For $50+ you are getting what I think is worth $100+ for this type of shaver! Good luck and enjoy!</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is a shaver for guys who want a great shave without a lot of questionable add-ons and doo-dads that contribute nothing except extra cost.  It is light, all plastic (what isn&#x27;t these days?) and feels \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; . . . until you turn it on. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of shavers (Ronson, Braun, Panasonic, Remington, Grundig), but this is the first one so powerful as to actually feel \\&quot;torque-y\\&quot; in my hand.   Clearly, how it looks is less important to Wahl than how it works. And work it does--clearing up four days&#x27; stubble in less than five minutes, and leaving my face as smooth as a blade shave. (This is with the standard \\&quot;Close\\&quot; foil. \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;Super Close\\&quot; foils are available separately--and inexpensively--from Amazon.)  This is the most commonsense shaver I have ever owned. Inexpensive to buy. Powerful, efficient and effective. Its consumables (cutters, foil) cost way less than anyone else&#x27;s. And its case is relatively easy to open (or so I&#x27;ve read) to allow you to change batteries yourself.  My only suggestion to Wahl would be to make the batteries truly user-replaceable the way they are in cordless phones. Since shaver batteries die long before shavers do, that would be quite a selling point. JMHO</li>
            <li> Having been a dedicated electric shaving person for the past 20 years or so (save for a brief foray into old fashioned flat blade razors for a month or so), I&#x27;ve had all of the major shavers in the past.  The last one I used prior to buying this one -- a Braun with a cleaning fluid/charging station -- seemed very good for awhile, but eventually it started with the neck irritation and the process of shaving was taking longer and longer each day.  After reading some other good reviews here I decided to give this Wahl Super Close shaver a try.  Yes, it&#x27;s noisy.  Yes, it vibrates a lot.  DEAL WITH IT.  The shaver is phenomenal!  Just do as it says -- use a VERY light touch (which keeps your face from getting irritated) and you will be stunned at how closely it shaves you.  I have tried it dry, with a liquid pre-shave called Kyoku (GREAT stuff, by the way, albeit expensive), and with Remington&#x27;s dry wax pre-shave sticks.  It works well with all of them (a tad better than dry with a good pre-shave). You can tell it&#x27;s working even without looking in a mirror simply by listening.  There&#x27;s a distinctive sound it makes when it is cutting hair and a much quieter sound when it encounters an already smooth surface.   At the time I bought it I also bought an extra set of cutters and screens.  I just hope parts are still available as it&#x27;s no longer listed in Wahl&#x27;s website.  They did write me and tell me parts are not a problem.  They also said the shaver is still available, too, though they sell more often to barber shops with this product than to end users.  Frankly, I&#x27;ve seen trimmers in barber shops but never an electric razor, but with as little hair as I have, what do I know?  :)  For less than $50, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Gets close to the skin but has trouble with facial hair longer than stubble. It was a gift for my dad and he likes it but because it has no teeth or grip for longer facial he wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for men with longer faical hair.</li>
            <li> Broke the second week of using it.I would never recommend this to anyone else. The wores thing that I ever order for a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this Electric Razor Purely off the reviews that others have posted, and man am I not Sorry, this shaver Performs and it can all be heard in the \\&quot;Buzz\\&quot; as soon as you turn it on. I have tried many other electric shavers and I pretty much got \\&quot;Burnt\\&quot; by them all either being Poorly made, or leaving my face sore and full of Ingrowns, but that&#x27;s not the case w/ this shaver it leaves the skin feeling smooth and the bonus no irritation or soreness after shaving!!! It does not get all the hairs, especially if you have Patches that usually grow longer than others, but if you start w/ a clean shave, and use the shaver daily \\&quot;No problems\\&quot;. Big ups to Wahl for putting this product out, not usually a fan of Wahl but this one takes the Cake.. Great Solid Product, hopefully it stands the test of time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 04/12:&lt;br /&gt;This Shaver is still going Strong, I think I&#x27;m more dependent on it now than before. I&#x27;ve since took the whole \\&quot;Clean Shave\\&quot; prior to, out of the Equation. Now, I shave down every 3-4 days w/ the [[ASIN:B000KEOODU Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer]], and use the Shaver/Shaper inbetween and I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but excellent results... I still Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product does not do a good job shaving it is easier and quicker to use a razor</li>
            <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> Very close shave; would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This it my second one and it works great. I receive a smooth pain free shave every time I use this product.  FYI. I dropped my first one.</li>
            <li> Gets the job down. Smooth and Bump free.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Bought this for my husband on the recommendation of his barber.  Trims close enough to the skin that he doesn&#x27;t feel the need to steal my razor to get even closer.  Easy to use and maintain.  Dry shaver only, cannot use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son.</li>
            <li> Son loved his Christmas gift, shaved his face as smooth as the day he was born!  Now, my other son wants the razor, his birthday is coming up so I will be purchasing another!</li>
            <li> best electric razor I ever had</li>
            <li> My barber uses these to give me a shave after he does my hair, I grow a very thick and coarse beard and razors just take too long as I&#x27;m constantly clogging the blades, 30 seconds with this thing and he&#x27;s got my clean shaven, liked it so much I went ahead and bought one.</li>
            <li> Awesome buzzer for either shaving or fade haircuts which I use it for. Was surprised how close of a shave it actually gives</li>
            <li> Very good quality much better then other shavers used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and an awesome value. Strong motor and efficient. It is louder than the rotary style norelco I had previously. It also can be run on the cord if need be which I like.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this same exact shaver when he gives me a haircut. The battery last long without recharging and it gives you a close shave to remove stubble.</li>
            <li> Why pay over-priced service when you can replace your own blades. Can of compressed air for cleaning and you are good for another year or so.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me the closest shave of any electric razor I have ever had.  I have used Wahl razors before but I had trouble with the screen coming loose from the housing.  I am going to replace the cutters every 6 months  and hope I do not have any problems.</li>
            <li> This caused numerous bumps on my husband.  It is not bump free. I would not buy it again  and want to return it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price. Love it!!! It is highly recommended. I&#x27;m a professional barber &amp; i use these frequently. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> As I said in the review of the replacement foil and cutter bar, the razor does a wonderful job of cutting close without producing razor burn.  Just don&#x27;t expect it to do the same with a grown-out beard of curly hair...</li>
            <li> Item came as advertised</li>
            <li> When used in tandem with the great classic Andis T-Outliner you&#x27;ll be the smoothest guy at the party!</li>
            <li> Loved this electric razor so much I bought one for my Father who loves it as well. Very close shave!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I have always had issues with shaving bumps being a black man. I have been using clippers for years even though they didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as I would like, it was neat enough for a professional appearance. I still use the clippers first to cut down any growth, but then I use the Wahl shaver to get close. I also use them to shave my head after I noticed my barber using them to finish me up. 5 stars all the way!!</li>
            <li> If I go without shaving for a couple days on the weekend this shaver really pulls and impossible to get anything but stubble without using my trimmer and shaving again. Should&#x27;ve spent the money for a Braun.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American male and I have had problems with ingrown hairs while shaving with other electric shavers, razors, and magic shave. Although noisy, this electric shaver provides a close shave with little irritation and only a few evident ingrown hairs. I highly recommend this electric shaver to anyone who has problem with ingrown hairs and wants a clean, close shave. I just received this shaver so only time will indicate the durability of the product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed. Baby bottom effect, soft and smooth face after shaving. I recommend these shavers to everyone, they are truly five star shavers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blk male and my Norelco does a better job at shaving short hairs. This product does a poor job at giving you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and so far so good.  He used it for the first time and while it didn&#x27;t give him the super close shave on his head, it did the job and didn&#x27;t leave razor bumps.  That is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This shaving machine is exactly what I wanted. It shaves very close and I charge the machine once a week. I have used different shaving machines. This is the very best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> As far as electric razors go it&#x27;s hard to beat the performance of this one. About as good as it gets!</li>
            <li> i have tried many electric razors before. many of them seemed to yank out the hair moreso than cut it. this one works great!!! it has a smooth cut and its very close. i also saved 12 dollars buying it online thru amazon. my barber used it on my face and i was immediately hooked. whats also great is i did&#x27;nt get any bumps after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best electric shaver I have used. Easy to charge. Holds a charge for a long time. Would recommend without reservations</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Deluxe Rechargeable Shaver Shaper&lt;br /&gt;  After several uses of this product I was not happy with my results. Did not get the close shave I was looking for. Hopeing to get similar results, as I uses to from my Remington shaver design for black man&#x27;s. Also sorry to say Remington does&#x27;nt make this shaver anymore. I&#x27;m not very happy with Remington on that note too.  Just not happy with this Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> After just 3 uses the foil split in two.  I thought this shaver would do the job and the price was not as bad as some local beauty stores. It does NOT give a close shave either. Have to say this was a waste.  With I had a zero star option</li>
            <li> love it, works so good</li>
            <li> OK, so it is not pretty, does not have a sideburn trimmer but I tell you it is the closest shave I have ever had.  I love this razor and I have the Braun which I thought was a close shave but this is far superior.  Love it! I would add a sideburn trimmer and we are good to go!</li>
            <li> shaves very close, the closest I&#x27;ve seen, not good with long hairs, razor bumps are a problem</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not irritate your skin. Love it</li>
            <li> charge holds over a week without losing power, i use this daily in barbershop i  love this tool very reliable</li>
            <li> As an African-American man, I am prone to razor bumps. I bought this shaver to give me a nice close shave. The shaver did not accomplish this . I get a closer shave with my Andis T- outliner trimmer. I also got a small amount of razor bumps but I believe I was pressing too hard on my face.The shaver seemed nice but it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves how close it shaves his head.  He has used another Wahl product for years but this product outshines the old one for him.</li>
            <li> I gave up using electric shavers over 15 years ago because they were unable to give a close shave, and gave me terrible bumps and irritation. This unit is incredible. Almost as close as a razor (no visible stubble, but you can feel just the tiniest bit) and ZERO bumps or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The up side is that, because it is not irritating, I can shave with it every day. The downside of this is, I need to shave every day now. I can skip a day here and there, but this shaver is designed to only cut hairs that are a certain length. If the hairs grow out too long, the foil will not pick them up. If your stubble grows in slowly this is not an issue. As mine grows in quickly, I cannot skip two days in a row. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I shave my head, and this unit works perfectly for that as well. Gets nice and close in about half the time of a blade shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is performing as expected. It  has given me close shaves, it looks durable and is manufactured in the USA. I wish the color of it is black, which is not very important otherwise its a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Professional?  Not likely.  Poor quality, noisy, and after a months use it no longer takes a charge.  I missed the 30 day return window so in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> Saw my barber use it and bought right away. Great for neck trim below beard and cheek touch-ups w/o using razor ,etc. Very handy.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with sensitive skin since I began shaving over 42 years ago. I have spent far too much on a certain \\&quot;rotary\\&quot; brand razor&#x27;s latest models claiming the closest and gentlest shave only to still have 5-6 ingrown hairs per month not to mentions still nicking my skin and bleeding as if I had used a blade. My \\&quot;barber\\&quot; had suggested this when my once a decade attempt at maintaining facial hair was at its inception during my most recent trim. He promised that I could shave right up to the beard margin without altering it as it would only cut the 1-2 day stubble and not the longer beard hairs. I am thoroughly pleased, not only was he correct, I have not had a single bump in over 2 mos! Go Wahl!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hated to use a razor everyday, is worth every penny. Go ahead and feel free to buy it. You will love it too.</li>
            <li> The razor itself worked well.  It wasn&#x27;t the best choice for our needs.  We need a trimmer as well.  It is a good value though.</li>
            <li> i liked it my husband used it on our son and it look good. grate shipping fast. would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Definitely the closest electric razor I have ever used, and I have tried a lot of them: from remington to phillips to even traditional gillette razors. None come close.&lt;br /&gt; I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30+ years, and the Wahl 5-Star gives me a better shave than any other I&#x27;ve found, including $200+ premium shavers.  I&#x27;m a 50+ yr old white guy with sensitive skin, so I approached this purchase with skepticism. Based on the many positive reviews, and the affordable price, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, loud, and can be harsh if you use it wrong.  But if you go slowly and do not press hard -- let the razor do the work -- you will get a remarkably close shave. I get best results by washing my face before and after shaving, and I don&#x27;t use this razor on more than a day&#x27;s beard growth, as it is designed to shave stubble, not hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the rechargeable battery in this unit is excellent.  I fully charged (24+ hrs) the razor when it arrived, and had a dozen long shaves with it before it needed recharging.  Be sure to let the battery fully discharge before recharging, to prolong battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> great product for the price, close shave and the item arrived pretty fast. You have to shave down the beard to a low level before you use it, and then use the shaver to just make it super close.</li>
            <li> Great Razor..... I love it.</li>
            <li> I will be returning the item. It bumps the face. I does not meet our expectations. We will continue to use what we have. extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> It worked great the first 2 times I used it. The third time, it broke. I&#x27;m going to send it back and see if I can get a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! This is definitely on the professional level and works so much better than any other 1 I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it had the trimmer</li>
            <li> Meets my husbands needs for getting rid a short growth on his beard and head</li>
            <li> Does not provide close shave. No bumps, but not all facial hair is picked up by shaver</li>
            <li> This shaver blows. I still had to shave my neck with a razor and it broke after only 3 uses.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered did not include a pop-up trimmer I contacted customer service at DiscountJungle and all they were worried about was the low feedback rating I attached to their site. In addition they agreed to ship me another shaver instead they decided to issue me a credit in the amount of 33.95 however I paid 49.92 for the item. The shaver itself is a nice product I have one from another supplier but DiscountJungle customer service is horrible.This was a Christmas present for a friend now I must shop somewhere else!</li>
            <li> After a couple of shaving, the result has been unsatisfactory. Not a smooth result at all. Equipment more noisy than I expected.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my 18 year old son. African American men sometimes have problems with ingrown hair. This is a must have tool, because it makes his skin so soft. Not only that, but no bumps at all. I will buy this as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most convenient shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used. The shave feels as close as a razor! It&#x27;s better than a razor because you don&#x27;t need shaving cream. Attention: It only cuts very short hair so you have to use any separate trimmer to get the hair short. This may seem like an annoying extra step but if you use it everyday it&#x27;s a step that you&#x27;ll only have to do once. I would keep it in the car and shave during my commute. I bought it once and lost it during a move so I&#x27;m buying another because I know it&#x27;s going to give me a hassle-free smooth shave without razor bumps. As a 35 year old black man I never thought I could achieve such a smooth shave with an electric razor. I&#x27;ve tried the $100 ones that they show on TV where you get a couple of days of smooth skin and then a razor bumb nightmare. Who ever created this product is a genius.</li>
            <li> I cut hair for family and friends. I cut my own hair as well. When I use it on family &amp; friends, they all rave about how much they like it, and how close it gets. However, when I use it on myself, I can&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like and it even misses hairs. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong. Still nice for a barber though.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these and it works great. cant get a closer shave with a blade. awesome shaver</li>
            <li> Different from a friends althought the model numbers are the same. Hers works better!</li>
            <li> Use in my barber shop and love it</li>
            <li> well worth the money...have been using for years....havn&#x27;t had a closer shave with any other electric...a must buy</li>
            <li> Good price great product</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. I have only shaved with it twice, but it was the best shave i have ever had. The only shave i had close to this was with the older phillips with the goo. This actually works best on thicker hair, but also gets the thinner hair. After first 2 shaves, no red marks like most other shavers. If you get bumps from shaving or have sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I have owned my wahl 8061 for a little over 3 months now and can say without a doubt the best electric shaver on the market. I was skeptical of electric shavers coming from shaving with a straight razor but needed something i could use right before work or when i did not have the time to use my straight razor. This razor is super powerful and gets a very close smooth shave. I will say that since i have purchased this shaver i have used my straight razor maybe 3 times. Thats saying alot. The only problem is the shaver does not cut hair thats more than a stubble. Its not a problem if you have a nice \\&quot;shape up\\&quot; trimmer tho. All in all this thing is amazing for the price and will blow those norelco shavers 5x the price away. take my word buy it you will not regret!!!!</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a different shaver. It does not give a close shave and after I attempted several times to use it to keep my beard from growing it gave me razor bumps.  I would not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to get a Wahl hypoallergenic shaver for a long time.  Finally I have one.  I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers, Norelco, Remington, a couple of Brauns....and now this Wahl.  I found immediately that you must NOT push hard on this shaver like you do with most of the other ones.  I pushed a little too hard the first time I used it, and got a little bit of a rash.  The next time....I took it easy, just as the instructions suggested, and let the shaver do all the work.  What a difference....a smooth shave, almost as good as a regular manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m very impressed with this electric shaver.  It is powerful, and gives a great shave. I have only one complaint...no pop up trimmer.  I can live without it, but it would be nice to have for sideburns.  Other than that, this is a great shaver which is easy on your sensitive skin.  I&#x27;d buy another one in a flash, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin like myself.  Buy one. I guarantee you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;  As an update to my review, I&#x27;ve had this razor for 3 years and the battery failed to hold a charge.  The instructions stated that replacing the battery was simple, so I ordered one online.  It was simple to open the shaver, but the 4 connections to the battery required snipping and re-soldering.  Fortunately I had the proper tools and a little bit of knowledge on how to use a soldering gun.  It took me an hour to snip and re-solder the connections, and now the shaver is charging the way it should.  I would think the original ni-cad battery would last longer than 3 years, but it might be good for others to know that replacing this battery is NOT a user friendly task. I&#x27;m sure that if a professional shop did the replacement, it would cost half the original price of the shaver to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;  Other than that, this is the only razor that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to try and fix it.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and after using a liner there is usually stubble left on the head. This cuts so close that it gets super close and you don&#x27;t see the stubble after using the shaver shaper. It&#x27;s easy to open and clean and battery lasts a long time. It can also be used corded or cordless.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first shaver shaper.  The only drawback is the product does not provide the shaper at the back of the shaver; at least the replacement I have does not.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave after using a clipper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver based on the reviews and recommendation for getting a close shave on your head. This was suppose to be one of the best product on the market for that purpose. The shave on my head was horrible. Did not cut close and I even gave it time so my hair would adjust. I am glad I did not use it on my beard. Magic Shaver is the ticket. Been using it over 20 years. Face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. However, don&#x27;t purchase this for a close head shave unless you want to look like the guy from the movie &amp;#34;The Transporter&amp;#34;! He has the &amp;#34;cul de sac &amp;#34; look on his head. No brothers want that look unless you are rich like Billy Gates. Women don&#x27;t care how you look all they see is green. It&#x27;s obvious I am not rich! Beware of this cheap product! Oh, I started using the BIC Soleil on my head and as you can guess as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my barber, but after four uses it just stopped working!  I am going to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> Closest shaver I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my Barber used it so this prompted me to get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the screen went bad in less than a dozen shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it is defective, I pushed to hard or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If no the screen then 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This Shave is great. The battery life is great. I recommend this shaver. Wahl has always been great with hair grooming kits.</li>
            <li> Great device. Neat, effective and efficient</li>
            <li> I could not get a good shave. I tried several times in several ways. So I decided to  returned the item.</li>
            <li> My barber used this on me after I told him I did not want a razor. I tend to break out very easily, and as a black man, that can be devastating for your face. After using this, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using clippers on my face again. A must have for those men that break out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this trimmer which is what prompted me to purchase it. I recommend this product to everyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> The product broke within its first two days of use.</li>
            <li> Im an allergic person so it gives me harsh bumps and rash on my skin. I am allergic to a lot of things though, but I read this used a Hypoallergenic gold film so I decided to give it a try. Well...it gives me allergies anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that this thing has to be used on very short hairs or it wont do anything. You will have to trim down your beard a lot for this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is easy to use (if your beard is not to long), gives a very close shave and the battery lasts a long long time. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend just tapping the top part when cleaning it, dont brush it or you might break it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy at all with this product. You have to shave or trime your hair short enough in order for the to catch hair. I highly recomend the Wahl peanut clippers. I lost mine previouly to getting deployed and thought i would order these. Serves me right for not sticking to what i know.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional 8061 5 Star dry razor should be in every African Americans bathroom medicine cabinet as well as for different nationalities. I&#x27;ve always been scared of using a razor due to acquiring razor bumps. So for a long time I used my hair trimmer clippers to groom my face and mustache. But there was a problem; the trimmers never got close enough leaving  stubble always on my face. One day, my son told me about the Wahl dry razor the barber used on him while in New York. He explained to me that it perfumed well and did an excellent job leaving his face as soft as the skin on your arm or hand. So I ordered and tried it. Guess what, he wasn&#x27;t lying. My face was just as smooth as a newborn baby&#x27;s bottom!!!! The big plus here, I did not have to purchase any expensive shaving creams or nothing. Just your plain soap and warm water will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first close shave, it was a learning lesson. I felt just a tiny tiny tiny bit of peach fuzz on my face. On my nest shave, in order to cut closer, I stretched my face in all directions while using the Wahl until the peach fuzz was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, nothing is 100%. The Wahl dry razor did leave a few stray hairs (3 to 4) which is relatively nothing. Most people would probably not even notice it. But considering it is my face, I did notice. So I just simply used my trimmers to remove those 3 or 4 hairs. Trust me, 3 or 4 hairs beats having razor bumps any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, read your directions if you decide to buy it. You only have to change your blade ($16.65) every six months which is pretty cool becuase your still saving money by not buying other grooming products. For the guys who like the bald look. This could probably work for you too. I hope my review helps you out.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I cant use razor and my skin is very sensitive and this does the trick</li>
            <li> Works great holds a long charge easy to clean and it great on the skin real close without irritating the skin definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. I use it everyday because if you let to much hair grow them it&#x27;s not going to perform up to its potential. I used it for a week so far and no bumps.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth and close.  It is a bit bulky, and the head cover is easy to loose; but a close shave is what&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  He has been looking for a good, smooth shaving, gentle razor for years.  Kudos  to Wahl for a great product.</li>
            <li> shaver works very well, gets a rather close shave almost as close as a razor. bought the razor because i have sensitive skin and get bad razor bumps/burn. was recommended this product, at first it wasnt any better but after using it regularly my skin started to soften and noticed much less irritation.</li>
            <li> Cuts amazingly close BUT not for very long. The foils just don&#x27;t last. I tried on head and wife tried for legs. Is better than razors but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, it works great but the foil is broke already on its 3rd use! I can see this is going to be expensive maintaining this shaver.</li>
            <li> well  It my 5 times using this little machine , I liked it but after 5 time using it I have it broken and I was surprised so I want to know whats happen with.&lt;br /&gt;I wait for an answer please</li>
            <li> This is for the guy who wants the smooth razor cut face but doesn&#x27;t want to use a razor. No razor bumps, rechargeable and easy to clean. Make sure you get some canned air to clean it, brushes are a little too harsh for cleaning,</li>
            <li> it is a very well design shaver, very sharp cut and the battery last a very long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> The closest shave you will ever enjoy. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt !!!! Mine worked so well my wife had to have one. Was intended for afro-americans whose face can get bumps from shaving too close. Not with this brand, Works like magic  !!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of trying this machine based on past experiences with other machines. Also reading from others concerning close shave made be worry about purchasing it. Anyway I made a bold move to buy it but got disappointed the first few days until I came up with a plan having realized what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have said this machine does not give close shave, let me say it will not give you a close shave if you leave your beard to grow a little longer and get curled as some of us black folks face such. If I shave with it everyday, I get a clean 100 cut. If i want to shave after a day or two, i have to use razorless products to get clean cut and then use this machine to keep it clean cut every day and that makes it work and leaves no bump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s a little loud, I recommend this machine to all who want to have a clean smooth cut but make sure you do it right or you will hate it.</li>
            <li> I tried this shaver and it was ok. I got burned the first time and it did not cut as close as i would like it to....but i think what might not work for me will work for you. For all those black men out there who are plagued with razor bumps and have tried everyway of shaving, here is a little advice: try the Andis outliner 2 trimmer and be sure you go to your local black barber and ask him to adjust the blades. Please be sure that the ones that he uses on his clients work. You want them to be close but not close enough to bite. besides that DO NOT USE RAZORS OR ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS. Trust me. I have tried different ways and this will save you a lot of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> These are the best shavers I ever had. I dont bump up, like when I used those other shavers like norelco or those brand name one they advertise on television. Those aren&#x27;t made for African Americans at all. I recommend this all Black males that have the bumping problem. Nice and smooth after every use. I use it every 2 to 3 days. And no bumps!</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use. Motor is crazy powerful, I think it scares some customers who have not experienced it yet lol! But from a professional standpoint, the power is awesome. I used a Braun electric razor before, and would always have to make multiple passes when shaving heads for razor fades or whole head shaves, trying to not leave any stubble. THIS RAZOR DOES IT IN ONE PASS! Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash/burn or bumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is my major complaint...I started using this razor in May, moderate use. I don&#x27;t shave heads everyday, all day long; maybe a couple a day, say ten to fifteen a week. Well, it stopped working as a cordless razor about a month ago. I can only use it when it plugged in to the outlet. The supplied power cord is very long and lightweight, so that is not exactly a problem for me at work, but if i had to travel or...i don&#x27;t know what, but it should still work less than 6 months after purchase, and for this i give it only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My only minor complaint is, I am already replacing the foil head assembly. But that might be normal with the amount of use it has seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But bottom-line, this razor blows every other razor I&#x27;ve used out of the water with ease. You cannot beat the price or performance of this razor. Maybe my next one will be more durable, or maybe I&#x27;ll give the Andis razor a go. I haven&#x27;t heard anything good or bad about the Andis razor, but I&#x27;d only heard good things about the Wahl.</li>
            <li> I love it. One of my employees had this machine, and she has tons of clientele bc she always does detail work like using this machine to finish a haircut after she uses the outliner machine on clients. I had to get one for myself and I love it. This machine and it is a very close and even though it&#x27;s cordless it still has tons of power and the charge lasts a long time. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and no problems.  If you use it when the beard is low, say 1-2 days growth it&#x27;ll work fine.  Don&#x27;t use it after 2 days because it tends to pull the hair.  It caused me to bump.  Keep it clean and use it with 1 day of growth and you&#x27;ll enjoy it.  I&#x27;ve used a Remington Electric Razor for years and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> I been a barber for 22  yrs ..I used tons of electric razors..Whal 5star is number 1 for me..I use this clipped on all my razor fades at the barbershop!! Cutts super clean!!!!</li>
            <li> Its ok. Charger port goes out and you have to replace the whole thing but other than that its a great product</li>
            <li> This item works great for shaving and for haircuts.  It also holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver , I&#x27;ve used many different electric shavers and I have to say this is the best and closest shaver ever. The best bang for your buck</li>
            <li> returned for refund, its really loud and obnoxious. its okay if you live alone, but if your waking up early for a shave ur going to wake up everyone else in the house -- its really that loud!</li>
            <li> So far this is a horrible shaver and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy</li>
            <li> It does and excellent job if you shave daily.  However, it will not cut beard hairs just stubble.  I no longer skip daily shaves.</li>
            <li> Got to admit that this is the closest shave I had in years without using a razor. I am really please with this purchase. Nice product, Wahl.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great product! Working excellent! I really love the super close shave with no bumps or irritation!!! Definitely will do business again! Wahl has been always great!</li>
            <li> Work great best shaver ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, works well on short hairs on my face but I have a harder time using it on my neck. I have to use a razor there which kind of defeats the purpose of using an electric shaver. But it works well everywhere else</li>
            <li> I have hair the comes outs flush with the skin.  This product dnot get that.  I have to actually use a straight blade and a Gel shaving cream to get the hair to stand up straight, then cut it.  But as much as not getting so close to cause ingrown hairs, this is the only thing ever that is doing the trick.  I use it daily and it gets as close a shave as allowed by my skin.  I am testing out lotions and after shaves to stop the 1-3 bumps I do get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better than the hundreds of bumps I used to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working properly d expected. I wad told how efficient it usage was only to discover otherwise. Maybe wrong choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought.  First few uses, it did not clean my face.  Nothing was cut.  My barber uses the same and it works great. Really the reason why I purchased.  So, I asked him, and he advised, you have to clip facial hair very short with clippers, then use these to clean up face, make it smooth.  This process works, but these clippers still don&#x27;t make my face smooth and clean.  So I am disappointed.  I wished instructions guided me better on how to effectively use the product.  Then, using 2 clippers every morning is a time waster.  So, now I have this device in the bottom drawer wasting space. Too late to return.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, but the blades got ripped. Manufacturer responded a d promise to replace. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver holds a charge well</li>
            <li> OK for the money, does a decent job when used to shave your head, however I would spend the extra money and get the Bald Eagle Smart, it&#x27;s in a league all by it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer still get bumps here and there</li>
            <li> My husband has purchased this shaver two times (because he&#x27;s broken them by dropping on tile).  The Amazon price is the cheapest around and he likes the close shave he gets from this wireless shaver.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great for shaving tour head.  Better that a blade.... But. The foil top started to rip after 2 weeks. I just emailed the company.  I already feel lost without it.  So would give it 5 stars but cannt because the top did not last.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well enough, but no where near as good as the old Wahl&#x27;s I owned years ago. It is very noisy and really doesn&#x27;t shave as close as claimed. Another thing lacking is that with the old Wahl&#x27;s you use to get several choices of shaving heads to use, this one only has the single one it comes with. Overall I would suggest that people look for a source for the older style Wahl shavers and get one of those instead of this one.</li>
            <li> this helped my son with the razor bumps he would get from other razors. Now its no longer an issue. He seems to like it alot and is glad that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> Not a very good shaver for a black person to use to shave their head.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas he has very sensitive skin he tried it it&#x27;s okay really doesn&#x27;t grab everything but I believe he really no longer uses it now.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of testing, it didn&#x27;t worked, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair grows almost the same direction of my skin therefore the machine either cant catch them, or cut them too deep and then they ingrown again; using it on a daily basis also hurt my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to go back to conventional razors being careful of not cutting to close to the skin, it causes me less irritation and ingrown hairs later.&lt;br /&gt;The product might or might not be a good one, but at least for me, it didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> a nice razor  a good shaver. I wish it had a  sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li> wish I had picked up the extra blades now and saved some money , I need a edger now so Im on the hunt.</li>
            <li> My barber suggested it for my head shaving, and I think it&#x27;s the best electric shaver, powerful, giving a very close shave, easy to clean, a little noisy but not the end of the world, it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great item for the price it is. Good quality not bad at all. Getting another one for my little brother cause he tried to keep mine</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be the best shaving equipment instead it gives me bumps after few hours of using it. A waste of money for me and I do not know whether it will be acceptable to return it as I use it only once.</li>
            <li> Works great and shaves very close. Easily comparable to shaving with a razor. It is very gentle on the skin. After using it for a couple days I dont even notice it touching me when I shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas.  His barber recommended it.  He loves it.  He no longer uses a disposable razor on his face because this shaver gives such a smooth shave.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> One thing to remember is that it takes about 3 weeks for your skin/face to get used to it. First foil shaver i&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m black and Razor bumps have ALWAYS been and issue... This Shaver and the combination of BUMP Patrol have kept razor bumps off my face for about a month now. Face is definitely the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because my Barber uses one to bald my head. I&#x27;ve tried on several occasions to use it to bald my hair and shave but it still leaves hair. My Barber&#x27;s razor shaves clean and no hair is left. I&#x27;m starting to get rash like razor bumps on my head which never happened when I go to the barber. I&#x27;m starting to believe that I don&#x27;t have the original manufacturer razor and got the fake one I have read about.  I can only give 2 stars!</li>
            <li> got this as a christmas present for a friend. He only wanted this as a present. I bought him it and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I like that it shaves very close and I can use it every day.</li>
            <li> Did some research and bought this as a gift for my 91 year old father. He loves it! He says it&#x27;s easy to hold and gives him the best shave of his life! He also says he thinks of me every morning when he uses it.. for that alone I would rate it at a million stars.</li>
            <li> this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This razor gives me the shave I&#x27;ve been looking for very close. I ordered this razor to shave my head. It work great nice close shave in 3 - 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Needs to be slightly retuned in order to receive 5 stars. The unit cuts very close without causing bumps that African American people get religiously. The only downfall is the cutting under the chin. That kind of sucks! Overall, great unit!</li>
            <li> I am a big Wahl fan been using their products since the 7th grade. This simply doesn&#x27;t work. It barely does a thing unless mines is broken.</li>
            <li> A friend suggest I get a Wahl rechargeable shaver.  I used it for the first time this week.  Excellent shaver! If you&#x27;re thinking about trying something besides a blade, or if you&#x27;re unhappy with your current electric razor, I suggest you get a Wahl rechargeable shaver. Very smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than any electric razor I have owned and it is great for touching up my head between blade shaves.</li>
            <li> I held out to cut my hair until I received this in the mail. I usually have a bald head and I would not use any other shaver except for this one. It doesn&#x27;t leave me with any bumps and it gives a smooth feel of skin after using it. I love this and it will go with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as well as I thought. Cut was not as smooth. It said no bump right on the package, that wasn&#x27;t true, my face was sore with bumps. I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for.  The foils &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; me on the first day and wanted to return them with no luck.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly. It really served my purpose. I love how it works. Intact it&#x27;s the best Shaving shaver l have ever had.</li>
            <li> Using this product along with my clippers gives me a very close shave. Being a black man, having less bumps is a plus!!!</li>
            <li> Ok so i rarely ever write any type of reviews for anything, but this was a must. Now the shipping was pretty fast on the sellers part so props to them. I am a young 19 year african american male. Since my first facial hair that started to grow in the 6th grade (yeah i know) i have tried everything under the sun to shave. my hair doesnt grow uniformly like i would like it to dod but it grows sparsely all over my face as a mess. i really hated it. It was such a depressing fact, comming from someone who dresses nicely but my facial hair would mess up the whole outfit.Sucks when youre trying to woo the opposite sex huh. Everytime i went to the barber for a complete haircut and shave of a shapeup it will begin to grow back on the beginning of the 2nd day. It was annoying and expensive to go get a shapeup once a week to control my hair.I bought an andis liner and it was pretty ok until the blade got dull and it wasnt as smooth as i wanted it to be as if i came from the barber Once i began to use electric and ESPECIALLY MANUAL shavors, here comes razor bumps. The multi- blade shavers are great for smooth looks and up close shaving but the irritation afterwards and ever facial killer razor bumps. it was disgusting! all over my neck and face looking like a mountain range! it was painful to touch and had to wait until it went away a week later while my hair is still growing. i hated. i was desperate, i tried nair on my face (disaster). i tried single straight blades, but had terrible technique, electric shavers are pretty expensive. and to be honest most shavers were made for caucasians,not minorities who really doesnt suffer from razor bumps. even the so called sensitive skin razors that wasnt much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, i went on a google search and looked up on a solution for weeks. I finally made a search of &amp;#34;bumpless shaver&amp;#34; and was brought to this product. i checked on the reviews and seen other african american reviews and were happy i found something.but the pricing point and some of the negative reviews swayed me away for a week or too. after seeing my facial hair mess in the mirror, i decided to take a chance with this believe its my last option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first used it i had my beard at the longest length thinking it would work. that first night it didnt do a thing. i was pissedd that i spent $50 on it. i read the manual and tried again, but once again no luck. i honestly believed that nothing would work. i immediately order for a refund and to send it back. due to work (thankfully) i wasnt able to send it back for about 4 days. during those four days i had an important event and went to the barber to clean my face up . on the morning of the 2nd day i saw that my hair was creeping out again. so i tried one more despearte attempt at this shaver. and it was as if god himself was cleaning my face. it was a miracle!!. the little stubble that was growing was gone. absolutely gone. i nearly had tears in my eyes when i saw this. but i did have some facial irriation to this shaver. i was terrified that my face was going to break out terribly because it was such a close shave to the skin and that spells out doom for my face. but nothing has popped up. Over the next couple of nights i continued to shave to prevent my hair from comming back and the irritation slowly went away as my face got used to it. i immediately cancelled my refund request and i will continue to buy this product once this one stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now tips to other people:&lt;br /&gt;1) you cannot shave with a full beard and think that it was take it away. look on the holes on the head. it is way too small to fit a fully grown facial hair. its a maintainer not a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) also it is pretty noisy but unless you live inside a library, it shouldnt be that big of a problem to hear for less than 5 minutes a day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) yes yes you pretty much have to shave everyday if u want a clean look. this is for me, other people hair growth rate varies but if it similar to mine pretty much everyday once a day in the night or morning. but less than 5 minutes would be suffice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)this thing doesnt affect any detailed facial hair designs. i have a goatee and a strip of hair extending from the bottom of my head hair along my jawline to the goatee. it goes right past it without a hair shaved. keeps it tight and clean inbetween haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope everyone enjoys this review and it answers your questions about this product</li>
            <li> This is a powerful shaver. It shaved closer than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I did use it for shaving my head as well as my face. I&#x27;d used it for a little less than a month and one of the foils broke.&lt;br /&gt;I know shaving the head can be harder on a razor but I expected more than a month for the price. I was a couple of days late on making a return request to Beautymaster and they denied it. (the razor broke before 30 days had past). A real cop out in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop this razor because the foil seems to break/rip very easily. If the foil does break, you won&#x27;t want to keep shaving with it unless you want to get some visible red lines/cuts.</li>
            <li> These clippers are outstanding!!!  By far the closest shave of any I have tried.  My barber used them on my head, so when I decided to shave the whole thing, it was an obvious choice.</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job on old baldy! I had the Skull previously and it lasted almost no time. This is cheaper and does a better job clearing my undergrowth. i hope it holds up better than the Skull!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for the entire 14 years of my barber career.what can I say Top of the line shaver.</li>
            <li> Great name brand and great price, used for barber school and helped a great deal! Great product. I would buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> good skin shaving machine</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, just what the doctor ordered, awesome shaver, buy one today, its a home run, it&#x27;s a no brainer. Thank You</li>
            <li> At first it work fine it shave me good except the neck area. It was working great until my 10th month. Now it dont shave a single hair.</li>
            <li> I got tired of painful razor bumps so I stopped shaving for a while.  But then again I can&#x27;t look like a hobo in the office....so I tried this product.  While it&#x27;s not gonna cut long hair I find that if I shave and edge my face with my normal electric trimmer this works AMAZINGLY well to get me that &amp;#34;nearly as close as a razor blade&amp;#34; smooth look and feel. Had it about two months and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet.  But then again it&#x27;s used ONLY to finish up a shave and get me that smoothness.</li>
            <li> HEY THESE SHAVE REALLY CLOSE IT HAS A LOUD MOTOR AND SHARP BLADES;;</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from the low-end shaver to the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; standard shavers. This thing is by far the best. I have the most coarse hair texture of anyone I know and somehow this shaver gets me baby smooth. Best experience I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver by far.</li>
            <li> After my barber recommend that I purchase this specific shaver, I was more than pleased with the results! It is very efficient and is also easy to clean and maintain. Blades are sharp and it really is the closest thing to a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> Works Great, very nice trimmer long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand this razor. Nothing I have tried gets this thing to cut my hair in under an hour. Basically have to rub my scalp raw just to get it to cut. If you let your hair go more than a couple days between cuts, you might as well not even pull it out of the drawer. I honestly don&#x27;t know why people would use this over a straight razor. Maybe I&#x27;m just not getting the purpose of this thing, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased three of these. One for my husband and two for my brothers. They all love this razor and uses it frequently. My husband uses it on his head and face. My brothers use it on their faces only as they still have plenty hair on their heads. We ordered replacement blades which works great. Ethnicity: &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; this razor works well.</li>
            <li> Not up to par for Me , good price but loud  would I buy another like this one No sub par for me</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, this shaver is really loud. I&#x27;m willing to forgive that because it shaves very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard and have to work a bit to clean the edges, but other than that I like it better than the Wahl shaver it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it exactly a month ago and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product may need to buy another</li>
            <li> I have been using a safety razor for many, many years, except after wilderness trips on which I couldn&#x27;t shave.  This razor worked very well from the first time I used it (no break-in period required, as suggested in instructions:but I have smooth skin and beard grows slowly).  However, it is unlikely it will be useful with a week-long beard (instructions suggest beard should be at most 1/32&amp;#34; long).  When charging, the red indicator light was always lit (but razor worked well for several shaves between charges).</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver about a month ago,to replace/augment a panasonic wet/dry shaver which,I sent off to Panasonic Service the day after the Wahl arrived..Panasonic Service is another story,which I will not bother to get into now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When,I opened the package I was surprised that the Wahl was a hideous wine colored pice of cheap looking plastic and not the sleek looking black pictured on Amazon,in any event I gave it a try,and I hated it,it was loud,ugly,felt like really cheap plastic,and gave a really bad shave,I would have returned it that same day,but because of Panasonic&#x27; slow service, was forced to use it...lo and behold after 10 days or so I began to get some really good results,and now plan to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary;really ugly design,very loud,gets warm,no trimmer,cheap plastic...very effective for me after period of adaptation.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried several razors, and this is the best yet. Also cuts very close to the skin</li>
            <li> I returned this razor, I purchased it for my hubby by it doesn&#x27;t shave/cut at all. I returned it for a refund</li>
            <li> This shaver gets any hair left over after I shaver with my razor. My bald head is smooth, I mean really smooth! No joke.</li>
            <li> The razor work as described but the grill ripped the second time i used it. I Am not sure how to go about getting another grill. Its a clean shave you just have to go over certain areas a few times.</li>
            <li> After a while it did not work for my husband.</li>
            <li> Product did not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is ok but not as good asy $20 norelco especially normal use leaves much to be desired. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I selected this product because my barber had used it when shaving me.  I was never satisfied with other shavers that I had previously used because they always left visible hairs, but found this shaver to be very satisfactory.  I decided to try it for those shaves that I would need in between my trips to the barber.  It does the job very well.  I would recommend it to others, particularly Black men.  I&#x27;ve had no post shave bumps or other irritation from using this device.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl 5 star shaver and it is lighter, louder, and does not shave as close. I will be so happy when Remington replaces the es 1000 which they discountinued. I will have to suffer with the Wahl until I find a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year. CONS - the 1st thing to go out after 6 months was the ability to use it without the cord so I had to use it plugged in. The next thing to go was the foil itself. Probably because I take it everywhere.    As a black man, i&#x27;ve tried all the products but still got razor bumps. For the last 10 yrs, I was just using the trimmer my barber uses but I still looked like I had a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow. One day my barber pulled out the shaver and the love affair with this razor began as my wife was loving how close the shave was compared to the old trimmer.    Some of the guys reviewing this product, in my opinion, are not using the shaver correctly and I would like to help. When I 1st tried it, I would push it hard on my face to try to get as close as possible. When I did this, I would get little bumps. I realized I was being counter-productive as the goal is a close shave NOT using force and getting below the skin-line and creating razor bumps. When I just run it across my face like it was a razor blade, I get NO razor bumps and the shave is very close. I recognize the spots on my face that I only pass once or twice as they are prone to razor bumps. For me, it is one the sides of my chin. You HAVE to use it daily or the facial hairs get to long. In that case, use the barber trimmer and then use this product.    Although it barely lasted one year, I&#x27;m about to stock up with 3 more. One for travel, one for the house and one for the car. Oh, and this Christmas, I&#x27;m getting some for some of my boys who use a blade and have bad razor bumps...    Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> I used it three times. I then went to clean it and took top off by pressing button stayed pressed in which obviously did not allow me to put top back on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One top of that the customer service to get my money back was HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews on this whal are a lie it should say 1 star</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Very close shave. Long lasting between charges. The only thing is it did not come with a carrying case. I had an old one and used it for this.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Professional Shaver is excellent! It exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this shaver for the African American male to use to closely shave the head.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this machine so I decided to get it. It&#x27;s perfect for travels, doesn&#x27;t occupy a lot of space. Also why pay a barber to shave your head when this does the same thing and saves you time and money</li>
            <li> excellent product.  gives a fast, clean and comfortable shave.  Great Price</li>
            <li> This very good to use when you want to get really close.  It&#x27;s lightweight and works well.  It&#x27;s a bit louder than I expected, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> I prefer a bald head but I have issues with razor bumps/irritation. Doesnt cut as low as other shavers. Decreases but DOES NOT eliminate bumps/irritation all together. I imagine this would vary greatly from person to person.</li>
            <li> The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten without a razor. I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore outrageous priced disposables again. I originally bought it for my head but, soon found out that I can also use it for my face without it causing bumps. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used my Wahl Dynaflex shaver for years, and it worked better than any other shaver I ever owned.  It came with three different heads, to provide the type of shave that worked best for you.  It also had a built-in pop-up trimmer, which is absolutely essential to cut those long hairs that the foil cannot remove.  The new 8061 model comes with only one head, and no built-in trimmer (stupid) at a higher price.  It is like men&#x27;s bathing suits, which are made without zipper flies (duh). Soon cars will be made without doors that open; you can climb in though the windows! Manufacturers will reduce quality, and make a product that serves no purpose, just to keep their prices lower than their competitors. Men&#x27;s electric shavers need trimmers built in, period! Forrest Gump said it best, \\&quot;Stupid is as stupid does\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Youre better of with a gillette mach 5 This prpduct Iis not what I expected AT ALL. Save your money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he does not have coarse facial hair. He&#x27;s used it regularly but his face never adjusted to the cutting, it was too rough on his skin. He did mention that it is the same shaver that his barber uses on his fade so we kept it for touch-ups between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> This is my first use of an electric shaver for many years and it performs admirably. While it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as a blade razor, it works well for me when I don&#x27;t want to take the time or effort to use lather &amp; the blade. I&#x27;ve got some &#x27;crazy&#x27; whiskers that have to be cut from several directions and this shaver does a good job. It works better in those cases if one does NOT mash down on the face but rather simply shave repeatedly in different directions. For me, mashing down on the shaver while shaving tends to cause me to have some skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors however this one is the best I&#x27;ve found. There are not many products like this on the market that work well for black men. This razor provides a  nice smooth,very close shave, no bumps no worries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a so called, &amp;#34;black male&amp;#34; (brown really), that has issues with razor bumps so I thought this would be a good buy from the reviews! Wrong! I am was so upset with this purchase that I had to send it back to Amazon immediately. It didn&#x27;t shave a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is how it suppose to work in theory:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foils that you see on the top are there to protect your face. The razors are under the foil so your face never really touches the razor. Your facial hair that grown out straight will actually stick through the foils and get cut by the razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the problem with that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason black males get razor bumps in the first place is because our hair is too curly. Once it grows out of the skin it will immediately curve and go back in. Which causes the razor bumps. If the hair on your face has already began to curl, the ends will not go through the foils. Therefor, this razor is crap because it can not shave your facial hair. Plus it is way too loud!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the Andis T-Outliner next. I am happy with Amazon&#x27;s customer service. Returning the razor was a breeze. I thought I would just have to cut my ties with the $52 dollars I spent on this crap. I got a full refund most likely because I tried the razor probably two or three times. Once I found out how it was suppose to work in theory and realized it wouldn&#x27;t work, I cleaned it and returned it immediately. It was a breeze cleaning as well since it doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving I at first was unsure the correct way to shave using it. Once I read to reverse and go and upward strokes, I was greatly satisfied with the close shave. In combination with my Andis clippers this is the cleanest look I&#x27;ve had ever..</li>
            <li> cheep stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I am going to return this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> This product is very unreliable. The product has a defect with the charging capability. I bought 2 of these (since I liked the way it shaved, I gave it a second chance) and both had faulty charging mechanisms. The first stopped taking a charge and would only work while plugged in - then completely stopped working altogether. The second was receiving an inconsistent charge (you can tell by the charging indicator flickering) and has just stopped working altogether. I am very upset that I can not return this product and will think twice before ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and It&#x27;s everything he wanted in a shaver! Very close shave! And convenient  too!!</li>
            <li> Hair must be real short before you use it, its great blade to bald your head.  the price is pretty good also.</li>
            <li> pure garbage, if i had not used it i would have sent it back, but they would re-boxed resold it. and PURE PURE PURE PURE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin was getting irritated from shaving a lot. I&#x27;m of Hispanic decent and my facial hair grows fast.&lt;br /&gt;This works great for giving your skin a nice break as well of getting extremely close shave. It holds a charge for a least a week and is very easy to clean. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a close shave without using a blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father who is currently a patient and it was so noisy and did not do a good job either. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Does good job shaving. But if the hairs are a little long it won&#x27;t cut them. Very noisy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;A charge does last a long time. Longer than other shavers I have had.</li>
            <li> Batery Last a Long time good product</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer so I returned it..Not sure how they expect you to shave without a trimmer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations my 10 year old norelco works better then this</li>
            <li> Great product but, battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge after 5 months or so..</li>
            <li> I only gave 3 stars because the clippers broke the first week</li>
            <li> I love it.  Gives a very close shave and so far on razor bumps</li>
            <li> I believe the item is giving the service expected, cannot give a first hand review as the purchase was for a friend.!...Mr Walker</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations for close shave and ease of handling.  A little noisy but otherwise I really like it.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s barber recommended it and hubby says it is the best electric razor for getting a close shave</li>
            <li> If you shave every day it is good but it will not shave you if you skip a day  3 stars at best</li>
            <li> Love it so much had to get family member one.</li>
            <li> Great tool very handy</li>
            <li> Works as it was expected to do, great. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smooth close shave, without any bumps or irritations.</li>
            <li> Shaver excellent, previous shavers had a trimmer and case included in the order. Neither was included, must be cutting back on costs.  You need the trimmer, shaver doesn&#x27;t do good job on sideburns.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the box covered in black guys intimidate you, still works great on all skin types and colors. Awesome.</li>
            <li> compact, easy to clean, works well with or without cord. fits well in the hand, shaves close enough, shaves comfortably.</li>
            <li> Lowest rating because I bought it for my husband who is Haitian, and in the military. He tried it and did not do anything. We returned it, I am not sure how there are so many comments on how great this works when IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!! FYI I also tried it on my leg, I am hispanic with very fine hair and it also did not do anything...So if you want to try it go ahead but that is our experience.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really cut the hair at all much.  It should be used only for maintenance purposes ONLY! (Even that I question)  It doesn&#x27;t seem to trim anything but it makes lots of noise as if it is doing something.</li>
            <li> Never work and i will tell anyone do not by any</li>
            <li> It was recommended to us from a fellow barber and we absolutely love it! It is great for a quick shave or for doing skin tight fades and tapers! Great feedback from customers as well! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Works very good and is a quality brand. Good buy for the price and its very solid. and hold its charge for a few days.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Battery lasts a long time and I get the closest trim for beards this is definitely a product I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived very quickly.  Works well, shaves close.  I am very happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my grandson, (15) did nor cut any hair off the face.  Unfortunately i do not think he put everything back in the box and i can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!! Not for beginners!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver require patience so that you understand how it works. You can&#x27;t &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; the foil too hard on to your skin when shaving, and you actually have to use another shaver (like an outliner) to mov down your beard hairs first. It&#x27;s a clean up razor. It works very well!</li>
            <li> My son love this shaver.  He needed something as he has turned 16 now.  I bought this reading the reviews saying that this particular shaver did not irritate the skin.  This must be true as my son has not experienced any irritation that I can see after shaving. So its a keeper!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use the wall shaver, didn&#x27;t get the direction paper how to operate the machine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much maybe 10 times doesn&#x27;t cut Aa good Aa the first few times I have light hair on face don&#x27;t recamend junk</li>
            <li> very good shaver, i did have to replace the head after a few times used. but i would rate it 4+</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. If it had a trimmer attachment it would be a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I like to shave my head but don&#x27;t always like to have to use a Mach3 or other blade razor. The Wahl 8061 5-star is exactly what I have been searching for and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great all-around razor that will shave your face as well as your head. The only thing I did note was is I let my head or facial hair get longer than two days growth then I have to take my beard trimmer to the stubble to knock down the length a little for this razor to work well. Small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve ever had. However, Ive had it for a month and the top metal thing frayed and broke easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to get get a new one or a replacement.&lt;br /&gt; the quality is terribly bad though.&lt;br /&gt;I wish to hear from the seller soon.</li>
            <li> The foil top is very fragile.  The shaver gives a great close shave.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaves! I use these to clean my clients&#x27; neck area, and for one I use it for a bald fade. He said that the shave is even smoother than the razor shave that he gets from the barber shop. This was a good investment!</li>
            <li> Great product to shave my head with (but it does take some time) - MORE IMPORTANT is the GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I got from Wahl. I accidentally tore the GOLD FOIL and it made it hard to shave. When I called them to complain, they not only sent me a replacement free of charge but they went so far as to send TWO !!</li>
            <li> These shapers are absolutely what I&#x27;ve been looking for 5 stars all the way no more razors they shave close and do not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say I had such high expectations for this shaver. Overall it has good reviews but for every customer that has a different face, different kinds of facial hair there will be different results. If you have thick curly facial hair, this may not be the razor for you. It did wonderful shaving around the sides of my face but often completely missed slightly longer hairs on my neck and painfully pulled on the mustache ones. Again, overall good shaver but I would not recommend for the thick curly beard types out there.</li>
            <li> Wahl says it all for a great brand. This shaver is by far above and beyond any other electric shaver out there.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the newer model with the gold/yellow power switch. No complaints so far. Needs a charging LED and replaceable and rechargeable battery. The stand is kind of loose, I never know if I&#x27;m charging it or not. I like the shape and build quality.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for those of you who like to not only remove the hair from your neck and face, but also the first layer of skin. Lots of blood, and screaming. Sent it back!</li>
            <li> I never knew about this electric razor until another African-American man mentioned it about a month ago during a random conversation. I ordered, used it and I&#x27;m quite impressed. I&#x27;ve searched for and used numerous electric razors and all work decent on my skin. The key to using this one is pre-cutting your hair with either an edger/liner type clipper and then going over it with the Wahl. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> i am not a barber, but wanted something for quick clean ups when i couldnt reach my own barber. Easy to clean &amp; close shave.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old black male with very sensitive skin. I have always shaved with Andis Outliner trimmer and have desired a closer shave for years. A few years ago I tried shaving with Magic Shaving Powder like my father and that didn&#x27;t work out, I had terrible in-grown hairs all over my face and neck a few days afterwards. So after stumbling upon this Wahl bump free shaver I was somewhat optimistic that maybe I&#x27;ll finally be able to get that closer shave I&#x27;ve always desired. I only shave every 5 days ago due to my skin being sensitive. I shaved for the first time with this Wahl shaver last Thursday night the same day it was delivered by UPS. I read the instructions and it said your face needs to get used to a new shaver and to only use the Wahl shaver for a few weeks. The very next day my face was super sensitive and would sting a little if I touched my face or under my neck. Well after letting the hair on my face grow out from last Thursday to today(Tuesday) I needed to shave again to look appropriate for work and decided not to chance it with the Wahl shaver and to just use the Andis Outliner trimmer instead and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my face looked, in-grown hairs and bumps everywhere on my face and neck. You should be able to see the pictures I uploaded to see the condition of my face. I spent 30 minutes picking in-grown hairs out and now my face will need a few weeks to recover and hopefully heal. I&#x27;m repackaging this Wahl shaver and calling Amazon tomorrow and argue with the rep about giving me a refund, I feel this is false advertisement. From reading other reviews I guess maybe other black males have tougher skin than mine and maybe thats why they had better success with this shaver. I&#x27;m disappointed that I still have not found anything that can give me a closer shave than the Andis trimmer I use, but I guess I just have to accept it for now and be happy not to have any in-grown hairs or bumps after I shave.</li>
            <li> This review is from Daryl,my husband who actually uses the shaver!ha. He says that he loves it.  It is strong in his hand yet very gentle and thorough on his face.  One of the nicest shavers he has purchased and he has purchased a number of different brands and has never been satisfied til now.  Thank you Wahl!</li>
            <li> My elderly vision impaired husband finds this very easy to use &amp; I appreciate the absence of stubble on his cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver,  I bought it cause it&#x27;s the one all my barber use.  It has not disappointed.  I have very coarse facial hair and this thing cuts it down pretty close for an electric razor.  As long as you don&#x27;t press it hard on your face and just let the razor do its job it works great.</li>
            <li> Husband said he would have given this 4 stars because he prefers a razor with a pop up trimmer,  which this does not have. Says it did provide a close shave... Key word here is &amp;#34;did.&amp;#34; During the THIRD use  the screen suddenly had a hole in it! He is very careful with his shaving equipment, so it wasn&#x27;t from misuse. I have emailed the seller &amp; will update our review after we get a response.</li>
            <li> When I received this shaver, I was like &amp;#34; Wahl tricked  me for $50.00, it is too much&amp;#34; because it was just too lite, had a 2V battery, and does not look professional. I wanted to return it at first, but since I had already opened the box, I said why not give him a chance. So I went  to trim my beard with my full size Wahl then tried the shaver shaper. I was like &amp;#34;whaooo&amp;#34;. It works. It gives you a smooth shave and you don&#x60;t even have to press it on your body.  Just ride the shaver shaper on your body and the work is done.  I don&#x60;t use shaving cream but I like close shaving even though I have sensitive skin, and I can guaranty you that it is bump free. Yes bump free. You are going to love shaving after using Wahl shaver shaper.</li>
            <li> Did not shave as close as I would of liked.  Shaver is bump free.&lt;br /&gt;Would try different model shaver to see if shaver cut closer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, OK.</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver because several barbers in my area use it for head shaving.  I figured they probably know what is a good product since it is a &amp;#34;tool of the trade.&amp;#34;  I have used it several times on my face and head.  It seems to have enough power to cut through my very coarse hair, but it is easiest if I do it daily.  It gives a very close shave if you go over it often enough and in many directions..  It is much easier than trying to use a blade on my head -- hopefully no more nicks and cuts!  Like some other reviewers I find it does miss some neck hairs, probably because they grow in different directions but I find it does a good job on my neck if I don&#x27;t go more than a day between uses.  A trimmer would be useful but it is not that much trouble to use a blade razor to outline and trim every few days.  All in all it seems to be a good product for my needs, and I like that replacement blades and foil heads are inexpensive and available on Amazon.  I will add more later if I experience any problems.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect and exactly what I was looking for to give my husband.  Thanks a lot for the prompt receipt!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver and a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this equipment. We&#x27;re currently processing your review and we will emaias soon as this is complete. i dig it.</li>
            <li> Rips the hairs out of your face. Caused me to bleed. I do not recommend this. Choose another product and make sure you have a return policy.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about 2 months back. I wanted to wait to write this review until I had forgone the trial and tribulations of using a new shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I learned many things on how to make it more effective, but sadly, it won&#x27;t be your one-step solution for shaving your face. To use this shaver, your hair must be the length of stubble! Not kidding. The first time I tried it out, I had a light beard going on and it did absolutely nothing because unless the hair is pointing straight out (which only stubble does), this will do absolutely nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked into this as an alternative because I wanted to be clean shaven or near clean shaving most days (something not possible unless I shaved every 3 days which is not feasible as I&#x27;d destroy my face pursuing that endeavor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is good because for the most part your skin doesn&#x27;t make contact with the cutter bar, that&#x27;s where the foil comes into play. So I can \\&quot;shave\\&quot; every 2 or 3 days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re like most men, when you go to use this on the third day, it&#x27;ll do nothing on its own as it only works on stubble... So you&#x27;ll need a trimmer companion. I have the Wahl Hero trimmer which I pass first and in between as I see hairs remain because of their length. The Andis T-trimmer is a great companion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s no picnic using this shaver over using razor blades, but I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s more docile on one&#x27;s face than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh, yes... Many people have complained of ingrown hairs. Yes, it happens. But not to the degree others have mentioned. For all I know, maybe it occurred when I shaved and I never noticed until I started to look for confirmation this did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving near the neck area is very hard and you don&#x27;t get that close of a shave, but everywhere else, it gives a really close shave. As close as using a razor. So try it out for yourself and good luck! Remember to moisturize afterwards! :)</li>
            <li> This product did not deliver a close shave. I really wanted to return the item but decided the time needed to do so was not worth it. Now it sits unused. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the shaver is all right: it shaves close and clean. however I have a major problem with the shaving foil: it is made of a metal that colors my skin: after I shave the skin simply looks dirty. what a strange and misfortunate choice of material! thumbs down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even have a Trimmer. Have you ever owned a shaver without a side burn trimmer? Surely that omission should have been given in the description, so I would call that description a little misleading at best. I used to use the gray colored Wahl Shaver and it was a high quality product that shaved very well and the blade and screen lasted 6-months or longer. This &amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; colored shaver doesn&#x27;t even have a side burn trimmer, makes rattling noises, and doesn&#x27;t provide a good clean shave. The blade and screen combination is fair to poor when it is new and gets worn out rather quickly with repeated use, and just doesn&#x27;t work as well as their original shaver did.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve used. Very powerful. Very close shave.</li>
            <li> Love it, better priced than going to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see many barbers and beauty salons use this shaver.  The shaver gives you a quick shave and is pretty close to a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery doesn&#x27;t last too long though, they last just a little bit over a year.  Just enough for it to be out of warranty.</li>
            <li> One month of light use, the foil tore. Need to replace immediately. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> This razor is very quick and convenient, however a bit on the noisy side. It does a good (not great) job on trimming the facial hairs, about 90% effective. The areas just under the jaw bone and above the neck are extremely difficult for this razor to maneuver. I would rate it five stars if it could shave those areas.</li>
            <li> My husband left his at home when we left for vacation.  While riding in the car on 95 I ordered it and thanks to Prime he had a replacement the next day.  Saved my vacation as my hubby is picky about his shaver and this one is the best we&#x27;ve found.  It shaves really close ( kissably close) and does not cut or scratch him.</li>
            <li> Close shave w/o irritation. Simple cleaning and operation</li>
            <li> I receive the shaver but it no good....broke after one used.</li>
            <li> Last week it just died.  I had this razor in the 1990&#x27;s it was the best electric razor I have ever owned.  This one just died it does not even work when it&#x27;s plugged in.  Too bad maybe I got a bad one out of that batch. bummer.</li>
            <li> This is the worst puducto I bought by Amazon, do not be fooled by the recommendations you have is a lousy product. No short beard and leaves you irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Wahl Professional 8061. This is the ONLY product that actually works in the prevention of razor bumps. For those of you who are struggling with razor bumps. ..do yourself a favor and purchase this product. I have seen noticeable improvement in a matter of days. Try it for yourself. .you have nothing to lose except razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Whilst thIs shaver does a good job, there is still room for improvement. It becomes differ cult to achieve a shave after three days of facial hair growth as the shaver depends on the hair passing through the mesh to be clipped. Apart from the few individual strands of hair that the shaver refuses to clip this shaver does a decent job assisted by a clipper.</li>
            <li> I recently changed my hair style to a Ragnar Lothbrook style Mohawk/undercut, and keeping the sides and back of my head shaved is a PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until I got the Wahl Pro!  So long as you use it daily depending on how fast your hair grows, this shaver will grind through all but the most stubborn hairs, all without the slightest irritation, tugging, or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head comes off easy for cleaning, and the replacement parts are easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have African American hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but as I do have to cut close to maintain that fresh shaved look, and have highly sensitive skin that gets ingrown hairs often, I must say this shaver blows the competition out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my dome, and keeping my beard manicured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that with the amount of hair I have to remove every day or so, the gold foil wears out too fast, and when it splits (often without warning) the still sharp blades can give you a nasty pinch/scratch (haven&#x27;t drawn blood, but felt like should have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the average person using this for their beard, or smaller sections of their head or neck, this probably won&#x27;t be as big a deal, as it will likely last a lot longer, but I go through a replacement screen and blade about once every 2 - 3 months, give or take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it costs me a little less than it would to buy mens razors if I was clean shaven.  But it saves me a lot of time and effort!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru heads in a short period. As of now I regret the purchase. I&#x27;ve asked for help from the seller. Let&#x27;s see if they respond. I&#x27;d not buy one again due to the frailty of the foil on the head. If they replace the head I&#x27;ll up my review.</li>
            <li> It is little loud, but does a good job and very close cut.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for the face and upper neck but i&#x27;m having some issues fully shaving my lower neck with it. would still recommend.</li>
            <li> Had hoped for better shave.  Okay for quickie but I guess I&#x60;ll revert to the razor when I want a better shave.  This Wahl seems to just skid over some facial areas.  I am disapointed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver shaper in my opinion and use it every other day to keep my line up looking clean. Easy to charge, clean, and use this often.</li>
            <li> The best shaver ever....</li>
            <li> A little loud. It would be nicer if it was a little quieter. Did I say a little loud. They made you put in 17 words.</li>
            <li> My Barber showed me this Razor and was selling it for $70&lt;br /&gt;I got it here for $48&lt;br /&gt;It shaves almost as close as a blade if not as close&lt;br /&gt;AND NO RAZOR BURN at all first electric razor not to give it to me&lt;br /&gt;Works great for this White guy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor in November of 2013 and used it three times a week until it broke at the beginning of January 2014.  When it worked it was very strong and gave an amazingly close shave.  I contacted the manufacturer through their website and have gotten no response.  The problem I am having is the power switch wont keep the razor running, I have to hold the switch in and up to the on position to shave which is a major pain.  Would recommend you take the lack of customer service into consideration before you drop the money down.</li>
            <li> My fiancée was tired of razor irritation on his head from shaving. A barber friend recommended this product as he uses it in his shop. Works pretty good. You do have to get used to it. But doesn&#x27;t take long. Holds a charge for a while. Gets pretty darn close to the skin. Not razor close, but saves a lot of irritation. Probably as close as you&#x27;re going to get. Comes in handy when he&#x27;s driving over the road. He can get a shave in right in the semi. He really likes it and is satisfied w it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. We use it in the salon.</li>
            <li> It is over hyped for that close shave I expected. I suffer from PFB and this was supposed to be a close shave minus the irritation. Well after use I still have a facial shadow.</li>
            <li> As I have said before I would try to talk my best friend into useing this razor as I have had several and it is the best of the group. Other brands just don&#x27;t shave as clean and fast as the Wahl. That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: buy it.  I used to shave my head with razor blades and was never comfortable. Plus, those blades get expensive quick.  I always read that no electric razor would be as good as razor blades.  Well, this one is as good as it gets. I have been using it for a week already.  I have sensitive skin.  But, I am never going back to blades. It takes a little practice on holding on your scalp, but i can shave everyday no problem.</li>
            <li> This shaver arrived on January 27th.  Today is Feb 10th and it is no longer  usable.  The coating that covers the blades has come off.</li>
            <li> This is the second of these I have owned.  The first one was broken while I was traveling.  It shaves very close with no problems.  I use it to shave my face and head.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> When I started barber school back in November, the only haircut that I was allowed to cut was bald heads.  I bought this shaver within a week and have used it extensively ever since.  A true test of a product is how well that your clients like the results of it, and when it comes to this shaver my clients have LOVED it.  Almost everyone that I&#x27;ve used this on have come back to the school and asked specifically that I cut their hair again because I got their hair as close as they&#x27;ve ever had it without actually putting a razor to their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts a very long time as well.  I can shave a couple dozen heads with this shaver before it starts showing signs of slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I had never heard about this shaver until a fellow African American mentioned it to me during a conversation in the locker room.  I purchased the shaver from Sally&#x27;s and was a little skeptic about an electric razor as I&#x27;d tried other electric razors before.  The initial use of the razor did not remove all of the hairs.  Reading the instructions, it states that it will take your face about three weeks(21 days), to get accustomed to using the razor.    One of the things that I did to help me along was to use the Andis Style Liner first to get rid of the the long hairs and get the beard area trimmed down to a level that is good for the Wahl.  Next I used the Wahl and I got a really good shave.  Really close, like a baby&#x27;s but close and my face felt good.  I immediately took a shower afterwards to avoid any inflamation/razor rash.  After I got out the shower I applied a daily cream treatment called Bump Rescue made by Magic [[ASIN:B00493ZX0G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]].  It contains Cocoa Butter and Aloe and does not sting.  It helps to even out the skin tone and get rid of those unsightly dark spots from razor bumps.    It has now been two-weeks and I can notice a big difference in my face.  My wife has even commented on how smooth my face is.  You have to use the razor DAILY.  You can&#x27;t just use it here and there.  You have to develop a regiment and STICK WITH IT.  I shave daily, every morning.  In fact with the Wahl Shaver Shaper, I look forward to shaving every morning.  My face is smooth and minimal irratation.  I always either wash my face or take a shower after I shave and then apply the Bump Rescue by Magic [[ASIN:B00493ZX0G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]].    I hope that this helps other African-American men as this shaver has changed my life.  Being in the military, we have to keep a clean and neat appearance and this shaver works if you give it time.  No need to press it into your face.  As I said, if your facial hair is more than 1/8 of inch long, use the Andis Style Liner/Trimmer first to get the hair down to a shaveable length and then just let the Wahl Shaver Shaper do the work.  You may have an occasional ingrown hair that you can pull out with the tweezers, but this beats the \\&quot;old bumpy bump\\&quot; face.</li>
            <li> Excellent. After all these years I have found what I have been looking for. Simply put, it works!</li>
            <li> Works great for men of color. Shaves my head extremely close with no irritation . The only problem I have is shaving parts of my face that have divots or ingrown hairs, that&#x27;s not the razors fault. I would recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> It has a perfect battery but it doesn&#x27;t remove hair well</li>
            <li> Bad. Pull Out the skin</li>
            <li> Shaves better than a razor!</li>
            <li> I needed this years before I got it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best electric razors for professional use. Customers love it once they experience how close it shaves without causing razor rash/burn or bumping.</li>
            <li> This is what I bought this razor for- a close clean shave.  This is the fix for my beard!</li>
            <li> The gold overlay/foil that protects your skin from the blades has completely come off.  It started as a small chip and within 2 days was unusable.  Of course this happened a week after the bogus 30 return policy expired. All I can say is wow...really Amazon????</li>
            <li> The item came very very quickly, was in perfect condition and has  worked perfectly ever since. I am thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband. He is very picky so I was hesitant to get another shaver that would just sit on the shelf.  Well  to my surprise he loves it and is loving the difference in his skin when he uses it.</li>
            <li> The foil to broke quickly causing it to snag my face.  Ordered a new foil.  Hope it lasts a bit</li>
            <li> I bought this because of its promise of a super close shave and it does the job, but only if your beard is short, if you have a 3 day beard it just doesn’t work and it has the annoying tendency of leaving single hairs uncut that are very hard to shave. The size is perfect for travelling and the battery holds about a week with daily use. It drops hair dust while shaving so you have to clean up afterwards. It has to be cleaned, cant be washed. The design is kind of old school, maybe they haven’t change the design in 30 years, and it is loud, it is like riding an old tractor, also buy some aftershave cream you will need it.</li>
            <li> I like the shave it gives, but have some issues with the protective case. Must be careful with it especially when carrying the device in a bag with other things because the case can come off and get lost easily. Wish the foils were level with each other so I can hold it easier when shaving.</li>
            <li> work great and fast...cordless battery is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Very good value, works just fine...</li>
            <li> This product performs exactly as described. A very close and smooth shave, without irritation. A great substitute for shaving your head without the fear of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this shaver.  Hope it lasts a while. Very strong motor. Love that it is wireless. Will need to get replacement foil.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to a friend and he enjoys it</li>
            <li> This shaver is just a little noisy but it gives a nice close shave. It is small and easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li> I like the way it runs smoothe on my butt cheecks.....and other places.</li>
            <li> Son has a hard time getting a close shave with all shavers. It does a little better than most but still not as close as we want</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  In just a week of shaving the foil on top tore open and the inside machinery made contact.  I went back to my trusted Norelco AT790.  The old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; rang true for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he is loving it!</li>
            <li> I decided to order one of these since my barbers use them. They suck! They fail at trimming anything. I used them 4-5 times and gave up.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t miss the daily shave or some whiskers may grow longer than the maximum 1/32&amp;#34; and won&#x27;t cut. other than this, this shaver is everything it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product no complaints... Thus far..</li>
            <li> Gives shaving bumps very painfull</li>
            <li> Cuts very close without burning.  Battery usually lasts me a couple of weeks+ before needing a recharge.  It can be used on low charge with the power cord.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it in that mode normally as it would likely kill the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a trimmer as I need to use this sometimes as well.  Construction is medium duty plastic.  Better than some but not heavy duty.  Still not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;On the whole even without the trimmer I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item after a visit the gentlemens barber shop and had to have it. Shave feels pretty close to skin but it won&#x27;t get long hairs that can&#x27;t feed trough the foil. Not bad at all for $50!</li>
            <li> Cuts super close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a couple months, but have not been able to use it longer than a week at a time without having to replace the foil which keeps tearing and scratching my head up. The replacement foils are from $15-$20 each time I replace.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this razor by my brother who had an extra one. I&#x27;m an italian guy with somewhat sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used this model for a few years and really thought it worked well. My brother told me at first, don&#x27;t keep going over the same area over and over and over again or you&#x27;ll seriously screw your face up and it&#x27;ll hurt. Of course, I didn&#x27;t listen. The first time I used it, I was a little reckless and saw what he meant and had a few bumps, not like what the guy in the customer pics has. You have to learn how to use it, just like you have to learn how to use a regular razor. Can you imagine what the images for the reviews would be for straight razors by people who didn&#x27;t learn how to use something properly? It works really well and offered a better shave than what I&#x27;ve gotten with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a bit noisy, mines a couple of years old so maybe I didn&#x27;t take care of it as well as I should have. But the foil on top also ripped apart one day. Luckily...it was on my face but happened right before I was about to use it. I&#x27;ve been using Schick Hydro 5 since then and love it. I just hate being back to buying blades now so I&#x27;m thinking of buying a new Wahl soon. It&#x27;s a great product, just learn how to use it properly, which isn&#x27;t hard. The type of overuse from an electric razor is the same you&#x27;d get from using a regular razor blade. It&#x27;s an extremely close shave right off the bat so you don&#x27;t really need to go over areas numerous times which makes for a quick and easy shave. I sometimes would go lighter under my chin and neck then just take a regular razor for a closer and smoother shave. But all in all, great product.</li>
            <li> Only works on the very very short and find hair.</li>
            <li> I am a black man, first of all, and bumps are something that I am very prone to having. I purchased this product after reading all of the \\&quot;great reviews\\&quot; on amazon (I wonder if REAL customers actually gave this product great ratings). I wanted to replace my razor and therefore have a better chance of shaving without having bumps 24 hours later. Honestly, this shaver is NOT a super close shaver. I ran it all over my face and it did NOT shave anything. Even after pressing hard on my face (which is not recommended) it didn&#x27;t do anything but actually cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me not get into how this shaver sounds. It is so loud!!! It sounds like a stupid motorcycle early in the morning. It is almost stupid to use this considering I have neighbors. This is the worst shaver I have ever had. IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN SHAVE ANYTHING!! WHY IS IT CALLED A SHAVER???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets review here:&lt;br /&gt;  Pros: Can be used as a revenge tool to disturb your neighbors if their loud sex wakes you up in the middle of the night&lt;br /&gt;  Cons: Loud it gives you a headache&lt;br /&gt;  Doesn&#x27;t shave facial hair&lt;br /&gt;  Not super close (if it does shave very little hair)&lt;br /&gt;  Messy shave&lt;br /&gt;I am so frustrated at how they market this product and it ends up not doing what it claims to do. This is the worst purchase from amazon so far for me. Congrats Wahl. Anything Wahl I will be glad to avoid and inform friends and relatives to avoid also.</li>
            <li> My son is happy with it  He is mentally challenged and this item is easier for him to use.</li>
            <li> Love it works great. &amp; ships fast</li>
            <li> Great for a regular maintenance of my beard and  shaved head.     Sadly, it broke, stopped charging and stopped working after being used in less than 45days.</li>
            <li> very close shave on your head</li>
            <li> Well made sturdy great for course and thick hair</li>
            <li> Nice!!! goo dproduct really close shave it arrived really quick</li>
            <li> My only regret is it does not have a mustasche trimmer as my older model did.Nice close shave!</li>
            <li> Worked well, just needs to cut more than stubble.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an advice from a veteran Barber, I use this daily to shave my face, because I do not like using razors.  I have been using this now for a long time and it works.  Barbers use this to get those hard to get hairs off of your face and go research it like I did and youtube or google and alot use this product.</li>
            <li> Good product and quick shipping, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and its the closest electric shave ive ever gotten</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned and MADE IN USA</li>
            <li> Not a close shave at all.</li>
            <li> Had to senf back was not the correct one</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Iam so pissed with what happened my face turns red and the bumps starts to show up!!! My skin is smooth!!! I dont have any sensitivity issues with my skin. Iam sure its the blade. Have your product be check. Not safe to use.</li>
            <li> Wahl you did it again!!! This shaver is by far the best shaver I have ever used!!!! Its Recommended by barbers and the best part it actually gives a CLOSE SMOOTH SHAVE! Everything I heard is Absolutely true the 5 star shaver shaper is a good product and I rate it (5 STARS!!!)</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this shaver!! Makes him super smooth and never gives him any bumps or breakouts. A great product!</li>
            <li> The shaver did not cut my husaband&#x27;s beard.  The product is advertised as a bump free shaver for African American skin.  Not so.</li>
            <li> Good enough to shave head daily, although the hair needs to be trimmed down short for it to work. After that can be used daily with no problems.  The first week did get razor bumps or burns however using aloe vera gel and exfoliating head just about every other day cleared everything up.  The razor shaves very well and close (no electric razor will ever come as close to hand razor). It leaves my head feeling smooth though. and sometimes I even use it twice a day since I like a clean shaved head.  The only gripe is the button that is on the side which is to let the foil off broke the 2nd time around. Although WAHL could replace it or fix it, I was able to fix it myself by opening it up. Even though it broke again, however I don&#x27;t really need it. To lift the foil just lift off the opposite end of where the button is and it comes right off.  EDIT 4/7/15 still think this is great but no longer use it on my head. I now use a razor which has the smoothest and best shave. I still have this set aside and will use every one in a long while on my face only.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great shave</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use shaver that gives you a razor close clean cut without the razor like after effects. I like it so much i&#x27;ve purchased two for my sons.</li>
            <li> love it just the foil is easy to damage</li>
            <li> Very professional shaver, cuts close and don&#x27;t leave bumps or irritate the skin. Holds a good charge easy to keep clean. Great product.</li>
            <li> my husband don&#x27;t like the shaver its not a close enough shave</li>
            <li> Terrible and cheap.  Does not work period.</li>
            <li> Just what ordered! And the exact amount of money!! Fast shipping , I bought a five star wahl and is good with a close shave!</li>
            <li> my husband doesn&#x27;t like the results from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;he is going to try the wahl triple head one.&lt;br /&gt;price ishowever is comparable to other shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years (thanks to my old barber) and it definitely works - BUT only for stubble-length hair.  This shaver won&#x27;t do much for hair longer than that... In my opinion this shaver gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten without having to put a blade &amp; shave gel on my face or scalp.  I highly recommend this product - specially for black men because our hair tend to be more curly and prone to grow inwardly.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my husband was using a razor for his bald head for years.  He&#x27;s light and prone to nicks, scratches, and cuts.  He gets a clean close shave with no issues from this shaver.  The only thing is, you have to be very careful not to press down too hard or you can break the screen.  Sigh... I&#x27;m buying him a new screen now.  LOL</li>
            <li> I received my shaver but it was USED!!! gross!! Didn&#x27;t even try it!!</li>
            <li> FAIR!!!  or maybe my expectations are/were too high but I need and want a much closer shave. I&#x27;ve used it twice and get nothing that I&#x27;m accustom to.  I&#x27;d like to donate it to someone who would be pleased with not such a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;JD - 10/05/03</li>
            <li> Initially I wanted to purchase a Braun Series 7 for my husband, but he insisted on the Wahl because they use it at his barber shop.  He loves his shaver.  Its rechargeable, portable, and gives him the clean close look he desires.  I may have picked up the wrong size in his boots, but I definitely got this one gift right! He uses it everyday and travels with it as well.</li>
            <li> irritated my skin and not as colse a shave as with a razor. i don&#x27;t think electric razors are for me.</li>
            <li> Came in slightly opened. Barely cuts it right. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent for men who can&#x27;t shave</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver and after looking at various products decided on this one.  It gives a very close shave and is easy to clean.  You can rinse the blades under hot water to clean them.  I have no complaints and would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does the job no bumps</li>
            <li> This is a very high-quality product, made in USA, smooth and powerful.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m a white dude who bought this hoping it would speed up the head-shaving routine.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t cut quite close enough, and it gives me razorburn - irritating my skin far more than a blade.  I tried it on my face, too, but the hair is apparently too thick there and this razor pulls, quite painfully.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this shaver and it did what it promoted. No bumps. Close shaving, specially for an A.American as I am. Heres&#x27; my problem: after six months or less the on/off switch stopped functioning. You had to press hard and hold in order to work. well, I bought another one, since I had to travel right away.....Same problem. I won&#x27;t buy it again, and I hate how large and weak the switch is. Be careful where you buy it from, because this 3rd party merchants have a no return policy.</li>
            <li> Lived up to every expectation</li>
            <li> perfect no shaving bumps use this before wet shaving it makes it smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift, and he loves it! This shaver works perfect for men of color who are wanting a very close, bump free shave. I love it too because after shaving, his skin is baby soft and ultra smooth. Highly recommended, great gift!</li>
            <li> This is the one my barber uses. Gets the job done. No razor bumps 2 days later. It does miss a few hairs on my neck. (Hence the 4/5 stars) I just put on some Williams Lectric Shave, hit them with the electric trimmer and we&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I had used Remington razors for several years.  Unfortunately, the quality of the last two that I owned was nothing like the earlier razors.  So I started searching for a different brand that gives a great shave, is a quality razor, and won&#x27;t require big bucks for purchase.  The Wahl fits that job description exactly.  It&#x27;s a solid razor that gives a close shave, and it doesn&#x27;t bite you.  It has a large surface shaving screen, two floating blades, the motor is more powerful and moves the blades at a higher speed.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an edit to my original review because, after only 5 months this razor is junk! The switch only works intermittently. There is no way to fix the problem. This was my second Wahl razor but, I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> Product operated for 5 min and then shut off and would not turn on again. I put it to charge over night and still no response. Faulty unit but I know this product works.</li>
            <li> Shaver is quite good product, it works good but does not shave close enough. It appears mine has a problem because now it cannot operate without pluging into power outlet. I bought it because I have seen others work. You may try it if you are looking for a nice looking shaver. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is great, but the foils came apart the first time it was used.  He called Wahl and they are suppose to be sending new foils, but so far have to received.</li>
            <li> It has surpassed another shaver, and that one is also a popular brand, which I no longer use.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has plenty of power and holds it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give five stars to any product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is an excellent shaver. Very good at fighting bumps, but....it is advertised as a shaver shaper, and the shaper for this product is missing. The back side should have a straight edge shaper, and it is not there. I recieved this product well packed and on time, but, this was a problem order overall. Not only was it advertised incorrectly, the first one I recieved had a defective foil guard, that came apart during the first use.  I called and and was offered a replacement, that also arrived quickly, but it too was missing the shaper. The customer service person could not confirm if the replacement would include a shaper or not. It did not. All in all, amazon allowed me to return both for a full refund, and I received an email from them stating that they would look into the product discription. I will note that I have been using this product for years, and it does typically have a shaper, and there is only one model number. It seems wahl either intentially or unintentially made this shaver without the shaper, and neglected to change the model number.</li>
            <li> My son the barber is very happy with this purchase and uses it all the time while working and cutting hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for xmas.He was very pleased with this item. Wahl  has great products. Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this razor. I read all of the reviews BEFORE I purchased and could not wait to get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;it would not give me a close shave. I had to go back to my razor blade. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> During the first 1-2 months, the product worked as advertised.  After two months, it would no longer charge, and would only work while plugged in.  After three months, the cord (at the site of insertion into the razor) became defective (the cord would fall out with vibration of the unit, to the point where I needed to hold the cord in place, while shaving), at four months, it stopped working completely.  Poorly built, loud product, that became inoperable within 6 months.  Wow.  Do not buy this.  Regarding the shave quality, it shaves as close as an electric shaver can (allowing once, daily shaving), yet the foil is of poor quality and with daily shaving, needs to be replaced monthly in the best circumstances (due to dulling), however in the worst circumstances (it happened to me three times), the foil screen will crack, requiring replacement.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Like it but learning to love it! It does provide a close shave after I use the andis clippers.</li>
            <li> Did not like the way it cuts. Scratches my skin.</li>
            <li> The shave is OK, but gets dull quickly, and the replacement head  cost is as much as the unit. Why bother... At the end of the day, they are all the same units in another package. I say try multiple units/brands, and anyone that cause lees issues after shaving, that is the best product on the market for you!</li>
            <li> it does not shave as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this until it broke</li>
            <li> this item did not cut at all</li>
            <li> The foil came apart in the middle after 2nd use. I was very disappointed. The motor also very loud. I always like Wahl product like clipper, never have problem.</li>
            <li> RETURNED!! This product did NOT work on my husbands hair. Was disappointed but maybe it just depends on the hair type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Wahl shaver after my second Wahl model 4000 finally died. That model is really built to last. I consider the model 4000 the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; of electric razors, bar none. Since I couldn&#x27;t locate anyone with a new model 4000 in stock, I settled on this model 8061. As expected, it delivers an outstandingly close shave with no irritation. Wahl builds excellent products at a very reasonable price. The model 8061 is the perfect size and weight for travel. The only feature it lacks, to make it an all-around excellent shaver, is an edge trimmer like on the model 4000. Still at the price it sells for and the quality of shave provided, it is an excellent buy. I would highly recommend it. However, I will probably order a new Wahl model 4000, once they are back in stock for my every day razor. This model 8061 will become my new travel razor.</li>
            <li> As an African American male looking to get into law enforcement and has a job that requires a clean shave; this product was a huge help. It gives you a smooth shave and REALLY leaves NO BUMPS. All you need to do is run it on your face and apply very little to no pressure. Just make sure you are cutting srubble it does not cut moderate to full length beards.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my heavy Lady Remington and VERY, VERY tired of rechargeable shavers because they HAVE NO POWER.  I wanted a corded shaver to have a strong, steady power supply and found that in the woman&#x27;s shaving world, they simply don&#x27;t exist.  So, I went for a men&#x27;s model.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I LOVE this shaver so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Plug in and strong power.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not any louder than my Lady Remington&#x27;s, Panasonic&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3) SUPER lightweight and easy to hold and manuever.  Half the weight of my Lady Remington due to plastic housing and no internal charging mechanism.  That thing feels like a lead weight now in comparison!&lt;br /&gt;4) Wider foil blade area; shaves my legs faster than a narrow &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s shaver&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;5) No scratching or irritating the skin like women&#x27;s shavers and their built-in &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; edges.  Always hated those!&lt;br /&gt;6) Normal, steady light pressure against the skin.  The trick I&#x27;ve found is slowing down a bit with each pass, not more pressure.  Then I can shave each section in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No electric shaver will ever compare to the smoothness you can get from a razor when you want to have soft, &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; legs with your guy, but I believe this is as close as I can get for normal, everyday &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; use.  It&#x27;s Winter now and I wear hose/tights with skirts &amp; dresses every day to work and it&#x27;s been fine for me shaving every other day.  In the Summer when I go bare-legged again, I forsee possibly using every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks and I love this thing.  Hope it pans out.  Wahl should SERIOUSLY market these for women!  They&#x27;d blow away the competition!  Heck, make the same exact product and model a purple-colored plastic version if you want to &amp;#34;girl-ify it&amp;#34; and not offend the men that we&#x27;re really using the same shaver.  Ha.</li>
            <li> Not near as good or as quick as my shaver with a blade.  Got it because I had neck surgery.  Can&#x27;t wait until I can use my razor again.</li>
            <li> My husband would always complain about not getting a close shave with his then current machine. Not anymore. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I actually it this gift for my husband as an anniversary present. He is a barber and loved it. His skin is always so smooth after he uses it with no bumps and he can use it on his clients. He definitely loved that it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver, but still can&#x27;nt figure out how to use the cleaner. Was an excellent buy for the me.</li>
            <li> Has the closest shave of all razors, and shaving time is less. Wish it had a trimmer,  as I didn&#x27;t realize it does not have one.</li>
            <li> This Wahl Shaver Shaper was purchased from amazon.com at a great price and rated 5-stars because it arrived ahead of time, well packaged, and functioned as described.  It provides a very close shave with great battery and electric power.  I recommend this shaver and shaper to others!!!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before several dozen years ago so I was familiar with the product if I had one question it would be the name sways shaver Shaper, well I thought the Shaper part is this little trimmer piece on the back of the foil.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a couple of recommendations from a couple of barbers but the foil split in two within 2 weeks of shaving every other day. Apparently the warranty does not cover the foil which is ridiculous because the line between the two foil heads was partially perforated at the time of purchase. Looks like a design flaw or a manufacturing defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was also irritated but they recommend sticking with it for a while before your skin gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth spending another penny on this shaver.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly and can not return it . Really surprised  because I thought they are had an excellent shave</li>
            <li> As an African-American man, I&#x27;ve always wanted a smooth shave without razor bumps. Unfortunately, using a regular razor is out of the question. Using hair trimmers or clippers keep the bumps down but they just don&#x27;t cut close enough. This shaver eliminates those issues! After using it for two weeks, all I can say is thank you, Wahl. I get a smooth face with no bumps.  While it is on the loud side, the bottom line is performance and for that I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this last week, and I open the box two days ago, it seems that the head which is like the blade is doll. It cannot cut my hair. I going to have to return it.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It shaves closer then others and it holds the charge forever...</li>
            <li> What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So convenient to shave any where. Have a mirror then shave your troubles away.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAVER CLOSE ANS SMOOTH SHAVE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS SHAVER TO ANYONE THAT ENJOYS A CLOSE SHAVE, WITE EASY CLEANING ITS VERY CONVENANT</li>
            <li> Shaves my head very well.</li>
            <li> shaves well, nice size , easy to handle. recommend</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it is quick and easy and works really really well. I use them a lot and I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Does this comes with a charger</li>
            <li> The product came very fast, when using this product remember that your facial hair needs to be very short to trim down with this machine. Machine is to be use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Priced cheaper than others ! Awesome Product !</li>
            <li> Good product, it still does not remove my hair the way that I thought it was going to but it&#x27;s no biggie, I still recommend it. I still have to use my line&lt;br /&gt;rs to get the clean shave...</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED!!!!  A good close shaver - easy to use, charge, portable...does a great job quickly and no razor bumps after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!!</li>
            <li> My father is very happy with this shaver!  He said it is a good, close shave!</li>
            <li> By far the best electric razor on the market. Especially for the money 5 Stars all the way!</li>
            <li> I no longer wait for my number to be called at my barber shop. I cut and clean my own hair now. Sweet savings!</li>
            <li> Item would not charge agter 90 days use. Item had minimal use and the return was refused.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! I just got it today..will be in the mail in the morning.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have the challenge with bumps that many African-American men have (I am white), I do have crazy sensitive skin. Post shaving with any razor (electric, safety, cartridge, straight) my upper-lip and chin look like I&#x27;d rubbed them with sandpaper. I&#x27;ve tried everything I could read (hot shower, tea tree oil, fancy shave sets, etc). This has frustrated me for decades (I am in my 40s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer get razor burn! This razor is amazing. I can shave daily without pain or razor burn. It helps to read the other reviews and remember to 1. Shave daily (longer hairs won&#x27;t be cut) and 2. Don&#x27;t push. Let the razor glide along your skin without pushing it. Buy it and be glad.</li>
            <li> Arrived with a damaged outer foil, damaged inner blade. I never had the chance to use it and I do not want to.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever.  Helps a lot with Razor bumps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I prefer the razor but for someone who cannot use razor it the best shaving machine to use.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast shipping! Amazon Prime is the best! Definitely recommend upgrading to Prime Mrmbership!</li>
            <li> Great when the foil is broken. The gold foil broke pretty fast. I only used it for about 2 months before it broke on me. When it was working it did give me a clean shave with no bumps.</li>
            <li> Gold mesh cracked after the very first use. Still waiting to hear from the seller</li>
            <li> if  you  do  not  need  a  shave  ...  meaning  have  no  hair  already  ...  this  might  be  for  you&lt;br /&gt; Yes !  simply  massage  your  obsessive  compulsion  to  shave  yourself  silly  several  times  a day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  do  not  like  to  cut  the  grass  more  than  what  i  consider  to  be often  enough  .....&lt;br /&gt; but  when  i  do  decide  i  expect  a  close  shave  like  a  blade  I  want  the  thing  to  work&lt;br /&gt;the  lawn  mower  is  expected  to cut  the  grass  not  blow  hot  air  and  only  make  noise</li>
            <li> Another good wahl product. Works excellent, try not to push down hard though because goil foil can tear.</li>
            <li> It hardly does its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad. He&#x27;s elderly and this was so easy for him to use on his own and that&#x27;s important for him to have that Independence</li>
            <li> BEST FOIL SHAVER IN THE BUSINESS FOR BLACK MEN.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Impressed very close shave. 😃</li>
            <li> Really good and amazon customer service is great!</li>
            <li> Decent shaver.  I do have a little irritation and the shaver doesn’t totally remove all the hair from my face.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ used this to shave my head and it&#x27;s just as smooth as a razor and doesn&#x27;t irirtate my skin like all the other electrics I have tried</li>
            <li> i love these they cut even closer then a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied after using this product for a week.  I have struggled for years to find a shaving method that provides for a close bump free shave.  I have used clippers and other electric shavers, but they didn&#x27;t shave close enough and as I got older the hair became more difficult to cut.  I&#x27;ve tried hair removal powders which actually provided the best results BUT it was very time consuming and inconvenient which made it an unrealistic option especially as my life became busier. Then the creams which include the issues above and they were simply weak and left patches of hair.  I finally said the heck with it and used a 5 blade razor.  I just accepted that I would have to deal with razor bumps.  But after stumbling upon this product, I no longer believe razor bumps must be a part of my reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: I finally bought it after reading the positive reviews by other African Americans and watching various videos, and there are some very good ones out there.  I must say that it looks a lot better \\&quot;in person\\&quot;.  Sounds foolish but one of the reasons I didn&#x27;t want to buy it was because I thought it looked butt ugly.  For some reason the online pics don&#x27;t give it justice.  I charged it only once when I first got the product (~16 hours) and it is still going strong after a week.  The only downsides are that there is no trimmer and it is loud.  I have a trimmer so that&#x27;s not a big negative but it would be a plus if they added one.  Others have complained about the loudness and although I agree that it is MUCH louder than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s bearable.  As long as you can close the bathroom door you should be fine, otherwise you may wake up the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: I know everyone is different and I am no barber but I&#x27;ll share what has worked for me so far. I begin with washing my face with an exfoliator.  Then I apply a thin layer of baby powder on my face to ensure my face is dry and allow the shaver to glide easily across my face. I begin shaving by pulling my skin tight while gliding the shaver over my face.  I do not apply pressure and I move in an up and down motion in the same area until I can no longer hear the razor cutting my hair.  Once I&#x27;m done I wash my face with a cleanser and pat dry my face.  At times a little touch up is need with a trimmer (I have some very stubborn gray hairs).  Finally I apply an aftershave balm and I&#x27;m done...looking as fly as a middle age man could be.  I tried using it on my head but either I didn&#x27;t have the patience to do a good job or I have too many nooks and crannies on my scalp because there were too many patches of hair.  I will continue to use a 5 blade razor on my head since that works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.  After about 20 years of trying different shaving methods, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found the answer.  Big thanks to Wahl for addressing the issue and providing an affordable solution.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t do more to promote the product.</li>
            <li> Hello, This is one of the most sorry and bad shavers I ever bought in my life time  I have never used a shaver that will not even cut my facial hair if it is long or short  I would like to know if there is any way that I can get my money back for this sorry  ass shaver and I will never purchase any Wahl products never again in my life time.  I have never been so disgusted and not pleased with any other shaver that I have ever purchased  as with this product.    Disgusted and Very Unhappy</li>
            <li> This shaver is a very close shave and works quite nicely.  It definitely is an upgrade from a razor and it doesn&#x27;t give me as many bumps on my face.  However, if there is one drawback it would be that sometimes even after running over the same spot on your face not all the hairs will be shaved off.  Other than that it is a very solid shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  I wear a bald head and sometimes don&#x27;t have time to cut my hair with my clippers. I grab the 5 star shaver and 5 minutes i&#x27;m done.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. He really likes the close shave for a smooth, clean, look. I love the way his face feels.</li>
            <li> i first I want to apologise cause I wrote a really bad review regarding this product. I ordered it 2 years ago.I tried it for 2 weeks an it didnt improve my razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend I run out of blades and decided to give it another shot. This time i int press the shaver over my skin I just let it glide slightly over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It wasnt the closest of the sahve cause I ha some extra long haird that I coulnt remove with my clipper.The main reason for me to try again this shaver was my clipper running out of charge. But Im glad I did cause my skin ahs been clear for 2 days after using this.&lt;br /&gt;Im biracial with very sensitive light skin an very curly african hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate shave with a clipper an then give a fast shave with this with no pressuer at all.youll be surprised. I think the trick is this machine doesnt pull the hair and doesnt cut it too short below skin BUT use very light pressure.If you press it on your skin against the grain you will have irritation just like a blade.&lt;br /&gt;I dont give it 5 stars because Im still testing it but it can easily get to 5 stars. I dont know but my beard seems to grow softer to teh touch not as strong kinky after using this</li>
            <li> I reall Like this shaver, I have been looking for a shaver that will help my sensitive condition.  I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I was hoping something made in the USA would be good unfortunately this one was not. The screen was messed up when I received it and it does not cut all of the hairs on my neck. I have to use a second razor to finish my neck. I also have another model of their shaver and it is the same way.</li>
            <li> I used this once and INSTANTLY fell in love. Its power is so strong it cuts super close! I have been unfortunately blessed to have facial hair grow overnight! This shaver is great for an everyday use! I highly recommend this to ANY man.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have had in years! Motor would drive a truck! I have a heavy beard but it cuts right through it easily! I was concerned because so many guys &amp;#34;of color&amp;#34; loved it and was worried that it may not work for a white dude. Don&#x27;t worry! It works great! I may not dance very well and I can&#x27;t dunk but I get a great shave! I guess you  could call it an equal opportunity shaver!</li>
            <li> Great for cutting bald...Zero razor bumbs on my head or neck after the first month of usage. I have done my head, neck and face in 20 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few weeks now and I am completely satisfied. I would even venture to say that this shaver is essential  whether you are a barber or just looking for personal care. This shaver will leave you babyface smooth! Your clients will really enjoy this product too. It leaves a clean, polished look and it doesn&#x27;t snag skin or hair. It is super powerful and if there is one thing you can bet on with Wahl is that this thing will surely hold a charge! Easily buy with confidence. I hope this helps</li>
            <li> It sucks don&#x27;t waste your money has no power and stopped working correctly less than a week after I got them.</li>
            <li> Does the job well without pressure</li>
            <li> A professional shaver that can be used for you face as well as your head. Works well on either. Now you know what all the smart looking clean shaven heads got their look from. Look no further than Wahl. You will seal the replacement blades for this shaver above.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with my T-outliner&#x27;s for over 10 years and these take the cake. This is the closest shave on my face and my head that I have ever had. When I first got these I used my T-outliner&#x27;s first to fet it low and then finished with the 8601&#x27;s, man believe the hype. Once this is don you can shave every day and if you skip a couple of days of shaves use T-outliner&#x27;s and complete with the 8601&#x27;s. No skin irritation or bumbs, this is an awesome product, when using don&#x27;t press too hard just lightly smooth strokes. Check out the videos on Wahl&#x27;s website ans well as YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> Only Gets the SMALLEST hairs. I thought I could use this to shave every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money for me.am nt going to use it again.cus it messed up my bearld and didnt cut cut low and smoothly as I expected it wud be I regret ever buyIng dis type of shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my second wahl 8061 shaver. My other one lasted about 4 years but something broke on inside while traveling and stopped working. I will admit that the foil is somewhat cheap and may need to be replace every now and then (maybe in 1-2 years, depends on your care of product) but for the quality of the shave - that&#x27;s minor. I recommend this for any man that dont like razors, like me. It&#x27;s recommended for black men (which I am) but I&#x27;m sure whites, other ethnics would benefit also.&lt;br /&gt;Update - it&#x27;s doesnt have the pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I shave my full head and beard daily. The Wahl 5-star deserves 5 stars. I&#x27;m buying a replacement after many years of daily service, my kids knocked it on the floor and the foil broke and plug receptacle was damaged. Glad to pay the money again, it&#x27;s well worth it. I have to replace the foil and cutter every 6 months or so, just like with my other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I also have a Braun 5 series and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close or as quickly as this Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much gone with a beard or a 5 o&#x27; clock shadow since I was a teen due to my first few encounters with razor bumps.  Female friends have often remarked that my face feels like sandpaper. lol. Even when I would get shaved with a straight razor at the barber shop, I would still end up with a few bumps and my skin would be dry and irritated.  After hearing and reading all the reviews, I bought one of these.  This is the smoothest my face has ever been since I started growing facial hair.  As the other reviews stated, you don&#x27;t have to press hard but you do have to trim it down first.  I do the outline with an Andis outliner, clean up with this, and then moisturize.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge to start using it.</li>
            <li> Works great but it is too damn loud! Can&#x27;t use it early mornings when I wake up for fear of not waking my roommate with this noisy shaver.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased 3 (THREE) of these shavers. The latest I&#x27;ve owned for less than 60 days and it&#x27;s already broken. I will not be purchasing a 3rd. I failed to operate when it&#x27;s off of the power cord - at least the last one did this. The latest unit fails to operate when I hold it horizontally. Unbelievable. I would be very careful about purchasing this item. I&#x27;ve NEVER written an Amazon review before but I&#x27;m fed up with this product. It offers a great cut but it does me no good if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The shaper&#x27;s screen was defective and broken at the corner... it could have been quite dangerous as the broken edges were sharp and could have cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the merchant was very understanding and took it back with a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone. I wonder how others consumers could rate this product as highly as they did in the reviews that I read prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> My clippers gives me a closer shave and it costs less. Absolute Waste of money. Never ever buy this product.</li>
            <li> Price was great but the produced didn&#x27;t cut me close enough. Was expecting a lot close shave but all it did was nipple the hairs a little bit.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Bump Free Shave&amp;#34; not a chance. This shaver left razor bumps and scratches (it looked like my head had been scratched by an animal) I would not buy it</li>
            <li> Just needed to get the pre electric shave and minimal bumps. If you are looking to save money and get a great product I recommend this. I learned about this product from my barber and have been hooked since.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 50 years old and have tried just about  every shaver on the market. and this one is by far is superior to ANY OTHER .for the price also what a steal.would reccomened to all my family and freinds..</li>
            <li> This was a gift so cant coomplain to much.&lt;br /&gt;BUT Whal&#x27;s lack of updated instructions and online details is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;there is no trimmer on shaver.&lt;br /&gt;If i let my beard grow 2 days this shaver will not shave it all.  My beard is not fast growing so i may not shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say if your beard is more than 1/32 of an inch use trimmer first. thats .031 thousandths or less than 1mm.(WHAT)&lt;br /&gt;OH Ya wheres the trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;Whal let us down on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over a year now and am very happy with it.  It is very powerful....much more powerful than a Braun 3 series which I also own.  However, its also very loud.  I actually wear earplugs sometimes when I use it.  It gives a very close shave, I&#x27;d say just as close as a blade, but it will only work on stubble or very short beard growth.  You really have to use it everyday, otherwise you need to trim your beard down beforehand.  I&#x27;ve always been prone to razor bumps/burn but I rarely get any at all with this shaver.</li>
            <li> At purchase, the web-site stated shaver was both &amp;#34;Corded &amp; Cordless&amp;#34;.  This turned out to be not the way it is.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl shaver; the first one I bought is the Wahl 4000 shaving system which I also purchased on Amazon. The 4000 is still going strong with no problems, I just wanted a back up/travel shaver and this one fit the bill. The 5 Star and 4000 are interchangeable a far as the foil heads and cutter blades, so when I buy replacements, they fit both shavers, which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the seller and the poor packing during shipping. The contents were not packed securely and when I opened the box containing the shaver, it had been tossed around and displaced due to not being secured within the box it was shipped in. So far, the shaver seems to be working fine, but it&#x27;s still early. Wahl makes sturdy, quality products so I am hopeful there won&#x27;t be any issues.</li>
            <li> This is the first Razor that I&#x27;ve ever had to cut as close as this pair does. I heard about them from a guy on facebook and thought i would give them a try. They arrived on time charged them for 24hrs and my first use was great better than a disposable razor to me</li>
            <li> As an African-American military member, this is the closet shaver I have found that does not leave my face with ingrownhairs two days later. I am very impressed with it.  I used to use Wahl beard trimmers turned upside down, and sometimes the BumpStopper razors.  This is, by far, the best product for a very, very close shave and yet no razor bumps.  If only it cost a little less, I would like to buy them as a Xmas gift for every professinal black men in my family.</li>
            <li> You will not get bumps unless you are pressing the shaver into your skin. After I shave with my andis T liners I simply run the shaver over my kneck and face. I do not press it into my skin because then I will get pumps. That happened once so I used DuDu Osun black soap and let my kneck air dry. I also pulled the hairs in and around the bump then let my face wolf for 2 weeks. The bumps were gone after that.</li>
            <li> I love Wahl shavers and this one produces a great shave at a reasonable price. It loses one star only because the battery is not replaceable. Once the battery inside it loses its ability to hold a charge, you have to throw it away and buy a new one. However, that being said, my last Wahl shaver gave me a close reliable shave for 3 1/2 years before giving up the ghost. A reasonable length of time, however, re-engineered with a replaceable battery and these shavers might last for ten years before needing to be replaced and at that point would then certainly rate FIVE STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver foils for these electric razors come in close, super close, and sensitive skin versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion I have for those of you who want the ultimate in a smooth close shave, buy the gold plated Wahl hypoallergenic shaver foils. They glide over your skin eliminating the skin irritation that can sometimes accompany a close shave when using an electric razor. However, if it&#x27;s your first time, be careful - press too hard and you can nick yourself. With time, however, you&#x27;ll learn exactly how much pressure to use.</li>
            <li> The best shaver in the game.  Shaves very close and I highly recommend.  No razor stubble, just very close clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor I use now.  I had an older version Wahl before and liked it; this one is even better thus far.  I tried a Norelco for a while and find the Wahl gives a much closer shave and works much faster.</li>
            <li> My husband has never been really satisfied with any shavers but this. It cuts perfectly, however the pushing up the cutter part could be easier. Even with this minor problem he is the most satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I had always thought that to get a close enough shave I&#x27;d forever have to use a razor, this shaver shaper changed that and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT...SMOOTH SHAVE...EASY TO USE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR AN AFFORDABLE CLOSE SHAVE, PUMP THE BRAKES&lt;br /&gt;YOU FOUND IT!!!</li>
            <li> Good razer delivered on time</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact little razor. I have nothing bad to say about it. I have just moved on to a safety razor. It&#x27;s a lot simpler, lasts a life time, and doesn&#x27;t require much money for replacement pieces.</li>
            <li> Long time and it works yet.  I have the time for the maintenance.  So I take care of it. Go.</li>
            <li> Have been an owner of this product for several  years. Needed a replacement. Product is adequate. Still, at times, I need to use a regular razor to get a smoother shave. Electric shavers aren&#x27;t perfect, but this one will be quite serviceable.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to compare it to but it works great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts well</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work hair needs to be very short and even then it still takes forever to shave a mans face</li>
            <li> It may be the texture of my hair, so close but no cigar.  Good Luck.  Fast delivery, but my skin was sensitive to this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  Used it as recommended but face still bumped.  Had to go back to straight razor. Plus it seem as if it took forever to ship.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with Wal Mart from now on.</li>
            <li> Best shaver in the market for years this been in the top seller&#x27;s by barber shop I was looking for a non allergenic foil shaver and this one is the chosen one.</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy. This shaver gets almost as close as a wet shaver. I use it when in a hurry and when I wear a white shirt, no stains.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a paramilitary job training, which i have to shave every morning for inspections. I&#x27;m African American, with ingrown hair Shaving issues. My routine follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed all my ingrowns with tweezers first, then used the Andis Outliner edgers, then the Wahl shavers to clean any remaing stubbles (going over areas no more than twice, excessive usages in the same area irritates the skin), rubbing alcohol, finally applyin bumpstopper sensitive skin twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;Less ingrowns and less skin irritation. I really think the ingrowns removal check before shaving is really important. I recommend the Wahl, but don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% bump free, it depends on your hair/skin, everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars for a few reason. First it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that other reviews gave it, I have only used this product twice because before I ever put it on my head it used it on my beard and it barely removed any hair. Secondly after using my clippers to bring my head hair down to a acceptable length to be cut with Wahl. Wahl didn&#x27;t delivery and I had to turn to my barber to shave it down completely. Lastly after using the wahl for the first time the gold foils had two noticeable cracks in them so in conclusion I am disappointed by this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. on a lighter note the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down from the other Wahl shavers that I have had. Flimsy.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, shipped fast and works great as intended.</li>
            <li> Avesome! Thanks a lot! Super Great Seller! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver performs better than most expensive electric shavers. This will definitely help prevent razor bumps and provide a closer shave than using regular trimmers.</li>
            <li> This product is used as an add on to a trimmer, since it only cuts short hair. You must use a trimmer to get the hair you want to cut short enough for the 5 star to work correctly. However, the 5 star shaver will take off all your facial hair and leave you with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would get closer but can&#x27;t complain about the price</li>
            <li> This seller sold this junk razor to me</li>
            <li> had to replace the heads twice in less than 6 months and then in less than 8 months quit working completely</li>
            <li> This meets all of my expectations. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Awesome, bout 5 for  my groomsmen they love it</li>
            <li> Opened it .. Plugged it in for the day.  It would not work.  I let it charge all weekend.  I will see tomorrow if it works</li>
            <li> Does a very good job.</li>
            <li> The worst product i&#x27;ve ever bought in my life, a single star would be a complement, it disn&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks and i did use only twice and it broke on me in tge second time i was using it, i didn&#x27;t keep the original packing that&#x27;s why i had to toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is a great and easy to use clipper. I have had no problems out of it, and it gives you the razor look.</li>
            <li> This thing does a good job,just follow the YouTube,instructions,and not press to hard against your skin,and it works well. May take a few times for skin to adjust, then it&#x27;s smooth shaving,strong motor,a lil  loud but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, besides a few stubborn hairs here and there, the machine does the job. I&#x27;ve noticed that after a while the stubborn hairs are easily eliminated, so have patientience and enjoy a very close shave without the bumps.</li>
            <li> returned . was wrongly ordered</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s just that you have to apply force in order for it to work well. My fiancé had to press it really hard to his skin for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> The shaver works very well with short hairs not a full beard. The best part is that it shaves the corners near the nose and the corner of the mouth without cutting them like the razors.</li>
            <li> The shaver 5000 did a great gob.the shaver cuts very good and close. Once you get use to the shaver it leaves your face very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and extremely close shave!  I would recommend this razor to everyone.  Just be mindful, it is for very short stubble.. not for normal shaving.</li>
            <li> They put all this stuff about how you have to give it weeks...LIES! This thing just dried my face out and gave one of the worst shaves ever! I bought it because my barber recommended it as a way to keep my head bald but it gave poor results their as well. Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money or time. It costs too much to work so poorly on my face/head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He LOVES IT!!!!!!! This turned out to be a real good product. He was pretty happy with the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> Eventually started to or irritate my skin. I bought some electric shave lotions which helped some. I&#x27;m now back to my good ole razor</li>
            <li> I had to down grade to the 8061 instead of the 8547 because of a terrible seller CBS express, but Amazon worked with me and got me this one the 8061. I have no complaints on product nice clean shave very happy.</li>
            <li> I use the Wahl to shave my head.  I provides the closest shave of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve owned over the last several years.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my African American husband, did not work well at all.  The shave was very sporatic.  Ended up having to return.  Not sure how it works for other hair types.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; that this razor is supposed to provide is non-existent. I received my Wahl shaver 3 days ago, and I&#x27;m already disgusted with it&#x27;s poor performance. I&#x27;m writing this review after printing out my return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an African-American male, with only mildly coarse facial hair. I prefer a clean cut close shaved look, but like most African-American men I suffer from razor bumps. Generally, I use my Andies t-liner to line everything up. And then I decided to go over my face with the Wahl shaver, and needless to say it was a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lacks power &amp; misses many hairs, especially when using it unplugged with a full charge. It is slightly more powerful plugged in. However, ultimately the coils feel cheap. And there are an abundance of missed hairs, even after going over my face multiple times (which is NOT GOOD practice for people who get razor bumps), but I really wanted this shaver to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble - Trust Me!</li>
            <li> Took the wrapper off and turn it own without the charger and started shaving...............I was impressed.  I have owned Phillips, Norelco and this Wahl is sharp.  And power to spare.  Real easy, light weight and works great.</li>
            <li> This Product did not work for me. It left me with dozens of razor bumps even after the so called break-in period.  Did not cut well either. My be the users fault though. Just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My fiancé has sensitive skin and will not buy anything else! Hopefully, this model of shaver doesn&#x27;t end up being replaced or re-designed any time soon.</li>
            <li> It works great! There are times when the shave doesn&#x27;t get everything. Other then that its a perfect shaver for quick buzz</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an electric shaver because to help me when I am on the road or on a business trip. I can only say that it works wonders for me maybe a slightly different for everyone else but great for me.  It&#x27;s easy to charge and compact for traveling, awesome product.</li>
            <li> It works well.  I like it a lot.  It gets the job done and Shaves nice and close and I will probably get more items from Wahl.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my 92 year old father in law who insist Wahl is the only product that can give him the shave he likes.  I must admit it does handle the wrinkled face and gives him a clean shave.  There is much wisdom in our elders</li>
            <li> Actually after using this shaver for a couple of years, I can&#x27;t say enough bad about it. Low quality. Noisy, noisy, noisy. Very pricey for what you get, oh and did I mention how noisy this little POS is? No trimmer is a poor design. Foil only lasted about 15 hours of total shave time. I used to have a Remington shaver of much better quality for a third this price. Dropped it while moving. Wish I stockpiled more of those. Oh well, the search continues for a decent shaver. Why can&#x27;t anyone make a decent shaver?!!?!?!?!?!?!?</li>
            <li> This was one of the best gifts I bought for my husband. He loves it and I love that he loves the shaver.</li>
            <li> Fully charged it works for days, very very close shave and fast much better than my old Remington triple header</li>
            <li> GARBAGE! If I could give this product a negative star I would. False adadvertisement, I hate when something doesn&#x27;t work the way it claims to. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Close and clean shave!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver only.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a flip~up trimmer/shaper.  You cannot shape anything with a shaving foil. Earlier models look the same but had a trimmer on the back side for shaping sideburns etc.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly, looks, works, and operates as advertised, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> clean,cool quick, and smooth-----the best buy I made in 2014</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item, i don&#x27;t want to make it seem like im mad mouthing the item. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does give you one of the best shaves ever but its not bump free as described.  I tried the item several times hoping that my skin would get used to it but instead i started getting bumps all over my face. I started getting ingrown hairs, something I&#x27;ve never had before. I ended up returning the product for false advertisement. Although everyone may experience different results with this item, unfortunately i was on the short end of the stick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend after buying shaver after shaver. He said that his barber uses this exact one and it doesn&#x27;t give him bumps. However, when he shaves himself he still gets them. So, I don&#x27;t know if his barber knows something we don&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other shaver to me.</li>
            <li> This is a poor replacement for my Remington ES-1000 Ultra Smooth slot electric razor which is discontinued. I&#x27;m white but my facial hair tends to curl right back into my skin. I&#x27;m not looking for a close shave because of ingrown hairs,however this Wahl shaver misses so many hairs I have to use a trimmer prior to using it. I suspect instead of the hair going into slots to be cut(like my remington) it has to pass thru the mesh holes on the Wahl. I used my Remington for years without missing random hairs and at a quarter of the time it takes to use this Wahl with no ingrown hairs. Remington please bring the slot razor back.</li>
            <li> nice shaver. i asked my brother whats a shaver to buy and he said wahl is good choice and when i asked why he told me thats a brand that barbers trust. i never use to shave so this is my first shaver... i would rate it 5 stars but i dont know much about shavers. all i can say is that it gets the job done... nice close shave!</li>
            <li> After a couple of shaves your face gets used to the closeness.  You will need another shaver to clear the longer hairs, this shaver is for the very small, close stubble. Your face will be real smooth in the end.</li>
            <li> Outstanding performance, close and clean shave, good product! I would recommend this shaver, holds a good charge, no need to recharge as often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun customer for some time now and would always go back to the blade for a close shave now &amp; then.  Then I bought a Wahl personal groomer, that included a small screen for &amp;#34;tidy up&amp;#34; small jobs.  One day I used the personal groomer, with the shaving attachment, to shave my whole face.  I was amazed that the shave was as close as a blade shave.  That is when I picked out the Wahl Professional 8061 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;No more Braun, no more blades -- this shaver has a powerful motor and shaves very close with little effort.  Even the replacement foil &amp; blade is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;There may be other shavers that shave as close -- but, for me, the Wahl shaver is a quality, well-built product that gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric razor; Braun, Norelco, Remington.  I just wish I had known about Wahl shavers sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy.  Works great.  Never break out.  If your someone like me that like a closer shave without using a blade.  Then this product is def for you.  Simple maintenance will have this guy last forever.  Battery last forever.</li>
            <li> Amazing machine!! So easy to use, helps clear all razor bumps, and very durable. Do yourself a favor and pick one of these babies up.</li>
            <li> Great shaver but lacking sideburn trimmer..</li>
            <li> great for close shave.</li>
            <li> Car exceeded my expectations, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves GREAT but is kind of loud.&lt;br /&gt;😊</li>
            <li> With a name like \\&quot;Shaver/Shaper\\&quot; one is led to believe that this shaver has a built-in trimmer for shaping.  Sadly, the place on the back where the trimmer *was* on older models, has been filled in with a blank piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new one of these. He loves the brand. Worked out perfectly. This was a replacement to his current one that got old.</li>
            <li> By far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used my trimmer/edger to take the hair down very low on my head and to line up my beard. Then used the shaver to clean everything up! Best shave I have had in years!!! Did not irritate my face at all!!! I would highly recommend this shaver to all my friends and family! Wish I could include a picture. Oh yeah, works best on hair that is less than 1/16\\&quot; the users manual recommends 1/32\\&quot;. You should not have to press extremely hard to get a close shave. Just the weight of your hand back and forth with very gentle strokes. Just realized I can include a video, I will do so next time!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wahl Professional 8061 shavers for the past 6 years because it is an awesome product. It is very easy to use with very little maintenance. Best when you pre-shave with a clipper then finish with the Wahl 8061 5-star series shaver. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a really clean bump free shave.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced. Provides a very close shave. Runs a long time between charges. Easy to clean and replace blades. A bit loud and has no trimmer but overall, a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> 5-Star is right .. this is the most amazing shaver I have ever used.  I had it used on me when I was driving a semi several years ago and was impressed and now that I found it and have it I LOVE LOVE LOVE it .. if you are like me and want to keep you head or face smooth then this is the way to do it .. it get&#x27;s your face and head as smooth as if you had used a razor on it but without the razor bumps :-)</li>
            <li> The one flaw this product has is that the foil breaks or flakes off to easy I have to purchase a new screen every other month. It does its job of cutting super close but I  would of  given it  5 stars if the  screen didn&#x27;t  always break.</li>
            <li> I have a barbed wire beard.  I have used all shaver brands.  I bought a new Braun in February that ran, but didn&#x27;t shave.  My older Braun had worked OK, but it eventually wore out.  The new Braun 320s-4 is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought a Wahl 8061, and followed the directions.  It works well, and fast.  My only complaint is it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> Just like my barber&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best $50 I have ever spent!!!  I&#x27;m an African-American male and always wanted the clean smooth bald head but couldn&#x27;t get it because with a razor I would get bumps everywhere.  I had been using the Andis Outliner clippers to cut my hair really low but it&#x27;s not the same as a smooth bald head.  A good friend of mine told me about this product and I was a little apprehensive based on the price but I couldn&#x27;t be happier I bought it!!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and gives me the smooth shaven head I&#x27;ve craved without the bumps.  I don&#x27;t even know how it works and honestly don&#x27;t care!  I love it!!!  Buy one ASAP!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my face and neck and no problems with razor bumps whatsover!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my young adult with down syndrome to teach him how to shave himself.  It did not shave a hair on his face nor did it shave a hair on my arm or any other member of my family.  I immediately returned the item to the seller, they have received the item and my account still is not been credited almost 2 month later.  I won&#x27;t mention this product is not even supposed to be sold or shipped to California don&#x27;t know why but..</li>
            <li> Terrible product, ripped the skin on my father&#x27;s face, had to be returned.</li>
            <li> Got to be the loudest shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. But great shave especially if you shave every day. No razor burn. Close shave. Like all foil razors though, if you skip shaving a day or two, got to be careful.</li>
            <li> This device was pictured differently than what was actually received; specifically the one pictured has a trimmer on the back and the one received does not making the shaver less than ideal.</li>
            <li> My Barber been using it on me for years, for my bald head....  Dosent work fast you must make mulitple passes, but dang it works great, my head is clean and smooth after 7-8 minutes,  Works better if your hair is very short, long stble gives it a small problem, it cuts it, but takes longer...&lt;br /&gt;If your bald, you will love it</li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst investments I&#x27;ve made to date, this razor did nothing but pull the hairs on my face.  It didn&#x27;t matter whether the hair was short or long, wet or dry - nothing but painful pulling every time.  Maybe it is just my facial hair.  Practically unusable.  Yes the motor is powerful.  Five or six times over a small area and I may have gotten a decent shave out of it, but my face would have looked like WWIII after.  Just terrible.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave, however just after one use we had to buy a new head for it because it cracked. We bought one after a barber in the family suggested it. The barber also said he has problems with the head cracking and has bought two heads in the past six months that he has had it......</li>
            <li> Wahl, please make a flat head shaver like the es 1000 remington stopped making and you can dump this foil shaver for black men which doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Experience was good however the product was not what I thought.  Doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all.</li>
            <li> This shaver is powerful and gives me a close shave on a tough beard.Holds a charge for a long time and seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;Leave my face feeling smooth although sometimes a bit sore in spots but not enough to complain much. The only negative so far is that it is noisy. Perhaps that is the only way to make shave so well as I have had many quiet shavers that didn&#x27;t shave nearly so close.I would definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> Great finish shaver.  Does as close as a razor with no bumps.  I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Its good not the greatest but it does the job. One thing I didnt like it&#x27;s to loud I wake up my wife everytime I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> We got this shaver recommended by a professional. We weren&#x27;t sure, we were replacing a $200 electric razor so spending so little worried me. The man using this razor is 83 years old. He loves it and says it&#x27;s the best razor he has ever owned.  I would totally recommend this razor. Great gift!</li>
            <li> I guess I gave this a 3 out of 5 because my expectations were set by the barber that I went to. He told me that this would get my head shaven to the skin. It did as he claimed. I expected it to be able to substitute it for my regular wahl balding clippers and andis shaver. It will not but it is a good supplementary shaver and will keep the head smooth. One will need to use it daily in order to maintain that smoothness to the touch. The good thing about it is that it is portable so you can take it while on a trip. If expectations are set accordingly, it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> does a good job. I wish I had looked for one with a edger on it as well as it is hard to get a straight line with it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the 5 star shaver. My face dose&#x27;nt bump up like it use 2 thanks 2 this product. I guest that&#x27;s y they call it a 5 star shaver. Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely Q.Clark</li>
            <li> So far so good ! Ordering items from iPad has been difficult especially because amazons website makes it very difficult to order 1 item</li>
            <li> But not all that though... it I expected to have me smooth but just makes me look smooth to the common eye.</li>
            <li> IT ONLY SHOULD BE USED FOR CLOSE SHAVING.  GREAT FOR A BALD LOOK, IF YOU USE IT EVERY DAY.  IT IS WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable battery stopped working two weeks after I got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but the top is keeping break</li>
            <li> Great product. Exceeded my expectations. Cuts extremely close without a lot of effort. Doesn&#x27;t cut my moles and the battery charges quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After 5 uses the metal meah broke and is now unusable.  When it did work it was great.  I just find it sad that the device broke.</li>
            <li> the shaver only works when you shave with the .t. outline clippers then you apply it otherwise it would not get the hair out. if you do that then it would work fine</li>
            <li> just wanted to ssay that i&#x27;m glad i purchased this shaver. i get my head shaved and my barber uses this same model to finish off my haircut. used it on my face to see the results and i am very happy. it gives a very close shave . razor close!</li>
            <li> This Shaver is a very good performing shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It holds its charge for a very long time. I shave about every 2 days or so and I have to re-charge this about every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I always get SUPER-CLOSE SHAVES with the Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my hair short and my beard close, this works good on shaving the neck, and around your beard if you have one. Your hair has to be pretty short when using this razor because it DOES NOT have a Pop-Up Trimmer like other Electric Razors.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you keep your hair pretty short (which I always do) you will NEVER have a problem with this Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Very Good Performing Shaver in my opinion and you will NEVER receive Razor-Bumps if you Shave Correctly.(that is not Pressing TOO-HARD and just letting the Shaver do the work for you)&lt;br /&gt;Definately Worth the $$$&lt;br /&gt;I would buy one again If I needed to.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of bad reviews and the main reason for this is because these people are not knocking down the hair with an Andis T-outliner, Superliner or Style Liner 1 or 2 FIRST . You can NOT use this product alone to shave. This is only ment for fine hairs to get you a close shave only after shaving with one of the above mentioned. So yes you have to buy another trimmer for 50 bucks or so but it is worth it . After using tons of shavers this is the only way to get it close with out bumps . Look up videos on Youtube or go to your local barber and ask how to use it ...  You will see for yourself ...  Only buy from respected sellers and you wont get used or broken items. Once again i cant stress how good of a product this is.</li>
            <li> the product broke after the very first use</li>
            <li> I did not know these were still available.</li>
            <li> Wahl has great shavers and this 5 star is good for what i bought it for, but the 4000 wahl shaver is excellent.</li>
            <li> Too loud. But smooth shave, takes few weeks to get used to  skin</li>
            <li> A very good investment</li>
            <li> the battery is long duration, it is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very narrowly-focused product. My barber uses this as a finishing touch on bald fades, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot for mornings I don&#x27;t feel like shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it out this morning on about 5 days worth of stubble. As other reviewers have said, it did literally nothing. I&#x27;m guessing this product is only good for 24 hours worth of stubble, as it was too weak/dull to do anything on real scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quality, I wish I had purchased the Andis version. With my other grooming tools, I&#x27;ve always found Andis to be of higher quality than Wahl. Actually scratch that - I wish I just didn&#x27;t buy this altogether. Maybe it will prove useful on finer hair for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Product works and looks great</li>
            <li> I have a fairly standard Caucasian beard but I do not care for blade razors, simply too much paraphernalia involved and wasted time.  I have used many brands of electric razors and they all seem to leave that &#x27;&#x27;need a shave&#x27;&#x27; feeling; however, this Wahl does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do... a good smooth, clean shave.  As for edge trimming use a blade, it takes all of 15 seconds and do it dry.  Its only fault (and a small ones at that) is it&#x27;s LOUD, sounds like a two-cycle lawn mower and on a hard surface it&#x27;ll vibrate and move about like a drunken hamster.  In summation, it&#x27;s a very good razor, just don&#x27;t let it wander off on its own.</li>
            <li> Speedy Seller! I love this product!</li>
            <li> That item doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> The Wahl 8061 is virtually identical to the Wahl 4000 shaver. The 8061 is maroon instead of silver and the trimmer has been eliminated. You can use the same replacement combs and cutters on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third Wahl for me. The 2nd one is still working but is now making vibrating noises so I did not wait for it to die and bought this replacement. I’ve used both the Close and Super Close combs and liked them both. No skin burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave while leaving it plugged in. It recharges during the day and I unplug at night. Perhaps this is why they last so long for me. I don’t press hard against my face while shaving and that seems to make the combs last for years. I’ve taken the Wahl to Europe and used a converter/transformer without any problems.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Priced OK.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this shaver when my barber used it to trim my facial hairs.  I noticed how smooth my face felt.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Best close shaver out there! Great for military!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  Though I am Caucasian and not African-American, I get &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; from ingrown hairs that curl over.  This is by far the best razor I have tried to shave off these curly hairs before the become ingrown.  These razors are not easy to find, and I&#x27;m mystified that they are not more popular.</li>
            <li> a great quality item. I am very satisfied with purchase. best of all it is Made in USA. Be American, Buy American.</li>
            <li> A clean smooth shave, worth the price.</li>
            <li> This Wahl does give a close shave, but greatly irritated my skin and left my face burning. I tried it a number of times but always had the same result thus I couldn&#x27;t continue using it. I gave it to my son and it did the same to him. I have used a Braun for many years and never had this problem. I then bought a Braun to replace this Wahl.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband after he somehow broke the previous one. It was the exact same one but he paid about 30 dollars more than I. He really has no hair bumps at all. His line of requires no facial hair. Many African American men do not like shaving due to the  increase of irratating hair bumps. But this particular shaver has his face looking amazing, smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li> said it is exactly what he wanted, and item lives up to its expectations.  not only does it prevent bumps, it can also be used to shave head, as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 19 yr old son. He LOVES it. He&#x27;s stopped using a razor and only uses this now. It gives him a nice clean shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Specs: 30 year old African American male who shaves every day.  This shaver never really cuts all of the hairs on my face and neck.  It cuts most of my beard, but undoubtedly there will always be some remaining hairs.  Going back over those areas of my face that it misses with his shaver is futile, as the shaver appears unable to reach certain contours of my face and neck.  I have to supplement this shaver with my edger.</li>
            <li> Shave a piece of junk.  Broke after two weeks it fell apart and I read some of the reviews that claimed that very thing, but my husband wanted to try it and thought just maybe that person had gotten a lemon.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about buying this shaver since it&#x27;s the same one my barber uses and he highly recommended it. Problem is after two shaves the motor sounded like its getting bound up and the only way I can use it is to squeeze where the on off button is. It was a close shave ( the two I got out of it ) and cheap price but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver to anybody.</li>
            <li> THIS  IS THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE USED, ALL THE BARBERS  THAT I USE HAVE IT  . AMAZON HAS THE LOWEST PRICE. AT OTHER PLACES THEY ARE 75.00 AND UP EVEN THE LOCAL BEAUTY AND BARBER SHOP.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG IF YOU WANT A CLEAN SHAVE THAT LAST FOR DAYS , NO SKIN IRATATIONS. GREAT PRODUCT.  I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Provides close shaves. A little noisy but performance up to par. The battery life is not that great but adequate.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver that I have ever bought. Prior to using this I was using the Electric Braun shaver that I bought here on Amazon for $200, and this Wahl cuts CLOSER THAN THE $200 Braun!!!!!! I work in an office that is very formal and I have to shave just about every day in order to look professional. This shaver takes me about 1 minute to completely shave my face and neck. My faces feels as smooth as if I used a straight razor against the grain!  The reason why I bought this was because my barber used it to clean up my face when I got a haircut and I could not believe how close of a shave it was. I would HIGHLY Recommend this product to anyone who shaves very often and in a hurry who doesn&#x27;t always have time to lather heir face with shaving cream and use a straight razor every morning. Thank you wahl! (I paid $50 for this and it is much better than the $200 Braun). THIS IS A MUST HAVE GROOMING TOOL FOR MEN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It left hair all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have so many electric razors and money invested I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t find this first. You won&#x27;t be disappointed this is the only reason that you use ever. You should make this a 10 star.</li>
            <li> It works fine as long as you trim it down close with a trimmer first.  My barber used this on me which is why I decided to buy one.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any razor bumps.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> the only shaver i use.  clean shave and no razor bumps</li>
            <li> It works alright. I have to run it across my face several times and use an edger to get the hair. The result can be a bit blotchy. I prefer using gilletes or a similar with the grain.</li>
            <li> When I got the product it was already open, Don&#x27;t cut close, also gave me bumps</li>
            <li> I have used and worn out many electric shavers over the years and was looking for one that would be durable, reasonably priced and of course, give me a great shave, so enter Wahl. I had heard of the company but didn&#x27;t realize they made shavers and since they are a domestic company and this model has a slew of good reviews, here I yam, as Popeye might say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at home and didn&#x27;t have any black tie dinner parties on my calendar, so I let the servants have the week off and let me beard grow to give the Wahl a decent test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performed admirably, a bit loud, as others have noted but gave me a close shave. In fact, the shaver seems powerful enough to mow the back 40 but I will probably postpone that for now as I have to repair the other mower.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it passed the girlfriend test, so what else matters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.R.

            <li> I got this because my barber recommended it. He said not to be fooled into all the marketing and expensive gimmiks or norelco and those expensive self-cleaning brands.  He said, go with the ones the barbers buy beceuase then you know it (i) lasts and (ii) works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, despite the fact that it looks like a relic from 1973, I bought it.  I&#x27;ve always hated electric shavers and this is my first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Its compact and it works without nicking the face.  No scratches and by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver - and I&#x27;ve used ones that were about 200+ dollars more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;This thing looks like its something you&#x27;d find in your grandfather&#x27;s attic after he dies.&lt;br /&gt;Its about as loud as a chainsaw. I&#x27;m serious on this one. The entire house will know when you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;Does hurt a bit when it pricks at the hairs, but they all do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIGGEST COMPLAINT:  If you don&#x27;t have perfectly straight hair and some hairs curl inwards, this will simply not get them and thus not cut them. When I was done, I noticed there were patches of random hair that looked like they had been completely unshaven. I went over it again and again but to no avail. The hair is curled and if it won&#x27;t reach the blade, there is little it can do. What I did was took a blade shaver and just shaved off the remaining straggling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was left with was an almost perfect shave without having to shave. Its a great product and especially for the price. But its not going to change your life and allow you to ditch blades any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: My barber was right, but my hair was wrong. All in all, I&#x27;d still buy it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This wont shave me. Instead it tries to polish my hide leaving it in a burning, stinging rage. I have to believe the reviewers who&#x27;ve left some pretty good comments regarding its performance. And I thought I paid enough to safely insure this product had that kind of merit? Im doing something wrong...? Gosh, gee whiz, weird beird?</li>
            <li> love it have been using wahl products for over 20 years</li>
            <li> This is a great machine, powerful and precise. My husband has very sensitive skin and could not tolerate using it on his face but uses it on his head and is very happy with it. Very close shave and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for faster head shaves that are almost razor close.</li>
            <li> Great product, provided it&#x27;s used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does precisely what it&#x27;s meant to, and cuts remarkably close. User MUST take care to use the tool correctly, and practice proper skin care and technique for maximum benefit. As always allow for 2-3 weeks adjustment for your skin. Each person&#x27;s regimen will be different--personally I shave every other day, using quality clippers to get the longer stubble and then going back over with the Shaver. Be aware that the shaver will NOT cut whiskers or any longer hairs, that&#x27;s not what this product is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to maintain and clean as well. Pretty simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> It broke within 60 days of purchase.  No mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked well upon first use.  However, after the very first use, my husband doesn&#x27;t get the results that we expected.  This shaver barely clears stubble left behind by the trimmer.</li>
            <li> closest shave ever. jus have to make sure your hair is already trimmed (cant be long at all) and go over skin gently.. if you press hard youll get razor bumps</li>
            <li> I strongly consider watching youtube videos on how to use this but when used correctly it&#x27;s awesome! I can honestly say that i achieved a razor shave with this electric shaver, with no bumps! Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I am involved in law enforcement as well as military. Both involve standard military hair cut ( High and tight). Normally I would have to shave my head half way up then fade it up for the desired look, which left me with the most painful razor bumps and ingrown hairs that turned white and looked like zits! I used this product before roll call and the result was just the same for closeness as a metal razor going against the grain on my head, only without razor bumps, ingrown hairs, etc. Great product, I recommend this product for any African American. Works great on face as well, same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is you must trim your facial hair or head with a trimmer/ clipper, otherwise hairs will be too long to cut.</li>
            <li> Husband is pleased with results.</li>
            <li> This razor offers the closest shave of any I&#x27;ve owned (rotary or foil) in the past 35 years.  Only draw back is it&#x27;s very noisy.  The close shave more than makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver and so does my husband. I bought it for his birthday and he was so excited to use it. He is military and can not shave because of his sensitive skin on his face and head. This shaver made it possible to maintain a very close face shave and clean bald head without any aweful breakouts! The key is to get on a manageable routine, brush your hair everyday so that you wont get the hair bumps. I most definitely recommend this for those men who need a clean shave without razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl shaver. My first one had a retractable trimmer on the back. The new one is quieter and the battery life so far has been better. I use the old one for the trimmer only, sure which the new one had a trimmer too!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a recommendation from my barber who uses it to clean up my sideburns.  I was really looking forward to it as I really liked the feel of it at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it was merely okay on the sideburns and cheeks and gave me the worst razor burn on my neck, even a day or two after I stopped shaving with it.  I tried being super gentle and applying barely any pressure, but it couldn&#x27;t pick up any hairs that were lying down and required multiple passes to pick up regular stubble.  I don&#x27;t know if my barber does something to make it work better, but out of the box, I did not care for this shaver and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might use it to clean up cheeks/sideburns if I miss a spot with my old shaver, but otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.  I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 63 years.  None made today are as good as the first Sunbeam that got me started using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn bristle-like neck hair that refuses the best efforts of most shavers.  The Wahl Professional, with a little effort, gives me a smoother neck than any razor I have yet tried (but I&#x27;m only 86 years old)!  I recommend it to anyone who has incorrigible neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my barber used, and I got a close, smooth shave. Ive used at least twice a wk for over 2months now. And Im impressed with the ease, cut, and smoothness of the razor. I can go over areas more than a few times. I recmd that you dont press down on it. Just let it ride over the covered areas.</li>
            <li> It worked good for a month. now it doesn&#x27;t cut my short  hair</li>
            <li> The foil covering wears out and needs replacement after only a few shaves, the foil lasted me about 2 weeks before it began showing holes. It does give a close shave, replacement foil is around $12</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle and the cut is so far so good</li>
            <li> works okay but not as expected not really close to a clean shave</li>
            <li> Good tool use it at work for balding dudes that can&#x27;t take a blade</li>
            <li> excellent Shaver I use this Strictly for my head</li>
            <li> Long story short just get a DE razor. Causes bumps and ingrown hairs on neck despite switching up technique and pressure. Does perform well on face.</li>
            <li> Product and service was as described. Still using with good results</li>
            <li> Great product. Shaving takes 3 minutes max!</li>
            <li> Good. Light and easy to clean</li>
            <li> The shaving was not clean and the product has not solved my ingrown hair problems. Everything else was fine: the delivery, the packaging, the service... I am black and thought that this shaver will be my ultimate solution :-(</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this shaver, but alas I can not.  I can&#x27;t even like it.  In the past I&#x27;ve used a couple lower end Braun shavers.  When I finally need another screen and blade replacement, I decided to start looking for another shaver.  The price on this shaver was not much more than a couple Braun screen replacements.  Plus the replacement screens for this shaver were about 60% as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver tears up my neck.  Not bad on my face and chin.  Severe razorburn on my neck every time I use it and I don&#x27;t have ultra-sensitive skin.  I have never had razorburn with any shaver in the past, and I wasn&#x27;t used to any high end shavers.  The main reason I wanted this shaver is that it was assembled in the USA, which is very important to me; even forgoing a shaver with a built in trimmer to have an American made shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using it about five times a week for over 3 months.  But it is just too uncomfortable, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  I need to get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other reason for my purchase was the more economical screen replacements.  However after reading the owners manual sheet, Wahl recommends replacing the screen every 6 months.  My old Brauns were about every 2, though they usually didn&#x27;t quite make it that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m really bummed I was so disappointed by this shaver.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver.  So much kinder to my head than regular razors and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Loved this razor to bad I dropped it the 3rd day I owned it and now waiting on parts to fix it.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product recommended by my barber. Provides a close shave and the battery stays charged for weeks. Definitely worth the price for a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> didnt like this product at all dosent get rid of razor bumps feels like it cuts your skin a little or atleast for me.</li>
            <li> Performance is not as good as advertised leaves face irritated motor or power switch keeps slowing down Poorley made product</li>
            <li> THIS shaver is crap as far as quality goes, the reason I give it 2 stars bc it will give you a close shave for the little time it last you. Another reason I dislike this is that it&#x60;s posted as professional which I know its not from it cheap feel but if you take the foil head off you&#x60;ll see the small writing in the hair pocket which tells you it&#x60;s for personal use only, so why is it advertised as professional. THE Remington F-4 790 SHAVER is the way to go great quality shaver with a pop up sharp trimmer, cord/cordless long battery life, flexible foil head, can stationary the head if you want to, had it for three yrs. now still running like new bought the wahl shaver 6 months ago already went out on me. I&#x60;M a barber and use these machines a lot and know quality when I see it, very overrated shaver.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. I have Wahl&#x27;s Balding Clippers and they have changed something with that product. The clippers do not bald. I have sent them in to Wahl two times, talked to customer service several times with no resolution. This is my second pair of clippers. Unfortunately, I dropped the first pair  I had for several years and they worked perfectly. I tried  as an alternative with no luck. Wahl: you have lost my business.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would give me a cleaner shave.  It&#x27;s close but not close enough for me.  Gotta clean it more regularly than the instructions indicate.</li>
            <li> Bad to awful shave.  It seemed to take the top layer of skin off and still left a lot of beard.  Used it once.  Poor quality not the  quality that I&#x27;m used to with  Wahl Products.</li>
            <li> Got my razer on time just like they said works great. Should have bought extra screens they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old Black man. Started shaving (mandatory) in the Marine Corps.&lt;br /&gt;This is agreat product, for many years I wore a light beard because shaving close resulted in razor bumps: even with that stinky paste. I am now getting a close shave without negative effects. My daughters tell me I look a lot younger with the close shave.  [[ASIN:B000FJ2I2O Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver Shaper]]</li>
            <li> I am in African American male without a full beard but when my stubble does grow its curly and patches and it looks terrible  and is itchy.wanted to find something that I can use to keep my face smooth and keep my partial beard shaved without using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend giving this product at least 2 weeks to get the correct shave. I usually use my andis outliners to shave my facial hair down and then follow up with applying remington face saver then the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver a must have !</li>
            <li> Junk razor, screen is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I have had my head and beard exposed to this tool by my barber and loved the results then and now that I own one, I remain in love with the tool.</li>
            <li> The foil failed the first time I used it. Doesn&#x27;t hold up to head shaving like it claims. Replacement foils are expensive compared to the over all cost.</li>
            <li> Great shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my barber used this shaver on me a few times and it provides a close nice shave.</li>
            <li> This is just what all the barbers &amp; stylist needs. Especially if you have clients who want that close shave, but there skin can&#x27;t handle the razor directly on there skin. It gets Very close as a razor, without the razor irritation...</li>
            <li> Just horrible, threw it away after one day. If I could give it 0 stars then I would. Nothing more to say than just don&#x27;t but it. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Has my head very smooth!  5stars</li>
            <li> All the barbers at the Barber shop where I get my hair cut uses this shaver. I brought one because they all were pleased with it. And now I am too. Great electric shaver for the price. Amazon has the lowest price for this shaver.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and he loves it.</li>
            <li> my shaver gives a closer  shave than w/dbl bladed razor and soap and I expect to use only it in the future</li>
            <li> My barber uses this shaver on my when I get a haircut, and it shaved so closely I went and got it myself. Closest shave of any electric shaver, and I&#x27;ve tried a few. I have thick Italian hair and have always had trouble finding a shaver that got it. Still have to go over my neck with a blade occasionally, and the fact that the whole shaver isn&#x27;t washable is why it only has a 4 star and not 5 from me. If you&#x27;re looking for an easy to clean, close dry shaver this is your best bet by far.</li>
            <li> Did a very poor job of cutting whiskers. Tried using pre-shave but still didn&#x27;t cut the whiskers. Probably the worst electric shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have use many rechargeable shavers in the past.  None with the close shave and long lasting battery life of this product!!  I am Very Pleased with the Wahl Professional 8061!!</li>
            <li> i had expected it to work better based on the reviews. I went to a barbour and got a haircut and shave from a trimmer. I then tried to get a close shave from my machine but instead i got bad bumps. If a day pass and i do not shave the machine would not shave me close. maybe i got a defective product because my experience is not as the other reviewers stated.</li>
