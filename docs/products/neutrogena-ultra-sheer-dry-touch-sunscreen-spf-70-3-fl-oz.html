    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think the sunscreen in the spray can is the best spray out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably used every sunblock out there and this is the best!  </li>
            <li>Consumers report rated this the best.</li>
            <li>It was excellent.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product among the 10 best drug store buys and it was dermatologist</li>
            <li>this product is very good, make a great sun protection, is  almost invisible, does not drain with the sweat.</li>
            <li>Those were not that great either - greasy and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s great against the Sun,,,</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)You should put on ample amount of sunscreen to get any reasonably good sun protection.</li>
            <li>Please do not use skimpy amounts unless you want to get a good tan without sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair, sun-loving guy who&#x27;s been burned by the advice of some friends on sunscreen, so I&#x27;m trying a bunch.</li>
            <li>Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;It is good at blocking the sun</li>
            <li>The good news is that the SPF 55 version is an excellent sunscreen, and quite possibly the best in the market.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Neutrogena sunscreen products for over 4 years and have been very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Then I found and tried their SPF 70 sunblock, which is really amazing -</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, feels great, and lets me get on with my routine.</li>
            <li>Better yet, just don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 2 months now and mostly for golfing and bicycling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1)There is no such thing as perfect sun protection except for staying out of sunshine all together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;5)The SPF 70 version leaves noticeably more residue than the SPF 55 version.</li>
            <li>I have used the SPF 45/55 have find it to be a much better product.</li>
            <li>My family loves their beach vacations, and I love my family,</li>
            <li>Definitely the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Some \\&quot;dry\\&quot; gels peel off when I put an incompatible makeup on top.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was better than their moisturizers with SPF 30 and 45</li>
            <li>so I decided to use a non-SPF Neutrogena moisturizer and then on top of that apply the SPF 70.</li>
            <li>It lasted throughout hours of bike riding:)</li>
            <li>Since I work out doors all time, I wanted to make sure I was protected.</li>
            <li>and it is not any better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4)This product is water resistent and does not wear off easily.</li>
            <li>Felt that they were the best in terms of strong, waterproof, sweatproof sun protection that does not feel heavy, sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my neighbors &amp; not only is it waterproof, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog pores &amp; amazon had a great price compared to the local stores.</li>
            <li>My exposure to the sun was light.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Dry Touch is not greasy at all, feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The lack of stickiness was especially appreciated so I didn&#x27;t end up with more sand than normal on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Neutrogena sunscreen products for several years now.  </li>
            <li>It really does provide day-long protection and it doesn&#x27;t have the greasy, makeup-melting effect of most of them.  </li>
            <li>Hawaiian Tropic Faces Oil-Free SPF 30 Sheer Reflections Formula, the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found, which is truly sheer.</li>
            <li>The package was the right size</li>
            <li>So if you want less residue with almost as good sun protection, I recommend the SPF 55 version.</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve had a growing problem with sun poisoning rashes, especially in the Spring and on vacation at the beach.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first summer that I did not get any rash at all.  </li>
            <li>will note that I also used a UV blocking umbrella this year for the first time and that undoubtedly helped.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to play with my nephews out from under the umbrella for long periods of time and stay in the water.  </li>
            <li>As far as the sun protection from the Helioplex ingredient, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as Mexoryl, which I get in L&#x27;Oreal Anthelios Fluide Extreme SPF 50 (also a non-greasy product).  </li>
            <li>The nurses at my doctor&#x27;s office told me that the SPF 70 is too strong and I have not been the only one to come in with this problem.</li>
            <li>Took a week to go away after much itching.</li>
            <li>The SPF 70 protects the person just as well, but not by 20%-25% margin as one would reasonably expect with 15 SPF increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applying cold packs seems to work best.</li>
            <li>the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me as much</li>
            <li>However, I got very flaky skin all over my face and neck and some irritated patches of redness after one or two weeks.</li>
            <li>Reading on the one-star reviews here on Amazon further confirmed it.  </li>
            <li>i am very blond, i need sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I had used a little as well a couple of days before but this day in San Francisco the sun was very strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;Forty-eight hours later, he is still itchy, but looks significantly</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant different in sun burn with this product compared to the copertone sunblock which I used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spf 30 that works remarkably better (not neutrogena brand, granted, but face sunscreen) with other products i don&#x27;t get a tan or burn.</li>
            <li>With summer approaching, I needed sun block for my sensitive, easily sun-burnt face.  </li>
            <li>Ultrasheer blended quickly on my skin, and was not sticky or showing a white residue as some do.  </li>
            <li>It has a very faint scent, good for me because I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances.  </li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this for swimmers and beach bums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high number blocks over the years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it 70% SPF.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month now with normal use.</li>
            <li>you, this sunscreen is a heavy lotion like  many others you find out on the market.</li>
            <li>I have never had  any kind of reaction to any product in the past, I do not have sensitive skin yet within MINUTES  of applying this product</li>
            <li>Definitely do not use this without testing it first.</li>
            <li>The Helioplex (AVOBENZONE) remains exactly the same at 3%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many other Neutrogena products in the past with success.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my young son who has never had a skin rash or any type of dermatological problem.</li>
            <li>I use it under my makeup and so far I have found that it does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>The first tube of 2 pack Neutrogena ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock 70 SPF with Helioplex is pretty much empty.</li>
            <li>The sunblock really proved its worth after I spent an entire day in the sun in San Diego</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find out what was causing the horrible, itchy brilliant red rash on my face because I had always believed Neutrogena to be a safe product.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin DO NOT use this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands throughout the years and they were all watery/runny and greasy at the same time; and they all smelled really strong.</li>
            <li>I used this product on the first day of my vacation in Florida and spent the rest of the time inside or at Urgent Care.  </li>
            <li>(tanning beds cause major rashing).</li>
            <li>the only complian is when you use it in your hands it sticks in the things that you touch; is not a good idea to spread it to you when you are in the car, because is very dificult to clean.</li>
            <li>The overall residue is very much acceptable and is not readily visible to the eye.</li>
            <li>I went home with scarcely any tan at all, but at least I was comfortable and not endangering my health or aging my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently taking two prescription medications and using a cortisone cream to control the itching and clear up the rash.</li>
            <li>After using this product on my arms several times in one week, I developed an itchy rash on my forearms and the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>As I write this my face is so swollen that I can barely see.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old son had a moderate reaction to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Several months later I tried it again and immediately go the same, if not worse, skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to re-apply it very often as I&#x27;ve had to do with other blocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>applied the sun block on my face and neck feeling smoothed and moisturized for the first few days.</li>
            <li>I am not allergic to any other sunscreen, but I put this on my face and 7 days later, still have an allergic reaction - red, blotchy, very itchy.  </li>
            <li>The next morning I woke up with a severe red rash that over the days became worse, blistering red bumpy skin with an itch so strong</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice, the first time I developed serious allergic reaction on my face, with redness, burning and itching.  </li>

            <li> Long exposure to water and/or chlorine seems to make it worse/more likely.  </li>
            <li> but it is not really \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and does tend to to end up on car door handles and clothing, though apparently does not stain.  </li>
            <li> I long ago gave up any hope of tanning,</li>
            <li> Do not seem to have the same problem with their other formulations.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly due to my paternal Irish genes.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using this product on my arms several times in one week, I developed an itchy rash on my forearms and the backs of my hands. I&#x27;m currently taking two prescription medications and using a cortisone cream to control the itching and clear up the rash. The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunblock SPF 70 is going into the trash!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my young son who has never had a skin rash or any type of dermatological problem. 3 hours after applying the Neutrogena 55 SPF his face was slightly red. 5 hours later he was crying constantly and in pain. His face was as red as a tomato and blotchy all over. Definitely do not use this without testing it first. Better yet, just don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This product caused a severe red rash necessitating a visit to a dermatologist and prescription ointments.  Took a week to go away after much itching.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face on friday.  It is now tuesday and I look like the elephant man.  Started burning a couple of hours after applying it so I washed it off.  Not soon enough I guess.  After applying it to my face I wiped the excess on my arms.  Anywhere this stuff touched now looks like severe poison ivy rash.  Threw it in the trash can.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months now and mostly for golfing and bicycling. Both activities exposes a person to plenty of sunshine especially in Southern California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is almost identifical to the SPF 55 version. The SPF 55 version has 10% HOMOSALATE (which is not Helioplex) and the SPF 70 version has 15% HOMOSALATE. That seems to be the only difference according to the \\&quot;active ingrediants\\&quot;. The Helioplex (AVOBENZONE) remains exactly the same at 3%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My subjective tests failed to reveal SPF 70 is significantly better than SPF 55. The good news is that the SPF 55 version is an excellent sunscreen, and quite possibly the best in the market. The SPF 70 protects the person just as well, but not by 20%-25% margin as one would reasonably expect with 15 SPF increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few other things of note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)There is no such thing as perfect sun protection except for staying out of sunshine all together. Your skin will become noticeably darker even after ample application of this sunscreen, but not by much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)You should put on ample amount of sunscreen to get any reasonably good sun protection. Please do not use skimpy amounts unless you want to get a good tan without sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)DO NOT APPLY OVER THE EYES AND THE FOREHEAD (put on a cap). If you have been stung in the eyes with sunscreen before you know you would rather avoid the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)This product is water resistent and does not wear off easily. So I highly recommend this for swimmers and beach bums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)The SPF 70 version leaves noticeably more residue than the SPF 55 version. So if you want less residue with almost as good sun protection, I recommend the SPF 55 version. The overall residue is very much acceptable and is not readily visible to the eye.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena sunscreen products for over 4 years and have been very pleased with them. I think the sunscreen in the spray can is the best spray out there. However, I got this small tube of 70 spf sunscreen with two of the spray cans at Costco and it caused me to have a severe allergic reaction on my face. As I write this my face is so swollen that I can barely see. The nurses at my doctor&#x27;s office told me that the SPF 70 is too strong and I have not been the only one to come in with this problem. I have used the SPF 45/55 have find it to be a much better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Neutrogena sunscreen products for several years now.  Felt that they were the best in terms of strong, waterproof, sweatproof sun protection that does not feel heavy, sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year our family started using the SPF 70 and 90 products and have had allergic reactions to it.  Long exposure to water and/or chlorine seems to make it worse/more likely.  Web searches suggest it is the oxybenzone ingredient that&#x27;s the problem.  None of the members of our family have what I would characterize as hypersensitive skin or are prone to allergy.  But we&#x27;ve definitely correlated a poison oak-like rash to the stronger Neutrogena sunscreen products.  Do not seem to have the same problem with their other formulations.</li>
            <li> I used this product while on vacation in California  mainly to protect the exposed thin skin on my chest from sunburn while wearing a tanktop. I had used a little as well a couple of days before but this day in San Francisco the sun was very strong so I re-applied at least one time. The next morning I woke up with a severe red rash that over the days became worse, blistering red bumpy skin with an itch so strong I had to apply calamine lotion to soothe the itch but still woke up in the middle of the night from the itch as the effect of the calamine lotion had worn off. While I write this review it is the 6th day and the symptons have not really gone away. I stopped using calamine lotion and try to let it heal by itself. Applying cold packs seems to work best. This product is terrible and I found out on the skindeep website also very hazardous for your health.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now with normal use. I use it under my makeup and so far I have found that it does not clog pores. I have not had a single break out with this sun block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, this sunscreen is a heavy lotion like  many others you find out on the market. (I&#x27;m guessing because of the SPF) It can hardly be called sheer. However, it does work. As one of the other people reviewing this product has mentioned, the UVA/UVB protection of this product is comparable to that of the 55 SPF version. So, if you absolutely hate wearing a heavy sunscreen try SPF 55 which is much lighter than the 70 SPF lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Neutrogena makes a spray sunscreen with the same helioplex technology with SPF of 45 which can be found on Amazon or your local drug store.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old son had a moderate reaction to this sunscreen.  Approximately 6 hours after application he looked like he had a patchy sunburn on his face.  His face was slightly swollen, particularly under his eyes and around his mouth.  He had what looked like a heat rash with little red bumps on his chest, neck and shoulders.  His arms and legs were not affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-eight hours later, he is still itchy, but looks significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, both my husband and I were unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve had a growing problem with sun poisoning rashes, especially in the Spring and on vacation at the beach.  Undoubtedly due to my paternal Irish genes.  I long ago gave up any hope of tanning, (tanning beds cause major rashing). My family loves their beach vacations, and I love my family, so . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high number blocks over the years. Especially at the beach they only worked for an hour or so, even under an umbrella, hat and an Australian beach jacket. Yes, looking like an old lady in witness protection and not much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past summer I read about the chemical that increases the length of effectiveness of the sun block.  I did some research and found that Neutrogen&#x27;s Ultrasheer product contained that chemical which they call Helioplex. Several health experts recommended it so I bought a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first summer that I did not get any rash at all.  I was even able to play with my nephews out from under the umbrella for long periods of time and stay in the water.  I didn&#x27;t even need to re-apply it very often as I&#x27;ve had to do with other blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultrasheer blended quickly on my skin, and was not sticky or showing a white residue as some do.  The lack of stickiness was especially appreciated so I didn&#x27;t end up with more sand than normal on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I also used a UV blocking umbrella this year for the first time and that undoubtedly helped.  However, I am convinced the Ultrasheer protected me from UV rays reflected off the sand as well as the sun itself where previous products did not.  Granted I went home with scarcely any tan at all, but at least I was comfortable and not endangering my health or aging my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I didn&#x27;t try the lower SPF Neutrogena.  Possibly that works as well as someone said.  However, I know this one did the job I needed.  It is pricey, but if anybody else has sun poisoning problems, I recommend this product highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;m not affiliated with the company at all or any store that sells it - I work in a library - a definite pale face.e company at all or any store that sells it - I work in a library - a definite pale face.</li>
            <li> this product is very good, make a great sun protection, is  almost invisible, does not drain with the sweat. the only complian is when you use it in your hands it sticks in the things that you touch; is not a good idea to spread it to you when you are in the car, because is very dificult to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair, sun-loving guy who&#x27;s been burned by the advice of some friends on sunscreen, so I&#x27;m trying a bunch. I&#x27;m in southern California so I wear sunscreen every day, but if I&#x27;m going to on days which it seems unnecessary I&#x27;d like it to have some other benefits like anti-aging properties via the inclusion of vitamins A, C, &amp; E. This product does not have those. I know Neutrogena has such a product, but it&#x27;s $20 for a 2 oz. tube, unlike Hawaiian Tropic Faces Oil-Free SPF 30 Sheer Reflections Formula, the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found, which is truly sheer. This is thick &amp; white, smells like a woman&#x27;s cream or make-up, &amp; doesn&#x27;t absorb in \\&quot;t-zone\\&quot;. According to the FDA anything over SPF 30 is meaningless(I bought this before I knew that), &amp; the FDA has delayed enforcement of what can be on the label for a couple of years. Beyond that, there is some concern that even those products labeled SPF 30 and below are not performing what they purport to. I do give Neutrogena points for developing helioplex, and displaying a pfa rating, which pertains to UVA unlike SPF which only measures UVB.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. Took it to Burning Man, in serious sun for a week, and came back almost as lilly-white as I left. I have skin cancer in my family, so I don&#x27;t mess around with the sun.</li>
            <li> The first tube of 2 pack Neutrogena ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock 70 SPF with Helioplex is pretty much empty. I used it on my[....] boy with dark  skin complex. I did not see any significant different in sun burn with this product compared to the copertone sunblock which I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;He skin is very dark black now. I am not sure this product&#x27;s usefulness in blocking UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li> I have to use sunscreen after a bad accident to my face. I used my neighbors &amp; not only is it waterproof, it smells great. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores &amp; amazon had a great price compared to the local stores. I highly recommend it 70% SPF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used every sunblock out there and this is the best!  It really does provide day-long protection and it doesn&#x27;t have the greasy, makeup-melting effect of most of them.  Some \\&quot;dry\\&quot; gels peel off when I put an incompatible makeup on top.  This doesn&#x27;t.  It absorbs quickly, feels great, and lets me get on with my routine.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0013LNZ0C Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock with Helioplex, SPF 70 - 3 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;It is good at blocking the sun but it is not really \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and does tend to to end up on car door handles and clothing, though apparently does not stain.  It does not provoke any skin reaction and is scentless which is a plus.  We use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Gave me an unintended chemical peel on my face. Skin scorched and painful. Weeks for peeling to stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands throughout the years and they were all watery/runny and greasy at the same time; and they all smelled really strong. I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena&#x27;s moisturizers that are SPF 30 and SPF 45. Those were not that great either - greasy and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent. Then I found and tried their SPF 70 sunblock, which is really amazing - the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me as much and it&#x27;s not really greasy. I thought it was better than their moisturizers with SPF 30 and 45 so I decided to use a non-SPF Neutrogena moisturizer and then on top of that apply the SPF 70. It works really well, especially on my ridiculously oily skin. The sunblock really proved its worth after I spent an entire day in the sun in San Diego (I was literally outside since sunrise until past sunset). I only applied the sunblock once in the morning before leaving the house and I didn&#x27;t get a tan at all. It lasted throughout hours of bike riding:)</li>
            <li> I am not aware of having been ever allergic to any skin product in the world, but this stuff made red whelps appear on my face a matter of hours after application. I had bought a two pack of this a couple of years ago and had this horrible reaction and tossed the stuff, and forgot and used it again this past weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>

            <li> I used this product on the first day of my vacation in Florida and spent the rest of the time inside or at Urgent Care.  It took me a while to find out what was causing the horrible, itchy brilliant red rash on my face because I had always believed Neutrogena to be a safe product.  Never again!</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction on my face ( red blisters then extreme dry patches) and blisters on my arms where I applied this product. I&#x27;m not sure why sine I have used other sunscreens without this reaction. I will not be using ever again.</li>
            <li> With summer approaching, I needed sun block for my sensitive, easily sun-burnt face.  I was so happy to find this product among the 10 best drug store buys and it was dermatologist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the sun block on my face and neck feeling smoothed and moisturized for the first few days. However, I got very flaky skin all over my face and neck and some irritated patches of redness after one or two weeks. One of my friends saw me and even asked me whether I went to cruise and got burnt!&lt;br /&gt;I slowly suspected that this sun block caused me the allergic reaction. Reading on the one-star reviews here on Amazon further confirmed it.  I am now relying on Aquaphor healing ointment cream to cure my face and will never use it again.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B001E96P0A Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF-70, 3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> i am very blond, i need sunscreen. this product however is close to useless; even when i lather it on well ahead of time and go out in the sun (on a bike ride) for only half an hour i come home and am red for the next two days. I have spf 30 that works remarkably better (not neutrogena brand, granted, but face sunscreen) with other products i don&#x27;t get a tan or burn. i dont believe this is actually sunscreen, as it seems to do nothing. i tested with half this product and half another sunscreen same results. the bottle doesnt expire for several years. i would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin DO NOT use this sunscreen. I have never had a problem with sunscreens and this one left a red rash on my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product several days ago. My exposure to the sun was light. I have a rash over all the parts of my body where the sunscreen was applied, very itchy and uncomfortable. I do not know which factor in the sunblock is a problem for me. I usually have to use barrier sunblocks with titanuim dioxide or zinc oxide. I would suggest trying this out on a small area of your body before serious use if you have sensitive skin. I have used many other Neutrogena products in the past with success.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to any other sunscreen, but I put this on my face and 7 days later, still have an allergic reaction - red, blotchy, very itchy.  It looks and feels like I have hives on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I tried neutrogena sun block and a rash appeared.  It lasted a few days.  Recently, I was traveling in Southern California during the summer and needed a small package of sun block to keep with me during the day.  The package was the right size and I thought I would give it a try....whoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours after I applied it to my face and neck, the burn started.  I realized what was going on so I started washing it off with some water.  That evening, my face was blistered, red, and felt like I had been pepper-sprayed.  The next few days, my rash continued with small blisters and scaly formations all over my neck, ears, and face.  My skin felt like a cat&#x27;s tongue.  People stared at my face and wondered how I could possibly screw myself that badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF!  I do not have sensitive skin.  I do not have allergies.  Whatever is in this product is messed up.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s great against the Sun,,,</li>
            <li> I used this on my upper chest and face, and had an allergic contact dermatitis reaction on my chest.  I wish I knew what ingredient(s) I reacted to...  This product is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin.  Almost all sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried are greasy (even the ones that are supposed to be \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot;).  Neutrogena Dry Touch is not greasy at all, feels great on the skin.  It has a very faint scent, good for me because I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances.  As far as the sun protection from the Helioplex ingredient, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as Mexoryl, which I get in L&#x27;Oreal Anthelios Fluide Extreme SPF 50 (also a non-greasy product).  But this formulation of Anthelios is expensive and hard to obtain in the U.S. (our FDA has only approved Anthelios in the SPF 15 greasy cream), so I use Neutrogena with Helioplex as an alternate product sometimes.</li>
            <li> My father likes this product and it worked well. Also I used it when I was going out and it worked. I really like this product. I recommanded for everyone. It was excellent.</li>
            <li> Horrible red bumps that lasted a week!</li>
            <li> I have never had  any kind of reaction to any product in the past, I do not have sensitive skin yet within MINUTES  of applying this product I broke out in a raised rash, itchy and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;This is the third day and it is not any better. I am schocked while reading these reviews and extremely angry that this product is still being offered with these kinds of adverse reactions being reported for several years. I wish I had read them prior to use, however I trusted in Neutrogena , having used their products since childhood.&lt;br /&gt;Where is the accountability  here?</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice, the first time I developed serious allergic reaction on my face, with redness, burning and itching.  I showed the product to my dermatologist who said it could be anything in the listed 75 or s chemicals in it.  Awful.  Several months later I tried it again and immediately go the same, if not worse, skin reaction.  To the trash it went.  Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> 3 days later and I still am having trouble with clogged pores and heat rash. It also does not absorb into the skin well.</li>
