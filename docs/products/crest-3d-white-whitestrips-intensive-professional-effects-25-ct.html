    <ol>
            <li>I had wished for, but a wonderfully noticeable whitening none-the-less.  </li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips are the best whitening product you can buy without visiting your dentist.</li>
            <li>its perfect</li>
            <li>These are the best .</li>
            <li>What a good man!</li>

            <li>love these strips!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>it worked good</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>it was a great deal look to buy more of them good for yhe beginin but need maybe 2 hour strips</li>
            <li>Worked great for my sister but ok for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have discovered these that I will use them routinely (per Crest&#x27;s recommendations on frequency) to maintain my now bright smile!</li>
            <li>better then anything from the dentist and a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>These worked amazingly well for me.</li>
            <li>But they still gotta be more honest in packaging and naming.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product ... not the &amp;#34;pearly movie-star&amp;#34; white teeth</li>
            <li>I though would work better.</li>
            <li>a retiree so have had many years for stains to settle in.</li>
            <li>maybe even eat ok maybe not eat........</li>
            <li>I will always use crest until something better comes out .</li>
            <li>so it whitened some spots better then others.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t, most of them are gone but you can still see whiter spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product more than once.  </li>
            <li>the extra strips in this package is wonderful because of the original values.</li>
            <li>But to bleach teeth not as easy.  </li>
            <li>After several treatments, everyone starts commenting on how beautiful my teeth are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - yup it does work - very powerful.  </li>
            <li>These white strips are very effective and will stay on your teeth until you peel them off.</li>
            <li>First of many purchases.</li>
            <li>i would say..if your looking for a.. bright white smile, this is for you!.</li>
            <li>I loved the results and it was only 30 minutes a day.  </li>
            <li>The results were so good and so comfortable that a few times, I used strips twice/day to shine-up faster for a special event.</li>
            <li>I guess for getting a few coffee stains off my teeth they work great.........</li>
            <li>I just bought the cheap Colgate stuff that is more of a gel - it is not even in the same league as this.  </li>
            <li>and i cant even remember the last time my teeth looked this white AMAZING!</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Well I just got this item and the first thing that struck me</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered and it arrived on time</li>
            <li>Well Greaaat Item I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and noticing some positive results ...</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Adhered very well almost too well when applying to lower teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The strips really stick to your teeth (no sliding off), and you can drink with them on.</li>
            <li>teeth are much whiter</li>
            <li>....... if i leave them on to long I need to get on some strong pain killers if i want to sleep that night??????</li>
            <li>They do make my teeth somewhat sensitive but, afterwards, I use a fluoride gel that I purchased from my dentist, which really helps.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference with only 3-4 uses with some very mild sensitivity that was gone within a day- not nearly enough to pause use.</li>
            <li>Asked my new dentist about whitening and he recommended these.</li>
            <li>but it can also cause your teeths to be sensitive and sometimes hurt!</li>
            <li>I order online the same product but this last shipment was not what has been shipped to me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The strips in this current order do not come off easily and the backing sticks.  </li>
            <li>Also, for a few days after each treatment, your teeth will be more porous and prone to staining from coffee, tea, red wine, blueberries, etc.</li>
            <li>2nd point is why does Crest call almost all the strips \\&quot;Professional</li>
            <li>And as far as sensitivity on the teeth..speaking for myself,i have not had any issues related to pain at all...</li>

            <li> The results were only OK - not great- &amp; not very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> My only caution would be that if you have sensitive teeth or receding gums to be careful to keep the strips off of these spots, because they do cause pain and sensitivity if you have less protected areas in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I also have tried level 5 but takes too long.</li>
            <li> Effects\\&quot; That is pure double talk marketing &amp; they add such meaningless terms as \\&quot;3D\\&quot; It means nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried on and off to use the standard version of Crest white strips and have always been disappointed and grossed out by how slimy they are and how easily they slip off teeth with any moisture.</li>
            <li> Dentist tells me that means I&#x27;ve got stronger enamel but teeth are harder to whiten.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical, especially because as I have naturally dark teeth- despite scrupulous brushing- lucky me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly not blinding white, which to me looks unnatural, but results are as-good-as if not better than dentist&#x27;s process which was $250 more and painful!</li>
            <li> i was a smoker, quit two &amp; a half years ago..</li>
            <li> I might consider again if price was less.</li>
            <li> I guess the enamel on my teeth is a little uneven</li>
            <li> this product is one of the few that i buy periodically.  </li>
            <li> so, in order to achieve maximum whitening, you should forego these foods and drinks for a few days (or longer).</li>
            <li> make my teeth sore after few times of use.</li>
            <li> Very little product on the strips.</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> there where a hand full... of people that gave it bad reviews!</li>
            <li> ago had teeth bleached at a different dentist for $300 but had awful sensitivity for a long time.</li>
            <li> I did like that fact these stick to your teeth there very hard to pull off so</li>
            <li> Expensive and has not worked for me at all.  </li>
            <li> plus  the cost was very expensive .  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a stupid thing to  be doing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Could not find these in the local drugstore so I purchased online.  They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this product is one of the few that i buy periodically.  it has been around for quite some time and it really does the job. no need for dentists to get you all shined up, get one of those and use it for couple of months with breaks in between and you will see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Worked well after four treatments</li>
            <li> Excellent product ... not the &amp;#34;pearly movie-star&amp;#34; white teeth I had wished for, but a wonderfully noticeable whitening none-the-less.  First of many purchases.</li>
            <li> Well I just got this item and the first thing that struck me was the massive deception they foist with the packaging. more than 1/2 of the box is empty save for the thin bit of info sheet they stick there. It is a stupid thing to  be doing. 2nd point is why does Crest call almost all the strips \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; That is pure double talk marketing &amp; they add such meaningless terms as \\&quot;3D\\&quot; It means nothing at all.  Let&#x27;s see if this product lives up to all that hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - yup it does work - very powerful.  I just bought the cheap Colgate stuff that is more of a gel - it is not even in the same league as this.  I&#x27;ll stay with this product - give it 4 stars.  But they still gotta be more honest in packaging and naming.  IMHO</li>
            <li> it worked good it was a great deal look to buy more of them good for yhe beginin but need maybe 2 hour strips</li>
            <li> White white white stick stick stick white white white stick stick stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be disappointed. They don&#x27;t move once stuck to your teeth</li>
            <li> i must say i read alot of reviews about this product before .. i purchased! there where a hand full... of people that gave it bad reviews! simply put.. if this product didnt work for them....their teeth had to be corncob yellow,no joke, because ive been using them as to instructions! and my teeth are sparking white, and i have not even finished them all yet! And as far as sensitivity on the teeth..speaking for myself,i have not had any issues related to pain at all...and i have semi-sensitive teeth! i was a smoker, quit two &amp; a half years ago..and i cant even remember the last time my teeth looked this white AMAZING! i would say..if your looking for a.. bright white smile, this is for you!.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using the white strips I could see my teeth whiter It was exactly what I ordered and it arrived on time</li>
            <li> I though would work better. Adhered very well almost too well when applying to lower teeth. I might consider again if price was less.</li>
            <li> Tried them and am amazed with the results and I do not exaggerate in product reviews .I&#x27;m a retiree so have had many years for stains to settle in. I was VERY skeptical, especially because as I have naturally dark teeth- despite scrupulous brushing- lucky me. Dentist tells me that means I&#x27;ve got stronger enamel but teeth are harder to whiten. Several yrs. ago had teeth bleached at a different dentist for $300 but had awful sensitivity for a long time. The results were only OK - not great- &amp; not very long-lasting. (I drink 1 coffee/day, no cola, no red wine.) Asked my new dentist about whitening and he recommended these. What a good man! These worked amazingly well for me. That this product definitely stays put- no slip-sliding at all!  There was a noticeable difference with only 3-4 uses with some very mild sensitivity that was gone within a day- not nearly enough to pause use. I even left strips on for an hour without any pain. The results were so good and so comfortable that a few times, I used strips twice/day to shine-up faster for a special event. I keep looking in the mirror to see how great my once-dingy teeth look. They&#x27;re certainly not blinding white, which to me looks unnatural, but results are as-good-as if not better than dentist&#x27;s process which was $250 more and painful! I&#x27;m so happy to have discovered these that I will use them routinely (per Crest&#x27;s recommendations on frequency) to maintain my now bright smile!</li>
            <li> better then anything from the dentist and a fraction of the price! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well Greaaat Item I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and noticing some positive results ... however I have sent it with my brother in his luggage overseas to my family there ,,, and we found out that it&#x27;s been taken by maybe Customs ... I believe the reason is because there is a magnetic chip inside the box</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips are the best whitening product you can buy without visiting your dentist. I always buy the ones numbered either 4 or 5, and can see a difference after one use. After several treatments, everyone starts commenting on how beautiful my teeth are. The strips really stick to your teeth (no sliding off), and you can drink with them on. They do make my teeth somewhat sensitive but, afterwards, I use a fluoride gel that I purchased from my dentist, which really helps. Also, for a few days after each treatment, your teeth will be more porous and prone to staining from coffee, tea, red wine, blueberries, etc. so, in order to achieve maximum whitening, you should forego these foods and drinks for a few days (or longer).</li>
            <li> It does a good job but it can also cause your teeths to be sensitive and sometimes hurt!</li>
            <li> After a few strips my teeth looked so much whiter. I have used this product before and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I guess for getting a few coffee stains off my teeth they work great......... but man do they hurt my teeth....... if i leave them on to long I need to get on some strong pain killers if i want to sleep that night??????? Im not sure if anyone else has that problem but if you do dont leave them on for a hour like i did!!!!! I did like that fact these stick to your teeth there very hard to pull off so that means you can talk drink maybe even eat ok maybe not eat........ I would get them again.</li>
            <li> its perfect i buy this product every year and my teeth looks so naturally white all the rest of the year.. i drink coffee but not like an addict so i have to re-use it after one year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days and people already complimented me on my teeth being so white. My teeth were beginning to yellow because I chew tobacco, now when people find out I chew they don&#x27;t believe me because of how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I order online the same product but this last shipment was not what has been shipped to me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The strips in this current order do not come off easily and the backing sticks.  The shape of the lower mouth is also not the same.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why this product on this order is not the same as I paid the same price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> love these strips!! teeth are much whiter and I would buy over again!!</li>
            <li> Have been using crest whitestrips for years.  These are the best . I have tried others but always go back to crest.&lt;br /&gt;I have used bleach from the dentist and&lt;br /&gt;the results took longer plus  the cost was very expensive .  I will always use crest until something better comes out .</li>
            <li> I have tried on and off to use the standard version of Crest white strips and have always been disappointed and grossed out by how slimy they are and how easily they slip off teeth with any moisture. These white strips are very effective and will stay on your teeth until you peel them off. My only caution would be that if you have sensitive teeth or receding gums to be careful to keep the strips off of these spots, because they do cause pain and sensitivity if you have less protected areas in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I loved the results and it was only 30 minutes a day.  I had a mouth guard made  by my dentist years ago... But to bleach teeth not as easy.  I also have tried level 5 but takes too long.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my sister but ok for me. I guess the enamel on my teeth is a little uneven so it whitened some spots better then others. I thought the spots will go away but they didn&#x27;t, most of them are gone but you can still see whiter spots on my teeth. I used it around 6 month ago.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product more than once.  Very little product on the strips. Expensive and has not worked for me at all.  I&#x27;m done with these.</li>
            <li> i used it 3 days and it works. i didnt do it after that because you need to put them in your mouth for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I like them...but is painfull....make my teeth sore after few times of use.</li>
            <li> this product have kept my teeth looking cleaner and brighter. the extra strips in this package is wonderful because of the original values.</li>
