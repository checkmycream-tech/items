            <li>Very satisfied with product</li>
            <li>This easy flow primer is great.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>but they are so brittle, i do my own acrylics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these, one for my friend who use to own her own nail salon</li>
            <li>, I wanted to mention my friends experience over mine because I&#x27;m not a pro at doing my own nails</li>
            <li>Great product and really works.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes the acrylic stay on 100% on even my clients who have problems with lifting.</li>
            <li>but it is potent..</li>
            <li>Will purchase again:-)</li>
            <li>I do my nails at home now and love these products.</li>
            <li>Great price and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>great experience, i will definately use this buyer in the future</li>
            <li>So be precise when applying.</li>
            <li>Arrived timely and securely.  </li>
            <li>I have compared it to the low-acid type, and it is far superior to keeping the nail from lifting.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>i received my product very fast, it was packaged well, and it works great so far.</li>
            <li>Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly</li>
            <li>but when I got the package I opened it up and instantly smelled it very strong!</li>
            <li>I use this with ez-flow acrylic products and I have great results with minimal lifting.</li>
            <li>so it seems to be a good enough primer.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased because it helps my acrylic last longer.</li>
            <li>This primer along with the EZ Flow acrylic powder and EZ Flow Q Monomer will give you beautiful, strong, long lasting nails.  </li>
            <li>This primer really leave nail bed free of debri and allows nail monomer/polymer mixture to stick well onto nail plate.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and is decently priced.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth paying a little more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fast in and of itself let alone during Christmas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they kept lifting, but this primer really has solved this problem.  </li>
            <li>It works as described and I highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li>A little more than some brands cost but with how well this brand works</li>
            <li>The primer actually worked just fine, I only had one nail pop off</li>
            <li>I really wish I had received the proper brand I ordered because I use all EZ Flow products</li>
            <li>As far as how well EZ Flow primer works, I wish I knew.</li>
            <li>It is called Premium Nails, and a quick amazon search says it costs roughly the same amount as the a EZ Flow, but it looks like I got bait-and-switched because I received no response from the seller about the mix up.</li>
            <li>A little really does go a long way because you do not need to use much</li>

            <li> /&gt;she is a pro, she knows what&#x27;s good and not, we both where disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on your skin, it will burn so stay on the nail plate with it and let it air dry which only takes like 30s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good enough at proper acrylic application.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another product other than EzFlow.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not a strong smell at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here, I ordered EZ Flow primer</li>
            <li> finished opening it up and 1/3 of the bottle had spilled out due to poor packing and tightening of the lid!</li>
            <li> This not good.</li>
            <li> remember, this is a caustic acid to skin.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating three stars because of the sketch factor when ordering one product and receiving another, be wary.</li>
            <li> I had to go ahead and use the primer because I was desperate to do my nails before a vacation</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>

            <li> I gave this a 3 stars because I have not yet used it but when I got the package I opened it up and instantly smelled it very strong! finished opening it up and 1/3 of the bottle had spilled out due to poor packing and tightening of the lid! Very frustrating! Ill write a second review once I use it by Friday :)</li>
            <li> I use this with ez-flow acrylic products and I have great results with minimal lifting. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> been using it for 4 years</li>
            <li> It works, but its not the best out there.</li>
            <li> Great product and really works. Makes your manicure look and stay looking great. Good oruce too!  Very satisfied with product</li>
            <li> De este producto compre uno Ez Flow Nail Primer .5 oz, el 22 de septiembre lo compre y aun no lo he recibido que pasa? ya hoy es 8 de septiembre y nada de llegar, espero que me lo envien pronto, gracias</li>
            <li> This easy flow primer is great.A little really does go a long way because you do not need to use much</li>
            <li> I cant say its the greatest or if it stops lifting or not. I&#x27;m not good enough at proper acrylic application.  But i do use this every time as it is a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here, I ordered EZ Flow primer and I got a different brand. I had to go ahead and use the primer because I was desperate to do my nails before a vacation so I went ahead and tried the one I received. It is called Premium Nails, and a quick amazon search says it costs roughly the same amount as the a EZ Flow, but it looks like I got bait-and-switched because I received no response from the seller about the mix up. The primer actually worked just fine, I only had one nail pop off and I was already in need of a fill when it happened so it seems to be a good enough primer. I really wish I had received the proper brand I ordered because I use all EZ Flow products and I&#x27;d like to stay within the line to see if it makes a difference. I&#x27;m rating three stars because of the sketch factor when ordering one product and receiving another, be wary. As far as how well EZ Flow primer works, I wish I knew.</li>
            <li> excellent bonder to use when applying both gel and acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> My supply house used to carry this product and just stopped for no reason. I love this product because it makes the acrylic stay on 100% on even my clients who have problems with lifting. Great price and super fast delivery. I ordered it on December 23rd and it came on the 27th. That&#x27;s fast in and of itself let alone during Christmas.</li>
            <li> i received my product very fast, it was packaged well, and it works great so far. great experience, i will definately use this buyer in the future</li>
            <li> Great product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best.  I have compared it to the low-acid type, and it is far superior to keeping the nail from lifting.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, this is a caustic acid to skin.  It will burn your skin surrounding the nail.  So be precise when applying.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product but I am very pleased because it helps my acrylic last longer.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like having to have my nails done.  but they are so brittle, i do my own acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;they kept lifting, but this primer really has solved this problem.  the nails do not lift and seperate as before.</li>
            <li> I love this brand!! That being said this stuff works wonderfully. It was shipped quickly and is decently priced. A little more than some brands cost but with how well this brand works it&#x27;s worth paying a little more.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and securely.  Great product.  The primer is strong, but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great. I will never use anything else with my gels n polishes. Never no lifting or peeling at all with either one. It&#x27;s a must have staple in your DIY collection. Be careful not to get it on your skin, it will burn so stay on the nail plate with it and let it air dry which only takes like 30s.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to realize you need primer in order to keep acrylics on. It works alright and there&#x27;s not a strong smell at all but it is potent..</li>
            <li> Great product will continue to buy</li>
            <li> and I will say it again! I will never use another product other than EzFlow. It has been my all time easiest perfected product that I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Great product. It keeps my nails from lifting.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for my friend who use to own her own nail salon and now she just does her own.&lt;br /&gt;We both had problems with lifting after a week. The stuff she use to use was from sallys their brand and you need license to get. she could go 3 weeks with zero lifting. This not good. I had it lift on me as well, I wanted to mention my friends experience over mine because I&#x27;m not a pro at doing my own nails,  I could have gotten to close to the cuticle or something I don&#x27;t know??&lt;br /&gt;she is a pro, she knows what&#x27;s good and not, we both where disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and it works great! It helps my nails last 4 to 5 times longer than if I hadn&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> This primer really leave nail bed free of debri and allows nail monomer/polymer mixture to stick well onto nail plate.  Will purchase again:-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with acrylic nails. Did my daughter&#x27;s acrylic nails and after a week four nails fell off. Also used under nail polish didn&#x27;t work either, polish chipped after just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> My preference for the best primer on the market. It works as described and I highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li> This primer along with the EZ Flow acrylic powder and EZ Flow Q Monomer will give you beautiful, strong, long lasting nails.  I do my nails at home now and love these products.</li>
