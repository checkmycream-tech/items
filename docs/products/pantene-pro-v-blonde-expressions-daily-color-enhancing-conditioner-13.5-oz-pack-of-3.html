            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>A great find for the price, liked it better than the Clairol Shimmering Light Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love to use this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried others paid more and end up using once or twice and throwing out</li>
            <li>* Love to use in the summer for my highlights and the Brunette expressions in the Fall  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and have used this for many years.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a better one.</li>
            <li>Hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I only regret that I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair color, which is a combination of the two....  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Looking for more in the stores.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it arrived in good time.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FOR SOFT, SHINY HAIR.</li>
            <li>It must be the Kape seed oil in the conditioner, although this does not have the crystals that brighten your hair, the two used in conjunction with each other produce a great result!!</li>
            <li>Creamy and goes on think and easy.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Blonde Expresssions shampoo that did an excellent job at \\&quot;Brighening\\</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Blonde Expressions Conditioner is one of the best products on the market for blondes (natural or otherwise).</li>
            <li>I will definitely stop the hunt for a good</li>
            <li>It make my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I would sure recommend this to any blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great with the shampoo, doesn&#x27;t leave hair limp.</li>
            <li>Gives a beautiful gold shimmer to hair, and takes the grey, &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; blonde out of colored hair....not brassy, either, really pretty.  </li>
            <li>most shampoo/cond makes my hair a tangled mess, this has worked great for a few months!  </li>
            <li>* Pantene Expressions Shampoo and Conditioner are gentle and work well to upkeep your color treatment  </li>
            <li>thank you Amazon, very grateful,  Deborah LeMontagne</li>
            <li>This was for my daughter, she is a natural blonde and this help her enhance and keep her blonde hair looking good all the time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner makes my usually very thick tangled hair silky smooth and easy to brush after i shower.  </li>
            <li>and then seriously, the nice compliments just keep coming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I docked a star is because my hair was a little more brassy than I wanted.</li>
            <li>My hair will never be soft and silky again.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t color your hair just gives it soft glow</li>
            <li>Also, the Pantene Pro-V Blonde Expressions Daily Color keeps my color fresh.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to give the conditioner a try and what a major difference!!</li>
            <li>I have dyed platinum blonde hair that tends to be dry if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I went from coloring my hair every 2 weeks to once a month and my hair is looks a very natural blonde with a shine.</li>

            <li> Love to use this conditioner. It seems to make my highlights stay brighter, longer. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> the one and only conditioner I will use   It is the best one out there. I have tried others paid more and end up using once or twice and throwing out this is the best</li>
            <li> Works well hard to find in our area</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair with years of highlights.  this shampoo and conditioner makes my usually very thick tangled hair silky smooth and easy to brush after i shower.  I have tried a ton of products over the years and I am fianlly very happy with this product.  most shampoo/cond makes my hair a tangled mess, this has worked great for a few months!  i definitely plan to stick with this for a while.</li>

            <li> Makes my hair beautiful with shine and softness.  I will definitely stop the hunt for a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YEAH!  No more wasted time or money!</li>
            <li> I dont notice any difference between this and suave for 1.50</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful...such a shame it has been discontinued!</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Blonde Expressions Conditioner is one of the best products on the market for blondes (natural or otherwise). Creamy and goes on think and easy. It leaves shiney luster afterwards. Best used with the Pantene Pro-V Expressions Shampoo. The only trouble with this product is that it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does what it says.  The price is right and it arrived in good time.  It works well on blonde color treated hair.  It make my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene, but was disappointed when they discontinued the blonde expressions in the stores I used to buy them from... but then I found what I wanted on line, life is good...thank you Amazon, very grateful,  Deborah LeMontagne</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! It leaves your hair really soft and also deposits a little bit of color every time you wash. It gives a glimmering, shimmering effect. Get this conditioner, it&#x27;s awesome! :-)</li>
            <li> As someone who has real blonde hair its always been a pain to find something that doesn&#x27;t darken my hair. this works great</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter, she is a natural blonde and this help her enhance and keep her blonde hair looking good all the time.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and have used this for many years.  I use a few different brands of conditioner that I  alternate but this one is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Leaves a yellow look to my hair.  Prefer just the highlight.</li>
            <li> The only reason I docked a star is because my hair was a little more brassy than I wanted. It really is great for highlights though. I haven&#x27;t used a better one. Hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have dyed platinum blonde hair that tends to be dry if I don&#x27;t use the right shampoo and conditioners. I first purchased the Blonde Expresssions shampoo that did an excellent job at \\&quot;Brighening\\&quot; my hair that seemed to dull (I didn&#x27;t even have to re-dye it which I was planning to).

It must be the Kape seed oil in the conditioner, although this does not have the crystals that brighten your hair, the two used in conjunction with each other produce a great result!!</li>
            <li> why did they discontinue it? :(  My hair will never be soft and silky again.  Buy this conditioner and you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Great hair conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t color your hair just gives it soft glow</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but 90% of the time when I do, someone comments on how nice and blonde my hair looks, it is crazy! I thought it was a fluke and then seriously, the nice compliments just keep coming. Can&#x27;t find it in drugstores anymore so I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I only regret that I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner. Their 2-in-1 color preserving shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t work to preserve my blonde color at all but this conditioner is amazing! I went from coloring my hair every 2 weeks to once a month and my hair is looks a very natural blonde with a shine. I have it on S&amp;S so as to never run out.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful gold shimmer to hair, and takes the grey, &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; blonde out of colored hair....not brassy, either, really pretty.  I use it over my Garnier Nutrisse Champagne hair color.  I get so many compliments on my hair color, which is a combination of the two....  Also, the Pantene Pro-V Blonde Expressions Daily Color keeps my color fresh.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR SOFT, SHINY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
            <li> I would sure recommend this to any blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Florida and the weather is very hard on ahir.</li>
            <li> Love it. Looking for more in the stores. They seem to have discontinued it.</li>
