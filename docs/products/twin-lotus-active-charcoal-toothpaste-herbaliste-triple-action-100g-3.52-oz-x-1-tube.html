            <li> Not sure about it since I only used it a couple of timesI just started a tooth whitening project before it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost black in color when you squeeze it from the tube.  </li>
            <li> My gums did seem a little irritated after using but I have no teeth sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> Just be cautious that since it&#x27;s a dark toothpaste, the buildup in your sink can look a little weird.</li>
            <li> but I hate using teeth whitening strips due to sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> And the taste was not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Tastes awful, feels terrible, and looks horrific in your mouth.</li>

            <li> I like the taste of this toothpaste better than any I have tried from health food stores or Walmart. It leaves my mouth feeling very fresh also. I cannot yet speak about the effectiveness of it as I just received it a couple of days ago. I will edit this review if it proves itself poorly in that area.</li>
            <li> Good try to smooth teeth etc.  Probably will get at health food store next time.</li>
            <li> Love this charcoal toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Works really well, feels super clean and fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> this is everything that was said it would do</li>
            <li> I love the taste and the clean. I take charcoal whenever my gut is upset and it works like a charm so I thought, knowing how charcoal attracts &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; and the delicious oils they have in this formula, it&#x27;s right up my alley. I&#x27;ve used Auromere for years and this is my new favorite!  I&#x27;ve never used white strips because they&#x27;re damaging but people always comment on how white my teeth are and I&#x27;m in my 60s. It really does work.</li>
            <li> A must try! It leaves my breath smelling so fresh. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I ordered. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> love, love, love.  breath is fresher, teeth are whiter, all natural &amp; lovely taste.  now i ask you……..</li>
            <li> This really is good stuff. A different taste, but pleasant. I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste will probably freak you out the first time you try it.  It&#x27;s almost black in color when you squeeze it from the tube.  Be brave and try it anyway.  It really seems to work very well.  I already use white strips to whiten my teeth, but I needed something to maintain them in between treatments, as I don&#x27;t want to over use them and damage my enamel.  This toothpaste is perfect for my needs.  It has a pleasant clove taste that leaves you with fresh breath, and so far it has done a great job of keeping my teeth white despite the fact that I drink 2 cups of coffee a day.</li>
            <li> is bit bitter but is different n good product. Feels like mouth spa :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrived in time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found out about this toothpaste.  I love it!  I use it every day with my regular toothpaste.  I have to use it with a non-electric toothbrush or it will make a big mess.  My breath feels fresh and my teeth feel clean all day.  I also noticed a little bit of whitening, but its only been a couple of weeks.  I do drink a lot of coffee though.  I will definitely be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! My husband, who hates brushing his teeth, actually looks forward to using this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is refreshing makes your mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really whitened my teeth quickly and makes my breath fresh. Just be cautious that since it&#x27;s a dark toothpaste, the buildup in your sink can look a little weird. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here but happy to have it.  I am sure dentists know about activated charcoal and bonded teeth.  They say nothing whitens them but having the bonding taken off completely and new ones applied is their approach.  This toothpaste has helped to whiten but not state it is whitening toothpaste. I have not tried the actual activated charcoal by itself so I can not compare the two. I googled and wrote, I can&#x27;t believe there is not a thing in 2015 that will whiten bonded teeth.  This tooth paste and activated charcoal popped up on the screen.  Shame on Dentist!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected, but i was also surprised by the taste. It was minty and felt really clean and fresh. Not chalky at all</li>
            <li> Tastes awful, feels terrible, and looks horrific in your mouth. But it has whitened my teeth significantly after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth with staining that builds between dental visits from coffee and tea. This really bothers me but I hate using teeth whitening strips due to sensitivity issues. I read that activated charcoal toothpaste could help &amp; decided to try this brand. It made a significant difference after one use &amp; took away almost all staining after 2 uses. I&#x27;m really grateful &amp; impressed. My gums did seem a little irritated after using but I have no teeth sensitivity at all. I&#x27;m so grateful that I gave this product a try!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would remove the yellow cast that teeth often get from smoking and drinking caffeine. The toothpaste lifts it, but not enough. Still looking for that whitener tooth paste,  that doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Not sure about it since I only used it a couple of timesI just started a tooth whitening project before it arrived.  I doubt if it will have an effect.&lt;br /&gt;I did see a much cleaner look to all of my teeth after using it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great!  My teeth felt so clean after the first use. My breath is also much fresher. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really good product, makes your teeth feel clean and look white.  And the taste was not that bad.  Plus has all natural products what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> this is wonderfly refreshing, my breath taste clean and my teeth sparkle!</li>
            <li> Charcoal is a wonderful cleaning product. Previously I could only find charcoal toothpaste in powder form. It worked great but was very messy. I love this toothpaste that cleans and freshens my mouth in less time and no mess. Taste is good, very neutral.</li>
