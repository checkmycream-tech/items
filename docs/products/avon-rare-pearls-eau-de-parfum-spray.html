            <li>I really love this Rare Pearls by Avon.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I have worn for years!  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t describe what it is about the scent that makes it so sweet</li>
            <li>I gave it to my mom as a present she loved it</li>
            <li>and then I bought the Rare Pearls in the Shimmering Powder to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>bottle of Rare Pearls wasn&#x27;t sealed, and looked like it may have been opened.  </li>
            <li>Is was not wrapped in the clear plastic wrapping like you get from Avon and the spray top is NOT working.</li>
            <li>but instead it was Rare Diamonds.  </li>
            <li>It was in fact in a Rare Pearls box.</li>
            <li>It has the smell of a rich luxurious perfume at a much affordable price.</li>
            <li>It came in super fast.</li>
            <li>it is not a bad smell if you are an older woman</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to reapply other perfumes (which I don&#x27;t like to do) but this blends beautifully with my natural scent and lasts me the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty smell......</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Will order more later.</li>
            <li>so so much!</li>
            <li>+ people, I&#x27;ve yet to hear anyone say anything positive about it.</li>
            <li>I love how the smell lasts on me all day long</li>
            <li>it really is a good smelling fragrance and long lasting as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I smelt it on one of those little paper flaps in the Avon brochure and liked by the time I decide to order it</li>
            <li>the Rare Pearls smells better than the much more expensive</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So much so it&#x27;s become &amp;</li>
            <li>Also, I do remember opening the first box and that bottle of perfume was only 2/3 full.  </li>
            <li>It is nice, but a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li>Product as expected,  delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from people who thought that it was a much more expensive, high end perfume.</li>
            <li>I will purchase Avon Rare Pearls in the future.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and I wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I tried the new</li>
            <li>The box for this &#x27;new&#x27;??</li>
            <li>Its nice not strong intense smell but subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li>If anyone is telling you this is a good scent, they are bad friends or are lying to you for a laugh.</li>
            <li>I will stick to far away</li>
            <li>The bottle had to many scratches on it, the box presented serious damage and this perfume was suppose to be a gift</li>
            <li>- it is so hard to find a fragrance you like only to have it seem like it has been changed after so many years.</li>
            <li>Not sure what has happened to Rare Pearls</li>

            <li> - it is so hard to find a fragrance you like only to have it seem like it has been changed after so many years.</li>
            <li> Not sure what has happened to Rare Pearls</li>
            <li> It last all day long when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> I opened the last bottle last week and it was not Rare Pearls</li>
            <li> The bottle, or the liquid inside the bottle, is a different shade than the one I bought from Avon previously.  </li>
            <li> That all ended with last few shipments I received from a variety of sources.  </li>
            <li> I was almost out of my other bottle came just in time.</li>
            <li> The only reason no one has told her is we are all afraid of getting reported to human resources.  </li>
            <li> Which at the time I had practically used half the bottle ! ..</li>
            <li> I spent my money on 1 used bottle of perfume, 1 bottle of cheap disgusting perfume i can&#x27;t wear and</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks really horrible overpowering smells gross like musty rust</li>
            <li> Currently very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this seller for switching boxes to give me a perfume I hate!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So thankful you had it.</li>
            <li> I Love this scent.  And it last all day!</li>
            <li> I tried the new In Bloom and then I bought the Rare Pearls in the Shimmering Powder to give it a try.  I love it.  I just bought the Shower Gel for only $5.00.  IMHO the Rare Pearls smells better than the much more expensive In Bloom, and , it lasts longer.  I will soon be getting the perfume and the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Pretty smell......People tell me that it smells so clean! Priced great on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> The box for this &#x27;new&#x27;?? bottle of Rare Pearls wasn&#x27;t sealed, and looked like it may have been opened.  The bottle, or the liquid inside the bottle, is a different shade than the one I bought from Avon previously.  The fragrance seems ok.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me the gift set about 6 years ago and I instantly fell in love with the smell. I love that whenever I wear it, people always ask me what I am wearing. I gave some of my friends the perfume or gift set and they loved it too!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t describe what it is about the scent that makes it so sweet but I am able to wear this and smell it when I move throughout the day. I sometimes have to reapply other perfumes (which I don&#x27;t like to do) but this blends beautifully with my natural scent and lasts me the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Received package in the allotted time.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> you guys sold me a fake spray, this spray doesn&#x27;t last for 5mins, i am very disappointed with guys..I need to be compensated</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.  I have no idea why so many people think it&#x27;s a good scent.  It smells like mold, flowers, and vomit.  One of the ladies at work wears this stuff and it fills the room when she walks in and it lingers 5 minutes after she leaves.  I work with around 80+ people, I&#x27;ve yet to hear anyone say anything positive about it. The only reason no one has told her is we are all afraid of getting reported to human resources.  If anyone is telling you this is a good scent, they are bad friends or are lying to you for a laugh.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother on her birthday and she adores the scent. When she learned that her beauty supplier discontinued it, she freaked out because this was the same perfume that my father bought her on their wedding night 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I love RARE PEARLS from Avon no one was selling it around me anymore so I thought let me just look and see if it is here, and to my surprise there it was I ordered on the spot. It came in super fast. I was almost out of my other bottle came just in time. Love it. Will order more later.</li>
            <li> I was totally satisfied with this product, Thanx</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrance from Avon. I love the and would give this as a gift to anyone. I can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to agree totally with the last customers review. rare pearls has become my signature fragrance because it smells soooo!!! good. i get compliments every time i wear it from both men and women. it really is a good smelling fragrance and long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> The bottle had to many scratches on it, the box presented serious damage and this perfume was suppose to be a gift and I couldn&#x27;t give in those conditions.</li>
            <li> Was extremely happy to find this - everyone comments how wonderful this smells when I where it.  No clue as to why Avon discontinued this.</li>
            <li> Rare pearls is a great awesome smell.  I love how the smell lasts on me all day long and I can still smell it on my clothes.

            <li> I keep getting lots of compliments whenever I use this perfume</li>
            <li> Not sure what has happened to Rare Pearls but the fragrance is not the same.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on the scent.  So much so it&#x27;s become &amp;#34;my personal fragrance&amp;#34; folks actually know I&#x27;m in the room.  That all ended with last few shipments I received from a variety of sources.  It is almost like there is no fragrance at all - in fact just recently I was asked why I stopped wearing my perfume.  Which at the time I had practically used half the bottle ! .. Suffice to say I purchased from various sources - vendors online and even Avon - all the same outcome.  I&#x27;m going to contact Avon but wanted to let folks know of my experience - it is so hard to find a fragrance you like only to have it seem like it has been changed after so many years. Currently very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want to have a lasting impression, feel wonderful, this is the perfum to get.  Outside of Sunnie Skys that Avon has offered&lt;br /&gt;Reare Pearls is on my list to get every time.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks really horrible overpowering smells gross like musty rust do not buy this  trust me save your money I will stick to far away</li>
            <li> rear pearls i don&#x27;t ever do without one on my dresser &#x27;I love the fragrance and it stays on for a while on my body</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of Avon perfume.  I get compliments all the time.  This has a timeless aroma, my sister loves it too.</li>
            <li> I really love this parfum spray. It last all day long when you spray it on. I really love this Rare Pearls by Avon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I wear it almost everyday. I get a lot if compliments all the time. The service and the timely matter that I receive my purchase is great and I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
