            <li>and I am super happy.</li>
            <li>It also cleans very easily too.</li>

            <li>I have been using it for quite a while now, and I love that it works well, and doesn&#x27;t shed bristles at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush in hopes that it would apply my liquid foundation with a better coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush for my cream foundation.</li>
            <li>What could be better?  </li>
            <li>I can even say it works better than that one.</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of the Eco Tools makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>

            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the EcoTools brushes.</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>this brush is better than clinques.  </li>
            <li>I love it because I used to apply foundation using my fingers and it would look and feel cake-y</li>
            <li>I love Ecotools and this brush is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I love EcoTools brand, and this brush lives up to their reputation.</li>

            <li>I love eco tools brushes and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Love EcoTools brushes.</li>
            <li>Has not lost hairs on me, even after washing many times.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, it&#x27;s just me, I find the beauty blender better at applying foundations.</li>
            <li>I love this brush but after about six weeks of use, the bristles start to shed.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much better my mineral makeup looks when I use this.</li>
            <li>It did seem like I used more foundation when I use the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>this brush was ok out of habit, I thought I needed to stop using my hands to put on my foundation, and purchase this brush</li>
            <li>well again it was OK</li>
            <li>It is better than using a sponge which absorbs your foundation</li>
            <li>but I mostly love Eco-tools for their earth-conscious and cruelty-free principals.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>If you love to apply face makeup this way than I would recommend it</li>
            <li>Love this brush, just wish it came with a cap or something.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It is better than using my fingers</li>
            <li>Like it, don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Ok for the pricepoint.</li>
            <li>I love this brush because it makes it easier for me to apply foundation to my face.</li>
            <li>But I truly love this one way way better then</li>
            <li>Again not my favorite</li>
            <li>I love this brush and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of cosmetic Brushes for all types</li>
            <li>, so now I&#x27;m put the foundation on with my fingers and just use this to make sure its evened out.  </li>
            <li>but i love my brush.</li>
            <li>I needed a better ciudad ion brush.</li>
            <li>I love that this product was made in a sustainable way and that it won&#x27;t adversely affect your skin.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d like it if there were some sort of plastic cover just for the top part.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product I was pleased with the quality,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>i need to replace them more often than i do, and i can never wash them as well as they claim they can be washed...</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, this means more stroking on broader areas as the cheeks, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff, but I don&#x27;t find that</li>
            <li>I cleaned the brush, and discovered it was holding a lot more makeup than I realized.</li>
            <li>Slightly bigger than the Mac foundation brush, but works wonderful for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>This foundation brush is so fantastic!</li>
            <li>love these brushes - the brand is good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>; item, it was also very economical!  </li>
            <li>They are affordable, adorable, and animal/eco friendly!</li>
            <li>It is great quality for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super cheap and \\&quot;green\\&quot;!!  </li>
            <li>Super soft and works great!</li>
            <li>I read a couple of the reviews &amp; was assured that my first inclination to like it was probably a good one.</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this brush.</li>
            <li>The EcoTools Foundation brush does a pretty good job smoothing foundation.</li>
            <li>I had my first one for 2 good years.</li>
            <li>Plus, its eco friendly!</li>
            <li>It cleaned easily and well, and I love the shape.</li>
            <li>I love how easily my foundation gets on with this.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean which is nice too.</li>
            <li>Good distribution of makeup, good coverage, but still working out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, lightweight, and durable to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Brush is easy to use and gives a very clean look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smooths my foundation on very nicely.</li>
            <li>They give great coverage, pickup makeup well, and feel so soft on your face.</li>
            <li>The smallness of the brush really didn&#x27;t seem to take that much more time to apply, but definitely worth it with how great it works.</li>
            <li>Love this brush - it does a fantastic job when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>When I put my foundation on with this, it is somewhat streaky, so I use a blush brush to give it a more even and smooth look.</li>
            <li>It is soft and great.</li>
            <li>so I really wanted something that does a good job on applying the foundation.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job blending my foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very economical and I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this brush!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other foundation brushes and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I got one of the Up &amp; Up foundation brushes from Target and, although it doesn&#x27;t match all my other bamboo brushes, it&#x27;s been working great and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles yet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good quality with smooth, solid bristles.</li>
            <li>It makes application so easy and my foundation always comes out even.  </li>
            <li>You could easily use it for contouring or foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It does leave some strikes but they are easily covered with the sealing powder afterwards.</li>
            <li>Washes and dries easy.</li>
            <li>it has good quality as far as being appropriate to put on your makeup</li>
            <li>For the first couple of months I liked it.</li>
            <li>I washed this brush with cool water and soap and most of the bristles are falling out.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe a cheap (under $10) comparing to shiseido $30 but given such an amazing result, even a more convenient application &amp; much better outcome!</li>
            <li>cruelty free, bamboo, easy to hold, easy to use.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a great value (if you go through them as much as I do), that work just like the higher priced pro brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for $5</li>
            <li>The bristles are fine and soft, which feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>It applies the foundation smoothly for an even appearance</li>
            <li>Then I smooth the brushstrokes on my face a bit with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>She says her foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>I guess this brush was cheap for a reason....</li>
            <li>I use this with mousse foundation (Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Smooth Mousse line)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Spreads foundation smoothly and without streaks.</li>
            <li>The foundations is applied smoothly and evenly and the brush doesn&#x27;t lose bristles.</li>
            <li>It does applies the make up smoothly and streak-free.</li>
            <li>This brush is still in great condition after a year of daily use and cleanings.</li>
            <li>This is such a great foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth and apply the make-up well.</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to clean and reshape.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s your definition of cruelty free?</li>
            <li>Really easy to clean</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing enjoy it thanks.</li>
            <li>love ecotools, thanks for creating this brand :)</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market for just as reasonable of prices.</li>
            <li>Good quality, soft bristles</li>
            <li>It leaves a very nice finish and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Easy control, the bristles are nice and soft and there is NO shedding!  </li>
            <li>The brush is smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>When my brush arrived I was very pleased with how soft the bristles were.  </li>
            <li>Puts makeup on evenly, cleans without fuss and it&#x27;s eco friendly -</li>
            <li>Fell in love with the whole line of these brushes!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this foundation brush.</li>
            <li>For the money-totally worth checking it out for yourself!</li>
            <li>I read all the praises on here, and with all the enviromentally friendly looking packaging and whatnot, I decided to go for this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I received a foundation brush by Stila for Christmas; since Stila has some nice products, I decided to put my Ecotools brush into storage and switch to this new one.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to apply my makeup incredibly quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This brush also dries well after you clean it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so smooth and soft yet effective for applying my foundation.</li>
            <li>I dont use it anymore, but when i was trying it out i would have to clean it every day.</li>
            <li>so I always have a clean one to use.</li>
            <li>On top of that...the brush itself gunks up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>A great buy for a cheap price compared to other eco-friendly foundation brushes out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush and worth the price!</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t detach from the metal part of the brush and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The handle is soft and feels nice to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for foundation anymore because it really soaks up most of my product.</li>
            <li>My two favorite brands of make-up brushes now are both Ecotools and Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase this brush again if I were to lose it or leave it somewhere by accident, because it&#x27;s such good quality I don&#x27;t see it breaking.</li>
            <li>It also swallowed up a good quarter of my foundation that I dabbed on my face beforehand while blending it in, and I know this because the amount I dabbed onto my face is just enough when I just use my fingers to spread the foundation.</li>
            <li>By the way I use Loreal True Match</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and good quality and my foundation become much nicer in my skin since I started making up with it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find I could buy just the foundation brush on amazon.com, as I did not need to replace the other brushes in my set.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, but when I use it to apply my liquid foundation, it leaves streaks and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as some other brushes</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>The EcoTools Flat Foundation brush is good for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many brushes in my 10+ years as a makeup artist and its really hard to find a great foundation brush</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job blending my foundation to the amount of coverage I want and even is tapered enough at the end to fill in those smaller spots (like around my eyebrows and nose grooves).  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful foundation brush without the cost of the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>This foundation brush is fantastic, I use it for concealer only for which it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Have used others that shed and do not apply an even layer unlike this brush that applies creams and liquids quickly.</li>
            <li>but I lost it and needed a quick fix.</li>
            <li>but it cleans quickly and dries quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of brushes both drugstore and high end</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and my foundation applies very smoothly when I use it.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t love these brushes for foundation and instead use a flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>but this one gives more of a full coverage look but surprisingly did not make the makeup look or feel any heavier then usual.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t wait long for it it;s good</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation brush and found it to be very useful when applying my mousse type foundation.</li>
            <li>Not super great.</li>
            <li>Foundation well n has very little hairs that come out of the brush easy to clean good quality</li>
            <li>my first product of ecotools and since then i&#x27;m hooked by their quality!</li>
            <li>I really love this brand of brushes, they&#x27;re SO soft and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li>It does blends my make up well, making my skin look naturally glowing with a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of the Eco Tools, but find the Flat Foundation Brush to spread your foundation not as good as a full coverage brush.  </li>
            <li>Right amount and very natural looking effect, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Coming from the cheap brushes, I really like the EcoTools brands brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine eco tools brush and works very well for foundation applying.  </li>
            <li>The Real Techniques face brush was much easier to use and applied products more evenly.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this brush is</li>
            <li>This is a really nice brush and advertised at a very low price.</li>
            <li>While comparing several foundation brushes, I again came upon Ecotools, &amp; was reminded how much I liked it at Target.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I felt the brush didn&#x27;t blend as well and kind of left a streaky look.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: this brush is built just as well,  and the brush heads just as precisely cut and/or angled, as any &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brush, many of which I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li>I love this brush - I decided to completely revamp and update my cosmetics collection and decided to try the EcoTools collection.  </li>
            <li>Its nice and soft and works really well.  </li>
            <li>I hope to get more Eco brushes as my old ones wear out.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Perfectly soft and smooth bristles produced a smooth, even coat of foundation.</li>
            <li>Economical price</li>
            <li>The top is so flat and fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really earth friendly, which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>it hits all the right shopper buttons.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount softness and springiness for blending in foundation.</li>
            <li>When I first started wearing foundation, I bought in a cheap brush (from ELF) to test out the whole routine.</li>
            <li>Just needed something to round up my order for free shipping and was very glad this product qualified.</li>
            <li>I also have the Bare Essentials brushes and they&#x27;re more scratchy and the bristles shed onto your face.</li>
            <li>clean the brush, I first soap it up in baby shampoo and water, rinse, squeeze out the water, and then dunk the whole brush in isopropyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I liked this brush for a long time, until I started breaking out!</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Bare Minerals brushes but was looking for a brush with this exact shape and almost bought the Sigma kabuki set of four brushes for $55.</li>
            <li>It took about 10 minutes, which isn&#x27;t long but honestly, when you first buy something</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my two purchases from Ecotools (the other one is the eye shadow brush 6-piece travel set).</li>
            <li>This is my first foundation brush, it&#x27;s soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times with liquid foundations, and have not often been pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this foundation brush along with the concealer one for over a year, and i really like them!</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much easier foundation application is with it!  </li>
            <li>I kind of doubt the brush since it was not very pricy</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re able to pay more, definitely look at higher-quality brushes that will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I ordered it, received it, tried it several times, &amp; am here to declare my love for it.</li>
            <li>I actually use it more to blend concealer because I use the beauty blender as my foundation applyer.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure it has something to do with the design and wasn&#x27;t specific to the unit that I received.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely try more products from this line.</li>
            <li>Bristles started falling off just after first cleanup.</li>
            <li>I love this line and only buy them.</li>
            <li>I like more sheer coverage</li>
            <li>Though it did not come with any form of cleaning tips which may have saved time searching google for mediocre tips that may not suit this brush the best.</li>
            <li>This was my first foundation brush</li>
            <li>It holds up and works like it did the first time.</li>
            <li>I have tried special soap for brushes and even dish soap and nothing has gotten my brush fully clean, even after several washes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles, bristles are soft, wand is just the right length and diameter for a perfect grip and the brush head as a whole is very thick and dense.</li>
            <li>and it goes a long way, giving a very smooth, even finish.</li>
            <li>I love my flat foundation brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft, effective and last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just because it costs more doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>Only reason it got 4 stars though is because the bristles come out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve gone through three of these brushes, and all three started falling apart within a week of being washed for the first time (with Cetaphil gentle face cleanser and water.)</li>
            <li>Small size is good for contoured areas of the face</li>
            <li>I am actually new to this makeup thing, but the brush is soft and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance.</li>
            <li>Super soft, can leave lines if careless/not maintained.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the color of the actual brush is not as pictured, mine was a light beige</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to wash, though depending on your products, you may have to be extra thorough.</li>
            <li>Considering the crazy prices for brushes like these (Mac wants over $30 for one!), this one is great!</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely amazing, i have previously bought brushes from ecotools and i absolutely love every single one of them.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, I use it every single morning.</li>
            <li>no so long ago, so any kind of improvement was gonna be great, but then i tried this brands, and the other brand, and the next one, not a single foundation brush seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually still working fine</li>
            <li>Easy to clean - after each use I just run it under water, put a little soap on my hand, then rub it around and rinse</li>
            <li>I would suggest giving this little brush a try, and if you pick it up from Ulta you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose since they&#x27;re return policy is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a bit smaller than some but hardly a huge issue.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth, well-tapered for the task at hand, with the proper balance between firmness and softness.  </li>
            <li>against your skin, i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much makeup</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple of weeks, &amp;</li>
            <li>I have the Kabuki brush set from EcoTools as well, and I much prefer using them to apply my make up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush a couple days ago, and received the brush very promptly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this brush much because it feels scratchy on my face.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Instead of spending soooo much money on MAC brushes or Sephora brushes, EcoTools does it all and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>so much I got one for my mom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much of a problem</li>
            <li>Cost efficient and they work very well.</li>
            <li>At the cost, I couldn&#x27;t afford not to since she talked it up so much.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to order just a couple ecotools brushes instead of a whole set</li>
            <li>I had to sit there, and gently yank it off the bristles, so that I didn&#x27;t ruin the brush.</li>
            <li>like that it does not absorb much of the foundation.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb much foundation</li>
            <li>Sometimes, especially near my eyes, it feels scratchy.</li>
            <li>It makes the application of foundation so much easier than it is with sponges.</li>
            <li>The brush altogether is very well made.</li>
            <li>which is very soon, I think.</li>
            <li>and it spreads it very evenly without absorbing the product.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it leaves a nice airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>The density of the brush was good, not too thick.</li>
            <li>Very soft yet strong enough to apply foundation all over the face.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as my old one, if not better</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it so much I have bought other brushes from this company!</li>
            <li>I have expensive natural hair brushes, but I go more often to my EcoTools, as they are so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>back to this item, right size for face to apply liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>Clean with some isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s back to new.  </li>
            <li>More expensive brushes don&#x27;t do any better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more brushes from ecotools in the future!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since i am waring basic make up everyday now, a good foundation brush is a must to me, plus the eco factor is also attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some have complained about an odor on the bristles, I believe, but I have experienced no such odor.  </li>
            <li>She swears by this particular foundation brush, so I decided to go for it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It leaves massive streaks on my face that I eventually have to blend out using my fingers because using the brush over it leaves even more smaller streaks.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies makeup really well.</li>
            <li>If your a beginner to makeup, the size of this foundation brush may be too small and overwhelming for you considering the amount of time it takes to properly apply and blend foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this brush</li>
            <li>I might end up using it as large concealer brush because its too soft and luxurious not to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot describe how unbelievably soft the bristles of the brush are!!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little better, for the price</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and non irritating and I love that the company is eco friendly.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely consider rebuying it when it gets old and used and I am ready for a fresh one.</li>
            <li>However, there are a few foundations that I have that I&#x27;ve heard go on better when applied with a brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good but ill</li>
            <li>I was glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on that brush and went for this one instead.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd brush from Real Techniques and the quality never failed me.</li>
            <li>The other Eco Tools brushes seem to work fine, but steer clear of the foundation brush!</li>
            <li>but I want to keep a new one at hand just in case I need it..</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, so much that I come back to it every time I get a new foundation thinking--maybe, just maybe,</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was a good width, not too wide or narrow.</li>
            <li>even more obviously so when wet.</li>
            <li>It has not shed a single bristle, despite my washing it multiple times (which also is easy - it come out brand new!)</li>
            <li>I used my old EcoTools Flat Foundation Brush for so long that it was worn out, so I&#x27;ve ordered a new one - can&#x27;t imagine anything being better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, too.</li>
            <li>I liked the brush because it was stiff enough to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>Very soft, makes foundation application pretty simple.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>I usually use a large kabuki style brush that provides light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is perfect for applying base for under mineral makeup (Jane Iredale amazing base try is amazing), or for liquid tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to feel good putting on foundation, but firm enough to contour the makeup and dab under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I own many brushes from this band, and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li>This brush is small enough to handle nicely, kind of like a pen.</li>
            <li>I bought a bigger brush a long time ago and have recently begun to buy more of these.</li>
            <li>finally bought a new brush to replace my real techniques foundation brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of stiff, not a soft brush.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this brush, especially for how little I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Small size requires more strokes on the broad areas of the face</li>
            <li>So soft and blends evenly</li>
            <li>they are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soft, they dont shed, and it comes in a re-usable pouch.</li>
            <li>The brush head is much fuller and bigger in dimension, helping speed the process a lot, while also making it easier to apply and blend the foundation.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft, and I don&#x27;t have to use my hands anymore to put on foundation.</li>
            <li>Sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and perfectly soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>This brush has a soft texture, but I find it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as a rounded shaped brush.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch but holds its shape.</li>
            <li>Just as described, soft natural bristles.</li>
            <li>I have just continued to use my old one that I bought this one to replace.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this brush is so soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>The brush held up well and was soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft when you are brushing with the grain, but if you accidentally push it forward, it can irritate.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, and it&#x27;s never shed on me.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be (and smaller than most foundation brushes).</li>
            <li>Super soft and fluffy but applies like a dream.</li>
            <li>It is just big enough to sweep over large areas but small enough to still be able to get the under eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some other less sensitive skin persons may like it, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Flat foundation brushes actually do nothing, a fact I wish I was aware of when I bought this.</li>
            <li>this brush is still strong with numerous \\&quot;CLEANINGS\\&quot; since I can&#x27;t stand to rub the same dirty brush on my face for more than 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>It is very soft yet still rigid enough to hold and apply product.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very soft, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>most likely replace them, maybe look at a set little more expensive to get what I need.</li>
            <li>Stiff enough to create precise lines yet soft enough to not aggravate my sensetive skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure, tough, that every so often, you wash the brush with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This brush does a great job and spreads foundation evenly, and doesn&#x27;t suck up liquid foundation as bad as sponge applicators do</li>
            <li>Just recently I threw my old Estee Lauder foundation brush away, the handle shattered when I dropped it on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>same professional finish in every application.</li>
            <li>Their brushes are soft and they pick up just enough powder for the application of make-up.</li>
            <li>Right at the top with the very expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Not a single bristle has come loose yet, either, which is another mark of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I must have gotten an odd brush, because after 83 positive reviews I didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels nice and soft but a little on the brush fibers feels a bit on the thin side.</li>
            <li>how it made my foundation less streaky and in general look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed that my foundation wasn&#x27;t coming out very matted down to my skin if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>But after a few weeks the bristles started coming out, slowly at first then several at a time and they would get stuck to my face while trying to put on foundation.</li>
            <li>I recently had to replace it, in late 2016 (the first one lasted 6 years!)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You get a much more even look and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.</li>

            <li> I have been using it for quite a while now, and I love that it works well, and doesn&#x27;t shed bristles at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in hopes that it would apply my liquid foundation with a better coverage.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush for my cream foundation.</li>
            <li> What could be better?  </li>

            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the EcoTools brushes.</li>
            <li> Foundation goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> this brush is better than clinques.  </li>
            <li> I love it because I used to apply foundation using my fingers and it would look and feel cake-y</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools and this brush is no exception.  </li>

            <li> Love EcoTools brushes.</li>
            <li> Has not lost hairs on me, even after washing many times.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, it&#x27;s just me, I find the beauty blender better at applying foundations.</li>
            <li> I love this brush but after about six weeks of use, the bristles start to shed.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much better my mineral makeup looks when I use this.</li>
            <li> It did seem like I used more foundation when I use the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> this brush was ok out of habit, I thought I needed to stop using my hands to put on my foundation, and purchase this brush</li>
            <li> well again it was OK</li>
            <li> It is better than using a sponge which absorbs your foundation</li>
            <li> but I mostly love Eco-tools for their earth-conscious and cruelty-free principals.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> If you love to apply face makeup this way than I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Love this brush, just wish it came with a cap or something.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It is better than using my fingers</li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Ok for the pricepoint.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because it makes it easier for me to apply foundation to my face.</li>
            <li> But I truly love this one way way better then</li>
            <li> Again not my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I love this line of cosmetic Brushes for all types</li>
            <li> , so now I&#x27;m put the foundation on with my fingers and just use this to make sure its evened out.  </li>
            <li> but i love my brush.</li>
            <li> I needed a better ciudad ion brush.</li>
            <li> I love that this product was made in a sustainable way and that it won&#x27;t adversely affect your skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d like it if there were some sort of plastic cover just for the top part.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I was pleased with the quality,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> i need to replace them more often than i do, and i can never wash them as well as they claim they can be washed...</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, this means more stroking on broader areas as the cheeks, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff, but I don&#x27;t find that</li>
            <li> I cleaned the brush, and discovered it was holding a lot more makeup than I realized.</li>
            <li> Slightly bigger than the Mac foundation brush, but works wonderful for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> This foundation brush is so fantastic!</li>
            <li> love these brushes - the brand is good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> ; item, it was also very economical!  </li>
            <li> They are affordable, adorable, and animal/eco friendly!</li>
            <li> It is great quality for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super cheap and \\&quot;green\\&quot;!!  </li>
            <li> Super soft and works great!</li>
            <li> I read a couple of the reviews &amp; was assured that my first inclination to like it was probably a good one.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this brush.</li>
            <li> The EcoTools Foundation brush does a pretty good job smoothing foundation.</li>
            <li> I had my first one for 2 good years.</li>
            <li> Plus, its eco friendly!</li>
            <li> It cleaned easily and well, and I love the shape.</li>
            <li> I love how easily my foundation gets on with this.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean which is nice too.</li>
            <li> Good distribution of makeup, good coverage, but still working out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, lightweight, and durable to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Brush is easy to use and gives a very clean look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and smooths my foundation on very nicely.</li>
            <li> They give great coverage, pickup makeup well, and feel so soft on your face.</li>
            <li> The smallness of the brush really didn&#x27;t seem to take that much more time to apply, but definitely worth it with how great it works.</li>
            <li> Love this brush - it does a fantastic job when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> When I put my foundation on with this, it is somewhat streaky, so I use a blush brush to give it a more even and smooth look.</li>
            <li> It is soft and great.</li>
            <li> so I really wanted something that does a good job on applying the foundation.  </li>
            <li> It really does a good job blending my foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very economical and I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this brush!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other foundation brushes and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I got one of the Up &amp; Up foundation brushes from Target and, although it doesn&#x27;t match all my other bamboo brushes, it&#x27;s been working great and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles yet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good quality with smooth, solid bristles.</li>
            <li> It makes application so easy and my foundation always comes out even.  </li>
            <li> You could easily use it for contouring or foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE that it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It does leave some strikes but they are easily covered with the sealing powder afterwards.</li>
            <li> Washes and dries easy.</li>
            <li> it has good quality as far as being appropriate to put on your makeup</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months I liked it.</li>
            <li> I washed this brush with cool water and soap and most of the bristles are falling out.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe a cheap (under $10) comparing to shiseido $30 but given such an amazing result, even a more convenient application &amp; much better outcome!</li>
            <li> cruelty free, bamboo, easy to hold, easy to use.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a great value (if you go through them as much as I do), that work just like the higher priced pro brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for $5</li>
            <li> The bristles are fine and soft, which feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> It applies the foundation smoothly for an even appearance</li>
            <li> Then I smooth the brushstrokes on my face a bit with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> She says her foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> I guess this brush was cheap for a reason....</li>
            <li> I use this with mousse foundation (Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Smooth Mousse line)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Spreads foundation smoothly and without streaks.</li>
            <li> The foundations is applied smoothly and evenly and the brush doesn&#x27;t lose bristles.</li>
            <li> It does applies the make up smoothly and streak-free.</li>
            <li> This brush is still in great condition after a year of daily use and cleanings.</li>
            <li> This is such a great foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are smooth and apply the make-up well.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to clean and reshape.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s your definition of cruelty free?</li>
            <li> Really easy to clean</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing enjoy it thanks.</li>
            <li> love ecotools, thanks for creating this brand :)</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market for just as reasonable of prices.</li>
            <li> Good quality, soft bristles</li>
            <li> It leaves a very nice finish and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy control, the bristles are nice and soft and there is NO shedding!  </li>
            <li> The brush is smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> When my brush arrived I was very pleased with how soft the bristles were.  </li>
            <li> Puts makeup on evenly, cleans without fuss and it&#x27;s eco friendly -</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the whole line of these brushes!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this foundation brush.</li>
            <li> For the money-totally worth checking it out for yourself!</li>
            <li> I read all the praises on here, and with all the enviromentally friendly looking packaging and whatnot, I decided to go for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I received a foundation brush by Stila for Christmas; since Stila has some nice products, I decided to put my Ecotools brush into storage and switch to this new one.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to apply my makeup incredibly quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This brush also dries well after you clean it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so smooth and soft yet effective for applying my foundation.</li>
            <li> I dont use it anymore, but when i was trying it out i would have to clean it every day.</li>
            <li> so I always have a clean one to use.</li>
            <li> On top of that...the brush itself gunks up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> A great buy for a cheap price compared to other eco-friendly foundation brushes out there.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush and worth the price!</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t detach from the metal part of the brush and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The handle is soft and feels nice to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for foundation anymore because it really soaks up most of my product.</li>
            <li> My two favorite brands of make-up brushes now are both Ecotools and Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase this brush again if I were to lose it or leave it somewhere by accident, because it&#x27;s such good quality I don&#x27;t see it breaking.</li>
            <li> It also swallowed up a good quarter of my foundation that I dabbed on my face beforehand while blending it in, and I know this because the amount I dabbed onto my face is just enough when I just use my fingers to spread the foundation.</li>
            <li> By the way I use Loreal True Match</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and good quality and my foundation become much nicer in my skin since I started making up with it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find I could buy just the foundation brush on amazon.com, as I did not need to replace the other brushes in my set.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, but when I use it to apply my liquid foundation, it leaves streaks and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as some other brushes</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> The EcoTools Flat Foundation brush is good for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many brushes in my 10+ years as a makeup artist and its really hard to find a great foundation brush</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job blending my foundation to the amount of coverage I want and even is tapered enough at the end to fill in those smaller spots (like around my eyebrows and nose grooves).  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foundation brush without the cost of the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> This foundation brush is fantastic, I use it for concealer only for which it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Have used others that shed and do not apply an even layer unlike this brush that applies creams and liquids quickly.</li>
            <li> but I lost it and needed a quick fix.</li>
            <li> but it cleans quickly and dries quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of brushes both drugstore and high end</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and my foundation applies very smoothly when I use it.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t love these brushes for foundation and instead use a flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> but this one gives more of a full coverage look but surprisingly did not make the makeup look or feel any heavier then usual.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t wait long for it it;s good</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush and found it to be very useful when applying my mousse type foundation.</li>
            <li> Not super great.</li>
            <li> Foundation well n has very little hairs that come out of the brush easy to clean good quality</li>
            <li> my first product of ecotools and since then i&#x27;m hooked by their quality!</li>
            <li> I really love this brand of brushes, they&#x27;re SO soft and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> It does blends my make up well, making my skin look naturally glowing with a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the Eco Tools, but find the Flat Foundation Brush to spread your foundation not as good as a full coverage brush.  </li>
            <li> Right amount and very natural looking effect, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Coming from the cheap brushes, I really like the EcoTools brands brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine eco tools brush and works very well for foundation applying.  </li>
            <li> The Real Techniques face brush was much easier to use and applied products more evenly.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this brush is</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush and advertised at a very low price.</li>
            <li> While comparing several foundation brushes, I again came upon Ecotools, &amp; was reminded how much I liked it at Target.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I felt the brush didn&#x27;t blend as well and kind of left a streaky look.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: this brush is built just as well,  and the brush heads just as precisely cut and/or angled, as any &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brush, many of which I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li> I love this brush - I decided to completely revamp and update my cosmetics collection and decided to try the EcoTools collection.  </li>
            <li> Its nice and soft and works really well.  </li>
            <li> I hope to get more Eco brushes as my old ones wear out.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly soft and smooth bristles produced a smooth, even coat of foundation.</li>
            <li> Economical price</li>
            <li> The top is so flat and fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really earth friendly, which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> it hits all the right shopper buttons.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount softness and springiness for blending in foundation.</li>
            <li> When I first started wearing foundation, I bought in a cheap brush (from ELF) to test out the whole routine.</li>
            <li> Just needed something to round up my order for free shipping and was very glad this product qualified.</li>
            <li> I also have the Bare Essentials brushes and they&#x27;re more scratchy and the bristles shed onto your face.</li>
            <li> clean the brush, I first soap it up in baby shampoo and water, rinse, squeeze out the water, and then dunk the whole brush in isopropyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I liked this brush for a long time, until I started breaking out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Bare Minerals brushes but was looking for a brush with this exact shape and almost bought the Sigma kabuki set of four brushes for $55.</li>
            <li> It took about 10 minutes, which isn&#x27;t long but honestly, when you first buy something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my two purchases from Ecotools (the other one is the eye shadow brush 6-piece travel set).</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush, it&#x27;s soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times with liquid foundations, and have not often been pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this foundation brush along with the concealer one for over a year, and i really like them!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much easier foundation application is with it!  </li>
            <li> I kind of doubt the brush since it was not very pricy</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re able to pay more, definitely look at higher-quality brushes that will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I ordered it, received it, tried it several times, &amp; am here to declare my love for it.</li>
            <li> I actually use it more to blend concealer because I use the beauty blender as my foundation applyer.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure it has something to do with the design and wasn&#x27;t specific to the unit that I received.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely try more products from this line.</li>
            <li> Bristles started falling off just after first cleanup.</li>
            <li> I love this line and only buy them.</li>
            <li> I like more sheer coverage</li>
            <li> Though it did not come with any form of cleaning tips which may have saved time searching google for mediocre tips that may not suit this brush the best.</li>
            <li> This was my first foundation brush</li>
            <li> It holds up and works like it did the first time.</li>
            <li> I have tried special soap for brushes and even dish soap and nothing has gotten my brush fully clean, even after several washes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles, bristles are soft, wand is just the right length and diameter for a perfect grip and the brush head as a whole is very thick and dense.</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way, giving a very smooth, even finish.</li>
            <li> I love my flat foundation brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft, effective and last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just because it costs more doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> Only reason it got 4 stars though is because the bristles come out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve gone through three of these brushes, and all three started falling apart within a week of being washed for the first time (with Cetaphil gentle face cleanser and water.)</li>
            <li> Small size is good for contoured areas of the face</li>
            <li> I am actually new to this makeup thing, but the brush is soft and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance.</li>
            <li> Super soft, can leave lines if careless/not maintained.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the color of the actual brush is not as pictured, mine was a light beige</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to wash, though depending on your products, you may have to be extra thorough.</li>
            <li> Considering the crazy prices for brushes like these (Mac wants over $30 for one!), this one is great!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing, i have previously bought brushes from ecotools and i absolutely love every single one of them.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I use it every single morning.</li>
            <li> no so long ago, so any kind of improvement was gonna be great, but then i tried this brands, and the other brand, and the next one, not a single foundation brush seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually still working fine</li>
            <li> Easy to clean - after each use I just run it under water, put a little soap on my hand, then rub it around and rinse</li>
            <li> I would suggest giving this little brush a try, and if you pick it up from Ulta you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose since they&#x27;re return policy is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a bit smaller than some but hardly a huge issue.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The bristles are smooth, well-tapered for the task at hand, with the proper balance between firmness and softness.  </li>
            <li> against your skin, i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much makeup</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple of weeks, &amp;</li>
            <li> I have the Kabuki brush set from EcoTools as well, and I much prefer using them to apply my make up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush a couple days ago, and received the brush very promptly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush much because it feels scratchy on my face.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Instead of spending soooo much money on MAC brushes or Sephora brushes, EcoTools does it all and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> so much I got one for my mom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much of a problem</li>
            <li> Cost efficient and they work very well.</li>
            <li> At the cost, I couldn&#x27;t afford not to since she talked it up so much.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to order just a couple ecotools brushes instead of a whole set</li>
            <li> I had to sit there, and gently yank it off the bristles, so that I didn&#x27;t ruin the brush.</li>
            <li> like that it does not absorb much of the foundation.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb much foundation</li>
            <li> Sometimes, especially near my eyes, it feels scratchy.</li>
            <li> It makes the application of foundation so much easier than it is with sponges.</li>
            <li> The brush altogether is very well made.</li>
            <li> which is very soon, I think.</li>
            <li> and it spreads it very evenly without absorbing the product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it leaves a nice airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> The density of the brush was good, not too thick.</li>
            <li> Very soft yet strong enough to apply foundation all over the face.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as my old one, if not better</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed it so much I have bought other brushes from this company!</li>
            <li> I have expensive natural hair brushes, but I go more often to my EcoTools, as they are so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> back to this item, right size for face to apply liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> Clean with some isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s back to new.  </li>
            <li> More expensive brushes don&#x27;t do any better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more brushes from ecotools in the future!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since i am waring basic make up everyday now, a good foundation brush is a must to me, plus the eco factor is also attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some have complained about an odor on the bristles, I believe, but I have experienced no such odor.  </li>
            <li> She swears by this particular foundation brush, so I decided to go for it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It leaves massive streaks on my face that I eventually have to blend out using my fingers because using the brush over it leaves even more smaller streaks.</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies makeup really well.</li>
            <li> If your a beginner to makeup, the size of this foundation brush may be too small and overwhelming for you considering the amount of time it takes to properly apply and blend foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this brush</li>
            <li> I might end up using it as large concealer brush because its too soft and luxurious not to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot describe how unbelievably soft the bristles of the brush are!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little better, for the price</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and non irritating and I love that the company is eco friendly.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely consider rebuying it when it gets old and used and I am ready for a fresh one.</li>
            <li> However, there are a few foundations that I have that I&#x27;ve heard go on better when applied with a brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good but ill</li>
            <li> I was glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on that brush and went for this one instead.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd brush from Real Techniques and the quality never failed me.</li>
            <li> The other Eco Tools brushes seem to work fine, but steer clear of the foundation brush!</li>
            <li> but I want to keep a new one at hand just in case I need it..</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, so much that I come back to it every time I get a new foundation thinking--maybe, just maybe,</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was a good width, not too wide or narrow.</li>
            <li> even more obviously so when wet.</li>
            <li> It has not shed a single bristle, despite my washing it multiple times (which also is easy - it come out brand new!)</li>
            <li> I used my old EcoTools Flat Foundation Brush for so long that it was worn out, so I&#x27;ve ordered a new one - can&#x27;t imagine anything being better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, too.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush because it was stiff enough to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Very soft, makes foundation application pretty simple.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> I usually use a large kabuki style brush that provides light to medium coverage</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is perfect for applying base for under mineral makeup (Jane Iredale amazing base try is amazing), or for liquid tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough to feel good putting on foundation, but firm enough to contour the makeup and dab under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I own many brushes from this band, and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush is small enough to handle nicely, kind of like a pen.</li>
            <li> I bought a bigger brush a long time ago and have recently begun to buy more of these.</li>
            <li> finally bought a new brush to replace my real techniques foundation brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of stiff, not a soft brush.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this brush, especially for how little I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Small size requires more strokes on the broad areas of the face</li>
            <li> So soft and blends evenly</li>
            <li> they are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soft, they dont shed, and it comes in a re-usable pouch.</li>
            <li> The brush head is much fuller and bigger in dimension, helping speed the process a lot, while also making it easier to apply and blend the foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft, and I don&#x27;t have to use my hands anymore to put on foundation.</li>
            <li> Sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and perfectly soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> This brush has a soft texture, but I find it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as a rounded shaped brush.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft to the touch but holds its shape.</li>
            <li> Just as described, soft natural bristles.</li>
            <li> I have just continued to use my old one that I bought this one to replace.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this brush is so soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> The brush held up well and was soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft when you are brushing with the grain, but if you accidentally push it forward, it can irritate.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, and it&#x27;s never shed on me.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be (and smaller than most foundation brushes).</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy but applies like a dream.</li>
            <li> It is just big enough to sweep over large areas but small enough to still be able to get the under eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some other less sensitive skin persons may like it, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Flat foundation brushes actually do nothing, a fact I wish I was aware of when I bought this.</li>
            <li> this brush is still strong with numerous \\&quot;CLEANINGS\\&quot; since I can&#x27;t stand to rub the same dirty brush on my face for more than 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> It is very soft yet still rigid enough to hold and apply product.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is very soft, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> most likely replace them, maybe look at a set little more expensive to get what I need.</li>
            <li> Stiff enough to create precise lines yet soft enough to not aggravate my sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure, tough, that every so often, you wash the brush with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This brush does a great job and spreads foundation evenly, and doesn&#x27;t suck up liquid foundation as bad as sponge applicators do</li>
            <li> Just recently I threw my old Estee Lauder foundation brush away, the handle shattered when I dropped it on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> same professional finish in every application.</li>
            <li> Their brushes are soft and they pick up just enough powder for the application of make-up.</li>
            <li> Right at the top with the very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Not a single bristle has come loose yet, either, which is another mark of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten an odd brush, because after 83 positive reviews I didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels nice and soft but a little on the brush fibers feels a bit on the thin side.</li>
            <li> how it made my foundation less streaky and in general look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that my foundation wasn&#x27;t coming out very matted down to my skin if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks the bristles started coming out, slowly at first then several at a time and they would get stuck to my face while trying to put on foundation.</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace it, in late 2016 (the first one lasted 6 years!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as other more expensive brushes I have, but it works almost as well as they do.</li>
            <li> This little foundation brush is now one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> I have moved towards these flat head brushes lately, and find them to be a lot easier to use, you use less foundation, and they give you an airbrushed look easily.</li>
            <li> In fact, there was an expensive brush I was interested in when I went to get the Ecotools foundation brush, but when I ran my hand across the bristles (gently, mind you...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, neither brushes 2 or 3 has lost clumps of bristles as badly as brush 1 did; they&#x27;re still usable, but they are losing enough bristles during makeup application that I spend some time every morning picking loose bristles off my face.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I noticed that there was this incredibly hard piece of (what I imagine</li>
            <li> I could honestly say that this brush works as well as expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve previously purchased.</li>
            <li> The one that I really want, the No7 foundation brush, is not available for purchase in the US (or anywhere online that ships to the US), so I really had to look hard for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Every morning it was a struggle to put foundation on -- the brush head is tiny, while the handle is ridiculously long.  </li>
            <li> When i bought it, tho, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a flat brush.</li>
            <li> I should have not bought a flat brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry by the next day.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft, and yet still firm enough to hold its shape well.</li>
            <li> Not great at blending but at painting on products quickly in an even layer.</li>
            <li> My other makeup brushes (drugstore finds and Bare Minerals cosmetics brushes, including the Ecotools concealer brush) have not had this problem after being cleaned</li>
            <li> They have outlasted other, more expensive brushes, and now it is my preferred brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little soft for what I like in a foundation brush, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I want to get that seamless foundation look, I use this.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting to purchase this brush for a long time but could not justify in-store price as I don&#x27;t have a pressing need for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush not to long ago</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal because once I set my wet makeup with powder, you don&#x27;t notice the streaks at all.</li>
            <li> Basically I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brush and the one I previously purchased from Estee Lauder which was about 5 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> In fact, excessive bristle loss was why I had to replace my first brush - half of the bristles</li>
            <li> I mean not 1 or 2 bristles, whole bunch of them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too stiff yet not too soft for applying.</li>
            <li> bought Ecotools foundation brushes 2 and 3 to replace brush 1 because I was feeling too lazy to shop around, so at the time paying $5 for a brush that would last four to six months was fine with me, but now I&#x27;m just annoyed.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush and other ecotools makeup brushes to anyone looking for inexpensive, quality brushes.</li>
            <li> After cleaning (soaking in water and tea tree oil &amp; letting it air dry) it began to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> I checked out several brands, MAC, Sonia Kushuk, Real Techniques, but all of those brushes were either too big, too small, too thick or too dense.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it every single day since i got it a month ago</li>
            <li> The bristles are appropriately stiff, yet soft and supple, and I have had absolutely NO problems with shedding through use or washing.  </li>
            <li> Like other Ecotools brushes, the bristles are soft but firm.</li>
            <li> Eco Tools are the only brushes I will use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used others in the past, but came directly back to Eco Tools, the brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less messy too (or not messy at all).</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little larger.  </li>
            <li> BIG NONO LITTLE SIS.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;&#x27;t like is that it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> The key is to let it &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; a little bit between uses.</li>
            <li> However, if you prefer a big brush, then you might want to look at other brushes or have both a big and small brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue is it can get a little cakey after one use, which was expected though.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to other high-end brands, quality-wise, while the price is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> Softest, non-shedding bristles in a great base for your makeup needs!</li>
            <li> If I am trying to use it and it is still moderately wet, I find it doesn&#x27;t blend as well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about the brush was that some of the bristles were shorter than the tip.</li>
            <li> However, the bristles feel extremely rough on my face.</li>
            <li> brush is only a little smaller than the ELF one (I was concerned because some of the reviews said it was too small) -</li>
            <li> works with virtually any foundation, liquid, pan stick, oily, cheap, expensive, you name it!</li>
            <li> This brush overall is too small to apply foundation unless you have lots of time to spare.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY downside was that I used three pumps of foundation rather than my usual two.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a makeup novice, so I cannot compare this brush to other foundation brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I use it for concealer since it&#x27;s small enough to work.</li>
            <li> However, other ECO brushes in those 5 &amp; 6 packs haven&#x27;t faired to well with coming apart at the stem.</li>
            <li> It is on the small size, but that is advantageous around contoured areas such as the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to apply highlighter, blush and occasionally, concealer, followed by a fluffy powder brush to blend everything together.</li>
            <li> Even when its dry, the bristles are uneven, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it has not shed a single bristle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked for Estee Lauder and their brushes are expensive and some are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> How annoying that it hasn&#x27;t seemed to bother so many others.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I can throw this in my makeup bag when I travel without worrying if the bristles will splay or get dirty--and I don&#x27;t need any other face brushes except my powder brush!</li>
            <li> Seeing as though I don&#x27;t want to use a dirty brush it will have to go right in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I said, for me it doesn&#x27;t matter but it is a definite downer, along with the hard little piece that was stuck on the tip.</li>
            <li> Hair kept coming out of it little by little.  </li>
            <li> Brush hairs could be a little finer</li>
            <li> but I find that it irritates my skin a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant</li>
            <li> but with this foundation brush I can easily apply a very thin layer of foundation if I want, just to help even out my skin tone, and it feels like I am not wearing any makeup at all!!</li>
            <li> and heavy use.  </li>
            <li> quite a few of them shed out</li>
            <li> Mine is your brushes won&#x27;t smell a like dead farm animal</li>
            <li> And green.</li>
            <li> way I use this brush could be wrong, but this is a very bad brush;; foundation doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and the brush itself makes my skin very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are also placed in very tightly so this brush does not shed.</li>
            <li> After two, I&#x27;ve grown tired of having loose bristles on my face while applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> You need very little foundation</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said it was small</li>
            <li> It turns out that it is too small and takes me forever to apply make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> no sense buying expensive brushes that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I can see the small brush lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit small and it sort of leaves streaks on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I got the hard plastic piece off</li>
            <li> I know that was a confusing explanation</li>
            <li> slowly just kept falling out.  </li>
            <li> These brushes act like expensive brushes, but cost a lot less.  </li>
            <li> i broght the shany brush set sometimes ago as a make up begineer, those brushes are not good at all after i compared them to MAC and Bobby Brown&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got the package, I saw that a few bristles were bent the wrong way.</li>
            <li> , I hope you all know what I mean!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s evenly and thinly spread.</li>
            <li> I also have not experienced any shedding (which is another plus).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but not great quality</li>
            <li> I had been using expensive Lancome brushes but tried this one out.</li>
            <li> Brushes can be expensive and I find these to be quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> alas!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying another one of these.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Feels awful actually</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I hate this brush;;;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for my anti-redness base under my foundation, and then for my foundation</li>
            <li> Firstly, I hate foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It was so annoying!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a great brush for a great price.  The bristles are very soft and non irritating and I love that the company is eco friendly.  Don&#x27;t bother spending 2-3x more for a foundation brush because you will love this one!  I will plan on replacing all of my makeup brushes with this line of brushes.</li>
            <li> I hate this brush;;;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use this brush could be wrong, but this is a very bad brush;; foundation doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and the brush itself makes my skin very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! So soft and blends evenly</li>
            <li> This foundation brush is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies foundation amazingly and is great for blending. It is very soft yet still rigid enough to hold and apply product. I spray my brushes daily and wash them with baby shampoo weekly and this one has held up perfectly. Not one bristle has shed and it hasn&#x27;t lost shape!  I also think it is a great size. It is just big enough to sweep over large areas but small enough to still be able to get the under eye area. The handle is soft and feels nice to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried many types of brushes both drugstore and high end and I can honestly say EcoTools brushes are some of my favorites. Must have!</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, yet strong, providing flawless and even coverage of my foundations and BB creams. I&#x27;m very pleased with the price as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times with liquid foundations, and have not often been pleased with the result. The Real Techniques face brush was much easier to use and applied products more evenly.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this foundation brush. I&#x27;ve worked for Estee Lauder and their brushes are expensive and some are hard to clean. Just recently I threw my old Estee Lauder foundation brush away, the handle shattered when I dropped it on my bathroom floor. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 35 dollars on just one brush so the price for the Ecotools one was excellent. It&#x27;s very easy to use, lightweight, and durable to clean as well. The brush itself is a wonderful tool. You need very little foundation and it goes a long way, giving a very smooth, even finish. It is just as good as my old one, if not better and it&#x27;s also good for the enviornment! I definately recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing, i have previously bought brushes from ecotools and i absolutely love every single one of them. they are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soft, they dont shed, and it comes in a re-usable pouch. buy it...</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush. It smooths out the liquid foundation on your face so, so well. I really like it a lot. It&#x27;s really earth friendly, which I like a lot. Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this foundation brush along with the concealer one for over a year, and i really like them! They are affordable, adorable, and animal/eco friendly! No need to spend money on mac brushes or whatever, these are great! :)</li>
            <li> This is the BEST foundation brush I have tried thus far. The quality is amazing. Ecotools are so underrated.</li>
            <li> I like it! Very soft, makes foundation application pretty simple. My only issue is it can get a little cakey after one use, which was expected though. Great price for what it is and I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> Applies eyeshadow on nicely. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The ecotools foundation brush feels like silk on my skin.  The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance. The two tone look of the bristles gives it a nice quality brush look. The bristles are also placed in very tightly so this brush does not shed. This brush overall is too small to apply foundation unless you have lots of time to spare.  If you have lots of time or you don&#x27;t mind the lack of reisistance this is a great brush for you. I might end up using it as large concealer brush because its too soft and luxurious not to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If your a beginner to makeup, the size of this foundation brush may be too small and overwhelming for you considering the amount of time it takes to properly apply and blend foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this brush is and it&#x27;s perfect for blending foundation. The only thing I would suggest is including a cap to protect the brush tip. The packaging that this brush came with is not the best for storing the item because it&#x27;s kinda cumbersome and the hairs get ruffled.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  I just wish it was a little larger.  It applies the foundation smoothly for an even appearance</li>
            <li> This foundation brush is excellent!  The bristles are smooth, well-tapered for the task at hand, with the proper balance between firmness and softness.  It allows me to apply my makeup incredibly quickly and smoothly.  I use it for my anti-redness base under my foundation, and then for my foundation and it does a superb job with both.  Then I smooth the brushstrokes on my face a bit with my fingertips.  Not a single bristle has come loose yet, either, which is another mark of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the brush, I first soap it up in baby shampoo and water, rinse, squeeze out the water, and then dunk the whole brush in isopropyl alcohol.  I&#x27;ve already cleaned it several times, and it&#x27;s still like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an FYI, they sell the entire line of Ecotools brushes at Target for really low prices, sometimes lower than Amazon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation brush!  Easy control, the bristles are nice and soft and there is NO shedding!  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and it has not shed a single bristle.  Great for applying liquid and/or cream foundation, with better control than a sponge (or your fingers).  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months I liked it. It did a good job applying my foundation. However after 5 months it is like a shedding cat! I can&#x27;t use it without having 5-6 bristles fall out. I prefer kabuki brushes instead. You get a much more even look and the bristles don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this brush!  It makes application so easy and my foundation always comes out even.  It has not shed a single bristle, despite my washing it multiple times (which also is easy - it come out brand new!) and heavy use.  It does an excellent job blending my foundation to the amount of coverage I want and even is tapered enough at the end to fill in those smaller spots (like around my eyebrows and nose grooves).  Oh yeah, it&#x27;s super cheap and \\&quot;green\\&quot;!!  Highly recommended :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I received a foundation brush by Stila for Christmas; since Stila has some nice products, I decided to put my Ecotools brush into storage and switch to this new one.  Big mistake.  Every morning it was a struggle to put foundation on -- the brush head is tiny, while the handle is ridiculously long.  After 5 weeks I had had enough and decided to go back to my Ecotools brush.  Wow!  I could not believe how much easier foundation application is with it!  The brush head is much fuller and bigger in dimension, helping speed the process a lot, while also making it easier to apply and blend the foundation.  I will never use another foundation brush!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foundation brush without the cost of the more expensive brushes. I have had mine for quite awhile and I still love it! I even bought a backup... just in case :)</li>
            <li> Got this as a surprise for my mom who wanted a foundation brush, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $30 at a fancy store for one. She LOVES it. She says her foundation goes on smoothly and evenly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t shed at all. And at the price, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have been using it for quite a while now, and I love that it works well, and doesn&#x27;t shed bristles at all.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received on time.  Great foundation brush!!!!  I use it every day and wonder how i ever lived without it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s soft enough to feel good putting on foundation, but firm enough to contour the makeup and dab under the eyes.  This brush smooths on makeup with caking - I don&#x27;t have to worry about people actually seeing the foundation it&#x27;s evenly and thinly spread. This brush also dries well after you clean it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> simple, inexpensive brush that does it&#x27;s job.  I have sensitive skin, so the brush does not irritatie my skin...bonus!</li>
            <li> I do love this brush, it spreads evenly , it is so soft,  feels wonderful.  against your skin, i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it ! I kind of doubt the brush since it was not very pricy but I&#x27;m in love with this and will buy more ecotools !! üòç</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush and advertised at a very low price. I would recommend it to anyone. When i bought it, tho, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a flat brush. I love it now that I have tried it!!</li>
            <li> I used to apply foundation with my fingers no so long ago, so any kind of improvement was gonna be great, but then i tried this brands, and the other brand, and the next one, not a single foundation brush seemed to work for me. And then i found this marvel. i&#x27;ve used it every single day since i got it a month ago (i was waiting to get to this point to write the review) this is just perfection made into a brush. works with virtually any foundation, liquid, pan stick, oily, cheap, expensive, you name it! same professional finish in every application. THIS IS A MUST HAVE! don&#x27;t hesitate, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush at Ulta last night and used it this morning with my liquid foundation. I really liked how it picked up the product and how well it spread and tapped. I also used it to apply my blush (powder) and highlighter (liquid). The ONLY downside was that I used three pumps of foundation rather than my usual two. It cleaned easily and well, and I love the shape. A similar Japonesque brush cost $25. I LOVE my Bare Minerals brushes but was looking for a brush with this exact shape and almost bought the Sigma kabuki set of four brushes for $55. Glad I didn&#x27;t! Plus, I can throw this in my makeup bag when I travel without worrying if the bristles will splay or get dirty--and I don&#x27;t need any other face brushes except my powder brush! It&#x27;s very soft, too. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will only use EcoTools brushes!  Softest, non-shedding bristles in a great base for your makeup needs!</li>
            <li> This brush works great! It&#x27;s really soft, and I don&#x27;t have to use my hands anymore to put on foundation.</li>
            <li> Summary: If you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a great choice. But if you&#x27;re able to pay more, definitely look at higher-quality brushes that will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat this price, and this brush works well for blending and applying foundation.  But I&#x27;ve gone through three of these brushes, and all three started falling apart within a week of being washed for the first time (with Cetaphil gentle face cleanser and water.) In fact, excessive bristle loss was why I had to replace my first brush - half of the bristles just pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, neither brushes 2 or 3 has lost clumps of bristles as badly as brush 1 did; they&#x27;re still usable, but they are losing enough bristles during makeup application that I spend some time every morning picking loose bristles off my face.  My other makeup brushes (drugstore finds and Bare Minerals cosmetics brushes, including the Ecotools concealer brush) have not had this problem after being cleaned the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Ecotools foundation brushes 2 and 3 to replace brush 1 because I was feeling too lazy to shop around, so at the time paying $5 for a brush that would last four to six months was fine with me, but now I&#x27;m just annoyed. I&#x27;ll be splurging on a couple of higher-end foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush I love the Eco tools brand!</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation brush! The bristles are very soft and my foundation applies very smoothly when I use it. Blending my make up is also a breeze. I also have not experienced any shedding (which is another plus). I could honestly say that this brush works as well as expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve previously purchased. The packaging is also neat too! If you are thinking about purchasing this brush...go for it! You will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Or of the package this brush was great.  After cleaning (soaking in water and tea tree oil &amp; letting it air dry) it began to fall apart.  Hair kept coming out of it little by little.  I purchased another thinking it was a fluke but the same thing happened with that one as well.  I&#x27;m on my third now but will probably look for something that rates well with cleaning next time.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.  Foundation goes on flawlessly and it is easy to clean.  More expensive brushes don&#x27;t do any better than this one.  It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes! wonderful feel and am very happy with the eco-friendly nature.</li>
            <li> Ecotools are one of the best, no need to spend a lot on MAC , I love this foundation brush, it blends in my foundation just perfectly.</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace it, in late 2016 (the first one lasted 6 years!) and it&#x27;s already falling apart at the beginning of 2017.  I don&#x27;t know what happened, but not great quality anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in 2010 and left this review:  Great product, great quality.  Clean with some isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s back to new.  The case it comes in can be used as a permanent case.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> When my brush arrived I was very pleased with how soft the bristles were.  I bought this brush in hopes that it would apply my liquid foundation with a better coverage.  After some use I washed the brush and the makeup will NOT come off all the way.  I have tried special soap for brushes and even dish soap and nothing has gotten my brush fully clean, even after several washes.  Seeing as though I don&#x27;t want to use a dirty brush it will have to go right in the trash.  I guess this brush was cheap for a reason....</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my cream foundation. It works wonderful and covers great. The quality is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using a liquid foundation and needed a foundation brush. I am so glad I purchased this one because it&#x27;s great! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second Ecotools foundation brush. I use this brush all the time. I was happy to find I could buy just the foundation brush on amazon.com, as I did not need to replace the other brushes in my set.  This brush does a great job applying a smooth, even application of my make up.  And, the best part?  It&#x27;s cruelty-free.  What could be better?  I highly recommend purchasing this brush.</li>
            <li> cruelty free, bamboo, easy to hold, easy to use. I love all my ecotools brushes but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> finally bought a new brush to replace my real techniques foundation brush I&#x27;ve had for years and it blends my under eye concealer so well.</li>
            <li> Basically I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; brush and the one I previously purchased from Estee Lauder which was about 5 times more expensive. I can even say it works better than that one. Some reviewers said it was small but it&#x27;s not, the standard size, I would say. Very soft yet strong enough to apply foundation all over the face. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my two purchases from Ecotools (the other one is the eye shadow brush 6-piece travel set). Definitely comparable to other high-end brands, quality-wise, while the price is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> This little foundation brush is now one of my new favorites! The bristles are so smooth and soft yet effective for applying my foundation. They&#x27;re not too stiff yet not too soft for applying. You could easily use it for contouring or foundation. I love the look and feel of the Eco Tools makeup brushes. They are just a good all around quality brush/tool to have in your makeup bag. I will definitely be purchasing a set of Eco Tools makeup brushes to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> Really good job on applying my foundation.  Don&#x27;t use much makeup so I really wanted something that does a good job on applying the foundation.  This was great.  Right amount and very natural looking effect, easy to clean.  Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use, smooth application. Perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. There were no shedding until about 2 months. I can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I hate foundation brushes. I have always preferred my fingers to any tool for applying foundation. However, there are a few foundations that I have that I&#x27;ve heard go on better when applied with a brush. So, I began my search for a foundation brush that I could tolerate. The one that I really want, the No7 foundation brush, is not available for purchase in the US (or anywhere online that ships to the US), so I really had to look hard for an alternative. I checked out several brands, MAC, Sonia Kushuk, Real Techniques, but all of those brushes were either too big, too small, too thick or too dense. While at Target one day, I was browsing their Ecotools collection, &amp; saw this brush. It seemed like it was a good width, not too wide or narrow. The density of the brush was good, not too thick. But I was still unsure, so I left without that day. Fast forward a couple of weeks, &amp; I found myself on Amazon pursuing the makeup brushes. While comparing several foundation brushes, I again came upon Ecotools, &amp; was reminded how much I liked it at Target. I read a couple of the reviews &amp; was assured that my first inclination to like it was probably a good one. So I ordered it, received it, tried it several times, &amp; am here to declare my love for it. It does everything I hoped it would &amp; nothing I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t. Another thing-- this brush is 100% synthetic, but it softer &amp; better quality than some of my MAC brushes. That&#x27;s saying a lot. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister because she always uses her hands to put makeup on. BIG NONO LITTLE SIS.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and perfectly soft bristles.  I definitely can&#x27;t complain about the price. For this great quality brush, I wouldn&#x27;t choose another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush. The bristles don&#x27;t detach from the metal part of the brush and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! When I ordered, it arrived way ahead of schedule! This brush is small enough to handle nicely, kind of like a pen. The brush itself is very soft, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out, which is a big plus. It&#x27;s wonderful for all kinds of foundations. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s \\&quot;earth friendly\\&quot;! I will definitely be ordering more brushes from ecotools in the future!</li>
            <li> Buy this brush, and all ecotools brushes! They give great coverage, pickup makeup well, and feel so soft on your face. I also have the Bare Essentials brushes and they&#x27;re more scratchy and the bristles shed onto your face. Ecotools products are awesome and very affordable.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft but lacks any resistance. The two tone look of the bristles gives it a nice quality brush look.</li>
            <li> When I first started wearing foundation, I bought in a cheap brush (from ELF) to test out the whole routine. I also knew I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing it on an everyday basis and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much. However, that brush soon fell apart and I looked online for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is only a little smaller than the ELF one (I was concerned because some of the reviews said it was too small) - I think it&#x27;s a perfect balance between precision and blending. Like other Ecotools brushes, the bristles are soft but firm. I use this with mousse foundation (Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Smooth Mousse line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy I got this :)</li>
            <li> I thought that this brush would be larger so that i can use it as my liquid foundation applicator. It turns out that it is too small and takes me forever to apply make up. On top of that...the brush itself gunks up pretty quickly. I dont use it anymore, but when i was trying it out i would have to clean it every day.</li>
            <li> Coming from the cheap brushes, I really like the EcoTools brands brushes. This brush has a soft texture, but I find it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as a rounded shaped brush. With this shape, I feel like I&#x27;m &#x27;painting&#x27; rather than blending. I have the Kabuki brush set from EcoTools as well, and I much prefer using them to apply my make up.</li>
            <li> Works great! I love the EcoTools brushes.</li>
            <li> Puts makeup on evenly, cleans without fuss and it&#x27;s eco friendly - it hits all the right shopper buttons.</li>
            <li> great for blending when using a contour look and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation brush.  Easy to clean and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> this foundation brush is better than brushes i have gotten from channel and Dior i am very pleased ! !</li>
            <li> Good foundation brush!  Foundation goes on nice and smooth.  It&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at Walmart and I like it. I can tell I&#x27;ll have to replace it every couple months though.</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation brush. It holds up well to washing and drying and helps me apply my liquid foundation evenly.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I definatley recommend this foundation brush.  It goes on smoothly and my makeup looks flawless.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> bought this brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend 30 bucks to get another Clinique foundation brush.  this brush is better than clinques.  I have enjoyed it so much I have bought other brushes from this company!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I use it every single morning. It&#x27;s very soft and smooths my foundation on very nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush at Ulta for about the same price that Amazon is selling it for. Bottom line, this brush is great and I would buy it again. It is good for applying foundation to the thickness that you need. I love it because I used to apply foundation using my fingers and it would look and feel cake-y but with this foundation brush I can easily apply a very thin layer of foundation if I want, just to help even out my skin tone, and it feels like I am not wearing any makeup at all!! I admit that I am a makeup novice, so I cannot compare this brush to other foundation brushes out there. It seems to be great quality (esp. for the price) since after applying makeup and washing several times, no hairs have come out. The bristles are soft and it is easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this brush and other ecotools makeup brushes to anyone looking for inexpensive, quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and shape; the wooden handle feel fantastic and the fibers are wonderful for flawless application.  Plus, its eco friendly!</li>
            <li> Brush has perfect quality so soft and works good and 100% cruelty-free aslo. Eco Tools forever)) I recommend</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools and this brush is no exception.  Foundation goes on smooth and flawless!</li>
            <li> I love EcoTools brand, and this brush lives up to their reputation. This foundation brush is fantastic, I use it for concealer only for which it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this brush applies foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I paid like $50.00 for a make up brush at Sephora and the bristles slowly just kept falling out.  It was so annoying!  I love the way this one feels on my face, the way it applies they make up and I LOVE that it&#x27;s so easy to clean.  Will definitely continue to buy EcoTools brushes!</li>
            <li> The brush works o.k. I&#x27;ve never used a foundation brush before so I have nothing to compare to besides a make up sponge. I felt the brush didn&#x27;t blend as well and kind of left a streaky look.</li>
            <li> I have expensive natural hair brushes, but I go more often to my EcoTools, as they are so easy to clean.  The foundation brush is perfect for applying base for under mineral makeup (Jane Iredale amazing base try is amazing), or for liquid tinted moisturizer.  Perfect size, nice application, and again, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love eco tools brushes and this is no exception.  This is a genuine eco tools brush and works very well for foundation applying.  I actually use it more to blend concealer because I use the beauty blender as my foundation applyer.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush that I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> Love EcoTools brushes. This one is great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Has not lost hairs on me, even after washing many times. Great quality foundation - it&#x27;s basic but does it&#x27;s job well. Have used others that shed and do not apply an even layer unlike this brush that applies creams and liquids quickly. Not great at blending but at painting on products quickly in an even layer. I recommend another brush for buffing in after using this brush.</li>
            <li> Love this. I had been using expensive Lancome brushes but tried this one out. This one is great!  So much better than the expensive brushed I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> i broght the shany brush set sometimes ago as a make up begineer, those brushes are not good at all after i compared them to MAC and Bobby Brown&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since i am waring basic make up everyday now, a good foundation brush is a must to me, plus the eco factor is also attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to apply highlighter, blush and occasionally, concealer, followed by a fluffy powder brush to blend everything together. Perhaps, it&#x27;s just me, I find the beauty blender better at applying foundations.</li>
            <li> I love this brush but after about six weeks of use, the bristles start to shed.  This has now happened with two brushes so I&#x27;m pretty sure it has something to do with the design and wasn&#x27;t specific to the unit that I received.  After two, I&#x27;ve grown tired of having loose bristles on my face while applying make-up.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and is sooo smooth! It also cleans very easily too. A great buy for a cheap price compared to other eco-friendly foundation brushes out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little soft for what I like in a foundation brush, but it does the job.  It is easy to clean which is nice too.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much better my mineral makeup looks when I use this. I usually use a large kabuki style brush that provides light to medium coverage but this one gives more of a full coverage look but surprisingly did not make the makeup look or feel any heavier then usual. The smallness of the brush really didn&#x27;t seem to take that much more time to apply, but definitely worth it with how great it works. And it is eco friendly and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This brush feels smooth. It doesn&#x27;t prick or poke my skin. It&#x27;s easy to clean. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I washed this brush with cool water and soap and most of the bristles are falling out.  In pieces or in GIANT chunks. How annoying that it hasn&#x27;t seemed to bother so many others.  Oh well, luckily it is only $6.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it everyday and it leaves a nice airbrush finish. The only thing that I don&#x27;&#x27;t like is that it sheds a little.</li>
            <li> I love my flat foundation brush! I can applu foundation with ease!</li>
            <li> I order all their brushes.  They are good quality and fairly priced....no sense buying expensive brushes that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush a couple days ago, and received the brush very promptly. I cannot describe how unbelievably soft the bristles of the brush are!! Also, the brush has not shed but 2 hairs since I&#x27;ve been using it! I am extremely satisfied with this brush, especially for how little I paid for it. Definitely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, the brush is about 6.5 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone!</li>
            <li> Will never buy again. I should have not bought a flat brush. Only lasts for a couple of weeks. Hard to clean. Doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It makes my make up look flawless. It did seem like I used more foundation when I use the brush. So I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I want to get that seamless foundation look, I use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t use it for foundation anymore because it really soaks up most of my product. I use it for concealer since it&#x27;s small enough to work.</li>
            <li> this brush was ok out of habit, I thought I needed to stop using my hands to put on my foundation, and purchase this brush well again it was OK but I went back to using my hands to put on my foundation..</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the Eco Tools, but find the Flat Foundation Brush to spread your foundation not as good as a full coverage brush.  It is better than using a sponge which absorbs your foundation but there are better style of brushes for good foundation coverage.</li>
            <li> Just needed something to round up my order for free shipping and was very glad this product qualified. Have been wanting to purchase this brush for a long time but could not justify in-store price as I don&#x27;t have a pressing need for it. I don&#x27;t wear foundation every day but when I do I find it counter-productive to apply it with my hands. Good distribution of makeup, good coverage, but still working out how to use it properly. Nice texture as well, but I mostly love Eco-tools for their earth-conscious and cruelty-free principals.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time but does not work well</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it everyday! Perfect buy for the cost!</li>
            <li> love it it&#x27;s great came on time didn&#x27;t wait long for it it;s good and it&#x27;s amazing enjoy it thanks.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush because it was stiff enough to apply foundation. I personally don&#x27;t love these brushes for foundation and instead use a flat top kabuki brush. If you love to apply face makeup this way than I would recommend it</li>
            <li> The price was great. This is one great brush.  And would recommend this product. It is so soft and silky. Does and great job and is easy to wash out.  I&#x27;ve had other foundation brushes and I like this one the best. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but when I use it to apply my liquid foundation, it leaves streaks and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as some other brushes</li>
            <li> So soft! Love to use it with my foundation cream!</li>
            <li> Great brush - Perfect size for my travel case or in home use. It&#x27;s soft to the touch but holds its shape.</li>
            <li> Just as described, soft natural bristles. Perfect for my under eye concealer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush much because it feels scratchy on my face. I have just continued to use my old one that I bought this one to replace.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the whole line of these brushes! I have extremely sensitive skin and this brush is so soft and non-irritating. Spreads foundation smoothly and without streaks. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this brush and I was not disappointed. It works really well. The foundations is applied smoothly and evenly and the brush doesn&#x27;t lose bristles. Considering the one I had seen at Belk was $35 this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I just received this foundation brush. Immediately I loved the way it felt. The brush is smooth and clean. I would definitely consider rebuying it when it gets old and used and I am ready for a fresh one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a contour brush. Stiff enough to create precise lines yet soft enough to not aggravate my sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little better, for the price it&#x27;s pretty good but ill most likely replace them, maybe look at a set little more expensive to get what I need. I&#x27;m sure some other less sensitive skin persons may like it, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, just wish it came with a cap or something. Going to buy another one soon!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is so nice to apply liquid make up and not get it on your hands. It does applies the make up smoothly and streak-free.</li>
            <li> the brush worked well for makeup application. I was happy with the quality. The brush held up well and was soft.</li>
            <li> my first product of ecotools and since then i&#x27;m hooked by their quality! going on to buy others from them! back to this item, right size for face to apply liquid foundation! can&#x27;t believe a cheap (under $10) comparing to shiseido $30 but given such an amazing result, even a more convenient application &amp; much better outcome! love ecotools, thanks for creating this brand :)</li>
            <li> love these brushes - the brand is good and the price is right.  Brushes can be expensive and I find these to be quality and affordable.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The price is low for what I get. The brush is very soft and good quality and my foundation become much nicer in my skin since I started making up with it. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The EcoTools Flat Foundation brush is good for liquid foundation. I am actually new to this makeup thing, but the brush is soft and easy to hold. The hair thingies do not shed. It is better than using my fingers</li>
            <li> I loved how this brush applies my make up without a problem or without the hairs coming off. Instead of spending soooo much money on MAC brushes or Sephora brushes, EcoTools does it all and the price is unbeatable. I am very happy with this. I am going to buy more because this is just too awesome.</li>
            <li> The key is to let it &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; a little bit between uses. If I am trying to use it and it is still moderately wet, I find it doesn&#x27;t blend as well.</li>
            <li> Great foundation (mouse) applicator blends everything perfectly</li>
            <li> Brush hairs could be a little finer but this product works as designed. Like it, don&#x27;t LOVE it.  Ok for the pricepoint.</li>
            <li> Love this brush - it does a fantastic job when applying makeup. Easy to clean - after each use I just run it under water, put a little soap on my hand, then rub it around and rinse/squeeze it out - it&#x27;s dry by the next day.</li>
            <li> if you need an inexpensive foundation brush this is the perfect time it stays together it has good quality as far as being appropriate to put on your makeup spreads Foundation well n has very little hairs that come out of the brush easy to clean good quality</li>
            <li> When I got the package, I saw that a few bristles were bent the wrong way. However, I like the size and the fact that it is durable. When I put my foundation on with this, it is somewhat streaky, so I use a blush brush to give it a more even and smooth look.</li>
            <li> EcoTools brushes are cruelty free AND excellent. That&#x27;s an unbeatable combination. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: this brush is built just as well,  and the brush heads just as precisely cut and/or angled, as any &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brush, many of which I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I got this tool to help with pore minimization.It works great for me! I plan to us the package it came in as a book mark.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this foundation brush.I am learning how to apply makeup, and i am happy with the results.I will definitely try more products from this line.I am very satisfied with this product,and i think you will be too.</li>
            <li> Awesome for contouring and highlighting!</li>
            <li> Brush is easy to use and gives a very clean look. The brush isn&#x27;t rough at all and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because it makes it easier for me to apply foundation to my face. With this brush, I can get into the corners of my eyes to apply foundation and it also does not cause streaking. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive foundation brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying foundation. Great call for the quality. This brush is still in great condition after a year of daily use and cleanings. I&#x27;ve mine so much I got one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and soft but a little on the brush fibers feels a bit on the thin side.</li>
            <li> Flat foundation brushes actually do nothing, a fact I wish I was aware of when I bought this.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush, it&#x27;s soft and easy to use.  I will never use a foundation sponge again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be (and smaller than most foundation brushes). It&#x27;s not too much of a problem but I find that it irritates my skin a little. The bristles are soft when you are brushing with the grain, but if you accidentally push it forward, it can irritate. I know that was a confusing explanation, I hope you all know what I mean!</li>
            <li> the brush is so soft and wide enough for it to be a foundation brush. I love it!!!  The item arrived very fast. I will certanly order again with this company!!</li>
            <li> Great application brush. I had the Mac one before but I lost it and needed a quick fix. But I truly love this one way way better then the Mac and Sephora brushes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $20+ on a fancy brush so I went with this one.  It does a good job of evenly distributing my liquid foundation and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush not to long ago and I used it for about a week. I noticed that my foundation wasn&#x27;t coming out very matted down to my skin if that makes sense. I also noticed that I can see the small brush lines on my face. Again not my favorite, I prefer to use my finger or a sponge!</li>
            <li> this is by far one of the best foundation brushes out there. Right at the top with the very expensive ones. I got two so I always have a clean one to use.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten an odd brush, because after 83 positive reviews I didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas!  My brush, even after multiple washings, still pricks my face when I use it with foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like to blend colors of conceler and foundation under my eyes.  This brush does the job.  It&#x27;s not as soft as other more expensive brushes I have, but it works almost as well as they do.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive brush for foundation when I made this purchase. It truly surpassed my expectations. It is soft and great. It does leave some strikes but they are easily covered with the sealing powder afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it every day.  It doesn&#x27;t suck up liquid foundation like a sponge does.  It leaves a very nice finish and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great foundation brush. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t soak up your foundation like most brushes and it provides flawless coverage.</li>
            <li> Eco Tools are the only brushes I will use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used others in the past, but came directly back to Eco Tools, the brushes are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft, effective and last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I have had some of these brushes for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Bristles started falling off just after first cleanup. I mean not 1 or 2 bristles, whole bunch of them. Had to throw it. I would suggest spending couple extra bucks and go for branded ones.</li>
            <li> This is my first foundation brush and found it to be very useful when applying my mousse type foundation. The bristles are smooth and apply the make-up well. The only thing I disliked about the brush was that some of the bristles were shorter than the tip. Guess I could describe the bristles as being layered? So, when I applied the foundation I felt some of the shorter bristles poking at my face. However, it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it day to day. Yes, I would recommend this to someone. I would also like to mention that I cleaned the bristles and none of them fell out!</li>
            <li> I love this brush - I decided to completely revamp and update my cosmetics collection and decided to try the EcoTools collection.  The bristles are appropriately stiff, yet soft and supple, and I have had absolutely NO problems with shedding through use or washing.  Some have complained about an odor on the bristles, I believe, but I have experienced no such odor.  EcoTools makes a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this line of cosmetic Brushes for all types puff make up application.  Spells well with cream and powder make up.</li>
            <li> Only downside to the brush is it retained makeup a LOT. but it cleans quickly and dries quickly as well. Super soft, can leave lines if careless/not maintained. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this line and only buy them. They are awesome quality, inexpensive and are cruelty free which is very important to me. They work wonderful as well. Win win!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a foundation brush, but I bought this one to try out.  Its nice and soft and works really well.  I like more sheer coverage, so now I&#x27;m put the foundation on with my fingers and just use this to make sure its evened out.  I hope to get more Eco brushes as my old ones wear out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t actually buy mine from amazon but i love my brush. I like all the EcoTools brushes I&#x27;ve used. Cost efficient and they work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation brush! I have moved towards these flat head brushes lately, and find them to be a lot easier to use, you use less foundation, and they give you an airbrushed look easily. I have gone through many brushes in my 10+ years as a makeup artist and its really hard to find a great foundation brush, that&#x27;s a great value (if you go through them as much as I do), that work just like the higher priced pro brushes. You do not need to spend that kind of money with a great brush like this! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> well, I bought this bc I needed a better ciudad ion brush. as a foundation brush it is not all that magnificent BUT if you&#x27;re looking for a concealing brush THIS BRUSH IS THE WAY TO GO.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this brush. But after a few weeks the bristles started coming out, slowly at first then several at a time and they would get stuck to my face while trying to put on foundation. I hoped it was maybe just a faulty brush so I got a second one of the same brush and the same thing happened AGAIN! Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying another one of these. I got one of the Up &amp; Up foundation brushes from Target and, although it doesn&#x27;t match all my other bamboo brushes, it&#x27;s been working great and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles yet! The other Eco Tools brushes seem to work fine, but steer clear of the foundation brush!</li>
            <li> I like that the bristles don&#x27;t fall off when using it and get stuck in your foundation.  Nice brush.</li>
            <li> This brand of brush was recommended to me by a co-worker.  She swears by this particular foundation brush, so I decided to go for it and give it a try.  At the cost, I couldn&#x27;t afford not to since she talked it up so much.  I&#x27;m very, very glad I listened to her about this brush.  The bristles are so soft, and it&#x27;s never shed on me.  It applies my B.B. cream evenly and flawlessly.  My two favorite brands of make-up brushes now are both Ecotools and Real Techniques.  These brushes act like expensive brushes, but cost a lot less.  In fact, there was an expensive brush I was interested in when I went to get the Ecotools foundation brush, but when I ran my hand across the bristles (gently, mind you... I didn&#x27;t tug) quite a few of them shed out and I hadn&#x27;t even bought and used it yet.  I was glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on that brush and went for this one instead.  Just because it costs more doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.  I would suggest giving this little brush a try, and if you pick it up from Ulta you&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose since they&#x27;re return policy is absolutely amazing.  I would purchase this brush again if I were to lose it or leave it somewhere by accident, because it&#x27;s such good quality I don&#x27;t see it breaking.</li>
            <li> This is another great brush from Eco-tools. I own many brushes from this band, and I have never been disappointed. They have outlasted other, more expensive brushes, and now it is my preferred brand.</li>
            <li> I love that this product was made in a sustainable way and that it won&#x27;t adversely affect your skin.  It is great quality for a decent price.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the color of the actual brush is not as pictured, mine was a light beige color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great quality brush. Bristles are full and well shaped, it works well and best of all, it does NOT shed. at all. The brush is easy to clean and reshape. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of stiff, not a soft brush.  I would prefer a softer brush for my face.  The price was good, but it reminds me you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Super soft and works great! However, I&#x27;d like it if there were some sort of plastic cover just for the top part. Next time, I&#x27;ll be buying the retractable version.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s your definition of cruelty free? Mine is your brushes won&#x27;t smell a like dead farm animal when you wash/dry them or wonder what type of animal your rubbing against your face to apply that foundation. I love this brush &amp; it&#x27;s only 1/5 of the cost of the ubber expensive ones ($32 each) that I&#x27;ve been using for the last 6 years. Unbelievable. Thank :: YOU :: EcoTools! I&#x27;ve now ordered the mineral 5 piece travel set &amp; the bamboo 6-piece make-up brush set. I can&#x27;t wait to dump the rest of my over priced brushes! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s May 14th &amp; this brush is still strong with numerous \\&quot;CLEANINGS\\&quot; since I can&#x27;t stand to rub the same dirty brush on my face for more than 5-7 days. However, other ECO brushes in those 5 &amp; 6 packs haven&#x27;t faired to well with coming apart at the stem. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I have realized that the best way to apply foundation is to use a brush.  This is a good brush for it,  It does not streak and foundation seems even.  Make sure, tough, that every so often, you wash the brush with soap and water.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I was pleased with the quality,&lt;br /&gt;and how it made my foundation less streaky and in general look much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash the brush correctly with it pointed downward so as not to loosen the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead after a month of regular use, the hole head came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this. i need to replace them more often than i do, and i can never wash them as well as they claim they can be washed... but this is holding up well and spreads foundation nicely.  i&#x27;d buy another to replace it, whenever i get around to doing it.</li>
            <li> Love! Perfect coverage!</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft, and yet still firm enough to hold its shape well. It applies liquid foundation evenly and none of the bristles have fallen out. Overall, it&#x27;s a good quality brush and worth the price!</li>
            <li> I really love this brand of brushes, they&#x27;re SO soft and they don&#x27;t shed! This foundation brush is great for the price! Maybe a bit smaller than some but hardly a huge issue. For the money-totally worth checking it out for yourself!</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies makeup really well. Only reason it got 4 stars though is because the bristles come out pretty easily. Other than that, great product. Very pleased. (:</li>
            <li> Great brush at a great price</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I was a little hesitant but I decided to order just a couple ecotools brushes instead of a whole set and I am so glad I did. The brushes work so well and I am super happy. And would recommend</li>
            <li> I used my old EcoTools Flat Foundation Brush for so long that it was worn out, so I&#x27;ve ordered a new one - can&#x27;t imagine anything being better. I do use a smaller brush (or a fingertip) to get makeup underneath my eyes, because this brush is a bit big for that. This brush does a great job and spreads foundation evenly, and doesn&#x27;t suck up liquid foundation as bad as sponge applicators do</li>
            <li> This brush works perfectly for applying my foundation.  As an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, it was also very economical!  I recommend this product; in fact, I bought two!</li>
            <li> Perfectly soft and smooth bristles produced a smooth, even coat of foundation. Would recommend this brand to anyone. Though it did not come with any form of cleaning tips which may have saved time searching google for mediocre tips that may not suit this brush the best.</li>
            <li> I bought a bigger brush a long time ago and have recently begun to buy more of these. Their brushes are soft and they pick up just enough powder for the application of make-up. I absolutely love it and would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I noticed that there was this incredibly hard piece of (what I imagine) melted plastic ball at the tip. I had to sit there, and gently yank it off the bristles, so that I didn&#x27;t ruin the brush. It took about 10 minutes, which isn&#x27;t long but honestly, when you first buy something and it&#x27;s not perfect, it makes you feel kind of crummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got the hard plastic piece off and it&#x27;s a good brush. Not super great. Here&#x27;s why, it&#x27;s a bit small and it sort of leaves streaks on my face. Now it&#x27;s not a big deal but you can see brush strokes on my face after I&#x27;ve applied BB cream or liquid foundation. For me, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal because once I set my wet makeup with powder, you don&#x27;t notice the streaks at all. But others might not want to set their makeup with powder, you will see those streaks I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, for me it doesn&#x27;t matter but it is a definite downer, along with the hard little piece that was stuck on the tip. It&#x27;s fine for $5 but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. And green.</li>
            <li> I read all the praises on here, and with all the enviromentally friendly looking packaging and whatnot, I decided to go for this. I really wanted to like this, so much that I come back to it every time I get a new foundation thinking--maybe, just maybe, that specific foundation didi &#x27;t work with this brush. But no, it&#x27;s the brush, not the foundation. Even when its dry, the bristles are uneven, and even more obviously so when wet. It leaves massive streaks on my face that I eventually have to blend out using my fingers because using the brush over it leaves even more smaller streaks. Urk. It also swallowed up a good quarter of my foundation that I dabbed on my face beforehand while blending it in, and I know this because the amount I dabbed onto my face is just enough when I just use my fingers to spread the foundation. When I used the brush, I didn&#x27;t have any foundation left for my jawline and chin.</li>
            <li> The EcoTools Foundation brush does a pretty good job smoothing foundation. The bristles are fine and soft, which feels good on the skin. It is on the small size, but that is advantageous around contoured areas such as the eyes and nose. However, this means more stroking on broader areas as the cheeks, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff, but I don&#x27;t find that problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not absorb much of the foundation. It washes nicely with baby shampoo and the bristles did not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very economical and I am quite satisfied with this purchase. However, if you prefer a big brush, then you might want to look at other brushes or have both a big and small brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Soft bristles&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job smoothing on foundation&lt;br /&gt;- Economical price&lt;br /&gt;- Small size is good for contoured areas of the face&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t absorb much foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Small size requires more strokes on the broad areas of the face</li>
            <li> I liked this brush for a long time, until I started breaking out! I cleaned the brush, and discovered it was holding a lot more makeup than I realized. It took me about 20 minutes to wash this thing out. Then it started losing bristles. I gave it another go, but bristles were coming out like a cat under stress. I gave up, chunked the brush, and switched to sponges.</li>
            <li> Best brushes for the money.  These do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> EcoTools brushes are by far the best brushes that you can buy in this price range. Not to mention, the company itself stands for great things. This brush is no exception. Awesome application of foundation!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sure there are better ones on the market for just as reasonable of prices. This brush is fairly firm, but not too much so, and has a sufficient surface area for foundation. It&#x27;s fairly easy to wash, though depending on your products, you may have to be extra thorough. It also can streak; I avoid this problem by either doing a criss-cross type motion or by patting it on my face after spreading the product.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were a bit softer. Sometimes, especially near my eyes, it feels scratchy.</li>
            <li> Considering the crazy prices for brushes like these (Mac wants over $30 for one!), this one is great! Good quality, soft bristles and they don&#x27;t come off. Slightly bigger than the Mac foundation brush, but works wonderful for my liquid foundation. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This foundation brush is so fantastic! It makes the application of foundation so much easier than it is with sponges. It&#x27;s less messy too (or not messy at all). The brush altogether is very well made. It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles, bristles are soft, wand is just the right length and diameter for a perfect grip and the brush head as a whole is very thick and dense. I&#x27;ll never use another foundation brush ever again.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount softness and springiness for blending in foundation.</li>
            <li> This was my first foundation brush and I&#x27;ve had it for about a year or so now. It holds up and works like it did the first time. Washes and dries easy.</li>
            <li> This is much easier for me than messy beauty blenders and sponges. It does blends my make up well, making my skin look naturally glowing with a very smooth finish. This is my 2nd brush from Real Techniques and the quality never failed me. I had my first one for 2 good years. It&#x27;s actually still working fine but I want to keep a new one at hand just in case I need it..which is very soon, I think. It&#x27;s very good quality with smooth, solid bristles. The top is so flat and fine. It really does a good job blending my foundation. By the way I use Loreal True Match and it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I love how easily my foundation gets on with this. However, the bristles feel extremely rough on my face. Feels awful actually</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!! Super soft and fluffy but applies like a dream. I use it to apply my BB cream and it spreads it very evenly without absorbing the product. Really easy to clean and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
