            <li>This product is great for girl scout badges and fun patches.</li>
            <li>So easy and they stay on!</li>
            <li>My daughters scout badges have stayed well glued to her vest for more than a year.</li>
            <li>We use badge magic on all our scout uniform patches.</li>
            <li>It held up during washes and the abuse of being worn by an energetic Girl Scout.  </li>
            <li>The sticky part that is suppose to stay on the bottom wouldn&#x27;t release from the top.  </li>
            <li>But Badge Magic works like it should and makes my life a lot easier...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply patches and the patches that are permanent have stayed attached through washing.</li>
            <li>Great shortcut to constantly sewing on Girl Scout patches.</li>
            <li>Fantastic alternative to ironing.</li>

            <li>He will begin Cub Scouts in September and after having sewn Scout patches on for two sons, I&#x27;ve decided that Badge Magic will be my new choice for Scout patches as well.</li>
            <li>My daughter is always bringing home fun patches from GS</li>
            <li>Works great for Girl Scout badges, as I do not sew and too lazy to learn.</li>
            <li>Easiest fastest way to apply badges and ships fast!</li>
            <li>Washed the vest twice, worn it at least 10 times, and everything is still holding up great.</li>
            <li>Only thing that worked to secure Girl Scout badges!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much faster\easier than sewing.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to use this rather than having dealing with ironing them.</li>
            <li>The second time it happened I was more careful with the peel away.  </li>
            <li>So far 100% of the patches are still on although we&#x27;ve not sent anything through the washer yet.</li>

            <li> Great shortcut to constantly sewing on Girl Scout patches. Drawback is that they don&#x27;t look as great as sewn on ones.  Still good product. I use all the time for Girls scout patches on vests.</li>
            <li> Easiest fastest way to apply badges and ships fast!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;Forget ironing or sewing...&lt;br /&gt;Magic Badge is the way to go!!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t sew...not at all. My Grandmother would be supremely ashamed, but with a daughter in Girl Scouts, I was desperate. These were perfect to attach her (many, many) patches to her uniform.  It held up during washes and the abuse of being worn by an energetic Girl Scout.  Save your fingers from holes, this product will work for you! All you need is a pair of scissors, a pencil and a kindergarten education. Put the patch on the paper, trace it, cut it out, then peel and stick. The best product ever invented if you ask me!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. My daughter is always bringing home fun patches from GS and I don&#x27;t have a sewing machine. This could not be simpler. Washed the vest twice, worn it at least 10 times, and everything is still holding up great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I was so tired of having to sew on badges that were falling off my daughters Girl Scout vest. Very easy to use and the badges stay on.</li>

The second time it happened I was more careful with the peel away.  The shirt looked really nice.  I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my grandson&#x27;s karate patches.  It it a wonderful alternative to sewing.  He will begin Cub Scouts in September and after having sewn Scout patches on for two sons, I&#x27;ve decided that Badge Magic will be my new choice for Scout patches as well.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it works and it&#x27;s much faster\easier than sewing.  We&#x27;re using it for girl scout badges on the traditional sash and Indian princess badges on denim vests.  So far 100% of the patches are still on although we&#x27;ve not sent anything through the washer yet.</li>
            <li> Only thing that worked to secure Girl Scout badges!</li>
            <li> Great product, worked perfectly</li>

            <li> Works great for Girl Scout badges, as I do not sew and too lazy to learn.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used to sew badges on - never again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic alternative to ironing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and they&#x27;ve left me disappointed. Even lost some badges. But Badge Magic works like it should and makes my life a lot easier...badges, hems, patching...all finished in no time because of this product.</li>
