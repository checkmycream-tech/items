            <li>happy hennaing!</li>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>worked great!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product, I would use it again.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for helping your hair get healthier and covering grays.  </li>
            <li>hair looks great and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I switched from toxic home hair color to this henna.</li>
            <li>I loved how it came with gloves &amp; a plastic cover to put on my head when i applied the henna.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and so good for your hair.</li>
            <li>Smells good (she added some ginger and lemon juice).</li>
            <li>this is a nice color...</li>
            <li>After much research henna seemed like the perfect option.</li>
            <li>(It wasn&#x27;t very warm, it was cool in our house</li>
            <li>The hair looks rich and has good sheen.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s darker than I thought from the chart on the box, but it&#x27;s gorgeous and my hair feels SO soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>(this is MESSY/smells like grass stuff, healthy, better for you, thickens your hair rather than thins it</li>
            <li>have heard from girls with all hair types that they LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>This is nothing that harms you let alone a precious life on the way so there is nothing to keep you from covering your gray with a baby on board.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on, wrap the top in a plastic bag and wrap a bandana around the hairline to block the drips once your body heat gets to work on it...</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, and love it.  </li>
            <li>There where toooo many reviews to go thru.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>But with so many options I was sort of confused!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I think there is more indigo than henna in this mixture, so it turned out more on the dark side, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>i love light mountain henna.</li>
            <li>love Mountain Light Henna...</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to understand</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow and the results...</li>
            <li>but I used a plastic bowl to mix it in and that seemed to turn out just fine, even though I used metal.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair too light or orange.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Light Mountain Henna for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It does take awhile to remove as it is quite sandy feeling, but just keep rinsing, and lightly scrubbing with your hands</li>
            <li>Perhaps light brown was too light, but I had no color change.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is cruelty free</li>
            <li>After selecting the color I wanted (Light Brown)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about over treating your hair with henna, its like getting too much dirt under your finger nails, its natural and washing off.&lt;br /&gt;After having henna on your hair for five to eight hours, the results are beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a natural hair color, and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand twice and each time was very happy with how well it covered gray, how soft and silky my hair was afterwards, and that it lasted JUST as long as chemical color, what is that about?</li>
            <li>I used the Light Red this last time, and it&#x27;w wonderful.</li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals so it wouldn&#x27;t harm my baby.  </li>
            <li>It did make her hair softer at first, which was nice, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention that this product is the same or cheaper than most box dyes with better results.</li>
            <li>to mention now I&#x27;m 14 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I was pregnant when I tried to use it, and wanted something to dye my gray hairs with</li>
            <li>first she was concerned about or mineral rich</li>
            <li>the light brown henna does not have much of a reddish hint to it.</li>
            <li>it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>After using this productonly 3 times I rarely use conditioner on my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>i am just not in love with the light brown henna color because it lacks the red i adore.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time but its SO worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I use 3T of this light brown henna plus 2/3T indigo powder to create a natural looking light ash brown on my salt and pepper gray hair.  </li>
            <li>i was using bright red for a period time which i liked, but i wanted to try the dark brown to switch things up a bit.</li>
            <li>as one reviewer said \\&quot;putrid spinach\\&quot; is about right.</li>
            <li>The color turned pretty red, but I liked it.  </li>
            <li>i have tried the mahogany, red, bright red and light brown.</li>
            <li>my hair is beautiful, shiny and thick from the henna.</li>
            <li>I will buy the pure ingredients next time and mix my own.</li>
            <li>First time using henna.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 6 months later: I still love Mountain Naturals.</li>
            <li>My natural ashy mousey brown turned a light red that softened after a few weeks into a great light auburn.</li>
            <li>First off, I have never written an Amazon product review before.</li>
            <li>My hair is not frizzy, it is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>But I did just apply the color last night, so it might still end up turning out red later on, but for now, I am very happy with the color.</li>
            <li>My hair is a light to medium brown naturally</li>
            <li>It also took out some of the dryness and is holding up more than several weeks and still no signs of having to re do the treatment.</li>
            <li>Light Mountain Natural.</li>
            <li>and I mixed 1 egg and 6oz of black coffee with 6oz of very hot water and the color looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can leave this one for a few hours, and not see a whole lot of color change,(this is a stain more so than a dye) or, you can do the easy thing and sleep with it in your hair</li>
            <li>3 times now, the first time I used a different brand other than this, it worked great</li>
            <li>I rate this product a 9/10 mainly because its messy and smells like something you&#x27;d feed a pet horse, but the results are worth it, just make sure you clean your bathroom as you spill/drop things, it stains.</li>
            <li>I was really worried I would end up with bright red hair, because chemical dyes ALWAYS make my hair fade out to red.</li>
            <li>My hair also felt more dry using henna versus chemical hair dye-</li>
            <li>I like the earthy smell of pure henna and cassia and don&#x27;t know if all indigo smells like this or just this brand</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even fade when I soaked my hair with a pure coconut/olive oil blend.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right before bed, wrap my head in saran wrap, and wear pjs I don&#x27;t care about, sheets I don&#x27;t care about and a towel wrapped in saran with a dark pillow case over top.</li>
            <li>some things just smell very strange.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s even very rust laden.</li>
            <li>1st try didnt change my hair too much...</li>
            <li>(I have had no problem using stainless steel ones) to pour the henna on your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--Hmm-hard to come up with much, but here goes...</li>
            <li>As much as i wanted to avoid it, i had no choice but to use a hair dye to cover grays.</li>
            <li>sit back, watch a movie, have a drink, work in the garden, clean the house...</li>
            <li>That said, the color came out nice, although it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>but this super long time with the henna on is the KEY TO GETTING A WONDERFUL DEEP COLOR; three hours should be the minimum (the more gray you have the more you need to leave it on); less than that will give you a pretty artificial color.</li>
            <li>To avoid the mess I&#x27;ve learned to apply it in the shower, and have an old button up shirt handy to put on.</li>
            <li>I especially like that the Light Mountain brand includes gloves, a cap, and complete instructions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;During my research one particular brand was repeatedly mentioned:</li>
            <li>My hair was light brown (highlighted last 5 months ago) and the color turned out a rich dark brown.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;--Can be time consuming (make sure you&#x27;ve nowhere to be for a few</li>
            <li>Its really not a hard choice here.</li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter tried this on her brown naturally curly hair, hoping to get some highlights, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for her.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it&#x27;d be too red, but the mix of henna and indigo makes it a beautiful walnut brown color, not red at all, just a rich brown.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try LIght Mountain for grey next time and will review it afterwards.</li>
            <li>To combat the smell, I added some drops of lavender essential oil and that really seemed to help combat the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it was all natural like this one) and the results were wonderful,but it did not come with the extras this brand does.</li>
            <li>a metal bowl (or even cut an old milk gallon in</li>
            <li>, so I left it on a bit longer when I did the whole hair application.</li>
            <li>my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>I have light/medium brown hair and was just looking to cover a few grays and make my color rich and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I mixed this with 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d finally put my foot down--NO MORE BLEACHING AND HARSH CHEMICALS!</li>
            <li>I bought the Light Brown mix to tone down my red hair.</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on the color, and it does last an AMAZING length of time (at least the red has.)</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, like green tea lattes, but it got clumpy and would rub off while trying to apply it to the hair, then got runny as it was setting on my hair, and while rinsing it out it made my shower a mess.</li>
            <li>I got nice dark red highlights over my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have time to sit and blow dry it the whole time.)</li>
            <li>use water, period, its a waste of henna when you could be adding apple cider vinegar, coffee, tea or pretty much any liquid with extra dying/conditioning benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li>I use a little grape seed oil and apple cider vinegar in the mix, it&#x27;s kinda like making a mud pie which is always a fun time...</li>
            <li>, i think its henna generally.</li>
            <li>I barely noticed any difference using this product,</li>
            <li>That being said, I was left to wonder how I would continue to naturally dye my hair and hopefully reverse some of the damage I&#x27;d caused from years at the salon.</li>
            <li>by random people asking what kind of hair color</li>
            <li>But I found the other user reviews on this product very helpful</li>
            <li>Previously purchased from Whole Foods.  </li>

            <li> I especially like that the Light Mountain brand includes gloves, a cap, and complete instructions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During my research one particular brand was repeatedly mentioned:</li>
            <li> My hair was light brown (highlighted last 5 months ago) and the color turned out a rich dark brown.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;--Can be time consuming (make sure you&#x27;ve nowhere to be for a few</li>
            <li> Its really not a hard choice here.</li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter tried this on her brown naturally curly hair, hoping to get some highlights, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for her.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it&#x27;d be too red, but the mix of henna and indigo makes it a beautiful walnut brown color, not red at all, just a rich brown.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try LIght Mountain for grey next time and will review it afterwards.</li>
            <li> To combat the smell, I added some drops of lavender essential oil and that really seemed to help combat the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it was all natural like this one) and the results were wonderful,but it did not come with the extras this brand does.</li>
            <li> a metal bowl (or even cut an old milk gallon in</li>
            <li> , so I left it on a bit longer when I did the whole hair application.</li>
            <li> my hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I have light/medium brown hair and was just looking to cover a few grays and make my color rich and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I mixed this with 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d finally put my foot down--NO MORE BLEACHING AND HARSH CHEMICALS!</li>
            <li> I bought the Light Brown mix to tone down my red hair.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on the color, and it does last an AMAZING length of time (at least the red has.)</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, like green tea lattes, but it got clumpy and would rub off while trying to apply it to the hair, then got runny as it was setting on my hair, and while rinsing it out it made my shower a mess.</li>
            <li> I got nice dark red highlights over my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have time to sit and blow dry it the whole time.)</li>
            <li> use water, period, its a waste of henna when you could be adding apple cider vinegar, coffee, tea or pretty much any liquid with extra dying/conditioning benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li> I use a little grape seed oil and apple cider vinegar in the mix, it&#x27;s kinda like making a mud pie which is always a fun time...</li>
            <li> , i think its henna generally.</li>
            <li> I barely noticed any difference using this product,</li>
            <li> That being said, I was left to wonder how I would continue to naturally dye my hair and hopefully reverse some of the damage I&#x27;d caused from years at the salon.</li>
            <li> by random people asking what kind of hair color</li>

            <li> So I can damage my hair to color it and it lasts just as long as the product that perfects it?</li>
            <li> but it did nothing to cover my grey.</li>

            <li> Be careful, as it will stain as will all hair colorants.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with the water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Semi-permanent (will have to repeat every 3-6 weeks--but at roughly $7 a box</li>
            <li> product is like thick sandy mud, so it probably would have been easier to have someone help me apply it, especially with areas in the back and underneath.</li>
            <li> Its very fine and drives me crazy!</li>
            <li> Before when i used traditional hair color, I could barely comb through my hair bc of the tangled mess it left behind.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because it was not pure henna.</li>

            <li> If you try and highlight your hair or use regular hair dye years later the old hair that has this henna in it will turn a really ugly blue green and have the texture of melted gum.</li>
            <li> I still have chunks left in my hair because i was getting annoyed by how long it was taking to get all the chunks out.</li>
            <li> I know indigo is the 1st ingredient, but my hair turned out a DARK brown, my head itches and  </li>

            <li> Still have to wait a few days for the color to set</li>
            <li> I may update this after a few days to see if the color lightens up any..</li>
            <li> - the product is messy and stains, but so can box color.</li>
            <li> have naturally messy waves that sometimes curl, sometimes frizz.</li>
            <li> It was coffee brown and all my grays were covered, and I have quite a few now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Application is a bit messy.</li>

            <li> I did not love this product.  </li>
            <li> I anxiously waited for it&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> VERY messy, so prepare your bathroom.</li>
            <li> the negative side:&lt;br /&gt;yes</li>
            <li> Also, I feel that it dried out my hair, which I assume would get worse with repeated use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much worse</li>
            <li> Totally not happy.  </li>
            <li> The smell isnt that bad, it lingers for awhile a few weeks.</li>
            <li> And 5) LEAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 5 OR 6 HOURS, even over night; I know this may seem crazy to some</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find anything wrong.</li>
            <li> ammonia, peroxide and all those unnatural chemicals smell much MUCH  worse (not to mention the harm to your body and the environment)!</li>
            <li> This was sooo difficult to use, you have to leave it on for HOURS.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping henna was my saving grace, but not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> when I was washing it out, it smelled like a dirty ashtray.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> It washed away within a couple washes though.  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this in the mail and I was so excited! First time using henna. I loved how it came with gloves &amp; a plastic cover to put on my head when i applied the henna. The instructions were easy to understand and I mixed 1 egg and 6oz of black coffee with 6oz of very hot water and the color looks great. Still have to wait a few days for the color to set but I can&#x27;t find anything wrong. I had to use a metal pot to boil the water, which wasn&#x27;t recommended but I used a plastic bowl to mix it in and that seemed to turn out just fine, even though I used metal. Great product, I would use it again.</li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter tried this on her brown naturally curly hair, hoping to get some highlights, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for her. It did make her hair softer at first, which was nice, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I myself use the Color the Gray from the same company, so I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t do much for her</li>
            <li> Anyone who orders this product should know that what you get is essentially a bag of dirt, with little twigs in it and stuff, and when you mix it up, it smells and feels like elephant dung. That said, the color came out nice, although it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a natural hair color, and it&#x27;s amazing! My hair was light brown (highlighted last 5 months ago) and the color turned out a rich dark brown. To be honest, it&#x27;s darker than I thought from the chart on the box, but it&#x27;s gorgeous and my hair feels SO soft and healthy! I gave it 4 stars because of the mess and smell while you&#x27;re doing it, but I hope when I learn to use it a little more it won&#x27;t be quite as nasty messy. I mixed it with water and let it cure for an hour before putting it on my hair, then left it on my head for 2 hours. (It wasn&#x27;t very warm, it was cool in our house and I didn&#x27;t have time to sit and blow dry it the whole time.) Next time I may try mixing it with lemon juice to see what that does to the color. I was afraid it&#x27;d be too red, but the mix of henna and indigo makes it a beautiful walnut brown color, not red at all, just a rich brown.  I may update this after a few days to see if the color lightens up any..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6 months later: I still love Mountain Naturals. I used the Light Red this last time, and it&#x27;w wonderful. My natural ashy mousey brown turned a light red that softened after a few weeks into a great light auburn. To avoid the mess I&#x27;ve learned to apply it in the shower, and have an old button up shirt handy to put on. I get lots of compliments on the color, and it does last an AMAZING length of time (at least the red has.)</li>
            <li> I barely noticed any difference using this product, eventhough I let it cure as instructed for 3hours, and left it to develop on my hair for almost 4 hours....Also, I feel that it dried out my hair, which I assume would get worse with repeated use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for helping your hair get healthier and covering grays.  I especially like that the Light Mountain brand includes gloves, a cap, and complete instructions.  I mixed this with 1 cup hot water and 1 cup hot black coffee so it wouldn&#x27;t make my hair too light or orange.  I got nice dark red highlights over my dark brown hair.  I will continue to use henna and this product!</li>
            <li> First off, I have never written an Amazon product review before. But I found the other user reviews on this product very helpful and I hope that my input will be helpful to others too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the negative side:&lt;br /&gt;yes - the product is smelly... as one reviewer said \\&quot;putrid spinach\\&quot; is about right. But I&#x27;ve been box dying my hair for years and used to be a receptionist in a hair salon and last I checked ammonia, peroxide and all those unnatural chemicals smell much MUCH  worse (not to mention the harm to your body and the environment)! To combat the smell, I added some drops of lavender essential oil and that really seemed to help combat the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes - the product is messy and stains, but so can box color. I used coconut oil around the hairline and ears and cleaned up my face as I went and had no stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is like thick sandy mud, so it probably would have been easier to have someone help me apply it, especially with areas in the back and underneath. That being said, I managed just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive side: after you wash it out (which, yes, is like washing dry, cakey, gritty mud out of your hair) it will be worth it. I&#x27;ve vowed to never box dye or chemically treat my hair again after all the damage it has caused to my hair, my body, and the environment. Not to mention that this product is the same or cheaper than most box dyes with better results. My hair is shiny, soft, has natural highlights, and added a subtle color, getting rid of the nasty faded orange box dye color and blonde tips from the summer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with my husbands account, I&#x27;ve henna&#x27;d my hair 3 times now, the first time I used a different brand other than this, it worked great (it was all natural like this one) and the results were wonderful,but it did not come with the extras this brand does. I&#x27;ve used this brand twice and each time was very happy with how well it covered gray, how soft and silky my hair was afterwards, and that it lasted JUST as long as chemical color, what is that about? So I can damage my hair to color it and it lasts just as long as the product that perfects it? Its really not a hard choice here. My directions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a metal bowl (or even cut an old milk gallon in half)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use water, period, its a waste of henna when you could be adding apple cider vinegar, coffee, tea or pretty much any liquid with extra dying/conditioning benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Add as directed.&lt;br /&gt;You can leave this one for a few hours, and not see a whole lot of color change,(this is a stain more so than a dye) or, you can do the easy thing and sleep with it in your hair (this is MESSY/smells like grass stuff, healthy, better for you, thickens your hair rather than thins it yes, but messy stuff! This will stain ALL your fabric, use a towel you don&#x27;t care about but don&#x27;t throw it away, you can re-use that coffee/henna stained towel next time, and trust me after you feel your hair you&#x27;ll want to do this again.) I put it on right before bed, wrap my head in saran wrap, and wear pjs I don&#x27;t care about, sheets I don&#x27;t care about and a towel wrapped in saran with a dark pillow case over top. You don&#x27;t have to worry about over treating your hair with henna, its like getting too much dirt under your finger nails, its natural and washing off.&lt;br /&gt;After having henna on your hair for five to eight hours, the results are beautiful. Silky, shiny, thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally messy waves that sometimes curl, sometimes frizz. Its very fine and drives me crazy! After using this productonly 3 times I rarely use conditioner on my hair after shampooing. My hair is not frizzy, it is smooth and soft. It was coffee brown and all my grays were covered, and I have quite a few now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard from girls with all hair types that they LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention now I&#x27;m 14 weeks pregnant and I can color my hair with no worries! This is nothing that harms you let alone a precious life on the way so there is nothing to keep you from covering your gray with a baby on board. I rate this product a 9/10 mainly because its messy and smells like something you&#x27;d feed a pet horse, but the results are worth it, just make sure you clean your bathroom as you spill/drop things, it stains.</li>
            <li> i started using henna when i had short hair because i wanted stronger, thicker and reddish brown hair. i must say henna truly does all those three things. i love light mountain henna. i have tried the mahogany, red, bright red and light brown. my favorites are the red and the mahogany. i was using bright red for a period time which i liked, but i wanted to try the dark brown to switch things up a bit. my hair is beautiful, shiny and thick from the henna. i am just not in love with the light brown henna color because it lacks the red i adore. the light brown henna does not have much of a reddish hint to it. happy hennaing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it never, the smell, the texture, and by the way it do not cover the gray hair</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but it did nothing to cover my grey. I am going to try LIght Mountain for grey next time and will review it afterwards. I will say my hair is way healthier feeling and I can actually comb through it now. Before when i used traditional hair color, I could barely comb through my hair bc of the tangled mess it left behind. The smell isnt that bad, it lingers for awhile a few weeks. It reminds me of canned spinach smell, not really hay like others have said.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Why poison yourself with chemicals?! It takes a bit of time but its SO worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair looks great and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Just becareful what you add in (like coffe, spices, etc.) As the directions suggest... some things just smell very strange.&lt;br /&gt;And rinsing can be a challenge. Just keep rinsing!&lt;br /&gt;Can be messy too. I like to put it on, wrap the top in a plastic bag and wrap a bandana around the hairline to block the drips once your body heat gets to work on it... sit back, watch a movie, have a drink, work in the garden, clean the house... I don&#x27;t sleep in it though, it is too messy and the worry of leaks and disccomfort of stuff on my head keeps me awake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Light Mountain Henna for over 5 years.  My hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> I use 3T of this light brown henna plus 2/3T indigo powder to create a natural looking light ash brown on my salt and pepper gray hair.  I leave it on for 3 hours vice the recommended time.  I&#x27;m happy I switched from toxic home hair color to this henna.</li>
            <li> Ehhhh.  I did not love this product.  I was pregnant when I tried to use it, and wanted something to dye my gray hairs with but that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals so it wouldn&#x27;t harm my baby.  This was sooo difficult to use, you have to leave it on for HOURS.  The color turned pretty red, but I liked it.  It washed away within a couple washes though.  :(</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye. It&#x27;s inexpensive and so good for your hair. One box is two applications for shoulder length hair. My hair feels healthier and stronger. Application is a bit messy. I use a little grape seed oil and apple cider vinegar in the mix, it&#x27;s kinda like making a mud pie which is always a fun time...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. My hairdresser puts it on for me. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, like green tea lattes, but it got clumpy and would rub off while trying to apply it to the hair, then got runny as it was setting on my hair, and while rinsing it out it made my shower a mess. If you have a bathtub, definitely rinse it out in the bathtub. I still have chunks left in my hair because i was getting annoyed by how long it was taking to get all the chunks out. Also, it sort of smelled like cigarette ashes as I was rinsing it out. I did the test strand, and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my hair color, so I left it on a bit longer when I did the whole hair application. It turned out quite well. I think there is more indigo than henna in this mixture, so it turned out more on the dark side, which is awesome. I was really worried I would end up with bright red hair, because chemical dyes ALWAYS make my hair fade out to red. But I did just apply the color last night, so it might still end up turning out red later on, but for now, I am very happy with the color. I always heard henna would thicken the hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that. Perhaps because it was not pure henna.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and love it.  Previously purchased from Whole Foods.  My hair is a light to medium brown naturally and this color adds some red highlights, shine, and body.  I tried a Clairol product a couple of years ago thinking it would be faster and it made my hair so dry that it crackled when I rubbed it together.  Henna does take a while.  I mix it, let it sit for 2-3 hours, and then leave it on my hair for about an hour.  It does take awhile to remove as it is quite sandy feeling, but just keep rinsing, and lightly scrubbing with your hands and it will come out.  Be careful, as it will stain as will all hair colorants.  One reviewer mentioned mixing with or using metal.  Wrong!  The instructions specifically tell you to avoid metal, so I use a Corelle bowl, and plastic spoon, and a plastic comb.  I have never had a reaction or problem with this product.  It does cover my grey, but that will lighten within a couple of weeks.  Not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. There where toooo many reviews to go thru. I picket two types of the same brand on gut feeling and the neat looking box. I bought some also intended to treat grey hair. Encroaching grey hairs was the concerned (she used henna before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first she was concerned about or mineral rich well water. Sometimes it&#x27;s even very rust laden. Absolutely no problems with the water. The grey strands tuned to highlighted hair slightly lighter than the brown. We will use the grey formula once in a while and touch up with the regular formula when needed. No special prep was taken. The hair looks rich and has good sheen. Smells good (she added some ginger and lemon juice). It also took out some of the dryness and is holding up more than several weeks and still no signs of having to re do the treatment.</li>
            <li> love Mountain Light Henna...this is a nice color...1st try didnt change my hair too much...2nd try I mixed it with lemon juice and apple cider vinegar...worked great!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair with henna for decades, using this brand for about 15 years, and I have learned how to put it on from the experts: Moroccan women! These are my tips: 1) Mix two hair conditioner table spoons to the mixture, at the end, before putting it on. 2) Use a spoon (I have had no problem using stainless steel ones) to pour the henna on your hair. 3) After putting the henna, get some paper towel folded several times and wrap it around your hair baseline (this will capture the drippings). 4) Wrap your head in cling film. And 5) LEAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 5 OR 6 HOURS, even over night; I know this may seem crazy to some but this super long time with the henna on is the KEY TO GETTING A WONDERFUL DEEP COLOR; three hours should be the minimum (the more gray you have the more you need to leave it on); less than that will give you a pretty artificial color. I have been doing it like this for decades, and I am still stopped in the street, shops, etc. by random people asking what kind of hair color I am using and where I get it done! If you are a brunette with a few gray hair, use red or copper and leave it on for the time advised above and you will get very natural looking highlights.</li>
            <li> I have light/medium brown hair and was just looking to cover a few grays and make my color rich and shiny.  Perhaps light brown was too light, but I had no color change.  I would purchase again, but maybe a different color.  I like that it is cruelty free and they have a lot of color choices.  VERY messy, so prepare your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d finally put my foot down--NO MORE BLEACHING AND HARSH CHEMICALS! That being said, I was left to wonder how I would continue to naturally dye my hair and hopefully reverse some of the damage I&#x27;d caused from years at the salon. After much research henna seemed like the perfect option. But with so many options I was sort of confused!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my research one particular brand was repeatedly mentioned: Light Mountain Natural. After selecting the color I wanted (Light Brown) I anxiously waited for it&#x27;s arrival. The package arrived in a timely manner and included everything I needed to color my hair. The instructions were easy to follow and the results... Well, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ll no longer be needing the services of my hair stylist. I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;--Easy to follow instructions&lt;br /&gt;--Came with gloves and a cap&lt;br /&gt;--Left my hair shiny and soft&lt;br /&gt;--Many colors to choose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Hmm-hard to come up with much, but here goes...&lt;br /&gt;--Can be time consuming (make sure you&#x27;ve nowhere to be for a few hours).&lt;br /&gt;--Semi-permanent (will have to repeat every 3-6 weeks--but at roughly $7 a box I&#x27;m still saving a ton of money!)&lt;br /&gt;--Couldn&#x27;t wash my hair with shampoo for 24 hrs after the henna was rinsed from my hair, so the green tea-like smell stayed with me for a while.No big deal, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If you&#x27;re thinking about henna, I would definately recommend!***</li>
            <li> I bought the Light Brown mix to tone down my red hair. I know indigo is the 1st ingredient, but my hair turned out a DARK brown, my head itches and  when I was washing it out, it smelled like a dirty ashtray.  YUCK.  I thought that the smell would go away after shampooing, conditioning and blow drying but I still get whiffs of the stanky (I know it&#x27;s misspelled but it&#x27;s much worse then just stinky) smell.  I even feel like I can taste cigarettes.  Gross!!  I like the earthy smell of pure henna and cassia and don&#x27;t know if all indigo smells like this or just this brand but I will never buy it again.  Totally not happy.  It wouldn&#x27;t even fade when I soaked my hair with a pure coconut/olive oil blend.  I will buy the pure ingredients next time and mix my own.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for grays. I kept it on for 2 1/2 hours on my grays and the gray was still there. As much as i wanted to avoid it, i had no choice but to use a hair dye to cover grays. My hair also felt more dry using henna versus chemical hair dye- i know its counterintuitive but unhappily its true, for me, at least. I was hoping henna was my saving grace, but not for me unfortunately. I dont think it has anything to do with this brand, i think its henna generally. I&#x27;ll have to go back to hair dye....</li>
            <li> This Henna changes your hair structure. It never washes out you have to grow it out. If you try and highlight your hair or use regular hair dye years later the old hair that has this henna in it will turn a really ugly blue green and have the texture of melted gum. I had to cut all of my hair off. I went from waist length hair to one quarter inch of hair.</li>
