            <li>i purchased them early because of the great price , they came on time and as listed new will update when i use them.</li>
            <li>This is only about $2 more than Norelco but better priced here after that.</li>
            <li>Not needed as the cleaner that comes with the razor doesn&#x27;t work worth of flip.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes how clean these keep his razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s O.K., but not really used much as easier to just rinse a good head.</li>

            <li> Actually this works OK but I gave it 2 stars as a coupon comes with a new shaver to get three more at a better price and includes shipping. It is probably good as a refill but I do not like the shave of the shaver that requires this and I have used Norelco&#x27;s for many years. Read my 2 star review of the 9200 and 9700 before you buy. This is only about $2 more than Norelco but better priced here after that. Just a heads up in case you want to buy the shaver and refills; the shaver comes with one starter cartridge and a coupon for a discount on 3 more.</li>
            <li> Fair price and am now on automatic delivery.  Wish I could get these cheaper, but so far this is the best.</li>

            <li> Husband loves these for cleaning his shaver.  They work with his smartclean Norelco shaver.</li>

            <li> My husband really likes how clean these keep his razor. The solution does a better job than water alone. The solution has a fragrance, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.

            <li> Just what the Doctor Ordered to keep your razor clean and sharp.....try it you will &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> great product. Works great with Norelco Razer and cleaner system.</li>
            <li> If you clean your razor daily after each shave, 1 cartridge only last for approximately 1 month. RDF</li>
