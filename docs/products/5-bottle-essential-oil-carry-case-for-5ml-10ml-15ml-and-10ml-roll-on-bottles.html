            <li>It&#x27;s nicely padded and does the job well.</li>

            <li>The outermost ones best fit the 5mL bottles, but the 15s will fit too; they&#x27;re just a bit more snug.</li>

            <li>So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>cute and made well.</li>
            <li>This carrying case is cute and functional.  </li>
            <li>the ones you would most need on-the-go.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of keeping the bottles together.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>and I can actually fit about 4-5 more bottles than it says.</li>
            <li>Those are best held in the center positions, rather than the two outermost ones.</li>
            <li>I traveled with this and everything stayed safe and accessible.</li>
            <li>The zipper is smooth and opens/closes easily.</li>
            <li>Handy, and very functional.  </li>
            <li>I can fit my 2-4oz spray bottles in but not in the straps.</li>
            <li>The bottles fit in the elastic</li>
            <li>love the soft texture and it holds many bottles</li>
            <li>Cute and compact and very soft.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Great little portable case.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, smaller carrying case for just 5 oils -</li>
            <li>But you can definitely fit more than 5 bottles as long as you are using 5mL.</li>
            <li>was great for small and large bottles.</li>
            <li>You can actually get more in than it shows.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to be able to carry essential oils in my purse.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice small handy carrying case for essential oils.</li>
            <li>Because the case is plush, it stretches enough to accommodate up to 8 bottles fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It is very bulky for 5 bottles.</li>
            <li>Very versatile</li>
            <li>Colors are really soft and fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually even put three extra bottles into my case, on top of the five that are secured in with the elastic straps.</li>
            <li>It might be OK if your just wanting to transport a few oils in your purse.</li>
            <li>but I can tell they are going to fall right out if the bag is not flat</li>
            <li>Love this little pouch!</li>
            <li>Not sturdy enough for much else.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice case to carry oils in my purse, keeps them padded so they don&#x27;t get broken or if they should leak, it will keep it contained.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a decent purchase for its purpose.</li>
            <li>But it looks cheap and that&#x27;s a big let down.  </li>
            <li>This case is just the right size for carrying a few (5) of my oil bottles with me at a time.</li>
            <li>Just FYI, it will accommodate the taller, 10 mL roll-on bottles such as the Young Living Deep Relief Roll-on.</li>

            <li> I like that there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; to them because that usually causes me to pull them off trying to get my bottles in and out of the straps.  </li>

            <li> This carrying case is perfect for bringing along those &amp;#34;always used&amp;#34; essential oils for a trip or just to keep with you.  i used it for 5/8 dram vials up to 15 ml vials.  Very versatile</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my purse.  Good price. Soft and easy to clean.  Holds 5 months bottles CBRES but not 15 ml.</li>
            <li> The bottles fit perfectly. The zipper is smooth and opens/closes easily. Colors are really soft and fun. Padding is excellent for ensuring the protection of the glass.</li>

            <li> cute and made well. I use it everyday and it holds up well.</li>
            <li> This carrying case is cute and functional.  It fits just enough oils to carry around in my purse.  I like the holders and have had no problems with the oils coming out of the holders.</li>
            <li> love the soft texture and it holds many bottles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.  But it looks cheap and that&#x27;s a big let down.  But you can definitely fit more than 5 bottles as long as you are using 5mL.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel case.  Fits nicely in my mid size purse.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. The material is very cheap and it arrived DIRTY on the inside. This is going back.</li>
            <li> was great for small and large bottles. traveled well and didn&#x27;t get stuff in security with them in my purse</li>
            <li> This is a nice, smaller carrying case for just 5 oils - the ones you would most need on-the-go. It&#x27;s nicely padded and does the job well. I just wish it had a small handle, for the times that I take it separately from my purse or bag.

            <li> Protects the Bottles, travels well!  Love the convenience of keeping the bottles together.</li>
            <li> This case is just the right size for carrying a few (5) of my oil bottles with me at a time. Fits nicely in my medium-sized purses. Holds both 5 ml and 15 ml sized oils bottles.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Cute and compact and very soft.  There is NO cardboard or anything to keep it firm, it is very pliable...meaning I can fold it or roll it if I wanted to, but I don&#x27;t.! :)  I like that there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; to them because that usually causes me to pull them off trying to get my bottles in and out of the straps.  These straps are firm.  They hold my 15ML bottles and my teeny tiny sample bottles.  Let&#x27;s not forget my roller bottles!  This is great.  I can fit my 2-4oz spray bottles in but not in the straps.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice case to carry oils in my purse, keeps them padded so they don&#x27;t get broken or if they should leak, it will keep it contained.</li>
            <li> The colors of the bag are off. The green is not even close to what the picture is. The bottles fit in the elastic but I can tell they are going to fall right out if the bag is not flat</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
