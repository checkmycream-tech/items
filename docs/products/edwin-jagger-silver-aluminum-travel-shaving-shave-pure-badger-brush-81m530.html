    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The storage and drying of the brush work perfectly.    </li>
            <li>and it always works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Perfect for that feeling of home on the road!</li>
            <li>This is a great travel brush!</li>
            <li>Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li>The aluminum housing is beautiful, and the threads are perfectly cut so assembly is a pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>For that alone it is a great brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall happy with quality and price.</li>
            <li>The case is a work of art and functions great.</li>
            <li>I also own one of their brushes in best badger.</li>
            <li>My husband loved this brush.</li>
            <li>but I wanted a travel brush since I spend a good bit of time on the road.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality and design</li>
            <li>Bought this for travel, and it is better than the one I keep at home!  </li>
            <li>I like how convenient this piece is, the piece screws together nicely.</li>
            <li>The container is good but requires bit more taking apart and putting together than it should.</li>
            <li>so you have a nice grip.  </li>
            <li>If the knot came with high quality hair and had a shorter loft, then it would be an excellent travel brush.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best one, nice looking, soft and laters</li>
            <li>used all hot water and shaving cream (Art of Shaving Sandalwood) and feels great.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to many years of using this brush while travelling.</li>
            <li>I own four of their razors and enjoy their creams and balms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect brush for travellers for whom space is at a premium, and the aluminum handle is ingeniously designed to allow the brush to dry even when prepped for travel.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to be just the right amount of firmness to be comfortable and generate a good lather.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my needs I have even had to store it wet</li>
            <li>So far, it works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Edwin Jagger products.</li>
            <li>I wish that they had a travel brush stand to fit this brush.  </li>
            <li>Light weight for traveling and packs up in a moment.  </li>
            <li>and it still works great after I open it up again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and protects the brush well during travel.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and even more quickly if you aim the hair dryer at it for about 5 seconds</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re used to a higher grade of badger hair, you won&#x27;t love the feel of the brush.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also more of a smell to the brush when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush purely for the novelty of being able to unscrew it and store it in my dop kit while traveling.</li>
            <li>The brush though full has not been sanded at the tips to soften and feels &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Super lightweight as well.</li>
            <li>Love the travel design - beautifully machines parts to allow the brush to be store inside the tube but remain open to dry and then to attach to the handle</li>
            <li>That being said, the brush dries quickly and for a short trip, does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>The brush is made from pure badger hair, which is the lowest grade of badger available.</li>
            <li>It also holds up very well to travel and the design is pretty cool in my opinion in addition to being really light weight.</li>
            <li>He was so excited that he now has a pure badger brush to take with him on business trips.</li>
            <li>There are many other better brushes (even from the art of shaving people or Evelyn and Crabtree).</li>
            <li>i own several shaving brushes, right from pure badger till silver tip    </li>
            <li>Having a little difficulty getting a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Like all Edwin Jagger products this travel brush is first class all the way.  </li>
            <li>Simple &amp; elegant.  </li>
            <li>really!)</li>
            <li>With so many other options available (a quality brush carried in a ventilated pill bottle, an inexpensive boar brush, or fast drying synthetic), I would search elsewhere for a travel brush.</li>
            <li>I configures easily, although I suspect some users at first might think the handle is tiny.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it broke down and assembled.  </li>
            <li>and I love the design which allows the brush to dry even after putting it away.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Brush is precision made and well designed for travel.</li>
            <li>the brush is as large as a non-travel size badger brush.</li>
            <li>The downside is that the pure badger hair is quite \\&quot;scritchy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This was a great value--beautifully machined metal and a thick premium badger bristle brush!</li>
            <li>The brush is very prickly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>The brush also splays very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The long soft bristles work so much better than my wooden-handled brush that I use it at home too.</li>
            <li>If you travel with DE safety razors, I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>The brush&#x27;s loft is way too high.</li>
            <li>and I i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>With a little care, you can unscrew the top and pack the brush inside its handle.</li>
            <li>and this brush is stiff enough to work up a good lather, but still soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I know it is not 100% badger hair since it fills a little bit more brittle (not as soft) as my Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>This is good when you want a quick drying brush, but bad when loading because the brush doesn&#x27;t hold much lather.</li>
            <li>Well, not only is this adequate, but it is almost as nice as the expensive one.  </li>
            <li>Now if I could only get Edwin Jagger to create a matching aluminum soap dish with a lid that screws on my shaving kit would be complete!!!</li>
            <li>The large ventilation hole means minimal drying time even when you&#x27;re in a hurry to get on the road.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>While the brush isn&#x27;t quite as soft as a larger badger hair brush, it is quite satisfactory for travel.</li>
            <li>When face lathering, it&#x27;s very floppy on the face and can be difficult to precisely apply lather.</li>
            <li>As a concept, it&#x27;s great but the (poor) quality of the hair (paired with its high loft) make it difficult to use.&lt;br</li>

            <li> But, it takes up very little room, dries really fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a week now, and while it is quite small, it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> (I always dry my blades with a dryer as it makes them last about 10 times longer...</li>
            <li> The high loft also means that this brush has very little scrub.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you want to do a proper wet shave, even when traveling.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is not a high quality badger hair brush.</li>
            <li> This little brush makes it possible.</li>
            <li> only concern is keeping the brush upside down to dry, The piece itself does have a hole where the brush goes through so during transit it can be upside down</li>
            <li> It packs up very small and the design is such that you can pack it when wet and it will dry since one end of the canister is open to the air.</li>
            <li> The knot is not very dense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other travel brushes and have always thrown them away.</li>
            <li> Yes a few hairs here and there occasionally fall out, but I have yet to any shave brush that don&#x27;t lose a few hairs now and then.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get bristles back in tube without bending or breaking some.  </li>
            <li> There is a small hole in the bottom, so if it isn&#x27;t quite dry when you pack it, it can breathe and not get all funky.</li>
            <li> but in a tight space (garment bag) which may cause moisture and premature</li>
            <li> That way he could keep his regular (expensive) brush at home and not worry about something happening to it while schlepping it about in a suit case.  </li>
            <li> Its weak backbone makes loading soap and face lathering a chore.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> This brush, however, was a disappointment.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i own several shaving brushes, right from pure badger till silver tip    this is one of the best one, nice looking, soft and laters well. I use it in rotation and carry it in my gym bag    a must buy...</li>
            <li> My husband loved this brush. He was so excited that he now has a pure badger brush to take with him on business trips. I wish that they had a travel brush stand to fit this brush.  Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Like all Edwin Jagger products this travel brush is first class all the way.  The aluminum housing is beautiful, and the threads are perfectly cut so assembly is a pleasure.  The Badger hair is a medium stiffness, which I find works well.  My travel size soap dish is only about 3\\&quot; diameter and this brush is stiff enough to work up a good lather, but still soft on the skin.  The storage and drying of the brush work perfectly.    Now if I could only get Edwin Jagger to create a matching aluminum soap dish with a lid that screws on my shaving kit would be complete!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a week now, and while it is quite small, it lathers very well. It&#x27;s the perfect brush for travellers for whom space is at a premium, and the aluminum handle is ingeniously designed to allow the brush to dry even when prepped for travel. I will definitely be taking this brush with me on my deployment.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to many years of using this brush while travelling. I liked the way it broke down and assembled.  However my brush sheds.  I end up with one or two bristles in the soap dish when creating lather and another one or two on my face each time I use it.  I do not pull it out of the base/container so there is no reason for it to shed.  Just like a paint brush this shows the quality of this shaving brush is not up to snuff.</li>
            <li> Simple &amp; elegant.  Light weight for traveling and packs up in a moment.  The long soft bristles work so much better than my wooden-handled brush that I use it at home too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you want to do a proper wet shave, even when traveling. This little brush makes it possible. With a little care, you can unscrew the top and pack the brush inside its handle. There is a small hole in the bottom, so if it isn&#x27;t quite dry when you pack it, it can breathe and not get all funky. I have taken it to Greece and back and it always works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling.  A must for brush shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush purely for the novelty of being able to unscrew it and store it in my dop kit while traveling. For that alone it is a great brush. That being said, it is not a high quality badger hair brush. The bristles are prickly and if you were going to use this every day you would ultimately decide to just smear the cream on your face with your fingers after about a week. There are many other better brushes (even from the art of shaving people or Evelyn and Crabtree). But, it takes up very little room, dries really fast and it gets the job done for you in a pinch. It also holds up very well to travel and the design is pretty cool in my opinion in addition to being really light weight.</li>
            <li> Hard to get bristles back in tube without bending or breaking some.  Having a little difficulty getting a good lather.  Otherwise does what you need.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I read the reviews but I wanted a travel brush since I spend a good bit of time on the road.  Yes a few hairs here and there occasionally fall out, but I have yet to any shave brush that don&#x27;t lose a few hairs now and then.  This is perfect for my needs I have even had to store it wet and it still works great after I open it up again.  Perfect for that feeling of home on the road!</li>
            <li> This is a great travel brush! I use it with an arko stick when I am away from home. I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere in the world without my travel brush as it lathers the soap quite well and then after use it fits neatly into its metal container. If you travel with DE safety razors, I highly recommend this brush. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel, and it is better than the one I keep at home!  The brush seems to be just the right amount of firmness to be comfortable and generate a good lather.</li>
            <li> This is my short term review as I just used it this week.  I like how convenient this piece is, the piece screws together nicely. The bristles are semi-soft, none fell out after 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used all hot water and shaving cream (Art of Shaving Sandalwood) and feels great. I know it is not 100% badger hair since it fills a little bit more brittle (not as soft) as my Art of Shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is keeping the brush upside down to dry, The piece itself does have a hole where the brush goes through so during transit it can be upside down but in a tight space (garment bag) which may cause moisture and premature breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with quality and price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a travel companion because its screw case appealed to me. As a concept, it&#x27;s great but the (poor) quality of the hair (paired with its high loft) make it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The case is a work of art and functions great. It&#x27;s light and protects the brush well during travel.&lt;br /&gt;-- The large ventilation hole means minimal drying time even when you&#x27;re in a hurry to get on the road.&lt;br /&gt;-- The handle is made from aluminum which means it won&#x27;t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The brush&#x27;s loft is way too high. When face lathering, it&#x27;s very floppy on the face and can be difficult to precisely apply lather. The high loft also means that this brush has very little scrub.&lt;br /&gt;-- The brush is made from pure badger hair, which is the lowest grade of badger available. The brush is very prickly on the face.&lt;br /&gt;-- Its weak backbone makes loading soap and face lathering a chore.&lt;br /&gt;-- The knot is not very dense. This is good when you want a quick drying brush, but bad when loading because the brush doesn&#x27;t hold much lather. The brush also splays very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Edwin Jagger products. I own four of their razors and enjoy their creams and balms. I also own one of their brushes in best badger. This brush, however, was a disappointment. If the knot came with high quality hair and had a shorter loft, then it would be an excellent travel brush. With so many other options available (a quality brush carried in a ventilated pill bottle, an inexpensive boar brush, or fast drying synthetic), I would search elsewhere for a travel brush.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as a gift for my husband to use when traveling.  That way he could keep his regular (expensive) brush at home and not worry about something happening to it while schlepping it about in a suit case.  Well, not only is this adequate, but it is almost as nice as the expensive one.  This was a great value--beautifully machined metal and a thick premium badger bristle brush!</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger Silver Aluminum Travel Shaving Shave Pure Badger Brush is precision made and well designed for travel. It packs up very small and the design is such that you can pack it when wet and it will dry since one end of the canister is open to the air. When fully assembled (which is a simple task) the brush is as large as a non-travel size badger brush. I am very pleased with the quality and design and I i would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The container is good but requires bit more taking apart and putting together than it should. The brush though full has not been sanded at the tips to soften and feels &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34;. I hope this will abrade off with use.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my AOS travel brush started losing bristles. So far, it works great and I love the design which allows the brush to dry even after putting it away.</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel. While the brush isn&#x27;t quite as soft as a larger badger hair brush, it is quite satisfactory for travel. I configures easily, although I suspect some users at first might think the handle is tiny. It isn&#x27;t, it screws into the larger case which acts as a longer handle. It dries quickly and even more quickly if you aim the hair dryer at it for about 5 seconds (I always dry my blades with a dryer as it makes them last about 10 times longer...really!) I&#x27;ve owned other travel brushes and have always thrown them away. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the travel design - beautifully machines parts to allow the brush to be store inside the tube but remain open to dry and then to attach to the handle so you have a nice grip.  Super lightweight as well. The downside is that the pure badger hair is quite \\&quot;scritchy\\&quot; so if you&#x27;re used to a higher grade of badger hair, you won&#x27;t love the feel of the brush.  There&#x27;s also more of a smell to the brush when you first start using it.  That being said, the brush dries quickly and for a short trip, does the job nicely.</li>
