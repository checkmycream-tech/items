            <li>I use this as a contour color on lighter skin, t is the perfect color!</li>
            <li>Great coverage!  </li>
            <li>Would be great for anyone with darker skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing loved it as always!</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good buy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did that with this!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice powder, but does seem lighter once you get it on your skin as compared to still in the container</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s suitable for every day use or over a lighter foundation that you have and want to use.</li>
            <li>Anywho Love it, gotta have..</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and light.</li>
            <li>This thing is full of shimmer!</li>
            <li>meduim-dark, italian skin and this powder is great in the winter as a bronzer.</li>
            <li>but i like how light weight it is.</li>
            <li>Nice color but very shimmery.</li>
            <li>I would think it is more for fair skinned African Americans, or used sparingly on skin like mine.</li>
            <li>if your trying to use this for a all over face powder try something else because this is full of shimmers.</li>
            <li>I have normal smooth skin</li>
            <li>but I certainly do!</li>
            <li>I apply with a large brush, rather than the puff provided.</li>
            <li>Works well with a brush, large quantity.</li>
            <li>It does not add the shimmer that a bronzer adds, but it really brightens up my face without looking like I am going for a \\&quot;tanned\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>The color was more bronze and darker than I expected</li>
            <li>It works really well for that</li>
            <li>It has never broken out my skin at all, but I remember when I began to use it, it smelled like Noxema,, Remember?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that much about makeup</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t use it because there is too much glitter .</li>
            <li>So ordering from the US, and even though its only  2.99, its costing me 14.99 with shipping and taxes, but its worth it to me..</li>
            <li>I always try my makeup testing it before I actual use it when I do my makeup just to make sure I don&#x27;t mess up my face if a certain product isn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li>I love it, its so thin, and feels so natural against my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a decent loose powder for the price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> In the US, I have to hunt for it, but eventually do stumble upon it.</li>
            <li> As other buyers have commented, there&#x27;s definitely a shimmer</li>
            <li> So you think you can&#x27;t really go wrong with a translucent powder right??</li>
            <li> Shimmer should only be used for highlighting the tops of your checks not for all over your face, you will look a mess!</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a slight sparkle to it and an unusaly fragrance for a loose powder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, but works well with my skin tone with a tan.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drugstore they were having a sale, I normally don&#x27;t buy drugstore powders because I hate the qaulity and the end result of my makeup, however I decided to give this a try because I needed a loose everyday powder to set my bb cream with.</li>
            <li> Once I have applied the powder all over my face, I use a blush brush and use the powder on my checks in a circular motion which makes it a little darker..  </li>
            <li> A little too traslucent for me, but like it</li>
            <li> Very dissapoited because the powder itself isn&#x27;t bad at all, but</li>
            <li> , I was shocked to see how much glitter was in this, who the hell puts shimmer in a all over face powder?</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I will do with it as yet.</li>
            <li> Also very messy when opoening the cap.</li>
            <li> I spend my year living in Canada and in the US, and always find it very difficult to find, especially in Canada.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their TruBlend base mineral powder before and it has simmer but not as excessive.  </li>
            <li> I moisturize like crazy then apply the translucent powder.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>

            <li> I use this product during the summer to cover scars on my legs.  It&#x27;s dark, but works well with my skin tone with a tan.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice powder, but does seem lighter once you get it on your skin as compared to still in the container</li>
            <li> Blends well with brown skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drugstore they were having a sale, I normally don&#x27;t buy drugstore powders because I hate the qaulity and the end result of my makeup, however I decided to give this a try because I needed a loose everyday powder to set my bb cream with. So you think you can&#x27;t really go wrong with a translucent powder right?? WRONG! This thing is full of shimmer! Like glitter specks on your face! I always try my makeup testing it before I actual use it when I do my makeup just to make sure I don&#x27;t mess up my face if a certain product isn&#x27;t for me and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did that with this!, I was shocked to see how much glitter was in this, who the hell puts shimmer in a all over face powder? Some people don&#x27;t have a problem with it but I certainly do! Shimmer should only be used for highlighting the tops of your checks not for all over your face, you will look a mess! Very dissapoited because the powder itself isn&#x27;t bad at all, but if your trying to use this for a all over face powder try something else because this is full of shimmers.</li>
            <li> I have used this color forever. I have meduim-dark, italian skin and this powder is great in the winter as a bronzer. It does not add the shimmer that a bronzer adds, but it really brightens up my face without looking like I am going for a \\&quot;tanned\\&quot; look. It just adds some life to my skin. I apply with a large brush, rather than the puff provided. Would be great for anyone with darker skin. It is not beige. I would think it is more for fair skinned African Americans, or used sparingly on skin like mine.</li>
            <li> The color was more bronze and darker than I expected so i use it as a bronzer for my cheeks. It works really well for that</li>
            <li> As other buyers have commented, there&#x27;s definitely a shimmer but I like it!</li>
            <li> I look like a sparkily Christmas ornament!  I&#x27;ve used their TruBlend base mineral powder before and it has simmer but not as excessive.  I would say if you have oily, combination/oily or combination skin I would say stay away from this one.  .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years, and unless they stop making it, it will probably be another 10.  I&#x27;m medium brown skin, and I don&#x27;t wear any foundation... I moisturize like crazy then apply the translucent powder. I love it, its so thin, and feels so natural against my skin. Once I have applied the powder all over my face, I use a blush brush and use the powder on my checks in a circular motion which makes it a little darker..  I spend my year living in Canada and in the US, and always find it very difficult to find, especially in Canada. In the US, I have to hunt for it, but eventually do stumble upon it. It has never broken out my skin at all, but I remember when I began to use it, it smelled like Noxema,, Remember?, Doesn&#x27;t smell like that anymore. Anywho Love it, gotta have.. Couldn&#x27;t even find it on the Canadian Amazon site... So ordering from the US, and even though its only  2.99, its costing me 14.99 with shipping and taxes, but its worth it to me..</li>
            <li> I use this as a contour color on lighter skin, t is the perfect color!</li>
            <li> Great coverage!  I have normal smooth skin and it&#x27;s suitable for every day use or over a lighter foundation that you have and want to use.</li>
            <li> A little too traslucent for me, but like it</li>
            <li> This is a decent loose powder for the price. Yes it does have a slight sparkle to it and an unusaly fragrance for a loose powder but i like how light weight it is.</li>
            <li> I bought product from walmart. The only reason why I bought it was because I needed to cover my tattoo and I thought this would be a good buy. I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so... shimmery. The last thing I want is for people to see the tattoo and even thou it did cover it you can see just brown and shimmer. I don&#x27;t know that much about makeup but I thought that translucent was going to set not set and shine. I got the 125 tawny .</li>
            <li> Amazing loved it as always!</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and light. Works well with a brush, large quantity. But I can&#x27;t use it because there is too much glitter . Also very messy when opoening the cap.</li>
            <li> I thought this face powder would work for me, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. My skin was too shiny. I had to revert back to my regular makeup.</li>
            <li> Nice color but very shimmery.I don&#x27;t like all the glitter on for daytime use. I think maybe I can get away with it at nights. I am not sure what I will do with it as yet. Maybe give it away as a gift.  I dont like glitter on my face.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I went to apply this powder and ended up looking like I could have been an extra in a Twilight movie. IT IS SO SHIMMERY! I actually like the powder, I just can&#x27;t deal with all of the sparkles. I think this should be mentioned in the description.</li>
