            <li> The seller shipped the items quicker than expected and was wrapped up in tissue paper - it was like getting a little present!</li>
            <li> They work extremely well for blow outs</li>
            <li> We use them every day, but some are already breaking. :/</li>
            <li> This are the worst quality clips I have bought in my 22 yrs of career, they are super hard to open, and to complete the bad experience when I notified the seller of that issue, ( doctored locks, inc)</li>
            <li> They give me the hold and grip that I was looking for and it took me hardly anytime to receive them.</li>

            <li> These seem to be well made and I expect them to last better than most clips or at least I hope so</li>
            <li> These clips are THE BEST!</li>
            <li> It works well but I just don&#x27;t like the company name to be bold and printed on top of the clip. It looks like I am advertising the product.</li>

            <li> I have very fine hair and all those clips that say they work for fine hair never really work with my hair. These were perfect. I have even started using them instead of butterfly clips to put my hair up during the day and you can&#x27;t see any of the clip since my hair covers it. Comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li> These clips are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> These clips are a tremendous help to section my hair while drying it. I am&lt;br /&gt;pleased with this item and the seller.The price was good,they were packaged well and shipping was fast.</li>

            <li> They work extremely well for blow outs Sectioning and Haircolor application Sectioning . They hold the finest of hair Also, great for thicker hair due to their sturdy, quality design</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these.  They barely hold the hair and slip off constantly.</li>
            <li> This are the worst quality clips I have bought in my 22 yrs of career, they are super hard to open, and to complete the bad experience when I notified the seller of that issue, ( doctored locks, inc) they claimed that since I openeded the bag is considered used so NO CREDIT BACK... What a scam, so If they prefer to turn away a good client over 12 dlls go ahead! A fair warning to the other people in the beauty industry.. Beware!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ever work without these again! Holds sections of hair very well!</li>
