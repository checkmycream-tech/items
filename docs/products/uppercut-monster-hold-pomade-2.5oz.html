            <li>Great hold...</li>
            <li>Great product, holds well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of pomades trying to find the one that fits my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>smells good too.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>But this pomade is really good and retaining your hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Nice medium shine and great hold.</li>
            <li>so it goes in my hair easy and had a great hold.  </li>
            <li>Great hold and easy</li>
            <li>Great pomade,very strong</li>
            <li>Completely impressed, and would certainly order again</li>
            <li>It compliments my shampoo stank quite nicely</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great work Uppercut!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried Imperial, Sauvecito, Uppercut Deluxe, Layrite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is nice, it makes applying a lot easier.  </li>
            <li>After i was able to get a fair amount of it off my hands i went about my day while thinking if was going to damage my hair in any way.</li>
            <li>Im not liking this one, honestly.  </li>
            <li>Kind of... industrial greasy smelling.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been looking for a nice pomade-type product for a while.</li>
            <li>Holds pretty good and looks great if done correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of all of them the Uppercut Deluxe and Monster Hold work best for my unmanageable wild</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look good which is not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>Once you get it on you hand, you have to wash it away with very strong scrubs.</li>
            <li>Good pomade that does what it says and does a rather fine job at that.</li>
            <li>Holds great all day with sweat and being active all day, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>holds hair like its supposed to and smells good ( light coconut ).</li>
            <li>The Uppercut Deluxe Pomade is way better.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty nice, and you catch a whiff of it every now and then throughout your day and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it for that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than having it smell like s</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>A lot better than most.</li>
            <li>This product also is a bit more pricey than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>product works for me better than any out there on the market</li>
            <li>this monster hold stuff is more plyable than murrays,</li>
            <li>Ok so i got this product in the mail</li>
            <li>if anybody knows a way to wash out this product please let me know so that i can use it :}</li>
            <li>It is outstanding.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>for the price, you could get way more</li>
            <li>Would love to see this hold with Matt finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different pomades, but this one has the best hold.</li>
            <li>And oh my, he looks incredibly handsome.</li>
            <li>Compared to other pomades it has the best hold in the summer heat..</li>
            <li>I may have been spoiled since Layrite and Suavecito develop their products to be easily washed out, but Uppercut is nothing like that.</li>
            <li>I thought it was maybe just the hands and that it would shampoo out easily, but with shampooing and condition twice on one shower and taking two showers per day and me having not put on anymore product since.</li>
            <li>It is not a monster hold but a decent good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you do not suffer from acne or have acne prone skin and are looking for a STRONG hold, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I have the craziest bushiest hair ever, not wavy, not curly, fine hair just lots of</li>
            <li>The smell of this is light and neutral.</li>
            <li>About the only good thing I can say about it</li>
            <li>Top marks on the package design, not so much on everything else.</li>
            <li>Should last a good while for one can.</li>
            <li>and if it gets mussed up by wind all I have to do is comb it back real quick and my hair is on fleek once more.</li>
            <li>Super super greasy.</li>
            <li>A little pricy, but looks great and holds up all day</li>
            <li>You can kind of blend the two (monstor &amp; Dax)together in your palms to get a slightly different texture if required.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, which is definitely an added bonus!</li>
            <li>I ordering another tin right now</li>
            <li>Dawn dish detergent washes it right out</li>
            <li>Held great all day with medium shine, like most waxy pomades it takes a little extra washes to come out.</li>
            <li>i have tried many different pomades and this is my favorite by far</li>
            <li>, if you are a skin conscious person and tend to break out easily on your forehead, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>washing first helps a bit.</li>
            <li>I finish this first tin.</li>
            <li>Holds all day and in most cases even till the next day.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have had a few products from this line and they are all good stuff.</li>
            <li>wash off very easily so after applying I use soap and water on my hands and then dry on a towel</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a Pomade that really holds your hair in place, then you have found the right product.</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight hair and do an alright comb-job</li>
            <li>But the only reason for 4 stars is that this stuff DOES NOT WASH OUT OF YOUR HAIR EASILY.</li>
            <li>I have very light medium length hair, this product makes my hair super greasy immediately no matter how much i use, little or a lot.</li>
            <li>The actual product and the job it does fine.</li>
            <li>Straight up candle wax in the hair and water just rolls off of it basically.</li>
            <li>but if  I&#x27;m doing too much it will fall out of style and I will have to restyle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a much stronger hold.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair looked when i styled it with this product</li>
            <li>It does not take a whole lot of product to get it to do what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>Works very well and holds all day.</li>
            <li>Its also very flexible for pomps or whatever you choose to do with your hair...</li>
            <li>If you want your hairstyle to stay put the whole day</li>
            <li>Nice hold at the cost of greasy stiff vasaline texture.</li>
            <li>Monster hold lasts all day long and is easy to style.</li>
            <li>Never tried Uppercut&#x27;s original stuff, but this Monster Hold is a petroleum based product and will do the same to your hair as Murray&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most pomades on the market and would only recommend Imperial Extra Hold or Shiner&#x27;s Psycho Hold.</li>
            <li>you just want a decent pomade, this is a decent way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone that digs an ole school Rockabilly ponp....</li>
            <li>which may not mean a lot</li>
            <li>Works great but seems expensive.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that is strong enough to maintain it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;m putting it right back into my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>i was rocking a pretty high pompadore and it would last all day/night.</li>
            <li>I live by the Uppercut brand.  </li>
            <li>It is good ,but not bertter for Asian hard hair.</li>
            <li>else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1: I have been using this predominately recently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different pomades (suavacito, American crew, axe,etc) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My previous favorite pomade was Layrite Extra Hold, but this one has just taken its spot on my counter.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with non-water based pomades, but this was by far the greasiest and most unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I have to gripe about is the price, 18 dollars is way too much for a 2.8 oz container of pomade in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>As far as holding the shape goes, it does alright.  </li>
            <li>and it adds just the right amount of shine, not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li>it does get a little pasty and might leave some small bits of paste in your hair, but once you comb through it well enough, it should look great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out new pomades each time my current one runs out, and I&#x27;d have to say this is my least favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Soap and water alone do not get this off your hands same goes for a decent shampoo and rinse for your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not water soluble, so the more you put it on everyday, the harder it is to take it out.</li>
            <li>it holds better than any, its a bit tough to get out of the hair</li>
            <li>When I pop it in and style it in the morning, I barely have to fix my hair when night time comes around.  </li>
            <li>Uppercut Monster Hold really just felt like any normal wax product since it didn&#x27;t keep my hairstyle up and eventually went limp.  </li>
            <li>After a while your hair does fall back down but only a quick adjustment will do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get a slick or a dry look.</li>
            <li>Seriously you&#x27;ll have to use a paper towel or rag to clean it off without your hands feeling gross.</li>
            <li>But after getting used to it a little bit, he absolutely loves it.</li>

            <li> a much stronger hold.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair looked when i styled it with this product</li>
            <li> It does not take a whole lot of product to get it to do what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> Works very well and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Its also very flexible for pomps or whatever you choose to do with your hair...</li>
            <li> If you want your hairstyle to stay put the whole day</li>
            <li> Nice hold at the cost of greasy stiff vasaline texture.</li>
            <li> Monster hold lasts all day long and is easy to style.</li>
            <li> Never tried Uppercut&#x27;s original stuff, but this Monster Hold is a petroleum based product and will do the same to your hair as Murray&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most pomades on the market and would only recommend Imperial Extra Hold or Shiner&#x27;s Psycho Hold.</li>
            <li> you just want a decent pomade, this is a decent way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone that digs an ole school Rockabilly ponp....</li>
            <li> which may not mean a lot</li>
            <li> Works great but seems expensive.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that is strong enough to maintain it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;m putting it right back into my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> i was rocking a pretty high pompadore and it would last all day/night.</li>
            <li> I live by the Uppercut brand.  </li>
            <li> It is good ,but not bertter for Asian hard hair.</li>
            <li> else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1: I have been using this predominately recently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different pomades (suavacito, American crew, axe,etc) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My previous favorite pomade was Layrite Extra Hold, but this one has just taken its spot on my counter.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with non-water based pomades, but this was by far the greasiest and most unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have to gripe about is the price, 18 dollars is way too much for a 2.8 oz container of pomade in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> As far as holding the shape goes, it does alright.  </li>
            <li> and it adds just the right amount of shine, not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li> it does get a little pasty and might leave some small bits of paste in your hair, but once you comb through it well enough, it should look great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out new pomades each time my current one runs out, and I&#x27;d have to say this is my least favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Soap and water alone do not get this off your hands same goes for a decent shampoo and rinse for your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not water soluble, so the more you put it on everyday, the harder it is to take it out.</li>
            <li> it holds better than any, its a bit tough to get out of the hair</li>
            <li> When I pop it in and style it in the morning, I barely have to fix my hair when night time comes around.  </li>
            <li> Uppercut Monster Hold really just felt like any normal wax product since it didn&#x27;t keep my hairstyle up and eventually went limp.  </li>
            <li> After a while your hair does fall back down but only a quick adjustment will do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to get a slick or a dry look.</li>
            <li> Seriously you&#x27;ll have to use a paper towel or rag to clean it off without your hands feeling gross.</li>
            <li> But after getting used to it a little bit, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it&#x27;s honestly too long lasting and nearly impossible to rinse out of your hair.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time though once you have it applied.  </li>
            <li> long lasting holds</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a ridiculously long lasting hold, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Kind of greasy look and impossible to remove from hands and hair.</li>
            <li> This product is so dry, you can rub evenly through your hair, how is it possible for anyone to use?</li>
            <li> The texture has been melted due to general summer heat.  </li>
            <li> Tough clean up for a extreme hold and volume.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s been in my hair all day it usually comes out completely by the time I shower the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Product does not wash out completely, after a few times you find yourself with a head of gunk.</li>
            <li> I have to wear a hat several times a day with my job ( military )</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely different from any of the other hair products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Meaning it will grab and pull if you apply on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you mess around with this stuff as its hard to completely rinse out and will get all over your pillow cases causing your forehead to erupt with pomade pimples.</li>
            <li> The only benefit that Layrite has over this is that it is a little easier to wash out, but this stuff isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using Layrite or Suavecito, I feel like Uppercut will be a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and every other Uppercut product on the market.</li>
            <li> A little tough to work with, but it does hold your hair really well.  </li>
            <li> Washing out is a little difficult, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well with little water, don&#x27;t apply on a wet head, damp is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only issue is it&#x27;s a bit hard to wash off your hands when you&#x27;re done applying.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it stays on your fingers and is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Holds but not worth the hassle of trying to wash it out.</li>
            <li> In that case not worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it should come with a stick to fight off the ladies with.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s designed to break down oil and grease...</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that Uppercut makes one mean pomade and the monster hold is no different..</li>
            <li> Every other products I&#x27;ve tried either falls after a few hours or gets crunchy</li>
            <li> Less shiney than Dax (</li>
            <li> and it holds it without any mess</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my thick, wavy hair very long.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used American crew hair products but found that it provided less than optimal control over my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> There have been times I&#x27;ve crashed after work and woken up with product still in; all that it needs is a combing and a little hairspray</li>
            <li> Lasted a little over a month.</li>
            <li> gel has little to no shine.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little shine, makes your hair look oily.</li>
            <li> A little greasy/waxy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Used this in a few weddings/partys and held through sweat, jumping around and beer spilling in my hair.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not light either.</li>
            <li> It is extremely waxy and incredibly hard to wash out of your hair and even your hands after applying it.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is the feel  and composition of the pomade.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer the strongest hold of any hair products because I like my hairstyle to stay firm throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My hair got all stringy, it continued to smell bad, and my natural waves fought through and took over after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I tried scrubbing really hard and the product still wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> since it was petroleum based it was really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> , even makes my hair smoother, and I have curly hair so a product like this is hard to find.</li>
            <li> One star for hard to apply on your hair...</li>
            <li> So hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> It is hard to wash out..</li>
            <li> Its sticky and hard to rub in your hands.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick like Murray&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This gel is thick and glue-y.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though...</li>
            <li> But a little too expensive</li>
            <li> I have used american crew pomade before this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> The hold was horrible also.not worth $18.00.&lt;br /&gt;Layrite is #1 on my list.</li>
            <li> I have curly, wavy hair and this product was a bit tough to get my desired style.</li>
            <li> Can be tough to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> so finding a style pomade that lasts is tough.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;ve never experienced that disaster just imagine washing your hair for 3 days without re applying and the product still in your hair ruining hats etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I tried it, I was also disappointed to find that it did not hold at ALL, much less deliver the &amp;#34;monster&amp;#34; hold promised.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to wash it out.</li>
            <li> After all it is a hairproduct.. if it&#x27;s impossible to style, what do I pay for???</li>
            <li> so I either end up with hair in my face or nasty ass dandruff looking flakes in my bouffant but not this time!</li>
            <li> Worst hair product ever.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and is basically petroleum jelly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is good ,but not bertter for Asian hard hair. i can&#x27;t all back my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> holds hair like its supposed to and smells good ( light coconut ). i have tried many different pomades and this is my favorite by far</li>
            <li> Product does not wash out completely, after a few times you find yourself with a head of gunk. Holds but not worth the hassle of trying to wash it out. Straight up candle wax in the hair and water just rolls off of it basically.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I currently have a side part pompadour and this product holds everything in place. I have extremely thick hair and this is the only product that is strong enough to maintain it. It smells great. Washing out is a little difficult, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Held well until I hit the gym then the front of my hair started to fall, it does wash out with water so this makes since.  I will purchase again as the price point is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I have curly, wavy hair and this product was a bit tough to get my desired style. But once I got it, it was awesome. it does get a little pasty and might leave some small bits of paste in your hair, but once you comb through it well enough, it should look great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the s***. I&#x27;m a girl, and I have always been hesitant to buy pastes that are marketed toward men because I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a cologney douchebag all day. The smell of this is light and neutral. It compliments my shampoo stank quite nicely and I love it for that. Also THE HOLD. Every other products I&#x27;ve tried either falls after a few hours or gets crunchy so I either end up with hair in my face or nasty ass dandruff looking flakes in my bouffant but not this time! It stays it place all day while I&#x27;m indoors and if it gets mussed up by wind all I have to do is comb it back real quick and my hair is on fleek once more. 100% will reorder when it runs out and will recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of pomades trying to find the one that fits my hair.  This one is a home run.  It&#x27;s not too thick like Murray&#x27;s so it goes in my hair easy and had a great hold.  When I pop it in and style it in the morning, I barely have to fix my hair when night time comes around.  So reliable.  It also smells great which may not mean a lot but it&#x27;s better than having it smell like s***.  The only thing I have to gripe about is the price, 18 dollars is way too much for a 2.8 oz container of pomade in my opinion.  It does last a long time though once you have it applied.  There have been times I&#x27;ve crashed after work and woken up with product still in; all that it needs is a combing and a little hairspray and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. However, not for all hair types. Didn&#x27;t hold my thick, wavy hair very long.  In that case not worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This is ok. A lot better than most. Could use some scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out new pomades each time my current one runs out, and I&#x27;d have to say this is my least favorite so far. If you&#x27;ve been using Layrite or Suavecito, I feel like Uppercut will be a huge disappointment.  I may have been spoiled since Layrite and Suavecito develop their products to be easily washed out, but Uppercut is nothing like that. It is extremely waxy and incredibly hard to wash out of your hair and even your hands after applying it. Seriously you&#x27;ll have to use a paper towel or rag to clean it off without your hands feeling gross. After multiple showers you&#x27;ll still feel it stuck in your hair.  Now all of that may have been forgivable if the monster hold actually gave you a monster hold. I usually prefer the strongest hold of any hair products because I like my hairstyle to stay firm throughout the day. Uppercut Monster Hold really just felt like any normal wax product since it didn&#x27;t keep my hairstyle up and eventually went limp.  This product also is a bit more pricey than the others I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely won&#x27;t buy this product again or recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Never tried Uppercut&#x27;s original stuff, but this Monster Hold is a petroleum based product and will do the same to your hair as Murray&#x27;s and if you&#x27;ve never experienced that disaster just imagine washing your hair for 3 days without re applying and the product still in your hair ruining hats etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most pomades on the market and would only recommend Imperial Extra Hold or Shiner&#x27;s Psycho Hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different pomades (suavacito, American crew, axe,etc) and this is by far my favorite. Great hold and easy as heck to apply. Only issue is it&#x27;s a bit hard to wash off your hands when you&#x27;re done applying.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Plain and simple. So happy with this product. I will buy it again and again. Washes out when you take a shower and makes your hair look rad all day. Thanks for the great work Uppercut!</li>
            <li> I have the craziest bushiest hair ever, not wavy, not curly, fine hair just lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well but if  I&#x27;m doing too much it will fall out of style and I will have to restyle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well with little water, don&#x27;t apply on a wet head, damp is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me better than any out there on the market, it&#x27;s just the hair that makes all the products look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried Imperial, Sauvecito, Uppercut Deluxe, Layrite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of them the Uppercut Deluxe and Monster Hold work best for my unmanageable wild hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also have 3 swirls which makes the back of the head non-cooperative.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great but seems expensive. Less shiney than Dax (red tin version)but a much stronger hold. You can kind of blend the two (monstor &amp; Dax)together in your palms to get a slightly different texture if required.</li>
            <li> A little tough to work with, but it does hold your hair really well.  Can be tough to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold for the money. I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I&#x27;ve had it. Lasted a little over a month. I ordering another tin right now</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Pomade that really holds your hair in place, then you have found the right product. Over sized tin with plenty of product for the price. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t. It felt like I was putting on Murray&#x27;s pomade. It&#x27;s not water soluble, so the more you put it on everyday, the harder it is to take it out. The Uppercut Deluxe Pomade is way better. Try to avoid this and save your money.</li>
            <li> it holds better than any, its a bit tough to get out of the hair but i do sports and it holds it without any mess</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. i was rocking a pretty high pompadore and it would last all day/night. smells good too. I have had a few products from this line and they are all good stuff. Used this in a few weddings/partys and held through sweat, jumping around and beer spilling in my hair. good stuff. this monster hold stuff is more plyable than murrays,</li>
            <li> Worst hair product ever. I have very light medium length hair, this product makes my hair super greasy immediately no matter how much i use, little or a lot. Does not hold my hair for longer than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I have used american crew pomade before this bad boy.  I still use pomade before I apply this.  This gel is thick and glue-y.  Meaning it will grab and pull if you apply on dry hair.  That s*** is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this gel holds shape.  However, under summer heat, it will not hold well as you hope, so I suggest hair spray after you do your hair (in the summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has little to no shine.  If you want shine, mix or use something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1: I have been using this predominately recently.  The texture has been melted due to general summer heat.  Which is nice, it makes applying a lot easier.  As far as holding the shape goes, it does alright.  I have pretty straight hair and do an alright comb-job but somehow, it doesn&#x27;t hold in the back like it should.  It is not a monster hold but a decent good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want a decent pomade, this is a decent way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To rid from hands, gotta wipe away not wash away.  Tho washing first helps a bit.</li>
            <li> Holds pretty good and looks great if done correctly. But the only reason for 4 stars is that this stuff DOES NOT WASH OUT OF YOUR HAIR EASILY. it washes out almost like wax. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Best hair sculpting product I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li> Ok so i got this product in the mail and i tried it on immediately and i like the scent it has, it holds your hair the way you want it and it adds just the right amount of shine, not too much and not too little. But when it got to washing it off my hands and my hair that&#x27;s when i started disliking it a bit. I tried scrubbing really hard and the product still wouldn&#x27;t come off. After i was able to get a fair amount of it off my hands i went about my day while thinking if was going to damage my hair in any way. I thought it was maybe just the hands and that it would shampoo out easily, but with shampooing and condition twice on one shower and taking two showers per day and me having not put on anymore product since. It took me around three to four days to get rid of all of the product. I really like how my hair looked when i styled it with this product but i didn&#x27;t like that since it was petroleum based it was really hard to wash off. if anybody knows a way to wash out this product please let me know so that i can use it :}</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Garnier Fructis Surf Hair. It is outstanding. The only complaint I have is that it should come with a stick to fight off the ladies with.</li>
            <li> Holds great all day with sweat and being active all day, and it smells great! I discovered it when my barber introduced me to it and I had to have it! Seriously though... It smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Im not liking this one, honestly.  I had been looking forward to it for a while, but i was immediately put off by the scent.  Kind of... industrial greasy smelling.  Hard to describe.  Then when I tried it, I was also disappointed to find that it did not hold at ALL, much less deliver the &amp;#34;monster&amp;#34; hold promised.  I am very familiar with non-water based pomades, but this was by far the greasiest and most unpleasant.  My hair got all stringy, it continued to smell bad, and my natural waves fought through and took over after a few hours.  Oh, and washing it out was a nightmare.  About the only good thing I can say about it is the can looks awesome on my shelf.  That earned it the second star.  Top marks on the package design, not so much on everything else.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Smells terrible and is basically petroleum jelly. Threw it away after the second day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.  for the price, you could get way more murphy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Greatest hold and smells good too. A little pricy, but looks great and holds up all day</li>
            <li> My previous favorite pomade was Layrite Extra Hold, but this one has just taken its spot on my counter. This stuff holds great and it&#x27;s easy to get a slick or a dry look. The only benefit that Layrite has over this is that it is a little easier to wash out, but this stuff isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little shine, makes your hair look oily. But this pomade is really good and retaining your hairstyle. After a while your hair does fall back down but only a quick adjustment will do. It is extremely difficult to wash it out. The smell is very pleasant. But a little too expensive</li>
            <li> Kind of greasy look and impossible to remove from hands and hair. Holds great though. Would love to see this hold with Matt finish.</li>
            <li> Great hold and does not end up crunchy at the end of the day. It does not take a whole lot of product to get it to do what you need it to do. Completely impressed, and would certainly order again</li>

            <li> Great pomade,very strong,I would deffinatly recommend this</li>
            <li> works great!  long lasting holds, even makes my hair smoother, and I have curly hair so a product like this is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Hold lasts all day and can be formed numerous times. I have to wear a hat several times a day with my job ( military ) so finding a style pomade that lasts is tough. Monster hold lasts all day long and is easy to style.</li>
            <li> Since a lot of fashion retailer starts to carry this brand, I decided to give a try. I received my monster hold last week. One star for hard to apply on your hair... This product is so dry, you can rub evenly through your hair, how is it possible for anyone to use? One star for the cleaning. Once you get it on you hand, you have to wash it away with very strong scrubs. Otherwise, they start to solidify on your hands like animal grease.. if zero star is an option I will go for it. Only thing is plesant is the scent... After all it is a hairproduct.. if it&#x27;s impossible to style, what do I pay for??? Buyer warning !</li>
            <li> I live by the Uppercut brand.  Monster hold gives great hold throughout the day and smells great. Previously, I used American crew hair products but found that it provided less than optimal control over my thin hair.  I recommend this product and every other Uppercut product on the market.</li>
            <li> Uppercut did it again! Loved this pomade! I will definately buy it again onec I finish this first tin. great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used many different pomades, but this one has the best hold. Of course it&#x27;s not light either. It will stay in your hair until you shampoo it out. The key is to put it your palm and rub your hands together until you heat it up and than apply it. Works very well and holds all day.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a nice pomade-type product for a while. I heard great things about this brand. And I did some extensive researching on this product, reading reviews and looking at pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely different from any of the other hair products he&#x27;s tried. But after getting used to it a little bit, he absolutely loves it. And oh my, he looks incredibly handsome. It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue in your hair after it dries. It smells nice, which is definitely an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Super super greasy. So hard to wash out. The hold was horrible also.not worth $18.00.&lt;br /&gt;Layrite is #1 on my list. Try Layrite instead.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a ridiculously long lasting hold, this is the product for you. My only issue is that it&#x27;s honestly too long lasting and nearly impossible to rinse out of your hair. There is no doubt that Uppercut makes one mean pomade and the monster hold is no different.. but it almost seemed as though it would take 2-3 showers before I could get all of the pomade out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are a skin conscious person and tend to break out easily on your forehead, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s basically like taking grease and just smearing it all over your skin.. you will not be happy with the &amp;#34;Pomade Acne&amp;#34; that may flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not suffer from acne or have acne prone skin and are looking for a STRONG hold, this is the product for you. But, if you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you mess around with this stuff as its hard to completely rinse out and will get all over your pillow cases causing your forehead to erupt with pomade pimples.</li>
            <li> Nice hold at the cost of greasy stiff vasaline texture. Soap and water alone do not get this off your hands same goes for a decent shampoo and rinse for your hair. Tough clean up for a extreme hold and volume. Should last a good while for one can.</li>
            <li> Held great all day with medium shine, like most waxy pomades it takes a little extra washes to come out.</li>
            <li> Great hold...Compared to other pomades it has the best hold in the summer heat..Its also very flexible for pomps or whatever you choose to do with your hair...It is hard to wash out..I found that for me Dawn dish detergent washes it right out cause it&#x27;s designed to break down oil and grease...Highly recommended to anyone that digs an ole school Rockabilly ponp....</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome pomade. Holds all day and in most cases even till the next day. The only down side is that it stays on your fingers and is hard to wash off. But that should in no way be a deterrent. Perfect product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He says it was the best hair product he has ever used.  I have another guy friend that uses this product as well and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> Great product, holds well and it was exactly what i was looking for. I will purchase another when i&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> The actual product and the job it does fine. Nice medium shine and great hold. If you want your hairstyle to stay put the whole day this is recommended. Truly monstrous hold. The smell is pretty nice, and you catch a whiff of it every now and then throughout your day and it&#x27;s great. The only real complaint I have is the feel  and composition of the pomade. Its sticky and hard to rub in your hands. But its not enough of a problem to out me off the product. Good pomade that does what it says and does a rather fine job at that.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look good which is not an easy task.  Plenty of strength.  Not too shiny.  A little greasy/waxy but that is to be expected.  Lasts all day even with me constantly running my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t wash off very easily so after applying I use soap and water on my hands and then dry on a towel and it rubs off my hands.  After it&#x27;s been in my hair all day it usually comes out completely by the time I shower the next morning.  Sometimes theres some residue left but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;m putting it right back into my hair anyway.</li>
