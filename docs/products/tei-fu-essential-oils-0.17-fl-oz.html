            <li>When my nasal passages get stopped up, it&#x27;s not usually due to mucous but rather because my nasal passages swell up.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for more than 20 years and believe me, it works on every problem!  The most I use it for is sinus congestion, pain and headaches.  It works for bug bites, toothaches, muscle aches, and even bad odors.  My mother had to clean out an old fridge with rotted meat in it and she just put Tei Fu oil under her nose and had no problems with the bad odors!  I am never without a bottle close at hand and am amazed at all the uses I have found for the oil.</li>
            <li> Helps many things topical</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I use for everything from a stuffy nose to acne.  Just dab a drop under your nose, and your sinuses are completely cleared up!  It is an amazingly versatile product.</li>
            <li> Was delivered promptly and was at a great price</li>
            <li> Great natural way to keep sinus pain away.  Just a little goes a long way.  Easy to carry in pocket to work.  Better than using pseudophedrine which is addictive and raises blood pressure over time.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WONDERFUL TO RUB ON THE NECK WHEN I TENSE. IT WORKS WONDERS WITH MY HEADACHES AND IT LAST A LONG TIME. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> We use this stuff as a chest rub, and especially as a gargle for sore throats.  Exceptional when gargled for cough supression from nasal drainage.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Works on tired sore muscles, and really is a big help with opening up stuffed sinus.</li>
            <li> this oil has 13 or more uses....and it is very effective in all of them..wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it for use in my autoimmune disease symptoms, etc  thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is a great  thing to open up congested nose and chest. Also good for head colds. Got to try it</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me at a chamber of commerce meeting and I knew I had to get some of it.  The difference when I use this is astounding.  When I&#x27;m at my worst and can&#x27;t breathe, it opens all the nasal passages up.  I had told many of my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s the perfect remedy for so many symptoms. I don&#x27;t travel without it!</li>
            <li> Tei Fu. So awesome. I use it when I&#x27;m congested. When my nasal passages get stopped up, it&#x27;s not usually due to mucous but rather because my nasal passages swell up. This Tei Fu stuff opens up my nasal passages up so quickly (kinda like Vicks Vapo-rub). Plus it smells good. I think it has essential oils of menthol, peppermint, cloves, lavender, cinnamon, and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on sore muscles, my temples when I have a headache, and it feels wonderful. Oh, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some. Get some now.</li>
            <li> I use this for headaches.  I like the aroma.  Let my neighbor use it and she got some for herself.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Got the sniffles? Sore, achy muscles? This product is nice for both. It isn&#x27;t any kind of cure, but its magic is in helping an ill or ill-at-ease body to relax enough to heal. I used it post-car accident and also as I was recovering from a wicked prenatal sinus infection (with antibiotics).</li>
            <li> Great Product, would be from seller again!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time because I have bad allergies...all the time. A little rub under my nose with this stuff and my sinuses clear right up. It&#x27;s REALLY helpful and a little bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years especially during the winter and during cold season.  I have also purchased this for my daughter and her family.  I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t used this in a long time so when I was having some problems went back to it and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I use this as a bronchitis treatment and it works great. I mix it with honey and lemon juice and pepper.</li>
            <li> Soooo happy to have found this... had been using it for years for congestion... local health store quit selling it... It works wonders... I will be able to breathe again!!!!</li>
            <li> probably need more...love this stuff</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Teifu Oil helps to cure colds, burns, insect bites, almost anything!</li>
            <li> Very Upset no one has contacted me about getting this product to me. I ordered it and paid for it but did not receive it.&lt;br /&gt;UPS says they left it at my door, but none of my neighbors saw it.</li>
            <li> This product works great, my wife uses it a lot and it helps heals her pains when she needs it.</li>

            <li> I use this to rub on hands and then inhale vapors. Great to open up the sinuses and lungs before singing!</li>
            <li> IT´S A VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it!  I use it for allergy sinus, headache, ears stuffed up and the lotion for sore joints or on my chest when I have a bad cold.  Great stuff.  I let friends try it and they are amazed how quickly they can breathe through their nose again.</li>
