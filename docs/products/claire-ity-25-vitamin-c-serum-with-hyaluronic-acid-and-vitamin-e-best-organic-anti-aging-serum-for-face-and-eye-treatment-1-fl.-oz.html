            <li>/&gt;Taking vitamin C through a supplement or food is beneficial to your health, but to specifically target signs of aging on your face, topical vitamin C is best.</li>

            <li>I think you enjoy the product and the price.</li>
            <li>The serum is light weight.</li>
            <li>Actually what i am telling is this medicine works great.</li>
            <li>of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity.</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be a good alternative</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>There are two unique feature sof</li>
            <li>The good news is that you can fight back by replenishing your skin’s vitamin C levels to help to combat and even reverse time’s effect on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was steadily purchasing a name-brand product for 50.00, and didn&#x27;t see near these kind of results!</li>
            <li>I love having something to apply before putting my cream makeup on as it looks better overall.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend the money some of these cost and decided to take a chance on this one.</li>
            <li>For a super powerful anti-aging punch, combine vitamins C and E together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a super powerful anti-aging punch, combine vitamins C and E together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>least at the time I purchased it, it was a very good value</li>
            <li>The scent is light, therefore; it not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting it just for the fantabulous scent of oranges.</li>
            <li>Quality ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Vitamin C is critical for your body and plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin.</li>
            <li>I wash my face and then put this on, once it is absorbed</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is always good for your face and other areas.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s looking younger and more beautiful everyday!</li>
            <li>No concerns recommending this one, with those particular unique features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My dark spots are slowly but surely fading away, and the best part, it is not breaking the bank!</li>
            <li>These two products have completely erased my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Shipping fast, a nice smooth, slightly citrus scent serum.</li>
            <li>I recently received the Claire-ity Vitamin C Serum and were pleased with it except for one thing.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid really goes to work with the vitamin C to give you a totally fresh look.</li>
            <li>Good but not easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I have seen nothing but positive changes in the evenness and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>On rare occasions, topical vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li>On rare occasions, topical vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li>very thin-almost like water-</li>
            <li>so I am very picky with my products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So fast forward to when I needed to repurchase</li>
            <li>but I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the consistency.  </li>
            <li>She mention how much it helped her</li>
            <li>this serum compared to other C serums, and one notable feature about the packaging here compared to most other C serums out there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a nice size for the price, I expected a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>It is an extremely high quality premium serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before then, I had tried so many promising lotions, washes and creams that would only dry out my face, give me acne and no results.</li>
            <li>This really allows to manage application in a controlled way, and I far prefer this consistency&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially are the outer eye area and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I wash my face at night when my pores are still open.</li>
            <li>Other factors like exposure to UV light, pollutants and cigarette smoke compound the decline of vitamin C, contributing to signs of aging.</li>
            <li>It seemed to bring balance to my combination skin, and I noticed a new glow.</li>
            <li>Makes face very very soft.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend this to anyone living in a dry climate or with over dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little watery for a serum but applies fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, and it is completely odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, when I put on it make my face soft .</li>
            <li>This product does not clog pores and is mostly natural, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I have used one bottle so far and just reordered.</li>
            <li>These are all a plus for aging skin for wrinkles, sun/dark spots, reduces fine line and wrinkles and dry skin due to hormonal loss.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles and laugh lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all your other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.</li>
            <li>This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all your other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.</li>
            <li>I received my first vitamin c serum as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift, and couldn&#x27;t believe the result on my dark spots.</li>
            <li>The glass is dark to protect the vitamin c from oxidation and the dropper is glass and allows you to get exactly what you need in a sanitary way.</li>
            <li>While young skin is full of vitamin C, aging skin naturally loses this nutrient over time.</li>
            <li>My ULTRA sensitive skin has not broken out or dried up with this routine.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free or at a reduced price and it also helped my blemishes looked a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my elbows and where I have some very dry skin and it help s to clear that up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Product, I really recomend it</li>
            <li> very thin-almost like water- I think it is basically useless. I have used vit c serum and this is nothing like i have ever seen. Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> There are two unique feature sof this serum compared to other C serums, and one notable feature about the packaging here compared to most other C serums out there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serum:&lt;br /&gt;-It has a scent that I would say is something like rose-hips or some variation of floral. It only lasts a couple moments, but was a surprise to me at first.&lt;br /&gt;-It is a bit more of a gel consistency than a watery liquid. This really allows to manage application in a controlled way, and I far prefer this consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pump, which is SO much better and easier than the eye droppers! Very pleased about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least at the time I purchased it, it was a very good value and I&#x27;ve had it function just as well as all other C serums that I&#x27;ve used. No concerns recommending this one, with those particular unique features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using C serum a year or more ago and it helped me fade away summer freckles. I am now in a daily maintenance mode now and use it daily.</li>
            <li> my mom really love it</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, does this smell good. It&#x27;s worth getting it just for the fantabulous scent of oranges. But in this case, you come for the citrus, and stay for the beauty benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it as I usually do a serum: around the eyes and on the dry patches on my cheeks. I then ended up covering my entire face with a light layer, and it was marvelous. It seemed to bring balance to my combination skin, and I noticed a new glow. After several twice-a-day uses, my skin seemed firmer as well, and I started using it on my neck as well. That was a BIG improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can pretty much treat any trouble spots you have with it, and it wasn&#x27;t at all irritating to any of my skin types. So try it already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and love of citrus are my own.</li>
            <li> I was steadily purchasing a name-brand product for 50.00, and didn&#x27;t see near these kind of results! NOT ANYMORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this nightly in my night time skin routine now and I have seen nothing but positive changes in the evenness and texture of my skin. It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin, and it is completely odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, THIS PRODUCT WORKS WONDERS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** I was sent this product for promotional purposes, and have agreed to give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This serum is a great mixture of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil and vitamin E. It is an extremely high quality premium serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum is great for aging skin like mine, I noticed that it helps in reducing fine lines. Especially are the outer eye area and laugh lines. What I have noticed as well is that the serum has brightened my skin, it just looks a litter brighter and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum in the morning before my make up routine and in the evening before I go to bed. I noticed that my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. Well good high quality premium serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review of the product. The opinions of the product are based on my experience with and use of the product.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Claire-ity Vitamin C Serum and were pleased with it except for one thing. I am not in favor of the sage scent which is not a factor because everyone has a different preference for different scents. I have a problem with scents sometimes but the the texture of the serum feels great on your skin. I have been using it prior to putting on my makeup and it literally lets it glide on. After using the serum for a couple days the texture of my skin feels wonderful. I love having something to apply before putting my cream makeup on as it looks better overall. Also, it contain hyaluronic acid ( which is recommended by dermatologist), jojoba oil and vitamin E, which is very good for the skin. These are all a plus for aging skin for wrinkles, sun/dark spots, reduces fine line and wrinkles and dry skin due to hormonal loss. I absolutely love the texture and smoothness of this Vitamin C Serum and would order again. The scent is light, therefore; it not that much of a problem. Looking for anti-aging formula it was recommended by by doctor to make sure it contained the three ingredients that is found in this product. I think you enjoy the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I have been doing the dermarolling and I needed a vitamin C serum. This serum really seems to be doing a great job. I can see the marks fading and an improvement in the texture of my skin. This doesn&#x27;t cause a burning sensation on the skin like other vitamin C serums. This serum also contains hyaluronic acid which plumps the skin and aides in the healing of the skin after a dermarolling session. I keep it in the box it came with, so as to not expose it to the sunlight. I use this serum n the night and finish off with some grapeseed oil. I have a problem skin so I am very picky with my products. This is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I like it, when I put on it make my face soft .</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Mary Kay Vitamin C serum which costs about $45.  So far this seems to be a good alternative and I plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received my first vitamin c serum as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift, and couldn&#x27;t believe the result on my dark spots. Before then, I had tried so many promising lotions, washes and creams that would only dry out my face, give me acne and no results. With this, I have had none of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast forward to when I needed to repurchase and I was overwhelmed by the selection. I quickly realized I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend the money some of these cost and decided to take a chance on this one. Well, I could not be happier with this product.  It works the same if not better than the more expensive, not sure if it&#x27;s because of the concentration but I really noticed the difference. My skin is radiant. I use it twice a day, am/pm, just after wash my fav, before applying hydralauric acid serum &amp; sunscreen moisturizer in am, and retinol serum &amp; moisturizer in pm. My ULTRA sensitive skin has not broken out or dried up with this routine. My makeup is staying on longer. My wrinkles and laugh lines are less noticeable. My dark spots are slowly but surely fading away, and the best part, it is not breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> I cannot stand the way this stuff smells. I got a deal on this and ordered 2 bottles. It is awful compared to my previous brand. I&#x27;m giving the unopened bottle away and going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> The vitamin c serum for the face worked pretty good. I have only have had it for a couple of days but it has made my face feel a little tighter. I honestly wish the smell wasn&#x27;t so strong but it does go away pretty quickly once it is applied to the face. I got this product for free or at a reduced price and it also helped my blemishes looked a little less noticeable. I think once I have more time using this product I will see more results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the consistency.  It&#x27;s too thin.  Needs to have a bit more substance.  Using it, but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Ordered for mother. She likes.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a retinol product and I feel my skin does look smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is always good for your face and other areas.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with it yet.</li>
            <li> Love the serum helps a lot on my sun spots!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! Does exactly what it says it does!!! The serum is light weight. Its odor is a light,sweet one. It is long lasting and noticeable within seconds of using it. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky film on your face afterward like other similar products. It works!</li>
            <li> My wife works hard in her office because of that she seems like little aged.After using this medicine her youth is restored and every one in her office asks me is that your daughter&#x27;s friend lol.Actually what i am telling is this medicine works great.Now she is very happy i am happy too to see my wife&#x27;s happiness.recommend to everyone who have aging problems</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my mom. So far so good. She&#x27;s looking younger and more beautiful everyday! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This serum saturates into your face and tightens your skin.  I put it on right after I wash my face at night when my pores are still open. The hyaluronic acid really goes to work with the vitamin C to give you a totally fresh look. My skin practically glows when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted to try it out and she loved it! She mention how much it helped her and it help build her self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good but not easy to use. I dont like the bottel head, I wish if it has glass dropper. The product itself is fine and good until now.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! Please put it back on Amazon! My skin has become the softest it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months morning and night. This product does not clog pores and is mostly natural, which is a bonus. I have already ordered a similar product from another brand but I can already tell that although the Clairiety brand is cheaper, is nicer. The glass is dark to protect the vitamin c from oxidation and the dropper is glass and allows you to get exactly what you need in a sanitary way. It&#x27;s a little watery for a serum but applies fine. I also use this brand&#x27;s eye moisturiser. These two products have completely erased my fine lines.</li>
            <li> If you read these reviews closely and look at each reviewer&#x27;s profile, you will see that they are all fake. Each person has reviewed the same products and given them all 5 stars. Only look at the reviews from real people, this product&#x27;s high ranking is false.</li>
            <li> Good Product and Fast Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic lies the eyes of the male.&lt;br /&gt;And also lies age.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> There is no effect for the vitamine c.</li>
            <li> Makes my face smoother and able to hold moisture. I have used one bottle so far and just reordered. I used this serum in the morning as well as a different vitamin C in the evening.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast, a nice smooth, slightly citrus scent serum. Makes face very very soft. Just what I wanted, will continue to use as have only had about 4 days so we&#x27;ll see how it does for fine lines and wrinkles but as for moisture and softness, this stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> This is why I wanted this product! Quality ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Vitamin C is critical for your body and plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin. While young skin is full of vitamin C, aging skin naturally loses this nutrient over time. Other factors like exposure to UV light, pollutants and cigarette smoke compound the decline of vitamin C, contributing to signs of aging. The good news is that you can fight back by replenishing your skin’s vitamin C levels to help to combat and even reverse time’s effect on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin’s levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age Spots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to treating age spots, you don’t need chemical peels and lasers – it turns out that vitamin C can have almost the same results! Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. While it’s not a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair UV damage like discoloration and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Anti-Aging Rx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking vitamin C through a supplement or food is beneficial to your health, but to specifically target signs of aging on your face, topical vitamin C is best. In fact, applying vitamin C to the skin can be 20 times more effective than taking it orally. Topical vitamin C is sold in a wide range of products from serum to lotions. Look for products that contain between 3% and 10% of vitamin C and include the active ingredient ascorbic acid or L-ascorbic acid. Pay extra attention to the packaging – all antioxidants, including vitamin C, are vulnerable to deterioration in the presence of air and light. Unless the product is in an airtight and opaque package, don’t buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply topical vitamin C once a day, ideally after you’ve exfoliated in the morning to utilize vitamin C’s sun-protecting properties. On rare occasions, topical vitamin C can cause some mild dryness or flaking. Counteract this side effect with a moisturizer. This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all your other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants. For a super powerful anti-aging punch, combine vitamins C and E together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of time from when you start using vitamin C until you see results varies with each person. While some people see changes as soon as 2-4 weeks, it may take others 6-8 weeks to see a difference. After around 6 months, you’ll reach the maximum benefits.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I am given products at a discount or free for my honest review.n in the presence of air and light.

            <li> The serum arrived in a nice little box, perfect for gift giving. It is a nice size for the price, I expected a smaller bottle. The serum comes in a bottle with a pump that is easy to use. I haven&#x27;t been using the serum for long and see a difference in the softness of my hands where I applied the product. I expected the serum to be greasy like other products that I have tried in the past. However, the serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed and not grease like or oily at all.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this serum!! I gave it a few weeks before writing this review and I would like to say that after a week the difference in my skin was unbelievable.  I do suggest you have minimal sun exposure or wear a hat and sunscreen.  But this product is worth it!! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see the results that were advertised.  Age spots have not lightened</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It is in an oil form and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I wash my face and then put this on, once it is absorbed I add my moisturizer. I do notice a different in my skin and have gotten compliments on my skin since I started using this. I also use this on my elbows and where I have some very dry skin and it help s to clear that up. No more itchy dry skin, it is like vitamins for dryness. I love it and would recommend this to anyone living in a dry climate or with over dry skin.</li>
