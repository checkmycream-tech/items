            <li>Love, love this organizer!</li>
            <li>I love the way it all fits so nicely and organized.</li>

            <li>It fits all my makeup, I love it</li>

            <li>Its ok you can not remove the dividers.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more space to add more things.</li>
            <li>It fit everything I wanted to store!</li>
            <li>It was better</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>LOVe</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well deserving of the 5 stars considering it came in perfect condition, no cracks, splits and packaged very well (except for the hole UPS made).</li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li>You can put stuff on top too, I put my brush bag</li>
            <li>No sticky drawers and it shipped safely.</li>
            <li>It should be made so much better for the price point.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>In the skinny drawer on the top of each I have mascaras, eye pencils and makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I Love the organizer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love.</li>
            <li>I love how it takes my spread of makeup and put it into one easy-to-find place.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size and looks so pretty .</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I just wish the drawers slid in and out more easily.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I wanted to buy another</li>
            <li>My dividers do come out so that was cool!</li>
            <li>Love this organizer, makes everything look clean and sleek</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>I love the case looks very nice and is really big will hold a majority or my makeup!</li>
            <li>and it is fine</li>
            <li>Nilecorp replied to my request for return immediately, both by email and phone, and asked if they could just ship a replacement drawer, which was fine with me.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick!</li>
            <li>I fit all of my cosmetics in here.</li>
            <li>Great buy compared to some others for double or triple the price!</li>
            <li>I could never justify dropping $200 plus for a beauty box, this is a great low cost alternative.</li>
            <li>I received this makeup organizer a few weeks ago and I must say it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>Such a great investment for a growing makeup collection.</li>
            <li>I think that people that buy the cheaper version pay what they get for I am not disappointed on the price.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to purchase the original beauty box</li>
            <li>so if I ever want to complicate my life I can put one of my old organizers on top and have more things</li>
            <li>The other two are great.</li>
            <li>but other than that is great</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The item arrives super fast and all of my make up fit in it.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;m dust free (one of the greatest advantages of these) why would I ever want to go back to that mess?</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this case for anyone in the market for a nice quality, affordable acrylic organizer.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Came packaged really well nice and clean look to my makeup holds enough.</li>
            <li>very nice and  hold quite a few items.</li>
            <li>There are no gaudy crystal door knob handles...just a flat, clean front....which I love.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated how carefully it was packaged and how amazing the quality is for such a good price.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is clear and there are no apparent scratches which is amazing because they&#x27;re so easily scratched if handled improperly.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday makeup but cannot hold large makeup palette.</li>
            <li>It is such a pretty organizer, I might get another one!  :)</li>
            <li>The top drawer is totally stuck and unusable.</li>
            <li>So much room!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I finally invested in this one.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup organizer however the only thing I would have changed is the opening and closing feature.</li>
            <li>I use this one for my more seldom-used stuff but still, I should have sent it back and had the company replace it</li>
            <li>There are 4 drawers, increasing in depth from top to bottom, and all three of the larger drawers include a non-removable divider.</li>
            <li>But, what sold me most on this case (besides the price) was the overall sleek look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked at several similar acrylic makeup cases of comparable sizing, probably the most popular being the Original Beauty Box, and their starting prices are well over $100.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re flat on top</li>
            <li>It makes me makeup look soooo pretty in my bathroom and its high quality.</li>
            <li>It was delivered earlier than promised and was packaged very efficiently and securely.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li>Delivered early!!!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I like the compartments and use it for all of my makeup and nail polish items. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon THIS one through the masses of other cases.</li>
            <li>This $50 NileCorp makeup case matches the BB sizing almost exactly and is more than half the price!</li>
            <li>Just like the more expensive beauty boxes but for a much better price.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend that if anyone has that problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It just takes a little creativity with fitting everything within the limits of each side.</li>
            <li>small complaint: two of my boxes are perfect.</li>
            <li>Wow! if you&#x27;re a make up</li>
            <li>Not sure why some of theses acrylic organizers go for more than $100</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to spend upwards of 100 dollars for another name brand box, when this exactly the same.</li>
            <li>First, the drawers do not smoothly open and close.</li>
            <li>Lastly, they put masking tape all down the front of it and there is no way I would&#x27;ve been able to get all that residue off.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sturdy enough for bottles, I can&#x27;t really do that because my cats enjoy knocking all of things down (jerks).</li>
            <li>The acrylic is crystal clear and the drawers slide in and out with ease.</li>
            <li>but I am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very affordable compared to similar storage units.</li>
            <li>this box is almost dead on size of the original beauty box which sells for $119</li>
            <li>The other one has drawers that don&#x27;t slide easily in and out and constantly have to be put back on track.</li>
            <li>I was going to give it 4 stars because I had a bit of trouble with the top drawer, but I couldn&#x27;t bare to give it nothing less than 5 stars.</li>

            <li> The top drawer is totally stuck and unusable.</li>
            <li> So much room!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I finally invested in this one.</li>
            <li> I love the makeup organizer however the only thing I would have changed is the opening and closing feature.</li>
            <li> I use this one for my more seldom-used stuff but still, I should have sent it back and had the company replace it</li>
            <li> There are 4 drawers, increasing in depth from top to bottom, and all three of the larger drawers include a non-removable divider.</li>
            <li> But, what sold me most on this case (besides the price) was the overall sleek look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at several similar acrylic makeup cases of comparable sizing, probably the most popular being the Original Beauty Box, and their starting prices are well over $100.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re flat on top</li>
            <li> It makes me makeup look soooo pretty in my bathroom and its high quality.</li>
            <li> It was delivered earlier than promised and was packaged very efficiently and securely.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> Delivered early!!!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the compartments and use it for all of my makeup and nail polish items. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon THIS one through the masses of other cases.</li>
            <li> This $50 NileCorp makeup case matches the BB sizing almost exactly and is more than half the price!</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive beauty boxes but for a much better price.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend that if anyone has that problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It just takes a little creativity with fitting everything within the limits of each side.</li>
            <li> small complaint: two of my boxes are perfect.</li>
            <li> Wow! if you&#x27;re a make up</li>
            <li> Not sure why some of theses acrylic organizers go for more than $100</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to spend upwards of 100 dollars for another name brand box, when this exactly the same.</li>
            <li> First, the drawers do not smoothly open and close.</li>
            <li> Lastly, they put masking tape all down the front of it and there is no way I would&#x27;ve been able to get all that residue off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sturdy enough for bottles, I can&#x27;t really do that because my cats enjoy knocking all of things down (jerks).</li>
            <li> The acrylic is crystal clear and the drawers slide in and out with ease.</li>
            <li> but I am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very affordable compared to similar storage units.</li>
            <li> this box is almost dead on size of the original beauty box which sells for $119</li>
            <li> The other one has drawers that don&#x27;t slide easily in and out and constantly have to be put back on track.</li>
            <li> I was going to give it 4 stars because I had a bit of trouble with the top drawer, but I couldn&#x27;t bare to give it nothing less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My thought was that if I needed an additional smaller case in the future for my growing makeup collection, the front handless design mimics the look of Muji drawers, which are considerably smaller and slightly cheaper.    </li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes off the track a lot especially if you over pack the drawers that&#x27;s a pain but other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been telling everyone and I have even compared it to some of my other purchases and my Muji&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the handling it had some scratches but other</li>
            <li> Not really Worth the money</li>
            <li> I put cotton balls in half a drawer, makeup remover pads, nail polishes laying down in two drawers.</li>
            <li> Having no handles on the sliding doors makes it a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> They are tricky to pull out because there arent handles and the openings are small to stick your finger into.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the masking tape they put on it to hold the drawers in place was so so hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that one of the drawers seams to get a bit stuck and the dividers are not removable :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, the seller put tape over the drawers (presumably to keep them from sliding out during delivery) and this left ugly residue on the acrylic.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one of the drawers broken.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> No more leaving stuff out or shoving them into ugly baskets.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I should just deal with, but this will be very annoying day to day, so sadly it is going back.</li>
            <li> but the craftmanship of the product is mediocre</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It took me hours and there is still that nasty residue</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way it looks. However, the drawers do not slide in and out with ease and have to be wiggled. The top drawer is totally stuck and unusable. I keep thinking I should just deal with, but this will be very annoying day to day, so sadly it is going back. I had high hopes based on the good reviews but I am completely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the seller put tape over the drawers (presumably to keep them from sliding out during delivery) and this left ugly residue on the acrylic.</li>
            <li> So much room! I fit all of my cosmetics in here.</li>
            <li> Delivered early!!!  and it was perfect I almost paid 150 for the orginal beauty box but so glad I didn&#x27;t , great qualityüëçüèº</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size. It fits all my makeup, I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and the dividers are removable. It&#x27;s the perfect beauty box. The only complaint I have is the handling it had some scratches but other than that it&#x27;s perfect. Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Great for my makeup items. I don&#x27;t have a ton of things so it fits perfectly. The 4 drawers are nice.</li>
            <li> This is even bigger than I thought, for the price this is incredible! I am so happy with it!</li>
            <li> Wow! if you&#x27;re a make up/skin care junkie you need this in your life!!</li>
            <li> 2 words for this item&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Perfect size&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Its ok you can not remove the dividers. The drawers do not stand on there own. Came packaged really well nice and clean look to my makeup holds enough. Wish it was more space to add more things. Should be 25 dollars instead of 35</li>
            <li> very nice and  hold quite a few items.</li>
            <li> This box was perfectly packaged and perfect size. I loved it so much I wanted to buy another but they sold out. Totally worth the cost. It fit everything I wanted to store!</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> It was better then I thought it would be. I think that people that buy the cheaper version pay what they get for I am not disappointed on the price. Will be purchasing another soon to finish organizing my makeup.</li>
            <li> LOVE  LOVE  LOVe this came quickly and in excellent condition  i am very happy with this make up holder it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> i just got mine yesterday and i can say that the drawers do get stuck.  to remedy that problem i apply baby oil or olive oil to the edges of the drawers and it is fine buuuuuuut i shouldnt have to do that lol  it holds alot of things.  im housing my makeup in it currently but i can others putting nail polish, toiletries, etc. in it. overall, id repurchase because of the price, its way below what others are asking for SIMILAR products not the same that are on the market.  but the craftmanship of the product is mediocre</li>
            <li> Great acrylic box! A great size and holds a ton of makeup. So in love with it!!</li>
            <li> I was going to give it 4 stars because I had a bit of trouble with the top drawer, but I couldn&#x27;t bare to give it nothing less than 5 stars. It&#x27;s very well deserving of the 5 stars considering it came in perfect condition, no cracks, splits and packaged very well (except for the hole UPS made). The acrylic is clear and there are no apparent scratches which is amazing because they&#x27;re so easily scratched if handled improperly. The drawers are roomy, from the smallest to the largest, and I&#x27;m truly happy about my purchase. I&#x27;ve been telling everyone and I have even compared it to some of my other purchases and my Muji&#x27;s. The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> Not really Worth the money</li>
            <li> Perfect makeup organizer! Just what I wanted a good size at a great price!! If you are on the fence go ahead and buy it you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I love love love this. I gave it 4 stars as opposed to the 5 i want to give only because of the drawers. They are tricky to pull out because there arent handles and the openings are small to stick your finger into. I love the way it all fits so nicely and organized. The bottom drawer is not wanting to cooperate opening and closing but i think it will work itself out with use. Great buy compared to some others for double or triple the price!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great quality and great price.  Not sure why some of theses acrylic organizers go for more than $100 but I&#x27;m glad I found this one.  Came in perfect condition and very well packaged.  It is such a pretty organizer, I might get another one!  :)</li>
            <li> I love this! I could never justify dropping $200 plus for a beauty box, this is a great low cost alternative. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room (see photos) and fits all of my makeup. You can put stuff on top too, I put my brush bag but it&#x27;s sturdy enough for bottles, I can&#x27;t really do that because my cats enjoy knocking all of things down (jerks). The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the drawers were taped with masking tape and left some residue on it, but I cleaned it off with GooGone.</li>
            <li> Great shipping... I love the case looks very nice and is really big will hold a majority or my makeup!</li>
            <li> I was originally going to purchase the original beauty box but when I found this I had to grab it, it works great and keeps all my makeup organized!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this. It took my forever to wade through all the acrylic container options but I&#x27;m so glad I finally invested in this one. It makes me makeup look soooo pretty in my bathroom and its high quality. No sticky drawers and it shipped safely.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with this one. It should be made so much better for the price point. For some reason, smaller than I anticipated but it works okay.</li>
            <li> I love the makeup organizer however the only thing I would have changed is the opening and closing feature. Having no handles on the sliding doors makes it a little difficult to open. I kinda don&#x27;t like the feeling of sticking my finger through the hole on the doors in order to slide it open. Other than that, I like the compartments and use it for all of my makeup and nail polish items. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for an acrylic makeup organizer forever. I had some considerations: the depth of my counter, a medicine cabinet door that swings out limiting the height, and yet wanting it to hold a lot. I ended up ordering three of these (yes, I have A LOT of stuff to organize!) I love these! I don&#x27;t just put makeup in them. I put cotton balls in half a drawer, makeup remover pads, nail polishes laying down in two drawers. In the skinny drawer on the top of each I have mascaras, eye pencils and makeup brushes. They are wonderful. Also, they&#x27;re flat on top so if I ever want to complicate my life I can put one of my old organizers on top and have more things but now that I&#x27;m dust free (one of the greatest advantages of these) why would I ever want to go back to that mess? Also, for bigger items, like oversized eyeshadow kits, I removed the bottom drawer on one of the units and stacked everything horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small complaint: two of my boxes are perfect. The other one has drawers that don&#x27;t slide easily in and out and constantly have to be put back on track. I use this one for my more seldom-used stuff but still, I should have sent it back and had the company replace it and I would highly recommend that if anyone has that problem. The other two are great.</li>
            <li> Love, love this organizer! Fits all my makeup. Super fast shipping!! Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected and I love it!! My only complaint is that it comes off the track a lot especially if you over pack the drawers that&#x27;s a pain but other than that it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!!!!!</li>
            <li> So before buying this I did my reasearch and it turns out this box is almost dead on size of the original beauty box which sells for $119&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size and looks so pretty . Only down fall is that one of the drawers seams to get a bit stuck and the dividers are not removable :( but other than that is great</li>
            <li> Received this today! Absolutely love it! Will be purchasing another soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and fast shipping. Just like the more expensive beauty boxes but for a much better price.</li>
            <li> Very nice. fits a lot, pretty good quality and good price. Shipped quick! just wish the drawer divider was removable</li>
            <li> I have two of these and I absolutely love them! They are very affordable compared to similar storage units. I may have to order a third!</li>
            <li> I Love the organizer. Keeps everything tidy and its easy to find everything.</li>
            <li> The item arrives super fast and all of my make up fit in it. The only thing is that the  sides of the 2nd and 3rd drawers keep on falling.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! I saw one for $180 and I knew there had to be one cheaper and great quality and I just got mine today, filled it up and was so in shock of how amazing it was! My dividers do come out so that was cool! I love it! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> What can I say about this Organizer... I absolutely love this. I use this for my bathroom essentials. All of my face products I use this for. But you can use it for anything.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. I just wish the drawers slid in and out more easily.</li>
            <li> I received this makeup organizer a few weeks ago and I must say it&#x27;s absolutely perfect. I&#x27;m so in love. All my makeup fits easily and the quality of the arylic is great! Such a great investment for a growing makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Let me be the first to say, this organizer is perfect. Although it was smaller than I&#x27;d anticipated (to no fault but my own), it was perfect for storing my makeup. I&#x27;ve looked at several similar acrylic makeup cases of comparable sizing, probably the most popular being the Original Beauty Box, and their starting prices are well over $100. This $50 NileCorp makeup case matches the BB sizing almost exactly and is more than half the price! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a steal, wouldn&#x27;t you?    The quality is great. It was delivered earlier than promised and was packaged very efficiently and securely. The acrylic is crystal clear and the drawers slide in and out with ease. There are 4 drawers, increasing in depth from top to bottom, and all three of the larger drawers include a non-removable divider. I had hoped they would be removable, but they aren&#x27;t. No biggie, though. It just takes a little creativity with fitting everything within the limits of each side. But, what sold me most on this case (besides the price) was the overall sleek look. There are no gaudy crystal door knob handles...just a flat, clean front....which I love. My thought was that if I needed an additional smaller case in the future for my growing makeup collection, the front handless design mimics the look of Muji drawers, which are considerably smaller and slightly cheaper.    I&#x27;d definitely recommend this case for anyone in the market for a nice quality, affordable acrylic organizer. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my mock vanity and I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon THIS one through the masses of other cases. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the masking tape they put on it to hold the drawers in place was so so hard to get off. It took me hours and there is still that nasty residue and it just kind of ruined the product for me. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This box does the trick to store my products in an attractive way! No more leaving stuff out or shoving them into ugly baskets. I love how it takes my spread of makeup and put it into one easy-to-find place. The price is unbeatable. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend upwards of 100 dollars for another name brand box, when this exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews- but I just had to. I love this!!! It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought and it holds a lot of makeup. I really appreciated how carefully it was packaged and how amazing the quality is for such a good price. I was so hesitant to purchase this but I&#x27;m glad I did, very happy with my purchase !</li>
            <li> Loved the look of the product. However, I will definitely be returning this item. First, the drawers do not smoothly open and close. One of them would not come out at all.  It was a chip as well. Lastly, they put masking tape all down the front of it and there is no way I would&#x27;ve been able to get all that residue off.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one of the drawers broken. Nilecorp replied to my request for return immediately, both by email and phone, and asked if they could just ship a replacement drawer, which was fine with me. Great customer service. Well worth the wait. Love this organizer, makes everything look clean and sleek</li>
            <li> Great for everyday makeup but cannot hold large makeup palette. The last drawer can hold the lipstick up. Originalbeautybox have this for $119 and $60 I rather buy this for $60</li>
