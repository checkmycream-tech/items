            <li>Not so good!</li>

            <li>Super curly girl here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great hydrating product, it has left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared with similar products that are not as good.  </li>
            <li>But its worth working with straight hair styles if my hair can be blond and feel this clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it lathers into a creamy less sudsy consistency although it is thinner than I remember</li>
            <li>I will only use sulfate-free shampoos, and the quality of this product is top notch.  </li>
            <li>My first impressions?</li>
            <li>The moisture balance is exactly what my hair needs.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of it online and through this seller.  </li>
            <li>The first order I placed never arrived and I had to</li>
            <li>Unlike with most shampoos, I don&#x27;t even need conditioner after using Pravana (I still sometimes use conditioner because I like the ultra soft feeling) because when your hair has the proper pH, it feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is super gentle on relaxed/transitioning hair as well as natural hair.</li>
            <li>and it is suppose to be gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much body after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to lather a whole lot - sulfate-free shampoos should NOT lather (the sulfates are what creates the lather) -</li>
            <li>leaves my jair clean but not overly dry.</li>
            <li>you will never want another shampoo conditioner again, i have their blonde brightening purple shampoo as well and the hydrating shampoo really delivers!</li>
            <li>other thing I love about Pravana shampoos is that they restore your hair to its proper</li>
            <li>My hairdresser introduced me to this product about a year ago when the previous brand I was using was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>On the opposite end I also find my hair doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl with using this.  </li>
            <li>The transaction with the seller was seamless.</li>
            <li>Ninety-nine percent of the time, though, a second wash is completely unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping packaging was kind of lame</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using it my scalp is no long irritated.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo was watered down when I opened it. I know because I have bought it before. I don&#x27;t know how to avoid that from happening again, major disappointment.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product about a year ago when the previous brand I was using was no longer available.  I have been very happy with this product and I was so pleased to find that it was available on Amazon!  I will only use sulfate-free shampoos, and the quality of this product is top notch.  I would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it is sulfate free and it is suppose to be gentle on the scalp.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it my scalp is no long irritated.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  It&#x27;s also a great hydrating product, it has left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve bought it before and still love it and would recommend it to anyone who wants sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> love love.oove this shampoo. leaves my jair clean but not overly dry. best results come when you use the conditioner as well. doesnt strip thr keratin treatment that i.habe in my hair off.</li>
            <li> My first impressions? Not so good! This shampoo has a very thin, almost watery consistency. Nonetheless, the shampoo has a very pleasant scent. It is super gentle on relaxed/transitioning hair as well as natural hair. This cleanses my scalp and nourishes my curly/coily hair in one rinse. Even when my hair is loaded with product and I have to do a second wash, my hair never feels dry or stripped. Ninety-nine percent of the time, though, a second wash is completely unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go here for my full review: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/pravana-sulfate-free-hydrating-shampoo/</li>
            <li> I have long searched for a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended this and I am hooked!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has restored the luster back to my hair.</li>
            <li> The moisture content of the shampoo leaves my hair with an oily heavy feel . I love loreal sulfate free hair thinking shampoo and the matching conditioner they have a wonderful juniper and rosemary scent.</li>
            <li> Living in NM, we have hard water which is hard on hair and skin. Enter Pravana. I  have color-treated hair and this one is perfect for it, being sulfate-free. No fading of color, fragrance not too heavy, and the price for 32oz makes my day.</li>
            <li> i looooooove these hair products, i swear once you try pravana you will never want another shampoo conditioner again, i have their blonde brightening purple shampoo as well and the hydrating shampoo really delivers!</li>
            <li> Super curly girl here. This has been my shampoo for years now. The moisture balance is exactly what my hair needs. I&#x27;m enviro minded to begin with so the sulfate free just added to the good.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo for bleached/color treated hair.  My hair never feels greasy, heavy or matted with this shampoo.  On the opposite end I also find my hair doesn&#x27;t hold much of a curl with using this.  But its worth working with straight hair styles if my hair can be blond and feel this clean.  This is my first purchase of it online and through this seller.  The shipping packaging was kind of lame but my bottle still arrived with no leaks so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect but it works fine. The price is reasonable compared with similar products that are not as good.  A note of caution; this products do not have the same effects on everybody hair.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This is the third time buying this shampoo years later and it is still my favorite. The smell is pleasant and it lathers into a creamy less sudsy consistency although it is thinner than I remember so I have to use twice as much. I read online that its consistency varies depending on the batch. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of color and oils that keep my hair from being frizzy, it feels soft and less tangled after a shower even without conditioner plus it doesn&#x27;t leave buildup. I recommend it to those looking for a sulfate free shampoo. 4 stars because the consistency varies every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also arrived on time. The transaction with the seller was seamless.</li>
            <li> This shampoo had been recommended to me so I was looking forward to trying it, however I have to give 1 star because zero stars is not an option.  The first order I placed never arrived and I had to so some digging to find out the shipment had been damaged and sent back.  I was never notified.  The second order arrived only to have the wrong product sent.  Conditioner was sent instead of shampoo.  Several days after my third order should have arrived, I received a notice that Amazon had cancelled my order.  So I never got a chance to try the product.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much body after using this shampoo.  Recommend this brand to anyone who uses color.  Truly the best Sulfate-Free Shampoo for price.</li>
            <li> I love Pravana products. This sulfate-free shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Don&#x27;t expect it to lather a whole lot - sulfate-free shampoos should NOT lather (the sulfates are what creates the lather) - but it does get your hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love about Pravana shampoos is that they restore your hair to its proper pH. Unlike with most shampoos, I don&#x27;t even need conditioner after using Pravana (I still sometimes use conditioner because I like the ultra soft feeling) because when your hair has the proper pH, it feel soft and healthy.</li>
