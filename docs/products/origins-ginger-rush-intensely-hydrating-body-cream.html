            <li>, I&#x27;d recommend as a gift for ladies,  smell is not too over powering, so most women should enjoy.</li>
            <li>Light &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>It smells richly of spicy ginger, and the scent is strong, both in the pot and on me.  </li>
            <li>Creamy smooth, with the freshest scent.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and does not look greazy.  </li>
            <li>If you are familiar with Origins, you know the &amp;#34;ginger&amp;#34; is their signature scent.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m treating myself to something special.</li>

            <li>dry skin and u will love it.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Origins brand....</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOOOOVE</li>
            <li>Very light texture yet moisturizing, absorb to the skin very quickly, no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is the most wonderfully light cream and makes my dry skin say, &amp;#34;Ahhhhh.&amp;#34;  More expensive than I would like to pay, but I will continue to purchase, because it has made such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Slides right out of the jar, imitation stuck on label, smells and feels way different.</li>
            <li>The smell is very faint,  it&#x27;s not offensive nor pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It was only AFTER the holidays that an employee recognized the package, because I send mom the same gift nearly every year.  </li>

            <li> Creamy smooth, with the freshest scent.  I&#x27;m often asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing when I use this cream!  I feel like I&#x27;m treating myself to something special.</li>

            <li> This was supposed to be a gift for my mom for Christmas.  It was delivered to her assisted living home in plenty of time.  However it had only the address and NOT the name of the recipient.  So, without further info it was put In a closet.  It was only AFTER the holidays that an employee recognized the package, because I send mom the same gift nearly every year.  So although I sent it in plenty of time for the holidays, she didn&#x27;t get it until after.  Not a good way to let mom know I was thinking of her.  How do we not have this happen again?</li>
            <li> Origins Ginger &#x27;anything&#x27; is wonderful, fragrant in an unusual way and delicious on the skin. I will purchase it always.</li>
            <li> It was a gift. But my daughter loves it. Lovely scent and texture.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, wonderful body cream.  It smells richly of spicy ginger, and the scent is strong, both in the pot and on me.  The scent lasts long after I apply the cream.  The formula is thick and keeps my skin very well moisturized.  This cream is very expensive- definitely the most expensive body cream I&#x27;ve used, but I just might buy it again, because it&#x27;s *that* good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. It makes me happy when I when I apply it and it&#x27;s very soothing on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Origins brand....Beware!  Slides right out of the jar, imitation stuck on label, smells and feels way different. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My favorite always! Light &amp; smooth! I love the ginger scent..it is fresh &amp; comforting. I wish this product&lt;br /&gt;came in a pump bottle. It would be easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I love Origins Body Cream. The scent is great and the feel is even better. Not greasy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOOOOVE this body cream. I wish it were edible. I mean, it smells amazing! I cannot express just how great this scent is...but I also am a fan of the orange scented cream. ORIGINS is a quality product line!</li>
            <li> The lightest, deep moisturizing  face &amp; body cream.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderfully light cream and makes my dry skin say, &amp;#34;Ahhhhh.&amp;#34;  More expensive than I would like to pay, but I will continue to purchase, because it has made such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with Origins, you know the &amp;#34;ginger&amp;#34; is their signature scent.  Goes on well, full of moisture, great product, but doesn&#x27;t come cheap...</li>
            <li> For years I have always used body creams that were on sale.  A friend gave me Origins Ginger Souffle for a present one year and I was hooked!  Because it is whipped, it goes on so smoothly and the effect on my skin is soothing and lasts!  I have allergies and am very sensitive to smells and odors but the gentle aroma of Origins Ginger Souffle is soothing and ever so relaxing!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday gift for a friend who loved it.  Arrived on time.  Will buy again in future...good price.</li>
            <li> This product was not in correct manufacture packaging.  Looked like label had be applied to container.  This made me concerned about the contents of the container.  Would not order from this provider again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good body cream.  Very light texture yet moisturizing, absorb to the skin very quickly, no greasy feeling.  The smell is very faint,  it&#x27;s not offensive nor pleasant.  I gave it 3 stars because its price.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive for 6.7oz body cream.  I&#x27;m living in a pretty cold, dry climate.  This tube of cream only lasted me little over a month of use.</li>
            <li> I have used this Orgins Gingeer Souffle for years.  It is so smooth and does not look greazy.  Love it</li>
            <li> What can a person say? Origins is a great product, souffle whipped body cream!! so luxurious on the body and smells awesome!. Remember we all smell things differently so try it. Then do what I do. If I personally don&#x27;t like the fragrance I find a friend that does and she&#x27;s happy.</li>
