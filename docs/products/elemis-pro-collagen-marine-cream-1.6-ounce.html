            <li> did not expect this product to do what everyone was saying about it.  so far, it has been over 1 month and i have used it everyday.  it is absolutely awesome and does even more than expected.  it has even diminished an age spot that i have had for over a year and now it is hardly noticeable.  i recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I use it in the morning and at night. I had sun spots on my chest and I wipe the excess there and the spots are gone.
