            <li>I used the corner of my towel rack :) ..</li>
            <li>Fantastic holder!</li>
            <li>No way to turn it on a counter edge, where most people would be putting it</li>
            <li>Having the extension plug together with the holders if fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many plugs in my bathroom</li>
            <li>easy setup and does&#x27;t take a lot of room on my counter.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter, easy set up and holds all her hair tools.</li>
            <li>Before buying, be sure to have adequate space to attach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needs more large slots.:)</li>
            <li>The additional 3 outlets are a huge plus.</li>
            <li>great product simple .</li>
            <li>This is an excellent idea and well made, but does not fit anywhere in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to organize your blow dryer, curling irons, flat irons, ect.</li>
            <li>I have limited drawer space in my new bathroom and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>so it really helps to not only be able to store my tools in here but also be able to use more than one iron at a time.</li>
            <li>I love my new appliance holder.  </li>
            <li>It was big enough and perfect and I loved the plug ins on the handle part, BUT the lip on my bathroom cabinet didn&#x27;t stick out far enough for this to fit.</li>
            <li>I use all these tools every day and it is so amazing being able to use them and turn them off having somewhere to put them that I am not afraid will burn my house down!</li>
            <li>, I was able to see the problem and my husband fixed this by making a small \\&quot;L\\&quot; shaped piece of wood that he used to supplement the counter top lip to provide more \\&quot;space\\&quot; for the unit to be attached to.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>just clips on, plugs in and your ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S BULKY AND TAKES UP TO MUCH COUNTER SPACE.</li>
            <li>This product had the potential to be really cool</li>
            <li>Decent price.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any extra wall space in my tiny bathroom so the fact that this clamps securely onto my counter-top is a bonus.</li>
            <li>It has made my make up area a lot more workable in a small amount of space.</li>
            <li>She accidentally leaves her flat iron on from time to time and the metal holder will get hot, but so far has not caught fire.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviewers issues about the problem of clamping this onto a small counter top lip (which is exactly the space I wanted to use it in).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny spent!  </li>
            <li>It is made of a very durable material and it works just as we&#x27;ll as the most expensive brands</li>
            <li>This really goes a long way organizing the bathroom clutter of hair dryers and flat irons.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviewer who posted pictures</li>

            <li> Thanks to the other reviewer who posted pictures</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to tighten because the screw part is long and can be tricky if your cabinet space is shallow but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> Also the power comes with a 6th cord so it should be long enough to wrap around your bathroom sink if need be.  </li>
            <li> I have a hair dryer, flat iron, 2&amp;#34; barrel iron and a 1&amp;#34; barrel iron and everything</li>
            <li> Most hair appliances have a large base to plug in, not just the prongs.</li>
            <li> Thought I would mention it, since the cord is bulky and long for the area where I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Mine has come loose a few times, so I have to be careful how I hang the dryer.</li>
            <li> I recommend you get cord management wall clips that nail the power cord in place to keep it from making a mess.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy duty and</li>
            <li> ( which only needed replacing because the power plug ins had started looking dangerous after all those years of being on all day. )</li>
            <li> It is heavy gauge so it can be ugly if you leave it loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that there was no mention anywhere on the product description that this item is counter and table mount only.  </li>
            <li> Very poor design for the tightenig screw.</li>

            <li> I read the other reviewers issues about the problem of clamping this onto a small counter top lip (which is exactly the space I wanted to use it in).  Thanks to the other reviewer who posted pictures, I was able to see the problem and my husband fixed this by making a small \\&quot;L\\&quot; shaped piece of wood that he used to supplement the counter top lip to provide more \\&quot;space\\&quot; for the unit to be attached to.  I will try to post picture of this fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the electrical plug is attached with screws and can be removed.  I am thinking of removing it and using a multi-plug in the wall socket instead.  Thought I would mention it, since the cord is bulky and long for the area where I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the holder where I want it, it works great!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Fits my hair dryer, curlers and straightener in one convenient place with only one plug actually going into the wall.. I recommend this product for anyone trying to de-clutter and has some type of ledge to screw this into .. I used the corner of my towel rack :) ..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  I absolutely love it!  Plus it is off of my counter and now I have more space!  It&#x27;s worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li> I have limited drawer space in my new bathroom and this is perfect. Looks great on your counter without making it look junked up with clutter</li>
            <li> I use all these tools every day and it is so amazing being able to use them and turn them off having somewhere to put them that I am not afraid will burn my house down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that there was no mention anywhere on the product description that this item is counter and table mount only.  I thought it would screw to a wall.  I contributed images so others can see what it looks like installed.  Also the power comes with a 6th cord so it should be long enough to wrap around your bathroom sink if need be.  That&#x27;s the only plus.  I decided to keep it because it would be a pain to return it at this point.  I recommend you get cord management wall clips that nail the power cord in place to keep it from making a mess.  It is heavy gauge so it can be ugly if you leave it loose.</li>
            <li> These are really good qaulity!  Decent price.  I ordered two to replace a pair I had in the salon for twenty years. ( which only needed replacing because the power plug ins had started looking dangerous after all those years of being on all day. ) These are sturdy and can accommodate all sizes of equipment.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Love having the plug can have several items plugged in at once.&lt;br /&gt;It just clips on, plugs in and your ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Needs more large slots.:)</li>
            <li> This product had the potential to be really cool but they placed the three pronged outlets in a row instead of side by side so you can still only plug one thing in at a time. Most hair appliances have a large base to plug in, not just the prongs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic holder! Very easy to move anywhere and having power cord on the stand makes it portable for any work area.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed! The extra outlets are great for organizing cords and all of my hair tools fit perfectly in each holder. I have a hair dryer, flat iron, 2&amp;#34; barrel iron and a 1&amp;#34; barrel iron and everything fits. I didn&#x27;t have any extra wall space in my tiny bathroom so the fact that this clamps securely onto my counter-top is a bonus. Glad I chose this one!</li>
            <li> Holds your hair dryer and 4-5 brushes in the convenient cups and slots. The clamp has rubber facings that begins to slip if you hang the dryer in a way where it&#x27;s weight favors pulling away from the counter. Mine has come loose a few times, so I have to be careful how I hang the dryer.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly for hair dryer and irons</li>
            <li> Very poor design for the tightenig screw. No way to turn it on a counter edge, where most people would be putting it</li>
            <li> I like it.  holds nice.  easy setup and does&#x27;t take a lot of room on my counter.  would recomend it.</li>
            <li> Great piece of equipment but I wanted something I could screw into the side of a counter, not clip on.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to organize your blow dryer, curling irons, flat irons, ect. It has made my make up area a lot more workable in a small amount of space. It is very heavy duty and the electrical 3-prong outlets make it a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> great product simple . we have no complain from this one. It does what it is suppose to do nicely.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about this product except I couldn&#x27;t make it hang on the wall.  It required a lip on the counter.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS . BUT FOR WHAT IT HOLDS IT&#x27;S BULKY AND TAKES UP TO MUCH COUNTER SPACE. AND IF YOU TRY TO PUT IT ON A TOWEL RACK IT FALLS WHEN YOU PUT STUFF IN IT BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;I GUESS I JUST DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY PLACE TO PUT IT THAT IT WOULD BE OUT OF THE WAY</li>
            <li> I love my new appliance holder.  I am a hair stylist and it holds my tools at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the plug in on the front.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny spent!  It is made of a very durable material and it works just as we&#x27;ll as the most expensive brands</li>
            <li> Having the extension plug together with the holders if fantastic! This was a gift for my daughter, easy set up and holds all her hair tools. She loves it! Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Coolest gadget ever keeps all my hair styling tools organized. It is a bit difficult to tighten because the screw part is long and can be tricky if your cabinet space is shallow but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> This gadget is great. I don&#x27;t have many plugs in my bathroom so it really helps to not only be able to store my tools in here but also be able to use more than one iron at a time. I have it mounted to a towel bar in the bathroom and it sits up there just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/8/2013: Pictures of it clamped to towel bar posted. I actually moved my towel bar lower because I was given a heated towel rack for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says she gives it 5 stars. She accidentally leaves her flat iron on from time to time and the metal holder will get hot, but so far has not caught fire.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent idea and well made, but does not fit anywhere in my daughter&#x27;s bathroom. Before buying, be sure to have adequate space to attach.</li>
            <li> I really loved this holder. It was big enough and perfect and I loved the plug ins on the handle part, BUT the lip on my bathroom cabinet didn&#x27;t stick out far enough for this to fit. Wish there had been some way to mount it  on the wall. I gave it to a girl who works in a beauty shop. It fits her cabinet good.</li>
            <li> This really goes a long way organizing the bathroom clutter of hair dryers and flat irons. The additional 3 outlets are a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My sister said this was awesome, that she would no longer have her things laying around.  Thank you very much</li>
