    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product to reduce hair loss and detangling.</li>
            <li>Great product thank you!</li>
            <li>It smells great, tingles a bit (so avoid breathing it in) just like a tea tree or peppermint oil treatment &amp; seems to work to stimulate those follicles!</li>
            <li>I was impressed when I heard the commercials and the ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I straighten it, I notice that my hair has no split ends, no flyways, been using this stuff for months and works great!</li>
            <li>I am now a happy camper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been impressed with Garnier products.</li>
            <li>This has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Works great - great deal!</li>
            <li>great product.hard to find.</li>
            <li>Bless and have a great day</li>
            <li>this stuff is great  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>NO recommendations even though it smelled great and gave a nice tingle to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Smells good, worked for me</li>
            <li>I purchased this a couple of months ago and have loved this product.  </li>
            <li>It just wasnt very healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it smells nice..</li>
            <li>It worked great for me from the first use.  </li>
            <li>but the spray smells nice and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>You know do what it do, but to no avail I still continued to break and lost many strands..</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>give it a try I promise you to will love it...</li>
            <li>everything was okay</li>
            <li>Maybe this is more of a styling protectant spray?  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Well not any more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>On here it&#x27;s over $6 bucks which is even more then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better just to take a biotin supplement than to spray it on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, try Tresemme&#x27;s Nourishing Rituals protein renewal creme, because that&#x27;s what worked for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After about 2.5 weeks I started noticing I didn&#x27;t have any more knots in my hair,</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m really impressed with this product, and while there are lots of reasons for hair loss, Fall Fight is inexpensive enough to just give it a shot and see if it works for you</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and manageable and have not been able to find a suitable substitute since it was removed from the shelves- going to buy as many as I can online!!</li>
            <li>Its not breaking or falling out and it feels strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>Really smells good</li>
            <li>I noticed I was seeing an aweful lot of hair in my brush and may hair was breaking easily.</li>
            <li>The reason I have to knock off a star is because it is marketed to fight falling hair which I don&#x27;t feel it is overly great at, but the other benefits of this product more than make up for it!</li>
            <li>I bought this as sort of like a leave in conditioner to strengthen my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference</li>
            <li>Smells good helps make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>although I still had some normal hair shedding, it worked amazing as a leave in conditioner/detangler.</li>
            <li>A great detangler spray for my long hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff sprays on easily, smells nice, helps a little with detangling, and the cool tingly sensation feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have an otherwise healthy scalp and growing hair, but I do notice a bit much coming out in my brush and comb.</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes my hair soft ;)</li>
            <li>I would like Garnier to go back to the drawing board and make some better stuff that it says it will do!</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth it unless you just want to feel your scalp tingle for a bit each day.</li>
            <li>However, I continued to use it to get my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>That would imply your hair isn&#x27;t that healthy to begin with, SO incorporate other healthy habits into your regimen to help this product work to the fullest.</li>
            <li>but on the directions it says you should massage the scalp for about or minute or so other than works good.</li>
            <li>I put it on after I shower and my tangles brush right out.  </li>
            <li>and I saw good results on the look of my hair and also loosing less.</li>
            <li>the seller was super fast on shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the complete set with the shampoo and conditioner and truthfully I don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner do much at all.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>this is the first time ive used Fall Flight</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product but fear it&#x27;s been discontinued locally &amp; may disappear from Amazon.</li>
            <li>, I really did see a difference between running out of this product &amp; not using it!</li>
            <li>I used up my first bottle and am eager to order another.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it not break, my bald places are now filling in.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find this product agin in the stores in Dallas</li>
            <li>I gave it four starts though because it&#x27;s smaller then the shampoo and conditioner but costs more.  </li>
            <li>This will prevent the stretching because the comb never gets enough friction to grab the hair any more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it has been 2 months since I purchased the first, and my hair has gotten drastically thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to stop shedding and that is exactly what it did for me.</li>
            <li>right now I consider it a product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>That was nice but not worth the money....</li>
            <li>so cost wise it is uneconomical for me, it just didn&#x27;t last long enough, but I like the product, it did make it easier to brush and comb my hair out, as it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It smooths, conditions and detangles my knots, allowing me to avoid pulling out large chunks/strands of my hair when brushing.  </li>
            <li>It kind of tingled/burned a little</li>
            <li>soooo I gave it three stars because it didnt really help me,,,</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated which I like, and</li>
            <li>Got this one from amazon a couple of months ago and the results were not the same, I don&#x27;t know if because they don&#x27;t make it any more and its just an old batch of product, but is jut like spraying water over your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve run out of this spray and used just the shampoo and conditioner and it didn&#x27;t really do anything that my old shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly using this for detangling, and MAN does this make your hair soft!</li>
            <li>This along with Anti Breakage Shampoo are my new routine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much change, but after a couple weeks of daily use, my hair became much softer and so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a physical and visual difference the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li>I have really long (right about my butt)</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>so I have a lot of split ends and this makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>as an FYI for the purposes I described above, I have been much happier with[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it sort of made my hair soft &amp; shiny, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars &amp; continue to look for it because of how soft &amp; shiny it makes my hair, which in turn makes it easier to straighten &amp; style.  </li>
            <li>I am 69 years old</li>
            <li>hair that is naturally curly/wavy and tends to get frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Mostly because my hair is dry and I prefer thick conditioners and I feel like their products are really runny.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of success with several garnier fructis products and this one does not disappoint!!I am an African American transitioning to natural hair, and during this process my hair was shedding and tangling constantly.</li>
            <li>My hair has been breaking off because of the new growth being such a different texture.</li>

            <li> I am 69 years old</li>
            <li> hair that is naturally curly/wavy and tends to get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Mostly because my hair is dry and I prefer thick conditioners and I feel like their products are really runny.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of success with several garnier fructis products and this one does not disappoint!!I am an African American transitioning to natural hair, and during this process my hair was shedding and tangling constantly.</li>
            <li> My hair has been breaking off because of the new growth being such a different texture.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t necessarily falling out, but the commercial got me with how it says if you are trying to grow your hair long (which I am) you have to fight breakage.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 months ago and until that time my hair brush was always full of broken hair.  </li>
            <li> The product is super, but it arrived in a broken bottle.</li>
            <li> i know it is healthy, but the bottle overall is small in quantity, as I went thru this in less than a week,, but I have very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The spray on the other hand makes my hair SOOO much easier to brush and even helps to tame the frizz, reducing the need for me to use a hair straighener all the time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a slight decrease in the hair that was coming out, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews and just haven&#x27;t had the same experience.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t blow dry?  </li>
            <li> I spray it all over my hair after I wash it, and massage into my scalp, then dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I do blow dry &amp; straighten my hair every day -</li>
            <li> Before using this product, my hair tends to stretch then knot up as you comb it out when wet.  </li>
            <li> The second complaint is the size of the bottle, I use this everday</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Nutrient Spray, 4.20-Fluid Ounce]] which does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> so I larger bottle would mean less trips to the store.</li>
            <li> have had less hair fall off</li>
            <li> Less hair in my comb</li>
            <li> furthermore less shedding all around.</li>
            <li> but as we all know, heat is not good for the hair, especially all the time.  </li>
            <li> In the first week I noticed the number of hairs shed or broken when I shampooed had decreased by two thirds.</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle lasted a little longer though.</li>
            <li> I might say it does help a little with keeping hair on head and not in brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was one product or the other or the combination for me</li>
            <li> Been buying this product a few years ago</li>
            <li> Not sure if it stops breakage but the trade off is not worth it to have greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> In the past, while running the brush through my hair, I could hear strands breaking.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day, not sure it does anything</li>
            <li> I usually straighten it</li>
            <li> You probably have other bad habits that cause your hair to have problems, maybe due to medical issues, medications, poor diet, over processing, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I seen how bad the reviews were for this product.  </li>
            <li> But a month later my hair is continuing to shed like crazy</li>

            <li> This product seems to be working.  In the past, while running the brush through my hair, I could hear strands breaking.  That isn&#x27;t happening anymore.  Hooray !  Recommended to be used with the line&#x27;s Fall Fight shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference but the spray smells nice and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to reduce hair loss and detangling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly using this for detangling, and MAN does this make your hair soft! I noticed a physical and visual difference the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> great product.hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning my AA 4A type hair for 9 months.  My hair has been breaking off because of the new growth being such a different texture. I  bought this item hoping the product would anti-break,,,, You know do what it do, but to no avail I still continued to break and lost many strands.. soooo I gave it three stars because it didnt really help me,,, NO recommendations even though it smelled great and gave a nice tingle to the scalp. That was nice but not worth the money....&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and have a great day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad I can no longer get this product in stores - although I still had some normal hair shedding, it worked amazing as a leave in conditioner/detangler. It made my hair so soft and manageable and have not been able to find a suitable substitute since it was removed from the shelves- going to buy as many as I can online!!</li>
            <li> Works like a detangle spray with no greasiness. Love it! I use it after every shower. Wish the bottle lasted a little longer though.</li>
            <li> Smells good helps make my hair soft. This along with Anti Breakage Shampoo are my new routine. Really smells good</li>
            <li> Smells good, worked for me have had less hair fall off, the only downside I thought I would just have to spray it on but on the directions it says you should massage the scalp for about or minute or so other than works good.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and couldn&#x27;t find in the stores anymore. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Been buying this product a few years ago and I saw good results on the look of my hair and also loosing less. I stop buying it as they stop selling it on stores. Got this one from amazon a couple of months ago and the results were not the same, I don&#x27;t know if because they don&#x27;t make it any more and its just an old batch of product, but is jut like spraying water over your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I am buying it anymore,</li>
            <li> I use this every day, not sure it does anything but it smells nice..I might say it does help a little with keeping hair on head and not in brush.</li>
            <li> this is the first time ive used Fall Flight and I love it I dye my hair so I have a lot of split ends and this makes my hair soft and I will buy it again and try the fall flight shampoo and con. the seller was super fast on shipping. this stuff is great  give it a try I promise you to will love it...</li>
            <li> Great product thank you!</li>
            <li> The product is super, but it arrived in a broken bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product but fear it&#x27;s been discontinued locally &amp; may disappear from Amazon. After having my daughter I had a lot of hair fall from the hormone surge going away. This product saved my hair from falling out. I&#x27;m talking clumps of hair. Even though I was assured by the Dr. everything was okay, I really did see a difference between running out of this product &amp; not using it! It smells great, tingles a bit (so avoid breathing it in) just like a tea tree or peppermint oil treatment &amp; seems to work to stimulate those follicles!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t necessarily falling out, but the commercial got me with how it says if you are trying to grow your hair long (which I am) you have to fight breakage.  I bought this as sort of like a leave in conditioner to strengthen my baby fine hair.  I found that it leaves a residue that weighs down my hair and makes it feel dirty.  Not sure if it stops breakage but the trade off is not worth it to have greasy hair.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t blow dry?  Maybe this is more of a styling protectant spray?  But if I am blow drying then I will have breakage anyway, so as another reviewer said - what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI for the purposes I described above, I have been much happier with[[ASIN:B004ZWH4BC Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition Nutrient Spray, 4.20-Fluid Ounce]] which does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This product along with the conditioner saved my hair.  A must for anyone suffering from shedding.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this fought anything.&lt;br /&gt;My hair continued to shed.  I like the smell &amp; it sort of made my hair soft &amp; shiny, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I would skip this one.</li>
            <li> I have an otherwise healthy scalp and growing hair, but I do notice a bit much coming out in my brush and comb. This junk does nothing in the \\&quot;fight\\&quot; against the \\&quot;fall\\&quot; of hair. I religiously sprayed on my scalp. It kind of tingled/burned a little and I actually thought it was working. Over the weeks, my hair has continued to shed. I was impressed when I heard the commercials and the ingredients. I also tried Garnier&#x27;s serum which just made my hair feel gooey and the hair spray which made my hair feel sticky. I would like Garnier to go back to the drawing board and make some better stuff that it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from my local stop &amp; shop with hope that it would stop my hair falling. But a month later my hair is continuing to shed like crazy but yet i still continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago and have loved this product.  I used up my first bottle and am eager to order another.  My hair was getting knotted and unhealthy at the ends.  Instead of following the directions and applying and massaging into the scalp (I didn&#x27;t want my hair to look dirty/greasy), I use this product on my ends.  It smooths, conditions and detangles my knots, allowing me to avoid pulling out large chunks/strands of my hair when brushing.  It is very concentrated which I like, and right now I consider it a product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months now.  I have strait color treated hair that is thin in diameter. I noticed I was seeing an aweful lot of hair in my brush and may hair was breaking easily. It just wasnt very healthy. I started using the Pantene Age Defying Shampoo and conditioner and this product. I&#x27;m not sure if it was one product or the other or the combination for me but I notice a BIG difference in my hair. Its not breaking or falling out and it feels strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted something to save my split ends. I spray it all over my hair after I wash it, and massage into my scalp, then dry my hair. When I straighten it, I notice that my hair has no split ends, no flyways, been using this stuff for months and works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it is hard to find.  It gets some mixed reviews, so here&#x27;s my two cents.  If you have problems with breaking, shedding hair this may not be the miracle you are looking for.  You probably have other bad habits that cause your hair to have problems, maybe due to medical issues, medications, poor diet, over processing, etc.  You have to address the problem from the root cause.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t claim that it will stop all hair from falling/breaking so keep that in mind.  This has a very pleasant smell.  I didn&#x27;t notice much change, but after a couple weeks of daily use, my hair became much softer and so shiny.  I started getting compliments on how shiny it was!  I noticed a slight decrease in the hair that was coming out, but nothing major.  I do blow dry &amp; straighten my hair every day - I use heat protector spray &amp; leave in conditioner in addition to this product.  I give it 4 stars &amp; continue to look for it because of how soft &amp; shiny it makes my hair, which in turn makes it easier to straighten &amp; style.  The reason I have to knock off a star is because it is marketed to fight falling hair which I don&#x27;t feel it is overly great at, but the other benefits of this product more than make up for it!</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and I have tried all products over the years. I have been on medication to help my hair and not one thing has help. I started using this product 4 months ago and until that time my hair brush was always full of broken hair.  Well not any more. I am please to say that. Not only does it not break, my bald places are now filling in.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to find this product agin in the stores in Dallas so I starting shopping on line. I am now a happy camper!</li>
            <li> i know it is healthy, but the bottle overall is small in quantity, as I went thru this in less than a week,, but I have very long thick hair. so cost wise it is uneconomical for me, it just didn&#x27;t last long enough, but I like the product, it did make it easier to brush and comb my hair out, as it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Love this product. A great detangler spray for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I seen how bad the reviews were for this product.  I have really long (right about my butt) hair that is naturally curly/wavy and tends to get frizzy.  I usually straighten it but as we all know, heat is not good for the hair, especially all the time.  I decided to try this product because my hair gets so tangled up from being so thick and wavy and I was tired of pulling my hair out.  It worked great for me from the first use.  I bought this in the complete set with the shampoo and conditioner and truthfully I don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner do much at all.  I&#x27;ve run out of this spray and used just the shampoo and conditioner and it didn&#x27;t really do anything that my old shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t do.  The spray on the other hand makes my hair SOOO much easier to brush and even helps to tame the frizz, reducing the need for me to use a hair straighener all the time.  I put it on after I shower and my tangles brush right out.  I gave it four starts though because it&#x27;s smaller then the shampoo and conditioner but costs more.  I&#x27;d like to see a bigger bottle made.  On here it&#x27;s over $6 bucks which is even more then what I pay at walmart.  I think it&#x27;s almost 5 bucks there.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy hair, then buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been impressed with Garnier products. Mostly because my hair is dry and I prefer thick conditioners and I feel like their products are really runny. Still, when I saw this product on the shelf, I decided to give it a go. My hair started thinning dramatically a year ago so I&#x27;ve been desperate to try anything to stop the falling strands. This stuff sprays on easily, smells nice, helps a little with detangling, and the cool tingly sensation feels pretty good. But it did NOT help with falling hair. I saw zero difference, even in combination with the shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s better just to take a biotin supplement than to spray it on your scalp. Or better yet, try Tresemme&#x27;s Nourishing Rituals protein renewal creme, because that&#x27;s what worked for me. This product isn&#x27;t worth it unless you just want to feel your scalp tingle for a bit each day.</li>
            <li> Helps get the brush through my hair.  Before using this product, my hair tends to stretch then knot up as you comb it out when wet.  This will prevent the stretching because the comb never gets enough friction to grab the hair any more.  It dries without any evidence you&#x27;ve even used it, so it is NOT a styling product.</li>
            <li> Works great - great deal! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I shed like a dog it&#x27;s ridiculous! It doesn&#x27;t stop it it just reduces it. Smells good and makes my hair soft ;)</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Stops breakage.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This seems to work rather well. Less hair in my comb</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of success with several garnier fructis products and this one does not disappoint!!I am an African American transitioning to natural hair, and during this process my hair was shedding and tangling constantly. I was panicked until I heard about this product. So I went out and purchased it the same day. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, however I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after using it for a week. However, I continued to use it to get my moneys worth. After about 2.5 weeks I started noticing I didn&#x27;t have any more knots in my hair, furthermore less shedding all around. Now I am on my second bottle  it has been 2 months since I purchased the first, and my hair has gotten drastically thicker and stronger. There is no denying my hair is definetly stronger. The only 2 complaints I have about this product are that it can not work solely has a conditioner, I spray it on before I detangle and add my leave in conditioner. The second complaint is the size of the bottle, I use this everday so I larger bottle would mean less trips to the store. I will say this about those with complaints about this product, you are obviously purchasing it because you are experiencing breakage or shedding with your hair. That would imply your hair isn&#x27;t that healthy to begin with, SO incorporate other healthy habits into your regimen to help this product work to the fullest. I still baby my hair and am focused on it&#x27;s overall health. I purchased this product to stop shedding and that is exactly what it did for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews and just haven&#x27;t had the same experience. My hair was falling out and breaking off by the handfull. In the first week I noticed the number of hairs shed or broken when I shampooed had decreased by two thirds. I stopped using it for a week and the hair loss returned to its former level of breakage and shedding. I&amp;#34;m really impressed with this product, and while there are lots of reasons for hair loss, Fall Fight is inexpensive enough to just give it a shot and see if it works for you</li>
