    <ol>
            <li>Great bargain, too!</li>
            <li>Perfect for the twice a day pill taker.</li>
            <li>Worked out great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re working great for her, though.</li>
            <li>They are a great way to organize your pills or vitamins.  </li>
            <li>Good size to hold vitamins, fish oil, and RX drugs.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Nice size for each day of pills, seems like a great value.</li>
            <li>That the tops come off is also handy for washing them if needed.</li>
            <li>These are great as you can take off the lid in one piece to make them quick to load.</li>
            <li>Nice light weight, which will be good for travel.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Suitable for its purpose</li>
            <li>Love these pill organizers, that&#x27;s why I bought 6 of them.</li>
            <li>I redid them with Magic Marker</li>
            <li>Order the bulk of six, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Love that I can remove the doors for easy filling :)  </li>
            <li>Plus whoever filled my order for the six containers, sent them in a variety of colors - I like that.</li>
            <li>They work great for people who have two different times for taking pills, one for AM and one for PM.</li>
            <li>The original one I got for my hubby two years ago still functions well</li>
            <li>Quick ship</li>
            <li>Just received these, with a quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a nice pill box and is large enough to hold many pills in each section.</li>
            <li>Whole row of lids pops out making it so easy to load.</li>
            <li>VERY easy for my mom to open....</li>
            <li>Big enough spaces for several pills - easy to use - caps to each pocket close securely, but easy to open - Perfect for AM &amp; PM pill takers - easy to track whether you have taken them or not -  BIG AM and PM letters -</li>
            <li>When I filled these new ones it was the easiest ever.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable, and shipping was fast and accurate..</li>
            <li>With such a great price not high quality - but work great - and not too big - nice and deep to hold lots of pills - even big vitamin pills.</li>
            <li>love the fact all the same color represents p.m. meds..</li>
            <li>The lids are removeable for easy cleaning and the letters are big for people with sight impairment.</li>
            <li>but it wears off fairly fast</li>
            <li>My whole family uses these.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Lids remove completely as one piece and quickly snap back when you are done filling.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted for my older sister, I had purchased them earlier for my mom..</li>
            <li>so I just bought him new ones.</li>
            <li>but a little too easy for me....  </li>
            <li>Large enough to handle a lot.</li>
            <li>Much simpler to load than the ones who come totally out of the container.</li>
            <li>My old ones are old an worn out.  </li>

            <li> My old ones are old an worn out.  </li>
            <li> so I could pre-fill them for a month long trip without taking all the bottles along.</li>
            <li> guess the definition of assorted colors means on side is blue and the other purple (as shown)</li>
            <li> The two rows (each differently colored row is one piece) of colored lids can be removed for washing or can be swapped with other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems filling other pill organizers with those small compartments, dropping an extra pill or two then having to dump out the entire batch to get it out.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Stays closed.  </li>
            <li> so you might go with this size for vitamins and a small size for regular medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other pill organizers for 20+ years dreading when they need to be refilled.</li>
            <li> Fellow traveler told me about small plastic bags which i will use on future trips.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of room in each curved compartment making filling less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> The compartments are not air tight or waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I returned this item, as it arrived with one broken lid on two of the six boxes.</li>

            <li> Good size to hold vitamins, fish oil, and RX drugs.</li>
            <li> Love that I can remove the doors for easy filling :)  Great bargain, too!</li>
            <li> Large enough to handle a lot. Quick ship</li>
            <li> With such a great price not high quality - but work great - and not too big - nice and deep to hold lots of pills - even big vitamin pills.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Needed to replace husbands boxes because I fill five weeks of meds for him at a time.</li>
            <li> Big enough spaces for several pills - easy to use - caps to each pocket close securely, but easy to open - Perfect for AM &amp; PM pill takers - easy to track whether you have taken them or not -  BIG AM and PM letters - Plus whoever filled my order for the six containers, sent them in a variety of colors - I like that.</li>
            <li> Love these pill organizers, that&#x27;s why I bought 6 of them. They work great for people who have two different times for taking pills, one for AM and one for PM. Very easy to use. Lids just flip up, you can do one side at a time or lift both sides at once. The original one I got for my hubby two years ago still functions well but the days of the week wear off. I redid them with Magic Marker but it wears off fairly fast so I just bought him new ones. Much simpler to load than the ones who come totally out of the container.</li>
            <li> I ordered two six packs of these. Good price. I like that the tops pull off of the containers so that you can fill without having the tops in the way of your fingers. That the tops come off is also handy for washing them if needed. My husband and I both use these for our twice a day meds. I needed a bunch so I could pre-fill them for a month long trip without taking all the bottles along. Worked out great.</li>
            <li> These are great as you can take off the lid in one piece to make them quick to load. The compartments are really big so you might go with this size for vitamins and a small size for regular medication.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the twice a day pill taker.</li>
            <li> I like using the pilll organizer.  I fill three and don&#x27;t have to refill for three weeks.  I can remember to take my pills because I can look and see if I have taken them or not, which was a problem before.</li>
            <li> VERY easy for my mom to open.... but a little too easy for me....  They&#x27;re working great for her, though.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for years.  My old ones are old an worn out.  They are a great way to organize your pills or vitamins.  My whole family uses these.</li>
            <li> Suitable for its purpose</li>
            <li> I returned this item, as it arrived with one broken lid on two of the six boxes.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of room in each curved compartment making filling less of a hassle. Lids remove completely as one piece and quickly snap back when you are done filling. I&#x27;ve always had problems filling other pill organizers with those small compartments, dropping an extra pill or two then having to dump out the entire batch to get it out. I&#x27;ve been using other pill organizers for 20+ years dreading when they need to be refilled. Not anymore! When I filled these new ones it was the easiest ever. Order the bulk of six, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;6 assorted colors&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;All 6 were the same color(s).&lt;br /&gt;I guess the definition of assorted colors means on side is blue and the other purple (as shown)</li>
            <li> Whole row of lids pops out making it so easy to load. Stays closed.  I bought 6, so I can load them up and I&#x27;m done for 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted for my older sister, I had purchased them earlier for my mom.. love the fact all the same color represents p.m. meds.. so when the lettering comes of, they will know where the meds go..the price is reasonable, and shipping was fast and accurate..thanks</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  The compartments are not air tight or waterproof.  The two rows (each differently colored row is one piece) of colored lids can be removed for washing or can be swapped with other colors.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time at home, but for extended vacation they were a bit bulky.  Fellow traveler told me about small plastic bags which i will use on future trips.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pill box and is large enough to hold many pills in each section. I bought this as it has an AM and PM side and I had a pet that was on twice daily medication for awhile. I kept forgetting what I was giving him so this is why I purchased this. The lids are removeable for easy cleaning and the letters are big for people with sight impairment.</li>
            <li> Just received these, with a quick delivery. Nice size for each day of pills, seems like a great value. Nice light weight, which will be good for travel.</li>
            <li> 3 of the boxes were damages and cracked even though they were individually wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;I wound up returning all of them.</li>
