            <li> I LOVE this body spray. I&#x27;ve worn it for years. It used to be called \\&quot;Sensual.\\&quot; I was heartbroken when all the chain stores in  my area stopped carrying the Healing Garden brands, which makes no sense since they are fabulous products. This fragrance is one of my absolute favorites. It is not too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t attract bees like some florals do. PLUS my 1 yr old nephew loves it and snuggles up to me whenever I wear it. BONUS!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body spray for atleast 10 years.  I keep having to track it down to buy it but I am NOT paying $17 for 1 bottle!</li>
            <li> The item was a great price and arrived fast! I am no longer able to get my favorite body spray locally, buying it from amazon will be my first choice for many items!</li>
            <li> I love the  Healing  Garden body mists , especially  the Jasmine.  The stores didn&#x27;t have it anymore, and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve always get complimenthe on it.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. I had purchased from Healing Garden some years ago, but unfortunately I think the quality of their products had deteriorated. I even tried a different scent in case it was me, but it seems to be overall poorer quality. Sadly, I will not purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I like the jasmine rainwater, but would like to see the healing garden jasmine cologne come back. The fragrance is more potent than the rainwater.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff i have used it for years the service was good and fast and i am happy with the product,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Recently I have found it difficult to find in the stores.  I am very happy to know that I can purchase this through amazon.  The scent of this body mist is light and floral not over powering.  This product meets all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;ef</li>
            <li> Great. Wish it was bigger but a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance ever!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this fragrance since it has been my favorite for a few years.  What I received was Lavender spray...the same kind Walmart has for $3. I wasnt thrilled to pay $17 for this product to begin with, and all I ended up with was the pleasure and inconvenience of returning the item.  No apologies, offer of replacement, or explanation from the seller to date.  I did get a refund for the 17$ but that didnt really suffice.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years, and now am having a difficult time getting it anymore so was pleased to see it here on Amazon. Price was a bit high, but since the product is now difficult to find I can understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is light, clean and wonderful right after your shower!</li>
            <li> The fragrance smelled strong and old.&lt;br /&gt;Too much money. Had price tag from Rite Aide for $1.00. I know it is more than that but why so much?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I love the scent and recommend it to anyone who likes cosmetics and&lt;br /&gt;toiletry items the way I do. It&#x27;s sweet and ligt; actually it could be a tad heavier for my&lt;br /&gt;tastes, cause it easily blends into your natural aura. There&#x27;s nothing not to love.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Jamine. I love it. Very subtle wonderful aroma. Works great with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I use this product often but can not get it in my home town, found your site and ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. It&#x27;s clean, fresh, beautiful and last all day. I love and recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
