    <ol>
            <li>It is, however, the best skin oil I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s impressive customer service in my book!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my hair though.  </li>
            <li>Then I brush it through with a bristle brush and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, is that it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Not to impressed and is oily and breaks out my face.</li>
            <li>but I also read that it was great for skin.  </li>
            <li>this is a great price after looking around</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great,</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I like this brand best out of all I have tried so far, and recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The oil feels very light, I keep hearing about a nutty smell, but I don&#x27;t detect that at all.</li>
            <li>Frankly I think you get more for your money in quality and quantity as well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, but I can&#x27;t use it on my hair</li>
            <li>I will continue to use on my hair, I will also make sure that my hair stays out of my face for fear of another breakout.</li>
            <li>About once a month I&#x27;ll run more through my hair and leave it over night for</li>
            <li>I am now more satisfied with the result, however.</li>
            <li>However, it was a nice product which I was able to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I always receive compliments on my skin and at 60 years old, thats a beautiful thing.  </li>
            <li>Great product absorbs into my skin and makes it so soft.  </li>
            <li>The oil seems pretty much odorless to me, so it&#x27;s great when I want to put on my favorite fragrance when I go out the door.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Have found similar products in Salons that are way overpriced, this one is a great value.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is absorbent and light.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft before having this oil, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I had noticeable results right away!  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so good and used under your regular moisturizer</li>
            <li>Healthy, soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I only tried the oil in my hair once, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It IS fantastic on the soles of your feet and your hands, makes them so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty pricey oil</li>
            <li>when I would put it in first, the heat would make my hair smell really nutty, and I actually found out that using oil and heat at the same time is a good way to literally \\&quot;fry\\&quot; your hair.  </li>
            <li>I just add about 2 or 3 drops to the moisturizer I already use right after I get out of the shower, mix it up, and apply as normal.  </li>
            <li>I have this and the 100% pure argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about 2 or 3 treatments though, it seemed like my hair had restored as much as it could, and my hair is too fine for everyday use of oil, even a light one like this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and absorbs much faster.  </li>
            <li>I would say that this product worked really well for my hair,</li>
            <li>I read other reviews stating Eden Allure is  better than Moroccanoil, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>and OMG it was like I had new hair!  </li>
            <li>They do a much better job on a daily basis of keeping your skin younger and smoother looking.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft but not much shine, but I will have to continue using to be sure.</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil, while expensive, is still a better value per ounce than this product and smells so much better.</li>
            <li>This is definitely going to be one my staples, I will be purchasing another bottle very, very soon!</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>it is not greasy and your skin will feel like a new born baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Since I have such fair hair, I use about half a pump, and I run it though my ends the same way I would use a frizz serum.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer coconut oil or olive oil separately or mixed.</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair texture felt so soft and stayed that way until it was time for another wash.</li>
            <li>(my hair is short and I would say I used almost an entire ounce per treatment, so the first bottle I bought lasted me 2 treatments) and put a plastic shower cap on my head, slept with the oil in overnight.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay product for use occasionally (such as a vacation because it is small and compact).</li>
            <li>I still am disappointed with the one ounce size and cost, as I tend to use more oil than most people .</li>
            <li>I am a afro-american female my hair is like mixed texture very fine, soft, curly and thin.  </li>
            <li>was very moisturizing and didn&#x27;t weigh it down, as for my skin</li>
            <li>At first I used this on both my skin and hair, however, I feel it was too heavy for my skin, so I only use it on my face about once a month/as needed.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too fine and thin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil is fantastic.  My hairdresser recommended it to me because I had destroyed my hair with bleach (literally-some of it burned off).  So I bought some argon oil (not this brand) and applied it and OMG it was like I had new hair!  Seriously, it helped my hair so much, anyone who has severely overprocessed hair should try this stuff.  I like this brand best out of all I have tried so far, and recommend it.  I also use this product on my face and skin.  It makes me breakout sometimes but I find that if I add it to my products rather than using it alone I don&#x27;t have that problem.  To use for hair:  I soaked my hair in the oil (my hair is short and I would say I used almost an entire ounce per treatment, so the first bottle I bought lasted me 2 treatments) and put a plastic shower cap on my head, slept with the oil in overnight.  Washed it out the next morning and voila!  Healthy, soft and shiny!  Even my hairdresser was like OMG when I went back a few weeks later.  After about 2 or 3 treatments though, it seemed like my hair had restored as much as it could, and my hair is too fine for everyday use of oil, even a light one like this.  Probably acceptable for everyday use for curly and dry hair types.  To use for skin:  I just add about 2 or 3 drops to the moisturizer I already use right after I get out of the shower, mix it up, and apply as normal.  I find when I use it directly on my skin, I break out with painful cystic pimples (on my face), so beware!  It IS fantastic on the soles of your feet and your hands, makes them so soft!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product for use occasionally (such as a vacation because it is small and compact). I much prefer coconut oil or olive oil separately or mixed. They do a much better job on a daily basis of keeping your skin younger and smoother looking. Frankly I think you get more for your money in quality and quantity as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to reorder this oil, I have gone through 7 bottles; have been using it about a year, liberally.  I absolutely love this stuff, but I can&#x27;t use it on my hair, it&#x27;s too fine and thin.  It is, however, the best skin oil I have ever tried.  I have been using Neutrogena oil for years on my body, and am now thinking I need to switch to this.  It&#x27;s much lighter and absorbs much faster.  I have been using it on my face, neck, and chest; I am now going to order 4 bottles so I can use it on my body.  A tad expensive, but as the other reviewers say, a little goes a long way.  BTW, I read the negative reviews (not many of them), and the owner of Eden Allure contacted each of the negative reviewers to offer them a full refund.  That&#x27;s impressive customer service in my book!</li>
            <li> Product is great for hair, but even better when used on face!! Have found similar products in Salons that are way overpriced, this one is a great value. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over a year ago for my hair but I also read that it was great for skin.  I am a afro-american female my hair is like mixed texture very fine, soft, curly and thin.  I would say that this product worked really well for my hair, was very moisturizing and didn&#x27;t weigh it down, as for my skin, I have oily acne prone skin, i suffered a horrible acne breakout from it!  I will continue to use on my hair, I will also make sure that my hair stays out of my face for fear of another breakout.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is truly amazing.  I have had people stop me and ask what I use on my skin.  It makes your skin feel so good and used under your regular moisturizer it is not greasy and your skin will feel like a new born baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! This lives up to its description.  I recommended it for its purity.  If you find it for less - go for it, but always check the purity label because frequently these oils are diluted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even understand how people gave this only 1 star.  They obviously do not know how to properly use oils.  This is by far my favorite argan oil.  Simple and too the point, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years now.  At first I used this on both my skin and hair, however, I feel it was too heavy for my skin, so I only use it on my face about once a month/as needed.  It&#x27;s perfect for my hair though.  My hair has grown the fastest it ever has since I started using this as a leave-in treatment.  Since I have such fair hair, I use about half a pump, and I run it though my ends the same way I would use a frizz serum.  Then I brush it through with a bristle brush and it&#x27;s perfect.  About once a month I&#x27;ll run more through my hair and leave it over night for deeper conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw backs I&#x27;ve had with this, is I do NOT recommend using this before using heat products.  If you want to use oil, use it AFTER you iron your hair.  when I would put it in first, the heat would make my hair smell really nutty, and I actually found out that using oil and heat at the same time is a good way to literally \\&quot;fry\\&quot; your hair.  So yes, save it for AFTER you use heat.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. My skin has never felt so soft before having this oil, I absolutely love it! I only tried the oil in my hair once, and so far so good. My hair feels soft but not much shine, but I will have to continue using to be sure. The oil feels very light, I keep hearing about a nutty smell, but I don&#x27;t detect that at all. The oil seems pretty much odorless to me, so it&#x27;s great when I want to put on my favorite fragrance when I go out the door. Best of all, is that it lasts all day. This is definitely going to be one my staples, I will be purchasing another bottle very, very soon!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews stating Eden Allure is  better than Moroccanoil, so I tried it. I disagree!! Moroccanoil, while expensive, is still a better value per ounce than this product and smells so much better. I guess I didn&#x27;t notice the small one oz size when I placed my order. I will order Moroccanoil again next time.&lt;br /&gt;  I must add, however, since the above entry I have washed and styled my hair twice with Eden Allure. I have coarse, thick hair that will frizz horribly in this Louisiana humidity. The Eden Allure actually prevented the frizz, and my hair styled easier. I still am disappointed with the one ounce size and cost, as I tend to use more oil than most people . I am now more satisfied with the result, however.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. After one use, my hair texture felt so soft and stayed that way until it was time for another wash.I definately suggest that you try this item out.</li>
            <li> Great product absorbs into my skin and makes it so soft.  Used it on my hair too.  Love this product great value.</li>
            <li> did not care for this on my hair, but on my skin it seems to work.  this is a great price after looking around</li>
            <li> I thought this was some miracle oil, but nope. I hate the texture of it and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin or hair. Instead, it makes my hair feel really coarse and kinda greasy and it&#x27;s not pleasant at all. My skin felt leathery after continuous application, too. It&#x27;s a pretty pricey oil so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re tight on budget.</li>
            <li> feels so good on my skin</li>
            <li> I recently read about the benefits of Argon oil and was not able to find the product in local stores.  I use this oil under my makeup and also put it on at night.  I had noticeable results right away!  Every woman needs to use Argon oil!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is absorbent and light. Not sure why its so expensive. I have used better argan oils that are not as expensive as this. However, it was a nice product which I was able to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I had purchased twice before and I received double the amount for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;I did not look closely enough on the 1 fluid oz.  I am sorry I purchased.</li>
            <li> I have this and the 100% pure argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great, and it&#x27;s like 1/2 the price! Definitely going to continue buying eden allure.</li>
            <li> Not to impressed and is oily and breaks out my face. I have normal skin but this is not for me.</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments on my skin and at 60 years old, thats a beautiful thing.  I use it every morning and evening.</li>
            <li> The product did not come in a box and as a result the plastic coverering  over the cap was cracked.  It must have occurred in transport.</li>
