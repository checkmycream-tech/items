            <li>this oil has a great smell and keeps you entertained all night out guessing whether someone is attracted by the pheromones or just something else.  </li>
            <li>But, I have believed it can make someone happy with you.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge skeptic but this formula is just the best you can get if you want to enhance your attraction to someone.</li>
            <li>I purchased the spray and saw good results</li>
            <li>but the smell is good.</li>
            <li>, I get good results.</li>
            <li>This oil works as good as cologne does.</li>
            <li>Good way to boost confidence.</li>
            <li>but it smells good.</li>
            <li>Good Luck to everyone who purchases these items, I am sure they work great.</li>
            <li>An orgy comprised exclusively of guys wearing this oil should have a palpably greater intensity than anything experienced before.</li>
            <li>Simply Magical!</li>
            <li>My massage therapist is even giving better massages!  </li>
            <li>The customer service is outstanding!</li>
            <li>but after my first use I found the scent to be very pleasant and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it made people kind of touchy feely.</li>
            <li>While you&#x27;re still warm from your shower or bath, apply PherX Pheromone Oil instead of your antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a really nice</li>
            <li>I personally liked it cause</li>
            <li>That could be the placebo effect, but it&#x27;s going to be nice finding</li>
            <li>The first time I put on the oil it had the most amazing scent!!!</li>
            <li>This oil includes a light/subtle pleasant scent, which (if needed) can easily be masked by applying cologne or the like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure the customer service is great if they send a free sample of something in order to get a review..</li>
            <li>The product works well and blends nicely with my cologne :)</li>
            <li>I like it, light, not too strong, attractive smell.</li>
            <li>it seems to be more concentrated and more effective.</li>
            <li>I know became more chatty.</li>
            <li>On day one I notice more smiles and conversation engagements.</li>
            <li>On day two I notice being able to deal with individuals easier.</li>
            <li>I realized my confidence did improve and my boss was more receptive to my ideas during my presentation.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Well I think it is way more than that.  </li>
            <li>But this is more than just a placebo one can buy to boost one&#x27;s self assurance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that...</li>
            <li>I receive a greater amount of attention from the guys at the Coffee shop and club.</li>
            <li>Now hopefully I can capitalize on it. :)</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>and I think i have more attention.</li>
            <li>Oh well ... Let&#x27;s give it more time.</li>
            <li>find me more approachable when wearing.</li>
            <li>I do love the scent.  </li>
            <li>have been friendlier and have taken more time to talk to me.  </li>
            <li>had better</li>
            <li>I seem to get more attention from people when Im out.  </li>
            <li>But the guys love it.</li>
            <li>I will be keeping a bottle on me all the time :-)</li>
            <li>I love PherX Pheromones.</li>
            <li>I got more compliments from the scent from the spray than from the oil.</li>
            <li>I noticed guys wanted to talk to me more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Much more potent than the cologne.</li>
            <li>After you put it, you forget about it, so it is not the placebo effect at most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have had the opportunity to try this, it worked well for the purpose I had for it...</li>
            <li>I have gotten a lot of attn and more interest in men like chatting, flriting and eye contact.</li>
            <li>I think this one works slightly better than the cologne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it just smells sexy.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>he was really warm and friendly with me; he said I was cute, and he picked up and swung me in a circle hug, like you see in the movies.</li>
            <li>There were guys coming up to me being very friendly</li>
            <li>but it has this very clean scent about it.  </li>
            <li>I have started to dress more nicely and wear it often and smile more</li>
            <li>but I can say that since I started wearing it he has become more attentive.  </li>
            <li>The product has been great so far.</li>
            <li>I am certain that this oil encourages many men to have a wondering eye and then some more!  </li>
            <li>I strongly belive in the power of pheromones so thats why i tried it out for myself.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and easily blends into skin.</li>
            <li>i bought this (PherX Oil) and was given an offer to try out the cologne (PherX Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men).  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a great love interest grabber!</li>
            <li>Immediately after I put it on, I felt more confident in myself and definitely noticed more looks!</li>
            <li>The very first day I wore it, I had 2 noticable events!  </li>
            <li>I could see a huge difference of just how close he wanted to be verses not using this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the attention</li>
            <li>With the purchase of the spray I was told I could receive a free bottle of something if I reviewed it.</li>
            <li>Prior to receiving my spray product, I request this one because I thought it was a great value!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on my eyes and my third eye for an enhanced experienced.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is such a confidence booster.</li>
            <li>He has been complimented many times in public on how good he smells.  </li>
            <li>I really feel more confident wearing it</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the &amp;#34;Pherx Phermone Cologne for Gay Men</li>
            <li>I feel attractive and if that were the only thing this Oil does, it is worth every drop!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot!...</li>
            <li>Since the first time I used this oil, I noticed more attention from men.</li>
            <li>Did not yield any significant results.</li>
            <li>#34;keep up&amp;#34;...  Commissions are at their highest point ever for me at work, and even my boss is being uncharacteristically friendly and praising!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a hot day, all the better.</li>
            <li>You will start to feel comfort with a person and will have lots of laugh!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this, and as I dabbed it on, set my expectations that I&#x27;d be dog-piled by a bunch of randy guys as soon as I stepped out of the door.</li>
            <li>Due to the scent, I would not recommend wearing a cologne in addition to the oil, as it might be a bit too overwhelming, but with deodorant and body spray will leave one smelling pleasant and clean.</li>
            <li>Over the weekend I decided to go to the bar for a special party</li>
            <li>The company gave me a special offer on the oil, so I ordered it as well.  </li>
            <li>When I started wearing this product it certainly gave me more confidence.</li>
            <li>I know it is more than my imagination, everyone wants to talk to me and get closer to me.  </li>
            <li>The oil has the same effect for me as the spray, and that is to make me feel more confident and receptive both in talking to guys and my being approached.</li>
            <li>so I see anybody &amp; everybody &amp; again it was women who were quick to compliment me on my smell....</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle the results keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li>You lucky guy.</li>
            <li>I tried the spray as well, and it works great too, but I think the oil is more long lasting and does not need to be re-applied as often.</li>
            <li>during the day I noticed a lot of people girls, gay guys and even straight guys turning heads and the people</li>
            <li>they said the liked it a little better.how much better can you get than</li>
            <li>The smell is light and really blends well with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>For work to try to keep everyone calm.</li>
            <li>Naturally that reaction from most of the men you meet in a day instills some confidence within oneself</li>
            <li>I must say the smell really is nice (Fresh, almost like a baby powder) &amp; like everyone reviewing on here has said it doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li>Men would touch my shoulders and arms and smile a lot.</li>
            <li>Some people respond to it, some don&#x27;t, but the extra confidence is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enhance your natural, sensuous scent rather than hide it under a cologne or body spray that&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s idea of sexy.</li>
            <li>pheromone content is high, so go easy with it.</li>
            <li>At this price, it is well worth it in making any guy feel sexy, confident, and alluring, or in helping him to attract the attention of other guys.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The part of the scent that you can smell starts out floral, but on my skin it changes to a more masculine, pleasant odor - still with just a little bit of floral to it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>I do feel and am able to smell the oil longer on my skin than when compared to the spray, and while the spray may be less long-lasting, it seemed to have more of a desired effect in attracting attention.</li>
            <li>It seems that people in general are friendlier, I get more smiles.</li>
            <li>I think that it definitely works very well to get someone interested in you, but I just wish the smell was more radiant and lasted longer!</li>
            <li>I notice I naturally tend to attract more straight and bisexual men.</li>
            <li>believed the reviews, so I bought it, expecting at least some sort of result.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells ok, but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any effects...</li>
            <li>Consistently when I am wearing PherX men, gay and straight, approach me more often, stand closer when speaking to me, linger longer than otherwise, and sometimes even seem to be in a minor daze, not knowing why they do not want to leave my presence.  </li>
            <li>Overall people are more social with me and interact more</li>
            <li>The oil does have a scent, not unpleasant, but that of a clean, fresh, light cologne, similar to what I normally would wear, but not as nuanced.</li>
            <li>All I can say, though, is that the dates I&#x27;ve had since trying PherX Pheromone Oil for Gay Men have gone better than average.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it higher since it does achieve some results, but considering the price</li>
            <li>Plus, I personally like the spray&#x27;s scent better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different from the spray but certainly equally captivating.</li>
            <li>In terms of personal effects, I do feel more focused at work during the first 2 hours of usage.</li>
            <li>Definitely getting more attention.</li>
            <li>I am really hoping I can catch the attention of my crush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed more attention and eye contact from men and women at work and in public.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely getting more when my supply runs out.  -- cyr.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this one to people most definitely.</li>
            <li>and I have made more friends than before in a short amount of time</li>
            <li>but the ones that did were pretty out there.</li>
            <li>This product have a great, subtle, and captivating fragrance it is definitely stronger than the cologne.</li>
            <li>A bit musky, but when combined with a very small amount of after shave it is a great understated fragrance.  </li>
            <li>not sure if it works but good to try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to try this for a few days, but all sorts of people in all sorts of situations seem to be more willing to make good eye contact and have a little conversation.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion I think it may have worked slightly but not in the way I was thinking...</li>
            <li>I make certain not to interact the two because I don&#x27;t know what the outcome would be.  </li>
            <li>You probably figure that this PherX Gay Pheromone Oil sex attractant is a not-inexpensive gimmick geared toward guys who feel that they need an extra something to get the attention they crave.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not around enough gay men?</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;ll say is, I went to a gay bar with a close female friend of mine.</li>
            <li>Whenever I started to talk to a person who was feeling nervous, after a little while my conversation&#x27;s partner&#x27;s mood changed spontaneously.</li>
            <li>My husband has become more attentive lately.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say i really see any difference in peoples aproach to me with this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works...</li>
            <li>The ladies seems to really like it as well.</li>
            <li>It stimulates the wearer perhaps as much as it does those around you.  </li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need cologne</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Very manly.  </li>
            <li>and i did not see any much of a difference between the two with regards to efficacy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the attention I gathered.</li>
            <li>I would say if you really want to try something you can notice a difference with, try this formula.</li>
            <li>and it really does attract the guys.</li>
            <li>Not quite what I expected, but I have gotten a lot more attention from guys after wearing this.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I have to admit to receiving compliments from female coworkers throughout the day that I smell nice, but since switching to the oil, I haven&#x27;t had such comments from men.</li>
            <li>They come back to be near me more than they need to do.  </li>
            <li>original product definitely has a nicer smile and I would get complimented on it very often, while my classmates were usually a lot more talkative and nicer to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first I thought the scent was a little to strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recomned it</li>
            <li>does not mean everybody else</li>
            <li>This oil seem to work a little better than the cologne</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong, cloying, and it would overpower any other cologne you might want to wear with it.  </li>
            <li>If anything at least somebody had took the time to compliment me which was nice...</li>
            <li>I have been using this with my normal cologne.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is it seems to disperse pretty fast.</li>
            <li>a few days before I get a better idea on how others interact with me.</li>
            <li>No negative comments yet</li>
            <li>Bottom line - less effective, but longer lasting.</li>
            <li>I did notice this one guy at work who was new was rather chatty with me...</li>
            <li>This product is subtle, but effective.</li>
            <li>I wore it to an event last weekend, I did notice everyone was quite friendly and a few took special interest in conversing with me.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not know if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; because I have not actually used them since my first headache with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I felt like guys were noticing me more than usual.</li>
            <li>Not a magic potion for sure.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it  works like magic</li>
            <li>The oil is a little strong.</li>
            <li>I will recommend it because it also gives you a self-confidence that actually works much better than other details!</li>
            <li>Now I cannot say this is positively the reason for the extra attention</li>
            <li>I have studied the reactions I get over a long period of time, wearing it for a month or two, not wearing it for a couple of months, then back to wearing it again, for several cycles over more than a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I actually am receiving so much attention now</li>
            <li>I do not know if this pheromone for gay men only attracts men because it seems that even women and straight men seem to be somewhat friendlier than the usual.  </li>
            <li>I had a gay friend that is sensitive to cologne smells, smell me and thought it was subtle but only noticed it when he was very close.</li>
            <li>And a avid user of the the spray, but the oil didn&#x27;t last as long as the spray did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a newbie to both this product and wearing pheromones in general.  </li>
            <li>When PherX blends with your natural pheromones it creates an utterly irresistible scent that&#x27;s yours alone.</li>
            <li>the inside of your elbows, your groin, the back of your knees...will allow your body&#x27;s natural movements to disperse your scent.</li>
            <li>, I did a lot of research on Amazon looking at various brands of these pheromone colognes and most of the feedback really read like fake reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this oil on my pulse points, such as my wrists, behind the ears, and my neck, but I noticed that a guy will have to get kind of close to you, such as when he hugs you, for him to notice the smell, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>And the scent is mild but like a current designer fragrance, just very faint which is even better.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the subtle smell and also have found I prefer the Oil version of this product to the spray cologne.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Increased confidence in social situations with a long-lasting fragrance reminiscent of leather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the oil and went strolling in a mall and have received second glances where normally, nobody would actively be looking with interest.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so I thought the oil would really be awesome.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best.</li>

            <li> tell me I smelled great.</li>
            <li> this oil has a great smell and keeps you entertained all night out guessing whether someone is attracted by the pheromones or just something else.  </li>
            <li> But, I have believed it can make someone happy with you.</li>
            <li> lol)  </li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> These products are great never-the-less.</li>
            <li> I DID, however, get great results from the perfume spray for women.</li>
            <li> great seller thx</li>
            <li> this lol</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge skeptic but this formula is just the best you can get if you want to enhance your attraction to someone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the spray and saw good results</li>
            <li> but the smell is good.</li>
            <li> , I get good results.</li>
            <li> This oil works as good as cologne does.</li>
            <li> Good way to boost confidence.</li>
            <li> but it smells good.</li>
            <li> Good Luck to everyone who purchases these items, I am sure they work great.</li>
            <li> An orgy comprised exclusively of guys wearing this oil should have a palpably greater intensity than anything experienced before.</li>
            <li> Simply Magical!</li>
            <li> My massage therapist is even giving better massages!  </li>
            <li> The customer service is outstanding!</li>
            <li> but after my first use I found the scent to be very pleasant and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it made people kind of touchy feely.</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re still warm from your shower or bath, apply PherX Pheromone Oil instead of your antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a really nice</li>
            <li> I personally liked it cause</li>
            <li> That could be the placebo effect, but it&#x27;s going to be nice finding</li>
            <li> The first time I put on the oil it had the most amazing scent!!!</li>
            <li> This oil includes a light/subtle pleasant scent, which (if needed) can easily be masked by applying cologne or the like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure the customer service is great if they send a free sample of something in order to get a review..</li>
            <li> The product works well and blends nicely with my cologne :)</li>
            <li> I like it, light, not too strong, attractive smell.</li>
            <li> it seems to be more concentrated and more effective.</li>
            <li> I know became more chatty.</li>
            <li> On day one I notice more smiles and conversation engagements.</li>
            <li> On day two I notice being able to deal with individuals easier.</li>
            <li> I realized my confidence did improve and my boss was more receptive to my ideas during my presentation.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Well I think it is way more than that.  </li>
            <li> But this is more than just a placebo one can buy to boost one&#x27;s self assurance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that...</li>
            <li> I receive a greater amount of attention from the guys at the Coffee shop and club.</li>
            <li> Now hopefully I can capitalize on it. :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> and I think i have more attention.</li>
            <li> Oh well ... Let&#x27;s give it more time.</li>
            <li> find me more approachable when wearing.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent.  </li>
            <li> have been friendlier and have taken more time to talk to me.  </li>
            <li> had better</li>
            <li> I seem to get more attention from people when Im out.  </li>
            <li> But the guys love it.</li>
            <li> I will be keeping a bottle on me all the time :-)</li>
            <li> I love PherX Pheromones.</li>
            <li> I got more compliments from the scent from the spray than from the oil.</li>
            <li> I noticed guys wanted to talk to me more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Much more potent than the cologne.</li>
            <li> After you put it, you forget about it, so it is not the placebo effect at most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have had the opportunity to try this, it worked well for the purpose I had for it...</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of attn and more interest in men like chatting, flriting and eye contact.</li>
            <li> I think this one works slightly better than the cologne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it just smells sexy.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> he was really warm and friendly with me; he said I was cute, and he picked up and swung me in a circle hug, like you see in the movies.</li>
            <li> There were guys coming up to me being very friendly</li>
            <li> but it has this very clean scent about it.  </li>
            <li> I have started to dress more nicely and wear it often and smile more</li>
            <li> but I can say that since I started wearing it he has become more attentive.  </li>
            <li> The product has been great so far.</li>
            <li> I am certain that this oil encourages many men to have a wondering eye and then some more!  </li>
            <li> I strongly belive in the power of pheromones so thats why i tried it out for myself.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and easily blends into skin.</li>
            <li> i bought this (PherX Oil) and was given an offer to try out the cologne (PherX Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men).  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a great love interest grabber!</li>
            <li> Immediately after I put it on, I felt more confident in myself and definitely noticed more looks!</li>
            <li> The very first day I wore it, I had 2 noticable events!  </li>
            <li> I could see a huge difference of just how close he wanted to be verses not using this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the attention</li>
            <li> With the purchase of the spray I was told I could receive a free bottle of something if I reviewed it.</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving my spray product, I request this one because I thought it was a great value!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on my eyes and my third eye for an enhanced experienced.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is such a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> He has been complimented many times in public on how good he smells.  </li>
            <li> I really feel more confident wearing it</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the &amp;#34;Pherx Phermone Cologne for Gay Men</li>
            <li> I feel attractive and if that were the only thing this Oil does, it is worth every drop!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot!...</li>
            <li> Since the first time I used this oil, I noticed more attention from men.</li>
            <li> Did not yield any significant results.</li>
            <li> #34;keep up&amp;#34;...  Commissions are at their highest point ever for me at work, and even my boss is being uncharacteristically friendly and praising!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a hot day, all the better.</li>
            <li> You will start to feel comfort with a person and will have lots of laugh!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, and as I dabbed it on, set my expectations that I&#x27;d be dog-piled by a bunch of randy guys as soon as I stepped out of the door.</li>
            <li> Due to the scent, I would not recommend wearing a cologne in addition to the oil, as it might be a bit too overwhelming, but with deodorant and body spray will leave one smelling pleasant and clean.</li>
            <li> Over the weekend I decided to go to the bar for a special party</li>
            <li> The company gave me a special offer on the oil, so I ordered it as well.  </li>
            <li> When I started wearing this product it certainly gave me more confidence.</li>
            <li> I know it is more than my imagination, everyone wants to talk to me and get closer to me.  </li>
            <li> The oil has the same effect for me as the spray, and that is to make me feel more confident and receptive both in talking to guys and my being approached.</li>
            <li> so I see anybody &amp; everybody &amp; again it was women who were quick to compliment me on my smell....</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle the results keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li> You lucky guy.</li>
            <li> I tried the spray as well, and it works great too, but I think the oil is more long lasting and does not need to be re-applied as often.</li>
            <li> during the day I noticed a lot of people girls, gay guys and even straight guys turning heads and the people</li>
            <li> they said the liked it a little better.how much better can you get than</li>
            <li> The smell is light and really blends well with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> For work to try to keep everyone calm.</li>
            <li> Naturally that reaction from most of the men you meet in a day instills some confidence within oneself</li>
            <li> I must say the smell really is nice (Fresh, almost like a baby powder) &amp; like everyone reviewing on here has said it doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li> Men would touch my shoulders and arms and smile a lot.</li>
            <li> Some people respond to it, some don&#x27;t, but the extra confidence is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enhance your natural, sensuous scent rather than hide it under a cologne or body spray that&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s idea of sexy.</li>
            <li> pheromone content is high, so go easy with it.</li>
            <li> At this price, it is well worth it in making any guy feel sexy, confident, and alluring, or in helping him to attract the attention of other guys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The part of the scent that you can smell starts out floral, but on my skin it changes to a more masculine, pleasant odor - still with just a little bit of floral to it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> I do feel and am able to smell the oil longer on my skin than when compared to the spray, and while the spray may be less long-lasting, it seemed to have more of a desired effect in attracting attention.</li>
            <li> It seems that people in general are friendlier, I get more smiles.</li>
            <li> I think that it definitely works very well to get someone interested in you, but I just wish the smell was more radiant and lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I notice I naturally tend to attract more straight and bisexual men.</li>
            <li> believed the reviews, so I bought it, expecting at least some sort of result.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells ok, but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any effects...</li>
            <li> Consistently when I am wearing PherX men, gay and straight, approach me more often, stand closer when speaking to me, linger longer than otherwise, and sometimes even seem to be in a minor daze, not knowing why they do not want to leave my presence.  </li>
            <li> Overall people are more social with me and interact more</li>
            <li> The oil does have a scent, not unpleasant, but that of a clean, fresh, light cologne, similar to what I normally would wear, but not as nuanced.</li>
            <li> All I can say, though, is that the dates I&#x27;ve had since trying PherX Pheromone Oil for Gay Men have gone better than average.  </li>
            <li> I would rate it higher since it does achieve some results, but considering the price</li>
            <li> Plus, I personally like the spray&#x27;s scent better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from the spray but certainly equally captivating.</li>
            <li> In terms of personal effects, I do feel more focused at work during the first 2 hours of usage.</li>
            <li> Definitely getting more attention.</li>
            <li> I am really hoping I can catch the attention of my crush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed more attention and eye contact from men and women at work and in public.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting more when my supply runs out.  -- cyr.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this one to people most definitely.</li>
            <li> and I have made more friends than before in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> but the ones that did were pretty out there.</li>
            <li> This product have a great, subtle, and captivating fragrance it is definitely stronger than the cologne.</li>
            <li> A bit musky, but when combined with a very small amount of after shave it is a great understated fragrance.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it works but good to try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to try this for a few days, but all sorts of people in all sorts of situations seem to be more willing to make good eye contact and have a little conversation.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion I think it may have worked slightly but not in the way I was thinking...</li>
            <li> I make certain not to interact the two because I don&#x27;t know what the outcome would be.  </li>
            <li> You probably figure that this PherX Gay Pheromone Oil sex attractant is a not-inexpensive gimmick geared toward guys who feel that they need an extra something to get the attention they crave.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not around enough gay men?</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ll say is, I went to a gay bar with a close female friend of mine.</li>
            <li> Whenever I started to talk to a person who was feeling nervous, after a little while my conversation&#x27;s partner&#x27;s mood changed spontaneously.</li>
            <li> My husband has become more attentive lately.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say i really see any difference in peoples aproach to me with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...</li>
            <li> The ladies seems to really like it as well.</li>
            <li> It stimulates the wearer perhaps as much as it does those around you.  </li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need cologne</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Very manly.  </li>
            <li> and i did not see any much of a difference between the two with regards to efficacy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the attention I gathered.</li>
            <li> I would say if you really want to try something you can notice a difference with, try this formula.</li>
            <li> and it really does attract the guys.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected, but I have gotten a lot more attention from guys after wearing this.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I have to admit to receiving compliments from female coworkers throughout the day that I smell nice, but since switching to the oil, I haven&#x27;t had such comments from men.</li>
            <li> They come back to be near me more than they need to do.  </li>
            <li> original product definitely has a nicer smile and I would get complimented on it very often, while my classmates were usually a lot more talkative and nicer to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> at first I thought the scent was a little to strong.</li>
            <li> I highly recomned it</li>
            <li> does not mean everybody else</li>
            <li> This oil seem to work a little better than the cologne</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong, cloying, and it would overpower any other cologne you might want to wear with it.  </li>
            <li> If anything at least somebody had took the time to compliment me which was nice...</li>
            <li> I have been using this with my normal cologne.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it seems to disperse pretty fast.</li>
            <li> a few days before I get a better idea on how others interact with me.</li>
            <li> No negative comments yet</li>
            <li> Bottom line - less effective, but longer lasting.</li>
            <li> I did notice this one guy at work who was new was rather chatty with me...</li>
            <li> This product is subtle, but effective.</li>
            <li> I wore it to an event last weekend, I did notice everyone was quite friendly and a few took special interest in conversing with me.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not know if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; because I have not actually used them since my first headache with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I felt like guys were noticing me more than usual.</li>
            <li> Not a magic potion for sure.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it  works like magic</li>
            <li> The oil is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it because it also gives you a self-confidence that actually works much better than other details!</li>
            <li> Now I cannot say this is positively the reason for the extra attention</li>
            <li> I have studied the reactions I get over a long period of time, wearing it for a month or two, not wearing it for a couple of months, then back to wearing it again, for several cycles over more than a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I actually am receiving so much attention now</li>
            <li> I do not know if this pheromone for gay men only attracts men because it seems that even women and straight men seem to be somewhat friendlier than the usual.  </li>
            <li> I had a gay friend that is sensitive to cologne smells, smell me and thought it was subtle but only noticed it when he was very close.</li>
            <li> And a avid user of the the spray, but the oil didn&#x27;t last as long as the spray did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a newbie to both this product and wearing pheromones in general.  </li>
            <li> When PherX blends with your natural pheromones it creates an utterly irresistible scent that&#x27;s yours alone.</li>
            <li> the inside of your elbows, your groin, the back of your knees...will allow your body&#x27;s natural movements to disperse your scent.</li>
            <li> , I did a lot of research on Amazon looking at various brands of these pheromone colognes and most of the feedback really read like fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this oil on my pulse points, such as my wrists, behind the ears, and my neck, but I noticed that a guy will have to get kind of close to you, such as when he hugs you, for him to notice the smell, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> And the scent is mild but like a current designer fragrance, just very faint which is even better.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the subtle smell and also have found I prefer the Oil version of this product to the spray cologne.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Increased confidence in social situations with a long-lasting fragrance reminiscent of leather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the oil and went strolling in a mall and have received second glances where normally, nobody would actively be looking with interest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be clear and say not every single guy I encountered threw himself on me- not by a long shot-</li>
            <li> I would say that there&#x27;s a mediocre response that probably lasts longer, but the spray did have a better response even if the duration wasn&#x27;t as long.</li>
            <li> It smells way worse than Ax body spray or other cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance didn&#x27;t linger as long as the spray version</li>
            <li> I definitely will be rebuying once this bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work, the first day I wore the oil I noticed a few people at work complimented my cologne (as if I didn&#x27;t wear Beckham everyday anyway</li>
            <li> It is strange how this can work!</li>
            <li> Im still single though.</li>
            <li> I am so excited every time I wear this man magnet because I get all the male attention I want but was afraid to ask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure of the science behind gay pheromones</li>
            <li> If I had men beating down my door suddenly, I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Because of the long-term way in which I have studied its effects repetitively with such positive results, I believe the science behind it and will use it for as long as I can remain supplied.  </li>
            <li> I also wear my regular everyday cologne (David Beckham) with the oil</li>
            <li> I think any of you that are curious to try it SHOULD...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to give up just yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still curious to see where it could go....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious about this product I suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li> I found myself using it everyday and have now placed my second order.</li>
            <li> The other reviews for this product are also suspect..  </li>

            <li> I put a little on everyday and i feel like it works personally.</li>
            <li> It was flattering to say the least, I just was curious to see if it would actually attract any males like it&#x27;s suppose to do...</li>
            <li> and yeah, it gives me a tingle down there.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say i really see any difference in peoples aproach to me with this product. It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> I purchased the spray and saw good results so I thought the oil would really be awesome.  I would say that there&#x27;s a mediocre response that probably lasts longer, but the spray did have a better response even if the duration wasn&#x27;t as long. I would rate it higher since it does achieve some results, but considering the price, I will just opt for the convenience of the spray. Plus, I personally like the spray&#x27;s scent better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works... during the day I noticed a lot of people girls, gay guys and even straight guys turning heads and the people I know became more chatty.</li>
            <li> The Pheromone oils are great. It&#x27;s different from the spray but certainly equally captivating.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice. But I haven&#x27;t noticed anything else. At least not yet.</li>
            <li> The product came as agreed. It has a light scent and easily blends into skin. On day one I notice more smiles and conversation engagements. On day two I notice being able to deal with individuals easier. I would recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I used 1 drop at the back of each ear, 1 drop on each wrist and 1 drop on each side of the neck. The fragrance didn&#x27;t linger as long as the spray version but I suppose that could be because my nose was acclimatized to the scent. I realized my confidence did improve and my boss was more receptive to my ideas during my presentation. In terms of personal effects, I do feel more focused at work during the first 2 hours of usage.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Definitely getting more attention.</li>
            <li> I had someone over I have been seeing for quite a while now. I decided to wear some of this oil on my pulse points. He was so overwhelmed by the scent just couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. I could see a huge difference of just how close he wanted to be verses not using this product. I&#x27;m a huge skeptic but this formula is just the best you can get if you want to enhance your attraction to someone. Over the weekend I decided to go to the bar for a special party my group of friends were having. There were guys coming up to me being very friendly tell me I smelled great. I got lots of hugs and attention. What are you waiting for get this product! I will be stocking up!</li>
            <li> I have a few friends that have tried wearing pheromones so I wanted to see for myself. The smell is light and really blends well with my chemistry. I wore it to an event last weekend, I did notice everyone was quite friendly and a few took special interest in conversing with me. I definitely will be rebuying once this bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I received this after purchasing the PherX Pheromone Cologne for my son for his birthday.  The company gave me a special offer on the oil, so I ordered it as well.  My son loves both the oil and the Cologne, and uses them together.  He has been complimented many times in public on how good he smells.  The ladies seems to really like it as well.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of the spray, I decided to give the oil a shot. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, so I&#x27;m still evaluating its effectiveness. Overall, while the oil seems to work well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite the effect that the spray does. The oil does have a scent, not unpleasant, but that of a clean, fresh, light cologne, similar to what I normally would wear, but not as nuanced. Due to the scent, I would not recommend wearing a cologne in addition to the oil, as it might be a bit too overwhelming, but with deodorant and body spray will leave one smelling pleasant and clean. I do feel and am able to smell the oil longer on my skin than when compared to the spray, and while the spray may be less long-lasting, it seemed to have more of a desired effect in attracting attention. Bottom line - less effective, but longer lasting. I have to admit to receiving compliments from female coworkers throughout the day that I smell nice, but since switching to the oil, I haven&#x27;t had such comments from men. The oil has the same effect for me as the spray, and that is to make me feel more confident and receptive both in talking to guys and my being approached. Will I continue to wear/buy the oil? Yes. At this price, it is well worth it in making any guy feel sexy, confident, and alluring, or in helping him to attract the attention of other guys. I&#x27;ll continue wearing it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> this oil has a great smell and keeps you entertained all night out guessing whether someone is attracted by the pheromones or just something else.  Great value and company is great with customers!</li>
            <li> Till I have used it, on one has never come on me!! But, I have believed it can make someone happy with you.</li>
            <li> You probably figure that this PherX Gay Pheromone Oil sex attractant is a not-inexpensive gimmick geared toward guys who feel that they need an extra something to get the attention they crave.  Well I think it is way more than that.  It works, and I like it.  I have studied the reactions I get over a long period of time, wearing it for a month or two, not wearing it for a couple of months, then back to wearing it again, for several cycles over more than a couple of years.  Consistently when I am wearing PherX men, gay and straight, approach me more often, stand closer when speaking to me, linger longer than otherwise, and sometimes even seem to be in a minor daze, not knowing why they do not want to leave my presence.  And they do not just do this once.  They come back to be near me more than they need to do.  Naturally that reaction from most of the men you meet in a day instills some confidence within oneself and yeah, it gives me a tingle down there.  But this is more than just a placebo one can buy to boost one&#x27;s self assurance.  Because of the long-term way in which I have studied its effects repetitively with such positive results, I believe the science behind it and will use it for as long as I can remain supplied.  It stimulates the wearer perhaps as much as it does those around you.  And it stimulates one&#x27;s imagination.  An orgy comprised exclusively of guys wearing this oil should have a palpably greater intensity than anything experienced before.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few days now &amp; I have been putting it on my pulse points (Behind my ears, wrists, inside of creases on my arms)...I must say the smell really is nice (Fresh, almost like a baby powder) &amp; like everyone reviewing on here has said it doesn&#x27;t last...I&#x27;m okay with that...I also wear my regular everyday cologne (David Beckham) with the oil but I don&#x27;t spray it on the areas where I applied the oil....In my honest opinion I think it may have worked slightly but not in the way I was thinking...I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work, the first day I wore the oil I noticed a few people at work complimented my cologne (as if I didn&#x27;t wear Beckham everyday anyway lol)  &amp; wanted me to hang around so they could smell me lol...I definitely think the oil enhanced my overall smell (Including my cologne) to anybody who came in close contact with me...Yet they were all females lol...It was flattering to say the least, I just was curious to see if it would actually attract any males like it&#x27;s suppose to do...I did notice this one guy at work who was new was rather chatty with me...I&#x27;d also like to add I work in a public environment so I see anybody &amp; everybody &amp; again it was women who were quick to compliment me on my smell....If anything at least somebody had took the time to compliment me which was nice...I definitely will continue to keep wearing the oil...I think any of you that are curious to try it SHOULD...It&#x27;s worth a shot!...It was definitely an impulse buy on my part too, &amp; I don&#x27;t regret it...I&#x27;m not ready to give up just yet lol...I&#x27;m still curious to see where it could go....I am really hoping I can catch the attention of my crush!</li>
            <li> With the oil I can&#x27;t smell anything. With the spray you can smell a muskiness to it but the oil, nothing. Not sure if it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle the results keep getting better and better. I receive a greater amount of attention from the guys at the Coffee shop and club. I know it is more than my imagination, everyone wants to talk to me and get closer to me.  I am so excited every time I wear this man magnet because I get all the male attention I want but was afraid to ask.  I am certain that this oil encourages many men to have a wondering eye and then some more!  I would drink this stuff if I could!  Simply Magical! My massage therapist is even giving better massages!  Thank you so much for such a great love interest grabber! The customer service is outstanding! Thank you, Thank you.</li>
            <li> When I started wearing this product it certainly gave me more confidence. I also noticed that it made people kind of touchy feely. Men would touch my shoulders and arms and smile a lot. I guess that&#x27;s attraction at it&#x27;s best. Now hopefully I can capitalize on it. :)</li>
            <li> Increased confidence in social situations with a long-lasting fragrance reminiscent of leather. I&#x27;ve also noticed more attention and eye contact from men and women at work and in public.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with my normal cologne.  I make certain not to interact the two because I don&#x27;t know what the outcome would be.  I purchased this so my husband and I could add a little spice to the relationship.  I love the scent and you really don&#x27;t need cologne but it has this very clean scent about it.  My husband has become more attentive lately.  Now I cannot say this is positively the reason for the extra attention but I can say that since I started wearing it he has become more attentive.  Plus I also have &amp;#34;More swing in my step&amp;#34;.  I feel attractive and if that were the only thing this Oil does, it is worth every drop!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out to see if it might improve my game. I was going to have some guys I know test it with me wearing it and not.  Unfortunately the basic smell of this is just nasty.  No, it&#x27;s not pheromones, it just smells like awful mens cologne. It smells way worse than Ax body spray or other cheap stuff.  it&#x27;s strong, cloying, and it would overpower any other cologne you might want to wear with it.  My friends all thought it smelled awful, so bad that it would reduce any &#x27;game&#x27; the pheromones might help with on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the point of this stuff was to subtly boost your game and in you could wear it &#x27;under&#x27; your normal cologne. I can&#x27;t do it as it smells so embarrassingly bad.  I won&#x27;t be caught dead smelling this tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I did a lot of research on Amazon looking at various brands of these pheromone colognes and most of the feedback really read like fake reviews.  The other reviews for this product are also suspect..  I&#x27;m returning this junk.</li>
            <li> This product have a great, subtle, and captivating fragrance it is definitely stronger than the cologne. I really feel more confident wearing it and I think i have more attention. I highly recomned it</li>
            <li> If I had men beating down my door suddenly, I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars.  All I can say, though, is that the dates I&#x27;ve had since trying PherX Pheromone Oil for Gay Men have gone better than average.  Cause? Effect?  I don&#x27;t know.  I enjoy the subtle smell and also have found I prefer the Oil version of this product to the spray cologne.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Since the first time I used this oil, I noticed more attention from men. I only used one drop and it worked.</li>
            <li> It is strange how this can work! There are some people that notice something is different and will ask if you have lost weight or changed your hair. Some people respond to it, some don&#x27;t, but the extra confidence is nice.</li>
            <li> Did not yield any significant results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I attracted anyone but the smell is good. I&#x27;m basically already an approachable person. Im still single though. Oh well ... Let&#x27;s give it more time.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the &amp;#34;Pherx Phermone Cologne for Gay Men (Attract Men)&amp;#34; and was offered to try out this oil.&lt;br /&gt;The original product definitely has a nicer smile and I would get complimented on it very often, while my classmates were usually a lot more talkative and nicer to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this oil on my pulse points, such as my wrists, behind the ears, and my neck, but I noticed that a guy will have to get kind of close to you, such as when he hugs you, for him to notice the smell, but I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Last night I went out to a club and met a guy..he was really warm and friendly with me; he said I was cute, and he picked up and swung me in a circle hug, like you see in the movies. Haha. I think that it definitely works very well to get someone interested in you, but I just wish the smell was more radiant and lasted longer! These products are great never-the-less.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the extra strength they just sent the regular oil. Would like to get a discount for it.</li>
            <li> This oil includes a light/subtle pleasant scent, which (if needed) can easily be masked by applying cologne or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a newbie to both this product and wearing pheromones in general.  The times I have used/applied this product, I have noticed an increase in overall confidence.  It also seems (both men and women) find me more approachable when wearing.</li>
            <li> I do love the scent.  A bit musky, but when combined with a very small amount of after shave it is a great understated fragrance.  Very manly.  Yea baby!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but I don&#x27;t care. it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I have only used the oil for ten days, but I believe that ALL men are reacting &amp;#34;more friendly&amp;#34; and open, and this gives me an edge in the retail clothing industry.  I actually am receiving so much attention now (people are hanging on my every word, wanting to just keep a conversation going, agreeing with almost every suggestion, etc...), that I am finding it difficult to &amp;#34;keep up&amp;#34;...  Commissions are at their highest point ever for me at work, and even my boss is being uncharacteristically friendly and praising!&lt;br /&gt;  I tried the spray as well, and it works great too, but I think the oil is more long lasting and does not need to be re-applied as often.</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re still warm from your shower or bath, apply PherX Pheromone Oil instead of your antiperspirant. That&#x27;s right. I said instead. If it&#x27;s a hot day, all the better. When PherX blends with your natural pheromones it creates an utterly irresistible scent that&#x27;s yours alone. Dabbing instead of rubbing the oil into the creases of your skin...the inside of your elbows, your groin, the back of your knees...will allow your body&#x27;s natural movements to disperse your scent. Finish by gliding the oil left on your fingers through your hair. That&#x27;s a really nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhance your natural, sensuous scent rather than hide it under a cologne or body spray that&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s idea of sexy. Enjoy the attention PherX Pheromone Oil delivers. You lucky guy.</li>
            <li> i bought this (PherX Oil) and was given an offer to try out the cologne (PherX Pheromone Cologne for Gay Men).  i have tried out both products recently and i did not see any much of a difference between the two with regards to efficacy. both of them work.  I&#x27;ve tried the oil and went strolling in a mall and have received second glances where normally, nobody would actively be looking with interest.  At work i used the cologne and people have been friendlier and have taken more time to talk to me.  I do not know if this pheromone for gay men only attracts men because it seems that even women and straight men seem to be somewhat friendlier than the usual.  I&#x27;m definitely getting more when my supply runs out.  -- cyr.</li>
            <li> I dont like it I did not meet no one it sucks sory had better I wish ther was something elase that you can  recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure of the science behind gay pheromones but psychologically it does make me feel sexier.</li>
            <li> Immediately after I put it on, I felt more confident in myself and definitely noticed more looks! The only thing is it seems to disperse pretty fast. I really liked the scent! Enough to go ahead and buy the spray as well even before I ran out of the oil.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had no luck with this particular product. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the attention I gathered. I DID, however, get great results from the perfume spray for women. Maybe I&#x27;m just not around enough gay men? I notice I naturally tend to attract more straight and bisexual men.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works but good to try.  great seller thx</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and have use this for about every time I go out.  I seem to get more attention from people when Im out.  The product has been great so far.</li>
            <li> With the purchase of the spray I was told I could receive a free bottle of something if I reviewed it. Prior to receiving my spray product, I request this one because I thought it was a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, the spray gave me a headache so I immediately discarded it. I contacted Zyloo and asked to cancel the shipment of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;They have not responded and I just received it today. I have thrown it away because I do not intend to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not know if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; because I have not actually used them since my first headache with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give this one or two stars because I do not know the quality of this material, just because I had an adverse reaction does not mean everybody else will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the customer service is great if they send a free sample of something in order to get a review.. Good Luck to everyone who purchases these items, I am sure they work great. Unfortunately, my body cannot handle them.</li>
            <li> The oil is a little strong. But the guys love it.</li>
            <li> The very first day I wore it, I had 2 noticable events!  It Definitely works! And the scent is mild but like a current designer fragrance, just very faint which is even better.  I would say if you really want to try something you can notice a difference with, try this formula. I will be keeping a bottle on me all the time :-)</li>
            <li> I love PherX Pheromones. And a avid user of the the spray, but the oil didn&#x27;t last as long as the spray did. I got more compliments from the scent from the spray than from the oil.</li>
            <li> I noticed guys wanted to talk to me more. And it had a relaxing effect on me personally. It has an inviting smell and is one of the best colognes I have smelled in a while.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ll say is, I went to a gay bar with a close female friend of mine. I wore this product, and the guys were all hitting on my female friend and ignoring me. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just bought the oil and after showering, as suggested by another reviewer, and dabbed on my armpits, inner elbow, wrists and behind the ear. I had a gay friend that is sensitive to cologne smells, smell me and thought it was subtle but only noticed it when he was very close. I&#x27;ll be a few days before I get a better idea on how others interact with me. No negative comments yet so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Well it seems to work I love the smell anyways I wear it both ways as suggested with or without calogne and i just cant get enough of it</li>
            <li> Much more potent than the cologne. Great product!</li>
            <li> the product works as may be with whom you use it, for my personal opinion, I get good results. I like</li>
            <li> This oil works as good as cologne does. After you put it, you forget about it, so it is not the placebo effect at most. It really works! Whenever I started to talk to a person who was feeling nervous, after a little while my conversation&#x27;s partner&#x27;s mood changed spontaneously. You will start to feel comfort with a person and will have lots of laugh! I will recommend it because it also gives you a self-confidence that actually works much better than other details!</li>
            <li> Nuh... It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I believed the reviews, so I bought it, expecting at least some sort of result.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells ok, but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen any effects... So no, I do not recommend it, and I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like it, light, not too strong, attractive smell.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference when I wear this product.  I love it!!!  I went out for a walk to the store and I felt like guys were noticing me more than usual.</li>
            <li> This oil seem to work a little better than the cologne but the results were a disappoint to me. Not a magic potion for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have had the opportunity to try this, it worked well for the purpose I had for it... For work to try to keep everyone calm.</li>
            <li> I like this one...it seems to be more concentrated and more effective. I have gotten a lot of attn and more interest in men like chatting, flriting and eye contact. I think this one works slightly better than the cologne. I would recommend this one to people most definitely. Hope this helps someone out!</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the spray and I do believe that this is longer lasting than the spray. Overall people are more social with me and interact more</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but when I smell it from the bottle it turns me on. I don&#x27;t know why it just smells sexy.</li>
            <li> I feel that you have to just try it for yourself. I personally liked it cause you dont even notice that it is on you but it is always working. I put a little on everyday and i feel like it works personally. I strongly belive in the power of pheromones so thats why i tried it out for myself. It also seems to give you a confidence booster</li>
            <li> The first time I put on the oil it had the most amazing scent!!! It is not overpowering and it really does attract the guys. I put it on my eyes and my third eye for an enhanced experienced. Also if you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to try this for a few days, but all sorts of people in all sorts of situations seem to be more willing to make good eye contact and have a little conversation. That could be the placebo effect, but it&#x27;s going to be nice finding out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part of the scent that you can smell starts out floral, but on my skin it changes to a more masculine, pleasant odor - still with just a little bit of floral to it.</li>
            <li> Good way to boost confidence. I am not sure if it  works like magic but it smells good. I have started to dress more nicely and wear it often and smile more and I have made more friends than before in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> I used the product several times and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product is subtle, but effective. I recommend putting it (sparingly) on &amp;#34;pulse points&amp;#34;: the upper neck (under the jawline, where your arteries are), your wrists (if you&#x27;re wearing short sleeves) and here&#x27;s the bonus: with the hand you applied it with, briskly rub your fingers through your hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; overpowering at all, but it adds to effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pheromone content is high, so go easy with it. One drop for each application site, and then rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this under the arms and other strategic areas. &amp;#60;wink&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> The product works well and blends nicely with my cologne :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, and as I dabbed it on, set my expectations that I&#x27;d be dog-piled by a bunch of randy guys as soon as I stepped out of the door. So that did not happen, but I have observed an effect- Latino guys seemed to be the ones who responded to this on me. Had some crazy flirtation directed at me over the past few weeks that was out of the ordinary. I&#x27;ll be clear and say not every single guy I encountered threw himself on me- not by a long shot- but the ones that did were pretty out there. I&#x27;ll keep using this.</li>
            <li> I have had Pherx pheromone oil for just over a week. It seems that people in general are friendlier, I get more smiles. I like it. I would like to try the cologne next in people&#x27;s reviews they said the liked it a little better.how much better can you get than this lol I guess I will see.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, it works well with a variety of scents and enhances attraction.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not quite what I expected, but I have gotten a lot more attention from guys after wearing this.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. It smells great and is such a confidence booster. If you&#x27;re curious about this product I suggest you buy it. Works like magic.</li>
            <li> at first I thought the scent was a little to strong. but after my first use I found the scent to be very pleasant and not overbearing.  I found myself using it everyday and have now placed my second order.</li>
