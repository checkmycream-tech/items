            <li>The bright blues and pinks.</li>
            <li>a good re-tightening of jars and a cloth wipe didn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>I purchased these glitter pots, based on the good reviews, and they took about a month to arrive.</li>
            <li>I love this on my nails!  </li>

            <li>It shows on nice on my nails, not translucent.</li>
            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>Very bright and pretty, convenient jars.</li>
            <li>but i will have to mix a couple colors together in order to cover all of my nails.. and for the price, that is totally fine!! :)</li>
            <li>but great for large areas, tips of nails.  </li>
            <li>Huge hit with my daughter!  </li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m really glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping someday for even more</li>
            <li>Love this glitter, Shiny and flat.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll do some more nail art research online.</li>
            <li>Make sure you look into the quantities of each.  </li>
            <li>I love this glitter</li>
            <li>sure that you know that each color is about a tablespoon</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more prettier than in the photos.</li>
            <li>i would like to use more of this product</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, they were pretty good</li>
            <li>The colors were good, not whats pictured but still were pretty.</li>
            <li>Still pretty happy with it though, received lots of pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and a good selection.</li>
            <li>&quot; I thought I was getting the fine glitter dust.  </li>
            <li>They were just short of completely filled and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>very cool bright colors easy to use - clean up is simple if you use acetone .</li>
            <li>They are small hexagon shape and are perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li>so if you mix them with dust glitter, it makes the perfect look!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely come back to buy more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>Will make me happy for a long time</li>
            <li>It did take a while for the item to arrive but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>you can also create your own sparkle clear coat.  </li>
            <li>They range from 1/4 full to 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I also did not take the time to read the full decription.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason it gets two stars is because it got here in two days, and there is a good variety of color.</li>
            <li>this would make a cool gift for the &amp;#34;girly girl :&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>NOT TOO FULL.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>amazing colors, a nice diversity, If you love designs or just mix them with some nail polish, I mean on top or probably with a clear coat...</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty..</li>
            <li>still nice.looks very pretty on your nails</li>

            <li>but generally it arrived safe.</li>
            <li>This glitter is pretty big and can easily just fall off your nails!</li>
            <li>Much better for specific placement on nail designs.</li>
            <li>I think it was pretty over priced for what I received..</li>
            <li>You get the same amount of each, and some of the colors aren&#x27;t very desirable, and some you wish you had more of.  </li>
            <li>Too large i was expecting finer</li>
            <li>These are not powder they are large chunks of glitter like fish scales or sequins.</li>
            <li>Th glitter is too large to use for nails, which is the reason I bought them.</li>
            <li>it is large glitter.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and pretty, pretty and vibrant, vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li>is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li>I love it the second I opend the package and can not wait until I get to use them on the clear acrylic nails.</li>

            <li>Vibrant and pretty&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;pretty and vibrant.</li>
            <li>BUT THEY CAME IN A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME..</li>
            <li>but the glitter is actually pretty big pieces not dusty at all.</li>
            <li>nice colors some the them were a little different but</li>
            <li>The other pots were mostly okay, although some were partly unscrewed and only some glitter leaked out.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more of a &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, but got small glitter instead.  </li>
            <li>it clearly states before you buy 3-5 ship...</li>
            <li>regret buying so far</li>
            <li>Instead, they are bigger particles that don&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>have had a lot of fun and done several different designs..</li>
            <li>packaged well, but jars are not full some only 1/4 full so you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about making the purchase at first  reading some reviews</li>
            <li>the transparent colors dont really show up on dark colors though.</li>

            <li> the transparent colors dont really show up on dark colors though.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to work with, the glitter pieces are pretty big and the case was cracked when I got it..</li>
            <li> Yes in the title it says &amp;#34;powder dust&amp;#34;, but if you take even a second to look at the picture it is clearly not dust.</li>
            <li> Glitter was way larger than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Why so long?</li>
            <li> Some loose glitter but nothing</li>
            <li> None came completely loose and none of the lids fell off in shipping.</li>
            <li> but they took almost 2 months to arrive and when they finally did, half the glitter was spilled out.</li>
            <li> I wanted these to cover my nails in sparkles, but they don&#x27;t stay on very well and are very hard to take off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> But my only complaint is each color isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> BUT IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED...</li>
            <li> Completely alien to the pictures, do you want to know if we buy goods sometimes is a professional purposes, if mailed to our products and the picture is not consistent, can cause cannot be used, that is to say we bought is rubbish!</li>
            <li> I was slightly mad about the wait, but looking forward to all the new designs i could do with my new glitter.</li>
            <li> This item was NOT as expected!  </li>
            <li> Glitter is a little bit bigger, NOT fine.  </li>
            <li> However, when they arrived about HALF the glitter pots were opened and the glitter had spilled out.</li>
            <li> This item was all over in the bag it came in, its not good that your items is already open by the time you received it.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few spilled a little</li>
            <li> small but not like dust glitter</li>
            <li> some craft glitters did that I bought for my nails in the past.  </li>
            <li> ON THE OTHER HAND, do not put false description words in the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will still use them as a chunky glitter but not very good on the description.</li>
            <li> I do nail art design and have a hard time finding glitter to match some of the art work I do..</li>
            <li> But instead I received thick glitter hexagonal shape glitter.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to put on nails so not useful at all.</li>
            <li> It was very small in size, and did not stick.</li>
            <li> But definitely small amounts!!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I hate this.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Big glitter. Not at all dust.</li>
            <li> This item was all over in the bag it came in, its not good that your items is already open by the time you received it. Which i could give no star</li>
            <li> packaged well, but jars are not full some only 1/4 full so you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Product as described.  I love this on my nails!  I would recommend this to anyone into nail art.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get powder dust like it says on the post. But instead I received thick glitter hexagonal shape glitter. These are difficult to put on nails so not useful at all. Do not buy if you are looking for powder nail dust</li>
            <li> Too large i was expecting finer</li>
            <li> I do nail art design and have a hard time finding glitter to match some of the art work I do.. I ordered this and got it right on time.. I thought the it was going to be finer than it was since it did say glitter powder dust.. but it is just regular nail glitter..</li>
            <li> These came in a week and came in perfect condition. Some loose glitter but nothing a good re-tightening of jars and a cloth wipe didn&#x27;t fix. None came completely loose and none of the lids fell off in shipping. They were just short of completely filled and the colors are great. I was a little unsure about making the purchase at first  reading some reviews but now I&#x27;m really glad I bought these. Am gonna buy them again! Here&#x27;s hoping someday for even more colors!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal favorites: The bright blues and pinks.</li>
            <li> Yes in the title it says &amp;#34;powder dust&amp;#34;, but if you take even a second to look at the picture it is clearly not dust. People complaining can only blame themselves for not looking at the picture. They are small hexagon shape and are perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty.. But definitely small amounts!! I wanted to use them for my nails and toes, sprinkle it over the gel and then put them in the dryer.. but i will have to mix a couple colors together in order to cover all of my nails.. and for the price, that is totally fine!! :)</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, they were pretty good so I got it. But my only complaint is each color isn&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> I was expecting glitter powder DUST. This glitter is pretty big and can easily just fall off your nails! I hate this. Not only are they big pieces of glitter but they took almost 2 months to arrive and when they finally did, half the glitter was spilled out.</li>
            <li> Works great in adding to acrylic powders.</li>
            <li> nice colors some the them were a little different but still nice.looks very pretty on your nails the transparent colors dont really show up on dark colors though.</li>
            <li> This item was NOT as expected!  Was not a glitter powder, and does not give the look I am wanting to achieve with my nail designs.</li>
            <li> Glitter was way larger than what I had expected. I didn&#x27;t care for this product. Don&#x27;t order if you want nail dust.</li>
            <li> These are not powder they are large chunks of glitter like fish scales or sequins.</li>
            <li> Love this glitter, Shiny and flat.&lt;br /&gt;Very small but not like dust glitter so if you mix them with dust glitter, it makes the perfect look!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely come back to buy more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> ordered on September 4th it is now October 5th I HAVE NOT RECIEVED MY PRODUCT YET.....it clearly states before you buy 3-5 ship... regret buying so far</li>
            <li> Completely alien to the pictures, do you want to know if we buy goods sometimes is a professional purposes, if mailed to our products and the picture is not consistent, can cause cannot be used, that is to say we bought is rubbish!</li>

            <li> I think the description of this is a bit decieving.  when I thought I was getting \\&quot;Glitter Powder Dust\\&quot; I thought I was getting the fine glitter dust.  Instead, they are bigger particles that don&#x27;t really \\&quot;dust\\&quot; well onto your figer nails.  However, for the price, I&#x27;m sure I can find a use for them.  I&#x27;ll do some more nail art research online.</li>
            <li> I like the variety, I like to mix them to get the shades I want. Very bright and pretty, convenient jars. Maybe a few spilled a little but generally it arrived safe.</li>
            <li> amazing colors, a nice diversity, If you love designs or just mix them with some nail polish, I mean on top or probably with a clear coat... you can also create your own sparkle clear coat.  I enjoy them.  I also use them individualy, to create for example heads of butterflies, or in the point of their antenna, etc.</li>
            <li> It is glitter.  Very pretty, and it doesn&#x27;t fade like some craft glitters did that I bought for my nails in the past.  It is very pretty.  Make sure you look into the quantities of each.  You get the same amount of each, and some of the colors aren&#x27;t very desirable, and some you wish you had more of.  It is nice just to sample different colors.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It was very small in size, and did not stick. Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I love this glitter it works soooo well!!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty colors too!!!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure that you know that each color is about a tablespoon</li>
            <li> I purchased these glitter pots, based on the good reviews, and they took about a month to arrive. I was slightly mad about the wait, but looking forward to all the new designs i could do with my new glitter. However, when they arrived about HALF the glitter pots were opened and the glitter had spilled out. The other pots were mostly okay, although some were partly unscrewed and only some glitter leaked out. I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I wish it was actually dust glitter but the glitter is actually pretty big pieces not dusty at all. I will still use them as a chunky glitter but not very good on the description.</li>
            <li> These color choices are very pretty.  Glitter is a little bit bigger, NOT fine.  but great for large areas, tips of nails.  Eyes or face painiting accent.  Have fun</li>
            <li> Iexactly what I wanted as for as glitters. I do nails and these are great for my designs I create</li>
            <li> this glitter goes on great, like the colors. It shows on nice on my nails, not translucent.</li>
            <li> Ordered july 7th and it still hasnt arrived by july 17th. It says now that it will arrive between august 1st and august 17th. Why so long? Everything I have ordered came within a week, tops...</li>
            <li> Was expecting more of a &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, but got small glitter instead.  Still pretty happy with it though, received lots of pretty colors.</li>
            <li> It said glitter powder dust. This is not powder this like arts and crafts glitter. I do like it but not for my nails.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Fun and funky stuff to play around with.What a great choice of colors and a lot of product.Will make me happy for a long time</li>
            <li> Th glitter is too large to use for nails, which is the reason I bought them.I was wanting a finer glitter.</li>
            <li> My pots were open and spilled all over when I received them. They range from 1/4 full to 3/4 full. I also did not take the time to read the full decription. I was looking for glitter dust. THIS IS NOT DUST! it is large glitter. It is partly my fault that I did not read it. ON THE OTHER HAND, do not put false description words in the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it gets two stars is because it got here in two days, and there is a good variety of color.</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> El producto tiene muy buena calidad, entrega rapida, y era igual lo describio  el vendedor. Muchas gracias . Me encanto</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors and easy to apply. Vibrant and a good selection.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for acrylic nails and it says its glitter powder dust and i recieved big glitter. The colors were good, not whats pictured but still were pretty. The shipping was great though.</li>
            <li> It did take a while for the item to arrive but it is totally worth it! Super pretty each glitter container. It&#x27;s way more prettier than in the photos. I love it the second I opend the package and can not wait until I get to use them on the clear acrylic nails. They&#x27;ll be super DIVA!!!!</li>
            <li> I trycto use this product and im so happy cause my nails looks great i would like to use more of this product</li>
            <li> very cool bright colors easy to use - clean up is simple if you use acetone . have had a lot of fun and done several different designs.. this would make a cool gift for the &amp;#34;girly girl :&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Vibrant glitters...very pretty and vibrant. Vibrant and pretty&lt;br /&gt;pretty and vibrant. Vibrant and pretty, pretty and vibrant, vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to work with, the glitter pieces are pretty big and the case was cracked when I got it.. I think it was pretty over priced for what I received.. my opinion!!</li>
            <li> Received much earlier than anticipated.  Huge hit with my daughter!  She loves doing her nails, and for her friends, too.</li>
            <li> THEY R SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT. NOT TOO FULL. I DONT REMEMBER WHAT I PAID BUT THEY CAME IN A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME.. HAVENT USED THEM SO I DONT KNOW IF THEY BLEED OR NOT. BUT IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED... BUT THEY WILL SERVE THE PURPOSE OF WHY I ORDERED THEM!</li>
