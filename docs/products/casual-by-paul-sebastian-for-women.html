            <li>I get lots of compliments - it&#x27;s a fresh clean scent, mildly sweet &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Its the original and</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it online, since it is unavailable in the stores now.  </li>
            <li>This is such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My then young daughter liked the way it smelled on me.  </li>
            <li>love this perfume would recommend buying it online much cheaper  than the  mall perfumerys</li>
            <li>All my friends ask me what fragrance I have on they say that smell so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>When purchasing this item, always make sure that what is sent to you is clear and light in color.</li>
            <li>It smells so crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, crisp and smells like a fresh soapy smell.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite perfume since I was 18 (33 years old now).</li>
            <li>Perfume is worth the money.</li>
            <li>A favorite scent that isn&#x27;t available at my local mall anymore.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh floral and fragrant soap.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, still persistant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough not to just dump.</li>
            <li>Very very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It probably cost me more to send it back, but it was a principle thing...</li>
            <li>However like most, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and get compliments on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>it &amp;#34; business office or medical clinic&amp;#34; appropriate.</li>
            <li>Was kinda worried about ordering in the hot weather.  </li>
            <li>It diminishes my decision to purchase many items from Amazon in the future.  </li>
            <li>Everywhere I go, I get compliments on it and everyone wants to know what it is and where they can buy it.</li>
            <li>but the shipping is too much.</li>
            <li>thought it was the real cologne</li>
            <li>Fast shipping an luv</li>
            <li>As soon as I smelled this, I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real thing because I felt nauseous.</li>
            <li>I have worn it for about 5 years and it is so much cheaper on line, thank you</li>
            <li>I resent paying for something which is obviously not the original product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean scent that is very similar to a scent I use to wear in the 70&#x27;s called Tatiana.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a fragrance to wear every day and if you work around allot of people, everyone will love it and folks will always ask you to write down the name for them.</li>
            <li>Not available in the stores now, so it is such a good deal online.</li>
            <li>light in color, but when it gets old it turns a yellowish gold color and does not smell the same.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes are different on different people.</li>
            <li>THIS particular item was expired and discolored.</li>
            <li>Casual has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li>I love Casual have worn it for many years.</li>
            <li>I have worn Casual for many years and receive compliments on how clean and fresh it smells.</li>
            <li>The shopping chg was extremely high as well...</li>
            <li>Casual is a great scent anytime and</li>
            <li>Right off the back</li>
            <li>There is a new \\&quot;Casual\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Very light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>If it was different or altered in any way from the original I would know, since I&#x27;ve been wearing it for so long.</li>
            <li>Discovered this fragrance in the 90s and still love it, but it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>However, what was sent to me was old.</li>
            <li>I really like my parfume hope that it will never be discontinue, and will continue to order it in the future.</li>
            <li>wife loved the casual.</li>
            <li>The color of box and bottle are same with the one I got last time but inside of bottle is yellowish and so maybe this one is old or maybe not a Casual By Paul Sebastian.</li>
            <li>So anxiously opened package and it is fine.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I read the reviews on this product prior to purchasing, I normally do but having only positive experiences ordering from amazon, I let my guard down.  </li>
            <li>Men hat supper heavy and sweet fragrances, generally.  </li>
            <li>but there was no other choice when ordering...</li>
            <li>I attempted to return the package but was unable as Amazon labels it a hazardous product.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is clear, but the one I received and promptly sent back was urine yellow.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for around 15 years and the color of this perfume is very pale as opposed to the original which is a definite yellow</li>
            <li>This new Casual is not the same as the original.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a clean scent that is very similar to a scent I use to wear in the 70&#x27;s called Tatiana.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a fragrance to wear every day and if you work around allot of people, everyone will love it and folks will always ask you to write down the name for them.</li>
            <li> Not available in the stores now, so it is such a good deal online.</li>
            <li> light in color, but when it gets old it turns a yellowish gold color and does not smell the same.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes are different on different people.</li>
            <li> THIS particular item was expired and discolored.</li>
            <li> Casual has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li> I love Casual have worn it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have worn Casual for many years and receive compliments on how clean and fresh it smells.</li>
            <li> The shopping chg was extremely high as well...</li>
            <li> Casual is a great scent anytime and</li>
            <li> Right off the back</li>
            <li> There is a new \\&quot;Casual\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> If it was different or altered in any way from the original I would know, since I&#x27;ve been wearing it for so long.</li>
            <li> Discovered this fragrance in the 90s and still love it, but it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> However, what was sent to me was old.</li>
            <li> I really like my parfume hope that it will never be discontinue, and will continue to order it in the future.</li>
            <li> wife loved the casual.</li>
            <li> The color of box and bottle are same with the one I got last time but inside of bottle is yellowish and so maybe this one is old or maybe not a Casual By Paul Sebastian.</li>
            <li> So anxiously opened package and it is fine.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I read the reviews on this product prior to purchasing, I normally do but having only positive experiences ordering from amazon, I let my guard down.  </li>
            <li> Men hat supper heavy and sweet fragrances, generally.  </li>
            <li> but there was no other choice when ordering...</li>
            <li> I attempted to return the package but was unable as Amazon labels it a hazardous product.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is clear, but the one I received and promptly sent back was urine yellow.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for around 15 years and the color of this perfume is very pale as opposed to the original which is a definite yellow</li>
            <li> This new Casual is not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I love casual perfume, in fact it is the only perfume I have worn for last 10 years or so.  </li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s packaging image and description reflects authentic Sebastian Casual.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this must be some very old stock because it does not smell right.  </li>
            <li> everything that it was supposed to be the cost was far less than buying in a store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overwhelming, whereas the real Casual is softly scented.  </li>
            <li> Casual is VERY clear very close to water with a light/clean scent.</li>
            <li> - not sure if it is even by Paul Sebastian - in a new (purple) box.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and you only need a little spray or two to last all day.</li>
            <li> This is not the original Casual that I used to buy.  </li>
            <li> Get compliments every single time I wear this.  </li>
            <li> In my book, the very expensive designer fragrances can&#x27;t top it.  </li>
            <li> I knew these bottles had been sitting on the shelf for a VERY LONG time!</li>
            <li> When Casual is new it is practically clear.....</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll either wear it until bottle is empty or give it to my friend.  </li>
            <li> This particular perfume is no longer in production and very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I rated this particular item POOR....</li>
            <li> I guess it is due to body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> With  this cologne and the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I can wear in the work place without bothering anyone like other stronger fragrances do.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it might be an imitation but no fear.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to be the real Paul Sebastian Casual fragrance.  </li>
            <li> She wears it every day and claims it is exactly the same as the product she&#x27;s been using for years; not sure if other reviewers got a bad batch or something, but there was no problem with the bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to find another fragrance, unless these were knockoffs and watered down versions!</li>
            <li> I use this as my everyday &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The title clearly states that this is Casual by PAUL SEBASTION, but nowhere on the packaging or bottle does it say Paul Sebastion or PS.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in major department stores in my area, and I have to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> My mother has always worn this scent and can&#x27;t find it at the stores she usually buys it, so I got her this for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> No more needs to be say.</li>
            <li> That was about 15 years ago, and Casual is still the only fragrance that I wear.  </li>
            <li> you ever...ever receive Casual Parfum and it is NOT CLEAR in color.........</li>
            <li> , I was having a hard time finding it in my area.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not really the Casual perfume.  </li>
            <li> Casual is one of the few scents that I can handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 2 separate orders and same thing :(</li>
            <li> Fast shipment but very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Had read some reviews that it arrived spoiled or was outdated.  </li>
            <li> but the shipping on this one was really expensive...</li>
            <li> People, especially men, seem to go insane when I wear this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> She remembered Casual and the way it smelled on me , her boyfriend likes the way it smells on her</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casual for years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Casual for about 15 years.</li>
            <li> Casual cannot be found anywhere but Amazon and another drug store on line.  </li>
            <li> I got a Casual fragrance card in a department store bill and put it in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> Casual was all I wanted for Xmas.</li>
            <li> Will use my Amazon gift card to buy another one for me and casual men&#x27;s cologne for my husband.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My mother has always worn this scent and can&#x27;t find it at the stores she usually buys it, so I got her this for her birthday.  She wears it every day and claims it is exactly the same as the product she&#x27;s been using for years; not sure if other reviewers got a bad batch or something, but there was no problem with the bottle I ordered.</li>
            <li> Authentic perfume. She loved it. No more needs to be say.</li>
            <li> This is such a pleasant scent. It says on, without overpowering. Not available in the stores now, so it is such a good deal online.</li>
            <li> I have worn Casual for years!  It&#x27;s the only thing I can wear that does not give me a headache.  Everywhere I go, I get compliments on it and everyone wants to know what it is and where they can buy it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume since I was 18 (33 years old now). It&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is beautiful !!!! It is light and people always compliment me when I wear it. Men and women both love the fragrance. I bought several bottles as gifts last Christmas and those who received the fragrance requested it again.</li>
            <li> Perfume is worth the money. It has very mild and light flowery smell to it. Person i gave it to as a gift loved the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is not the original Casual that I used to buy.  It is yellowish in color and would not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> I love casual perfume, in fact it is the only perfume I have worn for last 10 years or so.  So, getting it super cheap from Amazon was a great find for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product yesterday, I checked the bottles to make sure they were in good condition.  Unfortunately, this must be some very old stock because it does not smell right.  Rather than having a light floral, citrusy scent, it smells like rubbing alcohol.  And it looks a lot darker in color.  Those are two signs that the perfume is no longer any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The product was NOT Paul Sebastian, but some imposter.  No where on the box or the bottle was the Paul Sebastian identification.  The fragrance is clear, but the one I received and promptly sent back was urine yellow.  The box they are showing on the site is definately Paul Sebastian, but that is not what they send you.  It probably cost me more to send it back, but it was a principle thing...</li>
            <li> i love, love this perfume....but the shipping on this one was really expensive...i didn&#x27;t need them to overnight the product.  but there was no other choice when ordering...so advertises low price for the product but the shipping is too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost ten years now, my mom got me hooked on it.  I always get asked what i&#x27;m wearing.  However like most, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone.  Lasts all day without being over powering.  I&#x27;d describe it as musk/floral.</li>
            <li> Love, love it and so do a lot of people around me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light clean fragrance and I can&#x27;t seem to find it any place but on Amazon.  So glad to have found it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance ever since Our daughter-in  laws mom wore it and I just had to have it.  I have never gotten more compliments then on this one. And of course the BEST Price was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this when I was in my thirties and liked it.  My then young daughter liked the way it smelled on me.  When she was 12 she was in an accident and lost her sense of smell.  She remembered Casual and the way it smelled on me , her boyfriend likes the way it smells on her so it&#x27;s the only thing she wears because she can&#x27;t smell anything else to try anything else with her chemistry.  I hope I will continue to buy it for her.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to be the real Paul Sebastian Casual fragrance.  I am very disappointed with it...  I ordered 3 bottles, and one was given as a gift.  The shopping chg was extremely high as well... Dont ever want to order from this vendor again...</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casual for years.  It has a light, floral smell, and I love it.  Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in major department stores in my area, and I have to buy it online.  I have yet to find anything that I would wear in place of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Casual for about 15 years. I love this perfume. It smells great! However, what was sent to me was old. When Casual is new it is practically clear.....light in color, but when it gets old it turns a yellowish gold color and does not smell the same. When purchasing this item, always make sure that what is sent to you is clear and light in color. No yellow. As a rule Amazon is great! This is the first time, in ordering from Amazon, that I am not pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this purchase&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was the real cologne and it is not even by Paul Sebastian.&lt;br /&gt;I would never have purchased if I had known it was a cheap copycat. Don&#x27;t buy cause you will be wasting your money</li>
            <li> Fast shipping an luv the product</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne, smells so clean and fresh. Wish i could find their lotion again i would buy it as well</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance and tuccini (merchant) was prompt high marks to Tuccini. Product arrived promptly in perfect condition and was a great value.  This is a fragrance I have used since I discovered it several years ago.</li>
            <li> Casual cannot be found anywhere but Amazon and another drug store on line.  I love this scent and get compliments on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s a clean scent that is very similar to a scent I use to wear in the 70&#x27;s called Tatiana.  This is the only cologne I wear.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. I get lots of compliments - it&#x27;s a fresh clean scent, mildly sweet &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really like my parfume hope that it will never be discontinue, and will continue to order it in the future. Thank u</li>
            <li> I was concerned it might be an imitation but no fear. Its the original and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Nicely packaged as well</li>
            <li> People, especially men, seem to go insane when I wear this fragrance.  I&#x27;ve worn it for over ten years and thank Goodness they have never changed the formulation.  It&#x27;s clean, crisp and smells like a fresh soapy smell.  Men hat supper heavy and sweet fragrances, generally.  So if you are looking for a fragrance to wear every day and if you work around allot of people, everyone will love it and folks will always ask you to write down the name for them.</li>
            <li> I love this parfume.  It has a very light airy smell.  It is great for me.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Discovered this fragrance in the 90s and still love it, but it is hard to find.  I love the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s versions.  It is perfect any time of the year, and I get so many compliments when I wear it.  Not too heavy and very clean smelling!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the product!!!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite perfumes. I get a compliment every time I wear it. I even bought it for a friend.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who uses this and I really liked it on her.  It does not seem to smell the same on me.  I guess it is due to body chemistry.  Most perfumes are different on different people.</li>
            <li> I got a Casual fragrance card in a department store bill and put it in a drawer.  Everytime I opened the drawer, I was amazed at how wonderful it smelled--light and floral, not at all overpowering.  I asked for it for Christmas.  That was about 15 years ago, and Casual is still the only fragrance that I wear.  I get many compliments from people wanting to know what it&#x27;s called.  In my book, the very expensive designer fragrances can&#x27;t top it.  I just wish the lotion and shower gel were easier to find.</li>
            <li> This particular perfume is no longer in production and very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It smells OK. I like Design much better.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this and I order it all the time.  great gift idea for anyone</li>
            <li> As described.  I use this as my everyday &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; fragrance.  Casual has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this item smells so good</li>
            <li> Every one notices this perfume on my wife and comments how great it smells.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and glad I did.  Great product, arrived in time for Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;5 star rating.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I get lots of compliments on it.  Very refreshing smell!</li>
            <li> I love Casual have worn it for many years.All my friends ask me what fragrance I have on they say that smell so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, so glad I found your site, I was having a hard time finding it in my area.</li>
            <li> My Mother in law loves this fragrance and she can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Happy to supply her with it easily with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Casual was all I wanted for Xmas. Its scent is out of this world. Will use my Amazon gift card to buy another one for me and casual men&#x27;s cologne for my husband. It is that good....</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite - I buy it by the case for her.</li>
            <li> love this perfume would recommend buying it online much cheaper  than the  mall perfumerys</li>
            <li> CASUAL BY PAUL SEBASTIAN FOR WOMEN FINE PARFUM SPRAY 4 OUNCES,  &#x27;&#x27; IT&#x27;S  NOT FOR  ME, &#x27;&#x27;  IT TRIGGERS MY SINUS !!!!!</li>
            <li> I rated this particular item POOR....why? THIS particular item was expired and discolored. I have been using Casual for 10+ years and I know what it should look like. Casual is VERY clear very close to water with a light/clean scent. When I received THESE bottles it was a &amp;#34;brownish&amp;#34; color with a HEAVY/Bad smell!!! Right off the back I knew these bottles had been sitting on the shelf for a VERY LONG time! I reached out to AMAZON and they replaced it!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever...ever receive Casual Parfum and it is NOT CLEAR in color......... let AMAZON know!</li>
            <li> Get compliments every single time I wear this.  Someone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I react horribly to perfume - makes my nose fuzz up &amp; gives me migraines.  I stumbled across this perfume years and years ago and it is THE ONLY ONE that I do not react to at all.  Just so nice to be able to wear perfume again after so many years without.  It is a very light and pleasing scent as well.</li>
            <li> great light scent for summer time.  Lasts a long time and you only need a little spray or two to last all day.</li>
            <li> I have worn Casual for many years and receive compliments on how clean and fresh it smells. Casual is a great scent anytime and it &amp;#34; business office or medical clinic&amp;#34; appropriate.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years, she loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casual since inception, probably 15 years.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, but it smells like plastic and disappears after 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 2 separate orders and same thing :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to find another fragrance, unless these were knockoffs and watered down versions!</li>
            <li> Product shown is not the product received.  There is a new \\&quot;Casual\\&quot; - not sure if it is even by Paul Sebastian - in a new (purple) box.  This is what I received.  This new Casual is not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> Great value fast delivery very well packaged could not be happier</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and not overpowering.  Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Although I have worn more expensive fragrances over the years,  I have only received compliments on this perfume. Men and women have commented on how lovely I smell and ask what I wear and where they can get it.  It&#x27;s my only fragrance now and I have been wearing it for over 10 years. I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> wife loved the casual. everything that it was supposed to be the cost was far less than buying in a store. would recomd to anyone</li>
            <li> My wife noticed this on a friend and really liked it, so I got it for her.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Was just delivered.  Had read some reviews that it arrived spoiled or was outdated.  So anxiously opened package and it is fine. Smells like the Casual I love and at a great price.  Was kinda worried about ordering in the hot weather.  Heat damage can happen to any fragrance, but no problem.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I read the reviews on this product prior to purchasing, I normally do but having only positive experiences ordering from amazon, I let my guard down.  Like many others, I received an imposter perfume.  The product&#x27;s packaging image and description reflects authentic Sebastian Casual.  Very very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only up side is that amazon refunded my money because they don&#x27;t accept returns of perfume. They did express a caveat that they would only do it one time as an exception.... I will never buy fragrance from Amazon again. Shame!</li>
            <li> This scent evokes summer days...its lovely, its flowery but also has a sunny sultry component while it remains light and fresh. A wonderful affordable scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for many years.  I was so excited to find it online, since it is unavailable in the stores now.  I am happy, and, once again, getting compliments on how good I smell!</li>
            <li> A favorite scent that isn&#x27;t available at my local mall anymore.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it again.  The scent is fresh floral and fragrant soap.  It stays with you all day.. Love it</li>
            <li> Casual is one of the few scents that I can handle.  Most set off my allergies or give me a headache.  As soon as I smelled this, I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real thing because I felt nauseous. It&#x27;s overwhelming, whereas the real Casual is softly scented.  The title clearly states that this is Casual by PAUL SEBASTION, but nowhere on the packaging or bottle does it say Paul Sebastion or PS.  In fact, it says it&#x27;s made by EA Fragrances Co.  I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fresh, still persistant</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, kind lasting. Pie</li>
            <li> Inexpensive for what it is and that works for me!</li>
            <li> I like casual I have worn it for about 5 years and it is so much cheaper on line, thank you and I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! I have been wearing this perfume for 21 years and have always loved it! It smells so crisp and clean. I&#x27;m happy to find it online at a good price and it is not a knock off. If it was different or altered in any way from the original I would know, since I&#x27;ve been wearing it for so long. Good buy, and received it in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorite colognes and I brought it at a  excellent price  I recommend that you who are reading this review to take the time  and try the colognes on the website I purchased others also and the were shipped in 24 hours i am very pleased. With  this cologne and the other&#x27;s I have purchased and their prices.</li>
            <li> did not smell like product should.</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance that I wear. Very light and not overwhelming. I get numerous complements. I can wear in the work place without bothering anyone like other stronger fragrances do.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not really the Casual perfume.  I have been using this product for around 15 years and the color of this perfume is very pale as opposed to the original which is a definite yellow and the fragrance is fruitier.  I attempted to return the package but was unable as Amazon labels it a hazardous product.  If that is the case why don&#x27;t they advertise that in their product description?  I resent paying for something which is obviously not the original product.  The only reason I gave it a 1 star was because I received it promptly. It diminishes my decision to purchase many items from Amazon in the future.  I have already purchased fewer items because of their delay in shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment but very disappointed with the product. The color of box and bottle are same with the one I got last time but inside of bottle is yellowish and so maybe this one is old or maybe not a Casual By Paul Sebastian.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who wears this scent and I love it on her.  I couldn&#x27;t find any in the store, so couldn&#x27;t test it before I ordered it from Amazon.  While I like it on me, it&#x27;s not my favorite - which is a shame because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive!!  But I&#x27;ll either wear it until bottle is empty or give it to my friend.  It&#x27;s nice enough not to just dump.</li>
