            <li>Good product, my baby loves it!</li>
            <li>The dropper works great and allows him to get the vitamins he needs.  </li>
            <li>A good soak sometimes helps</li>
            <li>my Kid is doing good after taking this, but taste is not so good</li>
            <li>He sometimes motions for more and grabs the dropper!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be misled and think this is the solution to give your breasfed baby their vitamin D plus more!</li>
            <li>She loved the sweet taste!</li>
            <li>I have found if I catch her off guard she will swallow most of it.</li>
            <li>These vitamins smell so much better than poly visol.</li>
            <li>A word of caution: you may be able to find a better price in a brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li>It is OK for vitamin supplementation</li>
            <li>I have heard from many people that they stain</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s exclusively breast fed, so it&#x27;s a strong contrast in taste.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is too strong.</li>
            <li>We went dairy free because he was having issues with his stomach.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>Everytime she sees the bottle she will get excited and lean toward me.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and my daughter doesn&#x27;t speak so while I can say that they smell kind of gross</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use up this bottle then find something more organic and natural for my baby.  </li>
            <li>My son takes them easily straight into his mouth!</li>
            <li>I put it into a bottle of my breastmilk and give her first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying it again, there are alternative brands available that have clear liquid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Polysorbate 80 is found in a vast array of dairy products and is even used in many vaccines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I know not evey baby likes this,, but My baby really loves it.</li>
            <li>I was about to give these vitamins to my baby, when, to my dismay, I found it has a very toxic food additive:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); blurred vision or vision changes; chest pain; confusion; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; flu-like symptoms (</li>
            <li>but I would not use it much.  </li>
            <li>, he didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>I have heard from my pediatrician that the plain vitamin D drops are more palatable</li>
            <li>I am about to try a new vitamin D drop which has fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>the natural fruit flavoring of these is making the difference and to me it is worth a bit extra.</li>
            <li>The liquid also stains cloths, so use something old to wipe!</li>
            <li>My son loves these vitamins and has been taking them since he has been 3 weeks old.......he loves the taste and sucks it down lol</li>
            <li>I just mix it into a bottle everyday and she takes it just fine, though.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that if it slides out of his mouth (especially as a young infant) it can stain his clothes.</li>
            <li>I purchased these drops to use for my 3 month old breastfed son.  </li>
            <li>My one month old son doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this at all.  </li>
            <li>My baby starts when she was almost six month old.</li>

            <li>I barely make my baby take 1 ml, I had to order drops overseas that are given only a drop a day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my baby because of all of the iron provided in formula.  When I put a mL in the bottle for my baby, she always ate the entire bottle.  She loved the sweet taste!</li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended them to me as I nursed my son but said to keep giving even after he starts solids. My son takes them easily straight into his mouth! He sometimes motions for more and grabs the dropper! (Of course I only give him the correct dose). My only issue is that if it slides out of his mouth (especially as a young infant) it can stain his clothes. A good soak sometimes helps but I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain!</li>
            <li> My infant does not like the flavor and tried to spit it out. I have heard from my pediatrician that the plain vitamin D drops are more palatable but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true. I have found if I catch her off guard she will swallow most of it.</li>
            <li> My bsby can&#x27;t take any other brand because of a specific smell they all have. the natural fruit flavoring of these is making the difference and to me it is worth a bit extra.</li>
            <li> These vitamins smell so much better than poly visol. My son also takes them really well. He would continously spit out the other vitamins.</li>
            <li> Good product, my baby loves it!</li>
            <li> I read several reviews about the flavor and the baby rejecting taking the vitamins. My baby likes this one and has had no problems taking it and digesting.</li>
            <li> Our doctor recommended</li>
            <li> Yuck. Tastes awful no wonder my kids always spit it out. Switched to a product that only requires one drop</li>
            <li> Item came as described on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these drops to use for my 3 month old breastfed son.  We went dairy free because he was having issues with his stomach.&lt;br /&gt;These drops contain caramel colouring which I now know is on the no-no list for the dairy free.&lt;br /&gt;Please know all the other names for dairy before you buy anything.</li>
            <li> My one month old son doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this at all.  The dropper works great and allows him to get the vitamins he needs.  I would definitely recommend these drops.</li>
            <li> I know not evey baby likes this,, but My baby really loves it. Everytime she sees the bottle she will get excited and lean toward me. My baby starts when she was almost six month old. My suggestion is buy a small bottle. If you baby likes it you can buy larger one later; if he/she doesn&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again b/c the taste is too bitter for my baby to accept the drops.  I tried them, too, and understood why my baby kept spitting it out.</li>
            <li> Cherry flavored - baby seems to like the taste of it. Not sure how else to review this as it was a necessity for our baby.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy and fill your kid up with unneaded substances. Made my little guy spit up too.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended Enfamil Tri-Vi-Sol. I put it into a bottle of my breastmilk and give her first thing in the morning. She drinks without any problems. My daughter is 3 months old and I&#x27;ve been giving it to her for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely HORRIBLE! Not only does it have unnecessary ingredients, it tastes absolutely terrible. Don&#x27;t be misled and think this is the solution to give your breasfed baby their vitamin D plus more! On its own, it has a horrible fake, medicinal taste and when you add it to a bottle, it ruins the breastmilk.  It even smells badly! Instead, go for the conentrated vitamin D drops where only 1 drop satisfies the daily need for your infant and that drop is tasteless!</li>
            <li> My baby didn&#x27;t seem to like the taste and spit it out every time.  She&#x27;s exclusively breast fed, so it&#x27;s a strong contrast in taste.  The liquid also stains cloths, so use something old to wipe!</li>
            <li> My little dude actually gets excited when he sees me grab the bottle.  This is the next best thing to Poly-Vi-Sol and doesn&#x27;t come with the terrible taste!</li>
            <li> Although we try to keep it from dripping on to our baby&#x27;s clothing, considering we feed him Trivisol daily, it&#x27;s hard not to get stray drops on his shirt. This stuff stains every time. I have to use bleach on his whites and I&#x27;m just out of luck if it stains his colored clothes. Why do they have to add color to this stuff!? I won&#x27;t be buying it again, there are alternative brands available that have clear liquid.</li>
            <li> Flavor is too strong. I barely make my baby take 1 ml, I had to order drops overseas that are given only a drop a day.</li>
            <li> They smell like licorice and my baby loves the taste! My pediatrician recommended them and we have had no problem administering them. A word of caution: you may be able to find a better price in a brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li> I have used this for both of my kids as a supplement because I am breastfeeding. The kids both take it well with no fuss.  I just wish there were more natural ingredients. I am about to try a new vitamin D drop which has fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was about to give these vitamins to my baby, when, to my dismay, I found it has a very toxic food additive: Polysorbate 80 - read the extract of this additive from the following website:http://peopleforethicalliving.com/health-and-fitness/food-choices-nutrition/dangerous-food-additives/&lt;br /&gt;“Polysorbate 80″.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 80 is found in a vast array of dairy products and is even used in many vaccines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Drugs.com, “difficulty breathing” is indeed one of the known side effects of Polysorbate 80.Drugs.com says that the following are “common” side effects….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constipation; cough; diarrhea; dizziness; headache; muscle, joint, back, or stomach pain; nausea or vomiting; pain, swelling, irritation, redness, or bruising at the injection site; unusual tiredness or weakness.  In addition, Drugs.com says that the following are severe side effects of Polysorbate 80 that an individual should seek immediate medical attention for….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); blurred vision or vision changes; chest pain; confusion; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, sore throat); one-sided weakness; pale skin color; redness, tenderness, or swelling of the calf; seizures; severe diarrhea, dizziness, headache, stomach pain, or vomiting; severe or persistent tiredness or weakness; slurred speech; sudden pain or numbness of an arm or leg; sudden shortness of breath; sudden trouble walking or loss of balance; swelling of the arms or legs; vision or speech problems; weight gain.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My son loves these vitamins and has been taking them since he has been 3 weeks old.......he loves the taste and sucks it down lol</li>
            <li> I used this with my son before I did research on the ingredients.  It is OK for vitamin supplementation but I would not use it much.  It has lots of questionable ingredients as well as caramel coloring.</li>
            <li> my Kid is doing good after taking this, but taste is not so good, he didn&#x27;t like it much. every time after taking these drops he makes weird looking face and start crying..</li>
            <li> Though I nurse, my children&#x27;s doctor said that we should still give this to them every day.  My kids don&#x27;t seem to mind it, in fact my 2-year old looks for it every day.</li>
            <li> My baby girl doesn&#x27;t like the taste of these separately. She spits it out and lets it dribble out of her mouth. I just mix it into a bottle everyday and she takes it just fine, though. I chose this product at the recommendation of my pediatrician.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing - I don&#x27;t use them personally and my daughter doesn&#x27;t speak so while I can say that they smell kind of gross, maybe they are gross but I don&#x27;t know. I have heard from many people that they stain so we do ours while she&#x27;s in the bath. She&#x27;s only dribbled the vitamins out once but she doesn&#x27;t cry or make a face when I give them to her. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands because my pediatrician recommended this one specifically. I have heard there are cheaper Vitamin D drops on Amazon though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the ingredient list for what is supposed to be a baby supplement. It has ingredients that I don&#x27;t personally consume like food dyes. I&#x27;ll use up this bottle then find something more organic and natural for my baby.  It is also difficult to get my baby to drink a full dropper from the dropper itself.  She nurses so we don&#x27;t have a bottle to add them to. It drips out of her mouth and stains.</li>
            <li> My baby does not like the taste</li>
