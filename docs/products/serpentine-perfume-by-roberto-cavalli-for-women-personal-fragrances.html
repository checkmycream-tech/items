            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to say whether or not I like this perfume because the smell isn&#x27;t strong or soft....</li>

            <li> I hate that they mailed this out in this condition and have since left my favorite perfume and switched to Flowerbomb</li>
            <li> Perfume is not pure and has residue.</li>
            <li> but the smell is not exactly like the one I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal for those who&#x27;s skeptical about ordering from them.</li>
            <li> a rather bland flavor&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, FragranceNet company sent me a little mirror-brush that I can keep in my hand-bag...</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t ordered it directly from Amazon I would think it was fake.</li>
            <li> , found it here a few days before Christmas and once again Amazon saved the day</li>
            <li> I know the small and I can tell this one is fake immediately.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> So when i got my package 1/8 of the bottles had leaked out the bottom as the sprayer was broken.</li>
            <li> Even worse Amazon does not allow returns of fragrances because they are considered flamable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to tell or maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I already buy another from Amazon and detect this is fake.</li>
            <li> I want to send you the picture of that fake perfume</li>
            <li> That is very annoying.</li>
            <li> How horrible it is!!!</li>

            <li> I love this perfume. I do feel like it smells a little bit different from the one I used to get a few years ago, but it&#x27;s still great. Also, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but honestly, I get a headache anyways with all-day-lasting perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came in great shape - no leaks or damages as others have reported. My seller also included some freebies which are always nice :)</li>
            <li> I received my serpentine and I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good and it price was unbeatable !</li>
            <li> I have received this product today, the delivery was in time. However, it came with a defective cap/nozzle that almost leaked 20% of the perfume during transit. Whenever I try to spray it spills some on my hand. That is very annoying. I would like to return this and would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered on February 22, got it on February 25... I will order from them again without a second thought. I got my favorite fragrance in just a few days, what more can a girl ask for. It&#x27;s the real deal for those who&#x27;s skeptical about ordering from them.</li>
            <li> very good and fresh&lt;br /&gt;my son really likes me&lt;br /&gt;is a rather bland flavor&lt;br /&gt;recommended&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;very good&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> I bought this one. But it&#x27;s not original. I know the smell of original parfume and this is totaly different. And the smell putting aout in a 15 minute.</li>
            <li> I have men stop me and ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.........NICE&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy tantalizing the poor men......thanks Cavalli for this</li>
            <li> When I received it the top of the bottle was broken and didn&#x27;t smell anything like the original that I smelled at the Department Store.  I kind of doubt that this is anything more than a cheap counterfeit.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Almost time to order more.</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol.  This is not an original.  I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> my mother loves Cavalli and in mexico it is pretty hard to find it, the price was amazing and she love it!!! it fits her very nice!!!! i will be buying more! she uses it every day!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t original,but it&#x27;s a good fake,fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Serpentine for years. I get compliments from everyone from friends to doctors. It is a real favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as the sample my wife got at the department store.  Even I could tell the difference, and my wife knows her perfume. If I hadn&#x27;t ordered it directly from Amazon I would think it was fake.</li>
            <li> Got it for my Mother in law, she has used this perfume forever! looked everywhere and any perfume stores had it, found it here a few days before Christmas and once again Amazon saved the day got it two days later!!  Now we have a happy MIL and a happy customer! :D</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume of you and I got problem with the spray. I&#x27;m in Brazil and I will keep it anyway. But since I&#x27;m buying another, I ask that all of you are ok with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Serpentine  by Roberto Cavalli. This  is  one  of  many  women&#x27;s  perfumes  that I have  purchased  for  my  wife through  out our  25 year marriage . I must  say  this  perfume  was  one  of  the  best , I&#x27;ve  ever  gave  her in all our years  together . My wife  loved it . I  love  the way it smelled  on her too.I couldn&#x27;t  keep  my hands  off her.Gentlemen ,serpentine  by Roberto Cavalli , get  one for  her today.you will love the  way  she smells .</li>
            <li> tal cual la presentacion y envio a tiempo..</li>
            <li> This product ddeswrves no stars! The perfume  was leaking out of the bottle before I opened the box.  The nozzle is defective and doesn&#x27;t spray.</li>
            <li> item was exactly as described..... i love it...authentic item..what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
            <li> So when i got my package 1/8 of the bottles had leaked out the bottom as the sprayer was broken. Then the shipping rules say that i cant return it b/c its a bio hazard or something so i had to get my dad to break it open so i can pour it in a cheap plastic bottle. I hate that they mailed this out in this condition and have since left my favorite perfume and switched to Flowerbomb</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say whether or not I like this perfume because the smell isn&#x27;t strong or soft....it&#x27;s difficult to tell or maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product the seller shipped it to me immediately.  I also got a coupon to use on my next purchase that I make with them.  I&#x27;m really pleased.  I wanted a new perfume for the fall and this scent is one that I know will turn heads.  I can&#x27;t wait to start wearing it.</li>
            <li> First, my oder came pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;ve received some nice coupons and little perfume testers with my oder with no charge.&lt;br /&gt;Third, FragranceNet company sent me a little mirror-brush that I can keep in my hand-bag...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always nice to receive a little present with no-reason...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this perfume available at a lower cost but unforturnately it was too good to be true. Received the perfume and the nozzle will not work. Even worse Amazon does not allow returns of fragrances because they are considered flamable. Dont order this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li> I had this perfume before but I bought it more expensive than the price in here. I bought this one for a friend. She likes it but the smell is not exactly like the one I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since 2006 and I love it. I know the small and I can tell this one is fake immediately.  And I can&#x27;t even return this product. How horrible it is!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS 100% PURE EU DE PERFUME.  THIS PRICE IS RIDICULOUSLY LOW FOR SUCH A QUALITY PRODUCT.  YOU&#x27;D PAY OVER TWICE AS MUCH AT A RETAIL LOCATION FOR A LESSER QUALITY SERPENTINE (PROBABLY 80% PURITY).  tHE EXTRA PURITY MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE ON HOW LONG THE PERFUME LASTS PER APPLICATION + DURATION OF BOTTLE LONG-TERM TOO.</li>
            <li> I can not spray it. The cover has problem. Perfume is not pure and has residue. I already buy another from Amazon and detect this is fake. How to return or refund it. I want to send you the picture of that fake perfume</li>
