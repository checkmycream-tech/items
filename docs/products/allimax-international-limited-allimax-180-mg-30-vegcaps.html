            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>My daughter who is 3 is able to swallow the capsules as is my son (6).  </li>
            <li>We have the liquid which I would give to my daughter under her tongue before she was able to swallow the capsules.  </li>
            <li>Most allicin you can buy</li>
            <li>I feel so much better since taking them.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love this produce and the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helping me stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Allimax and have bought of for 7 years plus.</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon, especially for the 180 count bottle, was awesome.</li>
            <li>After substantial researching and using this this product I realized just how important it is to have on hand .</li>
            <li>I would have been better off to buy the odorless version another company sells, and they&#x27;ve been in business for a long time with a good</li>
            <li>so i love this brand of garlic its my family&#x27;s go to when colds or anything really is coming.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and I will order 2 bottles again here when needed.  </li>
            <li>If you want a higher yield, you have to buy capsules with higher mg of Allisure powder or take more caps.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I started getting relief from the allicin within days, and after a few weeks there were even more amazing improvements.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 180 capsules because this stuff is not cheap and it&#x27;s a great buy getting it this way.</li>
            <li>and well worth the cost for the amount</li>
            <li>My sons symptoms returned while taking this allicin, after having success using the one on iHerb.</li>
            <li>I have a good diet (paleo, near-100% compliance), but I feel like the allicin is helping out a fair bit, since I&#x27;m not able to sleep particularly well with a 10-month old around.</li>
            <li>My husband and I just took a very long cruise and we were worried about catching the flu on the plane or on the ship.</li>
            <li>Detailed information and larger bottles of FORTASE XL is available at holistic alternatives.</li>
            <li>This is such a potent product and so concentrated for the allicin it contains - I often tell people about it -</li>
            <li>it is so powerful as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal - I really believe in this product.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most powerful natural antibiotic that I could find as of date.</li>
            <li>I love the small size of the capsules - so easy to take -</li>
            <li>I think of this product as an alternative to antibiotics, and much kinder on the whole body.  </li>
            <li>I just read the label on my last order and found out why this is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Allicin is the bio-active compound of garlic that is responsible for its health benefits.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the reviews about it not being as potent as other Allisure products.  </li>
            <li>Most other products cannot guarantee their potency.</li>
            <li>I actually had a life threatimg parasite that required full strength.</li>
            <li>It was more like I was reverting back to where I was prior to taking the AlliUltra.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone having any digestive disorders, and as a bonus this has also helped my joints and fatigue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>No negative side effects.  </li>
            <li>The first got rid of the world&#x27;s most persistent sinus infection, and I really think (n&#x3D;1 experiment, no good data)</li>
            <li>These pills only contain 54 micrograms of allicin not 180 milligrams like the picture shows, that is a huge difference in the amount of allicin that is actually in each capsule.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Alli Max and within a week of taking two caps a day my shingles were completely gone.</li>
            <li>My son suffered from Primary Immunodeficiency for several years and since starting him on Allimax not only do we no longer use antibiotics, we no longer have to go to Children&#x27;s Hospital for office visits or admissions.  </li>
            <li>I started them because I had an infected cyst on my back and it has helped the infection to come out so much.  </li>
            <li>wow do they work.</li>
            <li>I am a big proponent of garlic and these capsules really work.</li>
            <li>and I got it from  FeelGood Natural Health Store via Amazon.</li>
            <li>In the picture on the internet it said &#x27;180 mg Allicin&#x27; (directly under the name Allimax).</li>
            <li>The wonders of garlic have been long documented through out history but modern medicine doesn&#x27;t support or advocate the use of garlic as an antibiotic, anti-fungal or antimicrobial.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Allimax and AlliUltra before from Amazon and a local health food store where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really blown away that this supplement has not only worked so well, but for such an extended period of time without me needing to up the dosage.</li>
            <li>I give it daily to my 3 and 6 year old children.  </li>
            <li>The whole label is printed so small that I had to get a magnifying glass to read, contains a bunch of general unproven statements.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s kind of a lame feature!</li>
            <li> I have used high potency allicin for a few years.  </li>
            <li> - lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Though no killer of antibiotics should be taken long.</li>
            <li> I used to get the flu once or twice a year, my personal experience is for the last 5 years and no more flu since I take a dose daily for maintenance and double that</li>
            <li> Not all Allicin products are the same, be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried a lot of supplements claiming to do a lot of things, and have mostly been disappointed by them - either because they don&#x27;t work for me, or they only work for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If you read the back label there is less than 54mcg allicin.</li>
            <li> &gt; All this product contains is a tiny amount of concentrated garlic powder, a half hour after taking my stomach burned</li>
            <li> I take it every single day!  </li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only been a few weeks taking it.</li>
            <li> If you get sick a lot you will love this.</li>
            <li> When I miss a dose, I really know it, so missing a dose is not good.</li>
            <li> mg allisure powder is misleading since each capsule contains other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think it takes 6 - 8 of these to equal two of the others, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I had a small patch of shingles all of January and 2 weeks into Feb. even though the average bout lasts ten days.</li>
            <li> least 3 x daily for me..</li>
            <li> I thought this would be equal to two of the Allimax AlliUltra 360 mg caps, but the labeling is really confusing.</li>
            <li> this is a typical maintenance dose.</li>
            <li> and I noticed after taking this for about 2 weeks, I was starting to feel worse again</li>
            <li> take a few of these throughout the day and watch the symtoms fade away.</li>
            <li> Just deadly for diabetics - basically a sugar pill.</li>
            <li> They are smaller capsules and quite a bit less expensive than the Allicin capsules I&#x27;ve used before, and</li>
            <li> (incidentally, after a week and a half of NOT taking my allicin), and it made me realize that, since I&#x27;ve started taking Allimax (almost a year ago), I&#x27;ve really almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like to be sick.</li>
            <li> I had already tried antibiotics for small bowel infection, but they did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The product that was delivered looked excactly like the one on the Internet for one small detail.</li>
            <li> It has knocked out cold and flu viruses completely time and again.</li>
            <li> I used to get sick about every other month, despite eating well, exercising, drinking mostly only water, and taking vitamins faithfully.</li>
            <li> To cure a problem you would need at least 390mg 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Have been taking Allimax for approximately two years now, and a cold or flu is nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li> I developed a cough at a time when I could not afford the time to be sick.  </li>
            <li> I was SEVERELY disappointed as it put a complete halt to my healing process that I was already 4 weeks into.</li>
            <li> I just recently got over a bad case of the Norovirus</li>
            <li> I have 4 kids who have all been sick several times</li>
            <li> This is a false label</li>
            <li> and I believe a false product.  </li>
            <li> I wrote about this on my blog as one of the three things to use during cold and flu season, the other two being Umcka Cold Care and XLEAR packets for your nasal rinse.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review this bad before, but I believe in my heart that this is s faulty product...don&#x27;t waste your money and put questionable ingredients into your body.</li>
            <li> I think it will help heal almost anything that is wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has had shingles can tell you even a small patch can be very painful.  </li>
            <li> if I start feeling any cold or flu symptoms, any any time I am exposed to people</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had a cold or sore throat.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t gotten sick since.</li>
            <li> But since adding this to my routine, I&#x27;ve become the one person in our home who never gets sick.</li>
            <li> I know are sick.</li>
            <li> I use this every time someone gets sick around me</li>
            <li> and I swear it keeps me from getting sick.  </li>
            <li> False advertising shame on you Amazon!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love allimax but this is not the picture. The picture says 100% allicin and the bottle sent was 100% allisure. NOT the same thing at ALL.</li>
            <li> I have used high potency allicin for a few years.  I initially heard about it from a doctor who was treating me for stomach and bowel issues.  I had already tried antibiotics for small bowel infection, but they did not work for me.  I started getting relief from the allicin within days, and after a few weeks there were even more amazing improvements.  For similar issues now - I take 3 caps, 3 times day, along with my Fortase XL (must be the XL type) and Vitalzyme.  When I miss a dose, I really know it, so missing a dose is not good. I also used this product when I had a tooth infection. I think of this product as an alternative to antibiotics, and much kinder on the whole body.  I highly recommend this product to anyone having any digestive disorders, and as a bonus this has also helped my joints and fatigue. NOTE: Detailed information and larger bottles of FORTASE XL is available at holistic alternatives.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.  Great product.  I developed a cough at a time when I could not afford the time to be sick.  I remembered that I had purchased the Allimax and took one a day for 3 days.  Cough gone.  No negative side effects.  Many of my friends are still coughing!</li>
            <li> They are smaller capsules and quite a bit less expensive than the Allicin capsules I&#x27;ve used before, and potency/reviews are better also.</li>
            <li> I had a small patch of shingles all of January and 2 weeks into Feb. even though the average bout lasts ten days. Just when I thought they were clearing up they would come back. Anyone who has had shingles can tell you even a small patch can be very painful.  I ordered Alli Max and within a week of taking two caps a day my shingles were completely gone. I have taken this product before (one cap per day) during the summer to keep mosquitos from biting me. It is very effective. Thanks Amazon for the good price on a great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great for intestinal problems.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT I ALWAYS ODER THIS IN THE 180 CT BEST VALUE</li>
            <li> I started taking allimax in Jan 2011. haven&#x27;t gotten sick since. Love the product. the rest im just typing because i have to.. that&#x27;s kind of a lame feature!</li>
            <li> Allimax, my go to remedy for all things!  The wonders of garlic have been long documented through out history but modern medicine doesn&#x27;t support or advocate the use of garlic as an antibiotic, anti-fungal or antimicrobial.  Allimax is a staple in our house.  I give it daily to my 3 and 6 year old children.  My daughter who is 3 is able to swallow the capsules as is my son (6).  We use Allimax for almost every ailment that falls on our household.  We have the cream which we use on fever blisters, cuts, burns, any skin problem!  We have the liquid which I would give to my daughter under her tongue before she was able to swallow the capsules.  We use the capsules for anything from colds - flu - bronchitis - sinus infections - basically everything!  My son suffered from Primary Immunodeficiency for several years and since starting him on Allimax not only do we no longer use antibiotics, we no longer have to go to Children&#x27;s Hospital for office visits or admissions.  I am sold on Allimax and recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I take it every single day!  Would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> My son and I have taken Allimax twice a day for a couple of years and it keeps skin infections which we are both prone to get,at bay.  This was the best buy that I have ever found for this product.  It was shipped quickly and I will order 2 bottles again here when needed.  I just read the label on my last order and found out why this is so cheap.  These pills only contain 54 micrograms of allicin not 180 milligrams like the picture shows, that is a huge difference in the amount of allicin that is actually in each capsule.  False advertising shame on you Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I just recently got over a bad case of the Norovirus (incidentally, after a week and a half of NOT taking my allicin), and it made me realize that, since I&#x27;ve started taking Allimax (almost a year ago), I&#x27;ve really almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like to be sick. I used to get sick about every other month, despite eating well, exercising, drinking mostly only water, and taking vitamins faithfully. But since adding this to my routine, I&#x27;ve become the one person in our home who never gets sick. I&#x27;ve really tried a lot of supplements claiming to do a lot of things, and have mostly been disappointed by them - either because they don&#x27;t work for me, or they only work for a few weeks. I&#x27;m really blown away that this supplement has not only worked so well, but for such an extended period of time without me needing to up the dosage. I would be over the moon if Allimax would create some chewable version in a child-safe dosage as well.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably the best garlic supplement available.  I buy and take regularly and believe it helps support the immune system.</li>
            <li> Most allicin you can buy</li>
            <li> After substantial researching and using this this product I realized just how important it is to have on hand .</li>
            <li> I have only been a few weeks taking it. So far I really like it. The garlic flavor is not an issue.</li>
            <li> This supplement is one of the most versatile and effective I have found on the market.  I think it will help heal almost anything that is wrong with me.  I feel so much better since taking them.  I started them because I had an infected cyst on my back and it has helped the infection to come out so much.  I bought the big bottle because I want this in my house to use for colds, flus, etc.  It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> This is such a potent product and so concentrated for the allicin it contains - I often tell people about it - it is so powerful as an anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal - I really believe in this product. I love the small size of the capsules - so easy to take - and well worth the cost for the amount - lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you know garlic can fight infections, this product is it. Though no killer of antibiotics should be taken long. I used this before and after surgery because I&#x27;m older and have less resistance to infections. It has done it&#x27;s job, I now need to allow my immune system to recover on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I shared these with my Dr...took some time but he came around to them. Then proceeded to tell me to take one every hr for max effect...wow do they work. the kill off is very good...must take a cleanse too, to get all the dead cells out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the reviews about it not being as potent as other Allisure products.  The yield of Allicin per mg of Allisure powder is the same across the board, no matter what Allisure product you are  buying.  If you want a higher yield, you have to buy capsules with higher mg of Allisure powder or take more caps.  All the guides on dosages are for Allicin Powder (such as 1000mg a day) so you are not shorting yourself by taking these.</li>
            <li> great product and seller!</li>
            <li> Love the product. I used to get the flu once or twice a year, my personal experience is for the last 5 years and no more flu since I take a dose daily for maintenance and double that if I start feeling any cold or flu symptoms, any any time I am exposed to people I know are sick.</li>
            <li> They are not the potency they claim to be these guys actually duped me twice! Shame on me it sucked cause I actually had a life threatimg parasite that required full strength.</li>
            <li> My sons symptoms returned while taking this allicin, after having success using the one on iHerb. If you read the lable on the back, it does only say 54 mcg of allicin, whereas on the front, it says 180mg. This is a false label and I believe a false product.  I have never written a review this bad before, but I believe in my heart that this is s faulty product...don&#x27;t waste your money and put questionable ingredients into your body.</li>
            <li> Allimax is the only stabilized allicin capsule on the market. Allicin is the bio-active compound of garlic that is responsible for its health benefits. Most other products cannot guarantee their potency. I wrote about this on my blog as one of the three things to use during cold and flu season, the other two being Umcka Cold Care and XLEAR packets for your nasal rinse. You can read my post at http://foodsforlonglife.blogspot.com/2015/01/three-powerful-ways-to-fight-colds-and.html.&lt;br /&gt;As a nutritionist (and an Italian) I am a big proponent of garlic and these capsules really work. My husband and I just took a very long cruise and we were worried about catching the flu on the plane or on the ship. We took one of these each day and didn&#x27;t catch anything even in the height of flu season. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought Allimax and AlliUltra before from Amazon and a local health food store where I live. The ones I have bought before worked and were in the process of healing my issues. After I finished up my AlliUltra I started taking these and I noticed after taking this for about 2 weeks, I was starting to feel worse again (it wasn&#x27;t die off symptoms either, I know what those feel like, I had them with the products that worked). It was more like I was reverting back to where I was prior to taking the AlliUltra.  I bought this 180 count to save money and I got it from  FeelGood Natural Health Store via Amazon. When I got the bottle I noticed that it says on the front 180mg of Allisure but on the back it says 54mcg of Allicin powder which is like 1/8 of a gram. It doesn&#x27;t say 100% Allicin on the front like the picture on Amazon nor does it have the AC-23 Allisure powder on the bottle anywhere, which is in the product description. I was SEVERELY disappointed as it put a complete halt to my healing process that I was already 4 weeks into. I am upset that I strayed away from the AlliUltra and I can&#x27;t believe they are asking almost 90 dollars for a product that has almost no Allicin in it!!! I will go back to AlliUltra immediately. Not all Allicin products are the same, be careful.</li>
            <li> Love this produce and the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> The product that was delivered looked excactly like the one on the Internet for one small detail. In the picture on the internet it said &#x27;180 mg Allicin&#x27; (directly under the name Allimax). The product that was delivered instead showed &#x27;180 mg Allisure powder&#x27;. I looked at the ingredients and found that one capsule only actually contains 54 mcg (1g &#x3D; 1000mcg). I called amazon.com and asked for an investigation!</li>
            <li> If you read the back label there is less than 54mcg allicin. this is a typical maintenance dose. To cure a problem you would need at least 390mg 3 times a day. 180 mg allisure powder is misleading since each capsule contains other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Taking for only a short while and already see improvement in several areas.  My husband and i both are taking it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have to admit this stuff works!! if you take it bible - one or two pills will not do.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of these for cardiovascular issues.&lt;br /&gt;Best price I have found..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least 3 x daily for me..</li>
            <li> This is my second big bottle of this stuff. The first got rid of the world&#x27;s most persistent sinus infection, and I really think (n&#x3D;1 experiment, no good data) it&#x27;s helping me stay healthy. I have a good diet (paleo, near-100% compliance), but I feel like the allicin is helping out a fair bit, since I&#x27;m not able to sleep particularly well with a 10-month old around.</li>
            <li> I love Allimax and have bought of for 7 years plus. It has knocked out cold and flu viruses completely time and again. It&#x27;s also great at getting rid of bacteria infections. This is by far the most powerful natural antibiotic that I could find as of date. If you get sick a lot you will love this. Once you start to feel it coming on take a few of these throughout the day and watch the symtoms fade away. I bought the 180 capsules because this stuff is not cheap and it&#x27;s a great buy getting it this way.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!! It&#x27;s got 54 mcg out of 180 mg  that&#x27;s actually allicin. The rest is filler. That means .0003 allicin and .9997 MALTODEXTROSE AND HYPROMELLOSE. Just deadly for diabetics - basically a sugar pill.</li>
            <li> love this product and I will not be without it!  I use this every time someone gets sick around me and I swear it keeps me from getting sick.  I have 4 kids who have all been sick several times and Im still as healthy as can be!</li>
            <li> Have been taking Allimax for approximately two years now, and a cold or flu is nearly non-existent.  The price at Amazon, especially for the 180 count bottle, was awesome.</li>
            <li> so i love this brand of garlic its my family&#x27;s go to when colds or anything really is coming. the price is incredible</li>
            <li> I thought this would be equal to two of the Allimax AlliUltra 360 mg caps, but the labeling is really confusing. I don&#x27;t think it is. I think it takes 6 - 8 of these to equal two of the others, but I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m switching back to the 360 mg.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have chronic sinus infections and haven&#x27;t had one since taking Allimax. I haven&#x27;t even had a cold or sore throat. I do believe that Allimax has helped improved my immune system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the front label reads that each capsule contains 180mg and the back has 54mcg per capsule in tiny letters. The whole label is printed so small that I had to get a magnifying glass to read, contains a bunch of general unproven statements.&lt;br /&gt; All this product contains is a tiny amount of concentrated garlic powder, a half hour after taking my stomach burned and I was belching garlic. I would have been better off to buy the odorless version another company sells, and they&#x27;ve been in business for a long time with a good reputation.&lt;br /&gt; And I paid $80 for this junk.</li>
