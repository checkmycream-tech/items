            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase a fragrance this way because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or will go well with me.</li>
            <li>would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>It was a great present to give!</li>
            <li>Hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I do save it for special occasions because of the expense</li>
            <li>Finally, the bottle itself is gorgeous as well.</li>
            <li>the full size bottle one day.</li>
            <li>Months before she had commented on how much she just fell in love with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral, but much more modern and sophisticated than more traditional floral scents.</li>
            <li>And shipped to me really quick.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It lasts throughout the day and makes you smell pretty and sweet.</li>
            <li>but I am worth every penny.</li>
            <li>No weird \\&quot;creative\\&quot; \\&quot;innovative\\&quot; notes in this one, so</li>
            <li>in the mail on Saturday, the bottle is kinda pretty</li>
            <li>Very feminine and it has staying power!</li>
            <li>the spray is just that, comes in a sumwhat large stream instead of a fine mist, mabey thats what the natural ment</li>
            <li>and then there&#x27;s the whole airplane get it home</li>
            <li>I really like, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the fragrance also lasts longer on my skin than many other perfumes do.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it if you are looking for a really special fragrance.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a new perfume for a long time; it&#x27;s not that easy to find one that suits you.</li>
            <li>it right away; didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no need for a new perfume right now, but when it&#x27;s time for me to buy a bottle, I am so getting Valentina.</li>
            <li>I got a sample from Nordstrom when I purchased an old stand by cologne that I&#x27;d worn years ago.  </li>
            <li>I am using it frequently and have gotten compliments.</li>
            <li>altho im on the fence about the slight grandmaish scent butit fades to a nice floral (my fav), shipping was fast but that I expected as it came from southern ca&amp;I live in northern ca.ordered on tuesday late afternoon&amp;got</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely NOT one of those old lady perfumes either.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft and plesant enough for all day wear.  </li>

            <li> I have absolutely no need for a new perfume right now, but when it&#x27;s time for me to buy a bottle, I am so getting Valentina. This fragrance is GORGEOUS! It&#x27;s floral, but much more modern and sophisticated than more traditional floral scents. I appreciate that the fragrance also lasts longer on my skin than many other perfumes do. Finally, the bottle itself is gorgeous as well. I can&#x27;t wait to have this sitting on my dresser at home.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Great price and fast shipping, as promised.</li>
            <li> excellent very good product</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with my Sephora order. I was amazed by the scent and the longevity.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is a great feminine scent.&lt;br /&gt;I was let down by lots of perfume brands with sickening floral scent. But Valentina does not disappoint. It lasts throughout the day and makes you smell pretty and sweet. It&#x27;s definitely NOT one of those old lady perfumes either. No weird \\&quot;creative\\&quot; \\&quot;innovative\\&quot; notes in this one, so if you&#x27;re looking for something \\&quot;new\\&quot;, this is not it. But it impressed me so much that I&#x27;d like to purchase the full size bottle one day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as one of her birthday presents. Months before she had commented on how much she just fell in love with it and it was what a lady should smell like. Having never been exposed to it before it felt a bit like an expensive gamble but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. One of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever smelled and on my girlfriend it is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this perfume altho im on the fence about the slight grandmaish scent butit fades to a nice floral (my fav), shipping was fast but that I expected as it came from southern ca&amp;I live in northern ca.ordered on tuesday late afternoon&amp;got in the mail on Saturday, the bottle is kinda pretty but I am disapoited the spray is just that, comes in a sumwhat large stream instead of a fine mist, mabey thats what the natural ment I dont jnow as I never bought a perfume that did that or had that written on the box.aside from that little annoyance, im happy with my product.a good elegant evening or winter scent</li>
            <li> I got a sample from Nordstrom when I purchased an old stand by cologne that I&#x27;d worn years ago.  I am now in love with this.  OMG.  It is cheaper here than on Nordstrom, so I&#x27;m going to give it a shot here.  Hope I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I&#x27;m wearing the last of it the sample, as I write this......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts and lasts and lasts........</li>
            <li> Love it, smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new perfume for a long time; it&#x27;s not that easy to find one that suits you. Many are so cloying. A clerk in a duty-free shop at an Italian airport introduced this one to me, and I thank her.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Very satisfied with the product and price!! And shipped to me really quick. Noe I know where to go to get Valentina when I run out.</li>
            <li> I sampled this scent in Epcot {Italy} of Walt Disney World, I was going to buy it but it was pricey and then there&#x27;s the whole airplane get it home problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I came home and immediately checked pricing around.  I found the best pricing thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent, Great Price - fast shipping.</li>

            <li> I was looking for this parfume in my city. No one had it! I knew about it on a magazine, but never really tested it on me. I was hesitant to purchase a fragrance this way because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it or will go well with me. So, when I ordered it throguh Amazon, I was impatient to smell it. To my surprise, the purchase was a success, this parfum is wonderful, I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very nice and I think suttle.  if you don&#x27;t want to wear a fragrance that is overpowering, this fragrance is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
