            <li>It was packaged very nicely, with a plastic bubble wrap to prevent damage during delivery transit.</li>
            <li>It is styrofoam, which isn&#x27;t the most durable material in the world, but it arrived in exellent condition and I&#x27;ve been very happy with how mine has held up.  </li>
            <li>Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good because people take notice of something about the product.</li>
            <li>, did my mannequin research, found this one and saw the good reviews for it and then went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>But, what if I had wanted a nice, perfect clean head?</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great price to make a cheap, effective Halloween prop!</li>
            <li>Good quality for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect display piece fo easily transport to craft fairs</li>
            <li>This guy does an excellent job as the head supporting a mask of Michael Myers sitting on my front porch for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, and came in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Have been using them for two [2] years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go \\&quot;Amazing-</li>
            <li>so then I decided to buy my own</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Had nice sturdy features and worked well on my scarecrow for fall.  </li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive option if you need a full size head.  </li>
            <li>Very handsome :)  </li>
            <li>So, being a handy many he created a way to anchor it to a stand.</li>
            <li>Great Form, very cost effective.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quick and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I collect Mexican Lucha Libre (wrestling) masks, these styrofoam heads are perfect to display them.     </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find one that had the look that I needed and affordable.</li>
            <li>OK, what is up with this head?</li>
            <li>I got both on time, they were males, packed well and worked better for my needs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect if you need a standard model head for a hat, a mask, a pair of glasses, etc...and serves it&#x27;s function to a tee.</li>
            <li>so really can&#x27;t complain Great prop for Halloween.</li>
            <li>We tried it and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Hubby wears a hairpiece, and needed something to keep it safe at night or when he isnt wearing it.</li>
            <li>The styrofoam is well formed, nothing for the hair to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on (meaning it is smooth and has a nice finish).</li>
            <li>and I sometimes do book signings dressed up as my favorite character from my &amp;#34;Perception</li>
            <li>I love the way &amp;#34;he&amp;#34; looks in my hats.  </li>
            <li>Great display and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Head arrived fast and in great condition, no chips scratches or dents in styrofoam.</li>
            <li>Ok, one more time.</li>
            <li>just have to remember that if you just use it for hair pieces you will be ok, but for a batman cowl gotta put some talc on it because when it heats up it tends to stick to the inside of the cowl..</li>
            <li>Very cool.  </li>
            <li>And it really looks good too..........</li>
            <li>Easy to use for styling your wig.</li>
            <li>:) looks cool like that</li>
            <li>I will be using this to model my crochet hats and it should be fine for photo work.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product and price.</li>
            <li>I primarily use these ones as a cheap, lightweight, disposable armature for sculpting masks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>One suggestion I read on the internet is to wrap the head in cheap packaging tape until it reaches the size you want.  </li>
            <li>like most others do, so it is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>fit well</li>
            <li>The features of the face are clear and the Styrofoam is good quality.</li>
            <li>The male foam head is good for most adult-sized heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was very useful for sculpting from.</li>
            <li>Happened to fit perfectly with small mask I bought it for, which made me even happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a copy of the Silver Surfer guy from The Fantastic Four.  </li>
            <li>We used this as a mold to create the head of a past us president and it turned out really great!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a good size in general.</li>
            <li>They seem to run pretty true to size and they work well for fitting my hats.</li>
            <li>As always , the product is as advertised and arrived in extremely fast order!&lt;br /&gt;For those needing these, I have never found a better  more reasonable source!</li>
            <li>These have been put to good use for a grandson who collects may types of hats, especially western and brim hats</li>
            <li>I have purchased numerous mannequin heads for my halloween props and this one is good quality and doesn&#x27;t have the styro holes</li>
            <li>May be the quiet type, but he&#x27;ll make a good companion....</li>
            <li>The surface was smooth and the size is just right.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick too.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Besides the gashes, the head was very much intact which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>The features, though manly, are so much more proportionate to a normal sized head...</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more of these for my ball cap displays!</li>
            <li>Also, had to laugh when my styrofoam head arrived packaged in a box of...</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>it may work fine but don&#x27;t expect it do be normal size.</li>
            <li>T bought a few and will be getting more in the near future, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and recommend this seller to everyone.</li>
            <li>Not much complaint for a cheap styrofoam head.</li>
            <li>I get more use out of this male head because it has a nice face, and it is tall enough for my hats also.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This head worked exactly like i wanted to in the intended use in which i wanted it to perform.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I saw were too idealized or female.</li>
            <li>We saved the project since everyone said it was very well made!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you think it is.</li>
            <li>first then the headset.</li>
            <li>, they are exactly what we needed</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll order something a bit more quality next time.</li>
            <li>Would have been better if it were bigger</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Ok, I actually bought this head to make into a mummy prop for Halloween.</li>
            <li>well I crochet and  wanted to present my hats  better</li>
            <li>Works great - I mean</li>
            <li>Shaving off the top of the head and balancing a brain mold of shrimp on the flat surface.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hats look more desirable than just laying flat.  </li>
            <li>wow that looks pretty cool</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend both this item and this seller... will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are always looking for \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for halloween projects and it&#x27;s easy to find the female looking styroheads</li>
            <li>If you have a retail shop and need to show off some head gear, then this product will certainly do the trick.</li>
            <li>Since his destiny is to be a Halloween zombie, the damaged nose isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but certainly would be if you were using to display merchandise, etc.</li>
            <li>I held it up to a friend&#x27;s head and his head looked HUGE next to it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Very good\\&quot; customer service.</li>
            <li>The gashes didn&#x27;t really bother me a whole lot since this mannequin head was going to go under some \\&quot;zombification.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be real life size.  </li>
            <li>This was given as a gift, but suits the purpose very well.</li>
            <li>It looks much nicer in person.</li>
            <li>said however it worked out very well for me.</li>
            <li>LATER IT FIT</li>
            <li>Got this ridiculously fast, thank you.  </li>
            <li>Even if I wanted this kind of head I would have bought the linked product and saved a few bucks per head.</li>
            <li>one arrived with a tear in the mannequin but it was on top so it didn&#x27;t matter, other than that</li>
            <li>close to the size of a normal persons head!</li>
            <li>I would be less satisfied if I was using it in the retail setting</li>
            <li>I was searching for a mannequin head that was realistic.</li>
            <li>Realistic.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to say that the size of this head is comparable to that of a normal adult.  </li>
            <li>It works for what it is, but if you have some more money to spend look for something a little heavier.</li>
            <li>It worked for my Halloween costume so not much complaint here.</li>
            <li>I will probably put a few layers of paint on it to make it a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had to extend my clay masks to make them a normal size.</li>
            <li>only because he&#x27;s  suffering from several good sized dents due</li>
            <li>This was packed well and is just the right size for my male sized hats that I make.  </li>
            <li>I have beards that require styling and female wig forms don&#x27;t have the right chin for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put my new era hat</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it is a bit small, but seems fine, holds my computer headphones (full size), is pretty stable.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a female teardrop shaped head, which looks exactly like this product:</li>
            <li>so much so in certain areas that parts of the mask had actually become embedded in the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, the packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better.  </li>
            <li>My Dad asked me to buy these for him to hold a hat he especially loves and wants to protect its shape.</li>
            <li>i used this as a base for a mask and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is a very minor complaint, and it is still very usable for most purposes.</li>
            <li>Styrofoam head is realistic enough to serve my purpose.   </li>
            <li>It sturdy, exactly what I expected from the description &amp; photos.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This head is a smaller version of a normal head</li>
            <li>Packaging seemed adequate and undamaged, but other items were shipped in the same box and maybe squished it?</li>
            <li>If these other reviewers here are using this to model hats and the like, they are making some tiny little hats that would never fit this huge melon on top of my neck.</li>
            <li>The head itself is sturdy and is about the same size as an adult head ( we use it to display men&#x27;s caps).</li>
            <li>It barely reaches 21.  </li>
            <li>it served its purpose (bald cap station), but it was too light to be taken seriously.  </li>
            <li>Definitely smaller than an adult male head, but it models hats like a champ.</li>
            <li>Not sure grappling with returns will be worth it.</li>
            <li>It turns out that this head is just small enough to form leather just right.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s light, hard and durable but still prone to damage if handled too roughly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was very useful for sculpting from.</li>
            <li> Happened to fit perfectly with small mask I bought it for, which made me even happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a copy of the Silver Surfer guy from The Fantastic Four.  </li>
            <li> We used this as a mold to create the head of a past us president and it turned out really great!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a good size in general.</li>
            <li> They seem to run pretty true to size and they work well for fitting my hats.</li>
            <li> As always , the product is as advertised and arrived in extremely fast order!&lt;br /&gt;For those needing these, I have never found a better  more reasonable source!</li>
            <li> These have been put to good use for a grandson who collects may types of hats, especially western and brim hats</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous mannequin heads for my halloween props and this one is good quality and doesn&#x27;t have the styro holes</li>
            <li> May be the quiet type, but he&#x27;ll make a good companion....</li>
            <li> The surface was smooth and the size is just right.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick too.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Besides the gashes, the head was very much intact which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> The features, though manly, are so much more proportionate to a normal sized head...</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more of these for my ball cap displays!</li>
            <li> Also, had to laugh when my styrofoam head arrived packaged in a box of...</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> it may work fine but don&#x27;t expect it do be normal size.</li>
            <li> T bought a few and will be getting more in the near future, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and recommend this seller to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not much complaint for a cheap styrofoam head.</li>
            <li> I get more use out of this male head because it has a nice face, and it is tall enough for my hats also.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This head worked exactly like i wanted to in the intended use in which i wanted it to perform.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I saw were too idealized or female.</li>
            <li> We saved the project since everyone said it was very well made!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you think it is.</li>
            <li> first then the headset.</li>
            <li> , they are exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll order something a bit more quality next time.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if it were bigger</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Ok, I actually bought this head to make into a mummy prop for Halloween.</li>
            <li> well I crochet and  wanted to present my hats  better</li>
            <li> Works great - I mean</li>
            <li> Shaving off the top of the head and balancing a brain mold of shrimp on the flat surface.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hats look more desirable than just laying flat.  </li>
            <li> wow that looks pretty cool</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend both this item and this seller... will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are always looking for \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for halloween projects and it&#x27;s easy to find the female looking styroheads</li>
            <li> If you have a retail shop and need to show off some head gear, then this product will certainly do the trick.</li>
            <li> Since his destiny is to be a Halloween zombie, the damaged nose isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but certainly would be if you were using to display merchandise, etc.</li>
            <li> I held it up to a friend&#x27;s head and his head looked HUGE next to it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Very good\\&quot; customer service.</li>
            <li> The gashes didn&#x27;t really bother me a whole lot since this mannequin head was going to go under some \\&quot;zombification.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be real life size.  </li>
            <li> This was given as a gift, but suits the purpose very well.</li>
            <li> It looks much nicer in person.</li>
            <li> said however it worked out very well for me.</li>
            <li> LATER IT FIT</li>
            <li> Got this ridiculously fast, thank you.  </li>
            <li> Even if I wanted this kind of head I would have bought the linked product and saved a few bucks per head.</li>
            <li> one arrived with a tear in the mannequin but it was on top so it didn&#x27;t matter, other than that</li>
            <li> close to the size of a normal persons head!</li>
            <li> I would be less satisfied if I was using it in the retail setting</li>
            <li> I was searching for a mannequin head that was realistic.</li>
            <li> Realistic.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say that the size of this head is comparable to that of a normal adult.  </li>
            <li> It works for what it is, but if you have some more money to spend look for something a little heavier.</li>
            <li> It worked for my Halloween costume so not much complaint here.</li>
            <li> I will probably put a few layers of paint on it to make it a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to extend my clay masks to make them a normal size.</li>
            <li> only because he&#x27;s  suffering from several good sized dents due</li>
            <li> This was packed well and is just the right size for my male sized hats that I make.  </li>
            <li> I have beards that require styling and female wig forms don&#x27;t have the right chin for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put my new era hat</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it is a bit small, but seems fine, holds my computer headphones (full size), is pretty stable.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a female teardrop shaped head, which looks exactly like this product:</li>
            <li> so much so in certain areas that parts of the mask had actually become embedded in the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly, the packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better.  </li>
            <li> My Dad asked me to buy these for him to hold a hat he especially loves and wants to protect its shape.</li>
            <li> i used this as a base for a mask and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This is a very minor complaint, and it is still very usable for most purposes.</li>
            <li> Styrofoam head is realistic enough to serve my purpose.   </li>
            <li> It sturdy, exactly what I expected from the description &amp; photos.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This head is a smaller version of a normal head</li>
            <li> Packaging seemed adequate and undamaged, but other items were shipped in the same box and maybe squished it?</li>
            <li> If these other reviewers here are using this to model hats and the like, they are making some tiny little hats that would never fit this huge melon on top of my neck.</li>
            <li> The head itself is sturdy and is about the same size as an adult head ( we use it to display men&#x27;s caps).</li>
            <li> It barely reaches 21.  </li>
            <li> it served its purpose (bald cap station), but it was too light to be taken seriously.  </li>
            <li> Definitely smaller than an adult male head, but it models hats like a champ.</li>
            <li> Not sure grappling with returns will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It turns out that this head is just small enough to form leather just right.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s light, hard and durable but still prone to damage if handled too roughly.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was kind of mad, so I slapped the styro head around a bit</li>
            <li> Even the smallest adult size hats we have fall down over the eyes.  </li>
            <li> One ear is lower than the other along with some subtle differences in face features from left to right.</li>
            <li> though I wish they had a stronger base [ falls over too easily -  minor issue ], they do a good job of storing my caps and helmets.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a flimsy box, with a flattened nose, various dents on other parts of the head, and dirt marks.  </li>
            <li> There was almost no packaging, so the nose was crushed a bit, nearly flat.</li>
            <li> It is also slightly smaller than the average head, so if you are using this for templates for cosplay or whatever give yourself some room.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m pretty annoyed that i have to keep returning these.</li>
            <li> The photo shows all these styfrofoam balls loosely hanging off of the face, but mine didn&#x27;t have that issue at all.</li>
            <li> A little larger and lighter than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived when expected and was not damaged.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really much you can say about a styrofoam head.</li>
            <li> He works long hours for no pay, does not blink when the camera flash goes off, and does not require a place to lay his gold styrofoam head down at night.</li>
            <li> This male head is really small.</li>
            <li> Circumference around the forehead is 22\\&quot;, or about the size of a small female head.</li>
            <li> I can repair it, this may pose a problem to other buyers though.</li>
            <li> Despite the other reviews I purchased this to mold a leather mask around.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, not a bad head for fake monster-making, but a bit small for anything dealing with reality.</li>
            <li> Head shape is not realistic, too narrow to use for wigs</li>
            <li> I was wary because a few negative reviews said they got female heads instead of males, but I needed 2 right away, so I took a chance and figured what the hell...</li>
            <li> His only complaint is that it&#x27;s tippy.</li>
            <li> at least female head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that I find it a little narrow in the ear-to-ear direction and a little long in the nose-to-back-of-the-head direction (perhaps there are people with heads this shape, but not mine).  </li>
            <li> Looks creepy and not too much bigger than a regular manequin head</li>
            <li> HALF A</li>
            <li> I  suppose from poor packaging with other items in the same box.</li>
            <li> A little craft paint to accentuate the features</li>
            <li> little over-price</li>
            <li> Look messy but does the job.</li>
            <li> and I realize, this thing is really, really small.</li>
            <li> Then I went to a mirror and looked, and yes, again, way too small styro head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Not too small but not oversized either.</li>
            <li> If you have a small wig or hat</li>
            <li> This head is way way too small.  </li>
            <li> I had an extremely difficult time getting the mask off of the head because the material of the mask had actually melted the foam head...</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit small like everyone else</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Ended up being a bit small, but still worked.</li>
            <li> It also seems pretty sturdy without the base (Which has to be purchased separately.)</li>
            <li> duh,</li>
            <li> The ears are a bit smaller compared to the picture -- which was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lack of weight is still ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> A little creepy to him sitting out in the office staring at you</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my halloween batman mask and unfortunately the head is a bit too small to fill it up; my head fills in the mask well.</li>
            <li> I think its broken tho.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m going to end up covering it in fur and fake eyes anyway.</li>
            <li> This head is creepy and weird.</li>
            <li> Used fake hair from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> This fake head did everything I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> Was going to use it for an art project, so this rendered it useless.  </li>
            <li> Suggest that you find a square base with small rod to drive up and into bottom of neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was dirty and the nose was mashed a bit.</li>
            <li> so I have to compensate for that when I am cutting a wig for a costume.</li>
            <li> Well, I would have been hopping mad, I tell you.  </li>
            <li> just so I can come home from work and then slap the ever-living daylights out of this thing when I&#x27;m mad at the boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Impossible to tell if damage happened in transit or was shipped that way.  </li>
            <li> And can be mounted to bad clamps for it aren&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> Does the job well however sometimes when removing your clay you will pick up bits of styrofoam into your clay but its not that too bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Their are two holes, one in the bottom to attach to base stabilizer, one in rear for attaching to wall display.</li>
            <li> Using t-pins to affix head yo a sturdy cardboard base.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> got for my sculptures works well</li>
            <li> Not much complaint for a cheap styrofoam head. The nose was smashed some though. It worked for my Halloween costume so not much complaint here.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one.</li>
            <li> I bought this Styrofoam head for some knitted hats I make, and it is great. It is a tad larger than the female Styrofoam head that I have. I get more use out of this male head because it has a nice face, and it is tall enough for my hats also.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  Having he facial features and ears on the head help with the items I am making.  It arrived quickly and in good condition.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked for what I needed it for, however had to go a size smaller since no one sells my size.</li>
            <li> I collect Mexican Lucha Libre (wrestling) masks, these styrofoam heads are perfect to display them.     T bought a few and will be getting more in the near future, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and recommend this seller to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great Form, very cost effective. Arrived quick and in good shape.  Will do business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived when expected and was not damaged.  No problems experienced with the seller.   Styrofoam head is realistic enough to serve my purpose.   Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Mr. Male Mannequin Gold Styrofoam Head is helping sell my handmade hats online.  Thank you Mr. Male Mannequin Gold Styrofoam Head!  He works long hours for no pay, does not blink when the camera flash goes off, and does not require a place to lay his gold styrofoam head down at night.</li>
            <li> It was a quality piece.</li>
            <li> This head worked exactly like i wanted to in the intended use in which i wanted it to perform.</li>
            <li> I purchased the foam head to create a mummy head for our Halloween party in Oct., (I start planning and preparing in January).&lt;br /&gt;The foam is perfect. It was well packaged and delivered in a timely manner. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> bought a Styrofoam head. Received a Styrofoam head. I think its broken tho. It doesn&#x27;t move its mouth when it talks to me.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a mannequin head that was realistic. Most of the ones I saw were too idealized or female. I was pleased to find one that had the look that I needed and affordable. This item is well proportioned. The features of the face are clear and the Styrofoam is good quality. I am using it as a food prop in a buffet and will cover it with fondant. It would also serve well for displaying hairpieces and hats.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are always looking for \\&quot;heads\\&quot; for halloween projects and it&#x27;s easy to find the female looking styroheads but the man head is excellent!  Realistic.  Shipped quick too.</li>
            <li> OK, what is up with this head? I ordered this thing to enable me to finish my monster sculpture and man, I gotta say that if this is supposed to be a full-sized man&#x27;s head then I&#x27;m either a giant or I&#x27;m deformed. Or possibly both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the head came in a box with zero packing. It was dirty and the nose was mashed a bit. So, no big deal, right? Because I&#x27;m going to end up covering it in fur and fake eyes anyway. But, what if I had wanted a nice, perfect clean head? Well, I would have been hopping mad, I tell you.  In fact, I was kind of mad, so I slapped the styro head around a bit and then I let a friend start slapping it around as well. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one just so I can come home from work and then slap the ever-living daylights out of this thing when I&#x27;m mad at the boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so then I start looking at it and I realize, this thing is really, really small. I held it up to a friend&#x27;s head and his head looked HUGE next to it. Then I went to a mirror and looked, and yes, again, way too small styro head.  If these other reviewers here are using this to model hats and the like, they are making some tiny little hats that would never fit this huge melon on top of my neck. So, all in all, not a bad head for fake monster-making, but a bit small for anything dealing with reality.</li>
            <li> I was wary because a few negative reviews said they got female heads instead of males, but I needed 2 right away, so I took a chance and figured what the hell... I got both on time, they were males, packed well and worked better for my needs then I thought they would.. Factor in the price, and I would highly recommend both this item and this seller... will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it is a bit small, but seems fine, holds my computer headphones (full size), is pretty stable.</li>
            <li> Was very useful for sculpting from. Do note that the face is not symmetrical. One ear is lower than the other along with some subtle differences in face features from left to right. It is also slightly smaller than the average head, so if you are using this for templates for cosplay or whatever give yourself some room.</li>
            <li> Looks creepy and not too much bigger than a regular manequin head</li>
            <li> It sturdy, exactly what I expected from the description &amp; photos. And can be mounted to bad clamps for it aren&#x27;t included. I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive option if you need a full size head.  It is styrofoam, which isn&#x27;t the most durable material in the world, but it arrived in exellent condition and I&#x27;ve been very happy with how mine has held up.  It has a hole on the bottom for mounting on a stand (I use an inexpensive suction cup stand).  My only complaint about this product is that I find it a little narrow in the ear-to-ear direction and a little long in the nose-to-back-of-the-head direction (perhaps there are people with heads this shape, but not mine).  This is a very minor complaint, and it is still very usable for most purposes.</li>
            <li> This head is creepy and weird. That&#x27;s good because people take notice of something about the product. The size of the head is the clincher, however. It&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Came with some pins for your wig I suppose. I used it for target practice and a hat rack but serves its purpose I suppose.</li>
            <li> I was sent another head by mistake but the company promptly replaced it. \\&quot;Very good\\&quot; customer service. The head itself is sturdy and is about the same size as an adult head ( we use it to display men&#x27;s caps). Their are two holes, one in the bottom to attach to base stabilizer, one in rear for attaching to wall display. This display&#x27;s our hats well without distracting from the product.</li>
            <li> Standard mannequin head..no frills but it&#x27;s perfect if you need a standard model head for a hat, a mask, a pair of glasses, etc...and serves it&#x27;s function to a tee. Happened to fit perfectly with small mask I bought it for, which made me even happier.</li>
            <li> This male head is really small. Circumference around the forehead is 22\\&quot;, or about the size of a small female head. If I wanted a girl head, I would have gotten it. It otherwise fits my needs, so I guess my clients just have fat heads...</li>
            <li> We used this as a mold to create the head of a past us president and it turned out really great! The surface was smooth and the size is just right. It&#x27;s not as big as an acrual human head though. We stick some papers with glue and paibted it. Used fake hair from the dollar store. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and price. We saved the project since everyone said it was very well made! Wil purchase again in case there is a need for another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you think it is.</li>
            <li> The two I ordered came in great condition. Now they display headlamps, sun glasses and hats at my bait shop</li>
            <li> Solid styrofoam head. Not too small but not oversized either. I primarily use these ones as a cheap, lightweight, disposable armature for sculpting masks. Does the job well however sometimes when removing your clay you will pick up bits of styrofoam into your clay but its not that too bad.</li>
            <li> What can I say, i just bought a tritton headset Ax720 and had no place to put them. Recently I saw a video of a guy who owns the same headset as mine and uses a mannequin head as a rack or headset-rest. I thought to myself wow that looks pretty cool so then I decided to buy my own, did my mannequin research, found this one and saw the good reviews for it and then went ahead and purchased it. It was packaged very nicely, with a plastic bubble wrap to prevent damage during delivery transit. Hey you can even use it as your hat rack... Sometimes I put my new era hat first then the headset. :) looks cool like that</li>
            <li> Arrived in a flimsy box, with a flattened nose, various dents on other parts of the head, and dirt marks.  I would return it for another head, but I suspect the next one would arrive in a similar condition.</li>
            <li> This fake head did everything I wanted it to.  It sits there on the shelf, with a hat, perfectly.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a Styrofoam head.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Definitely smaller than an adult male head, but it models hats like a champ.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> I use this to size items I knit and it does the job well. The male foam head is good for most adult-sized heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also leave it on a shelf in my living room when not in use because it creeps people out.</li>
            <li> This was packed well and is just the right size for my male sized hats that I make.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> There was almost no packaging, so the nose was crushed a bit, nearly flat. I can repair it, this may pose a problem to other buyers though.</li>
            <li> My Dad asked me to buy these for him to hold a hat he especially loves and wants to protect its shape. His only complaint is that it&#x27;s tippy. So, being a handy many he created a way to anchor it to a stand. Now, he is happy with it. He says it now works for what he intended.</li>
            <li> one arrived with a tear in the mannequin but it was on top so it didn&#x27;t matter, other than that, they are exactly what we needed</li>
            <li> Was a tad bit smaller than my head but it still works</li>
            <li> As always , the product is as advertised and arrived in extremely fast order!&lt;br /&gt;For those needing these, I have never found a better  more reasonable source!</li>
            <li> I ordered one last week and it arrived damaged. The nose had a big smudge on it that i couldnt get off. I returned to amazon and bought another one of these. it just arrived and the cheek is smashed in as if he just came from a bar fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need this for business so i&#x27;m pretty annoyed that i have to keep returning these. i&#x27;ll order something a bit more quality next time.</li>
            <li> Item was as described.No frills, just a basic styrofoam head. Would have been better if it were bigger BUT the description did give the dimension so really can&#x27;t complain Great prop for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I bought this to display a vintage hat. A little craft paint to accentuate the features&lt;br /&gt;and this guy looks almost human!</li>
            <li> Easy to use for styling your wig. It&#x27;s light so I anchored it to a coffee&lt;br /&gt;can lid, weighted the can and now it&#x27;s solid to work with.</li>
            <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I wish they had a stronger base [ falls over too easily -  minor issue ], they do a good job of storing my caps and helmets. Suggest that you find a square base with small rod to drive up and into bottom of neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little over-price given they are only styrofoam, but some seller may end up offering them for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the way they look on my shelf in my closet or on my dresser. Have been using them for two [2] years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go \\&quot;Amazing-zon\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> It works as a thing to prop your wigs on. The overall head itself is a bit smaller than mine though so I have to compensate for that when I am cutting a wig for a costume. But it&#x27;s still a good size in general.</li>
            <li> Excellent! close to the size of a normal persons head! i used this as a base for a mask and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This product is not as it seems.  The overall circumference is not 22 inches as stated in the adds. It barely reaches 21.  If you have a small wig or hat it may work fine but don&#x27;t expect it do be normal size. One suggestion I read on the internet is to wrap the head in cheap packaging tape until it reaches the size you want.  We tried it and it works ok.  Look messy but does the job.</li>
            <li> I got this for a mannequin I made and it looks great. I will probably put a few layers of paint on it to make it a bit more sturdy. Also, had to laugh when my styrofoam head arrived packaged in a box of... wait for it. Styrofoam!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say that the size of this head is comparable to that of a normal adult.  Secondly, the packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better.  For instance, one of the heads looked like it was in knife fight with gashes on the eyebrow and chin.  The gashes didn&#x27;t really bother me a whole lot since this mannequin head was going to go under some \\&quot;zombification.\\&quot;  Besides the gashes, the head was very much intact which is a huge plus.  All in all, I would definitely purchase this item again!  If you have a retail shop and need to show off some head gear, then this product will certainly do the trick.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely. arrived promptly.  Will be the perfect stand for our \\&quot;pick your brains, a minute\\&quot; appetizer for Halloween party.  Shaving off the top of the head and balancing a brain mold of shrimp on the flat surface.  Using t-pins to affix head yo a sturdy cardboard base.</li>
            <li> I bought a female mannequin head to do a prosthetic and that was a disaster. This is the bomb diggity. The features, though manly, are so much more proportionate to a normal sized head... at least female head. I LOVE THIS HEAD!!</li>
            <li> This guy does an excellent job as the head supporting a mask of Michael Myers sitting on my front porch for Halloween.  He&#x27;s light, hard and durable but still prone to damage if handled too roughly.  Mine came with some scars (dents) on the cheek after being attacked by a spindle of DVD-R&#x27;s packed in the same shipping box.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a copy of the Silver Surfer guy from The Fantastic Four.  Maybe I&#x27;ll paint him silver after he finishes scaring the kids.</li>
            <li> I sell hats and wanted this to display them.  This head is way way too small.  Even the smallest adult size hats we have fall down over the eyes.  I was expecting this to be real life size.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I bought this in addition to a female head to get photos of the hats my mother crochets. He sits well and the hats look great on him.</li>
            <li> Instead of having your headphones be put back in the box from whence they came,  they can be hung around this dummy head. And it really looks good too..........</li>
            <li> Ok, I actually bought this head to make into a mummy prop for Halloween. Instead it sits on my desk, sporting a faux fur hat my Mother could not resist purchasing. Works great - I mean - what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> A little larger and lighter than I thought it would be.  it served its purpose (bald cap station), but it was too light to be taken seriously.  It&#x27;s Styrofoam, so duh, but it&#x27;s lack of weight is still ridiculous.  It works for what it is, but if you have some more money to spend look for something a little heavier.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to display World War II helmets and caps.  This was given as a gift, but suits the purpose very well.</li>
            <li> Hubby wears a hairpiece, and needed something to keep it safe at night or when he isnt wearing it. The styrofoam is well formed, nothing for the hair to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on (meaning it is smooth and has a nice finish).</li>
            <li> well I crochet and  wanted to present my hats  better it does the job , cant complain.&lt;br /&gt;and good price!</li>
            <li> These have been put to good use for a grandson who collects may types of hats, especially western and brim hats</li>
            <li> This may have been a mix up or miscommunication, but I was expecting the male head in the picture to arrive. I ended up getting a female teardrop shaped head, which looks exactly like this product: [[ASIN:B000NBIRII Female Styrofoam Head]]  Even if I wanted this kind of head I would have bought the linked product and saved a few bucks per head. I will probably not be buying from this vender again. If I wanted to buy a female mannequin head I wouldn&#x27;t have bought the one labeled \\&quot;Male\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this foam head is actually not a problem with the head itself... but something you should make note of before purchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this foam head with the intention of putting on display a vinyl Captain America mask that I had gotten for Halloween. I had gotten the mask along with the Captain America shield to wear for Halloween, and once it passed I wanted to put the items on display. I had both the mask and shield being displayed together for several months after Halloween up until I started packing to move and I went to take the mask off the foam head. I had an extremely difficult time getting the mask off of the head because the material of the mask had actually melted the foam head... so much so in certain areas that parts of the mask had actually become embedded in the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, not a problem with the head itself... but the item I chose to put on it. Just keep this in mind when you&#x27;re considering this item for your purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> Perfect product except nose was dented.  Packaging seemed adequate and undamaged, but other items were shipped in the same box and maybe squished it? Impossible to tell if damage happened in transit or was shipped that way.  Since his destiny is to be a Halloween zombie, the damaged nose isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but certainly would be if you were using to display merchandise, etc.</li>
            <li> Baddass blank head can be used for anything!</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous mannequin heads for my halloween props and this one is good quality and doesn&#x27;t have the styro holes like most others do, so it is definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Great price to make a cheap, effective Halloween prop!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really much you can say about a styrofoam head. I bought several of these in both men, women and child sizes so that I have something to model the knitted hats that I have made. They seem to run pretty true to size and they work well for fitting my hats.</li>
            <li> I used it for target practice.</li>
            <li> For the price, I wont complain. It looks much nicer in person. The photo shows all these styfrofoam balls loosely hanging off of the face, but mine didn&#x27;t have that issue at all. It also seems pretty sturdy without the base (Which has to be purchased separately.) I put a ball cap and sunglasses on it just to see how well it would stand up with some forward-heavy weight and it held up like a charm! I will definitely get more of these for my ball cap displays!</li>
            <li> used the head at party and at halloween and to decorate in the bed room wil use over and over</li>
            <li> Despite the other reviews I purchased this to mold a leather mask around. It does seem a bit small like everyone else said however it worked out very well for me. It turns out that this head is just small enough to form leather just right.</li>
            <li> This head is a smaller version of a normal head and I&#x27;ve had to extend my clay masks to make them a normal size. Should be an actual head size.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, great quality. Very fast shipping. I did a lot of searching and found these to be the best price. They were just what I was looking for. If you are storing men&#x27;s hair goods use a male form. I have beards that require styling and female wig forms don&#x27;t have the right chin for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Perfect item for what it is intended for - holding wigs.  I am a writer and I sometimes do book signings dressed up as my favorite character from my &amp;#34;Perception Is Reality&amp;#34; series, BENJAMINICO.  Having this to store my wigs between signings is perfect for me to keep my wigs/beards in great shape.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY BIG. I WANTED IT TO SIZE A MANS HAT AND HALF A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE LATER IT FIT</li>
            <li> I use these in sculpting objects and characters using foam. It just simplifies the creation by using a formed head and saves me a lot of time in carving facial features. These last heads were used in creating Babylonian &amp;#34;garudas&amp;#34;, body of a lion (or bull) and head of a man, with wings. Came out great. These are excellent value for what I use them for. Otherwise I guess just sitting around the house they might make great hat stands too.</li>
            <li> Good quality for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect display piece fo easily transport to craft fairs&lt;br /&gt;and for photographing items for internet display.</li>
            <li> Not life size. Too small.</li>
            <li> I love the way &amp;#34;he&amp;#34; looks in my hats.  Very handsome :)  It makes my hats look more desirable than just laying flat.  Great display and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a great price!  Very cool.  I&#x27;m using this for a Halloween decoration this year.</li>
            <li> Head arrived fast and in great condition, no chips scratches or dents in styrofoam. looks just as it is pictured. We are going to paint him and use him as a Halloween decoration.</li>
            <li> Great for photographing hats I sell online.  A little creepy to him sitting out in the office staring at you so I keep &#x27;Norman&#x27; in the closet.</li>
            <li> Head shape is not realistic, too narrow to use for wigs</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for. XD Great price for this by the way. I say buy it If you need a Male Mannequin White Styrofoam Head... Ok, one more time. Male Mannequin White Styrofoam Head.</li>
            <li> Had nice sturdy features and worked well on my scarecrow for fall.  He was a fireman and his hat fit well</li>
            <li> Got this ridiculously fast, thank you.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, and came in perfect condition.  May be the quiet type, but he&#x27;ll make a good companion....</li>
            <li> Arrived with the nose flattened. Was going to use it for an art project, so this rendered it useless.  Not sure grappling with returns will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Ended up being a bit small, but still worked. just have to remember that if you just use it for hair pieces you will be ok, but for a batman cowl gotta put some talc on it because when it heats up it tends to stick to the inside of the cowl..</li>
            <li> Prefect for my halloween masks</li>
            <li> I will be using this to model my crochet hats and it should be fine for photo work. I would be less satisfied if I was using it in the retail setting only because he&#x27;s  suffering from several good sized dents due I  suppose from poor packaging with other items in the same box.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my halloween batman mask and unfortunately the head is a bit too small to fill it up; my head fills in the mask well.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Is indeed a styrofoam head. The ears are a bit smaller compared to the picture -- which was a bit disappointing.</li>
