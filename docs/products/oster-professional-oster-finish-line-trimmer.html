    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Once adjusted this trimmer is one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I will say that out of the box it did not cut perfectly and had to be adjusted to cut closer.</li>
            <li>The best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>These complement the Oster 76 perfectly.</li>
            <li>He seems happy with it</li>
            <li>I am not a barber and can&#x27;t do haircuts, but  it&#x27;s great for me to use on my husband for trimming around the edges between haircuts.</li>
            <li>prob my own fault!</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;ll come in handy!</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li>These trimmers were not the greatest when they first arrived.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t cut the fine hair but works great on my husband&#x27;s neck when I cut his hair</li>
            <li>Trimmed nice and close, and they still offer closer trimming blades than what came with it, already a close trim.</li>
            <li>I still love my andies they feel more durable, but these osters feel sleek and reliable.</li>
            <li>Very quiet trimmer with a perfect cut!</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;m better off with Andy&#x27;s or Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>but the magnetic and rotary motor trimmers handle this task slightly better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I could get many years of use out of it if Oster included 4-6 guide combs with it...</li>
            <li>and they barely made a sound, and they cut great.</li>
            <li>It was in excellent condition and received it 5 days earlier than expected, overall a great product and now I don&#x27;t have to go pay a barber 12 bucks for a cut!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not what I originally had</li>
            <li>It runs quiet and very smooth, and it very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Works as expected from Oster, always a great product.</li>
            <li>I recommend keeping then lubricated and sanitized with Andis Cool Care.</li>
            <li>Strong and well made this trimmer gets the job done right the first time!</li>
            <li>Great clipper made unuseable by the complete lack of a $2-3 dollar plastic short length guide comb.  </li>
            <li>As a barber student, still learning, I&#x27;m glad I got these so early.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price than what i usually paid for andis.</li>
            <li>The first thing he said is I bought him a quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It has a very quiet motor and comes from a reputable company.</li>
            <li>works only OK for described purpose.</li>
            <li>Overall OK, depending on your use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>Oster&#x27;s CS rep was only able to send me another clipper head for the unit which really made no difference with my issue.  </li>
            <li>Dry shaving is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I own many edgers/outliners, but I frequently travel and have learned that my Andies outliners when connected to a power converter in order to get the European/Pacific/Middle Eastern 220v to a 110v which andies are, they make an extermely loud buzzing sound on the converted current, and I&#x27;ve even had a few blowout.</li>
            <li>but it certainly gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>the price of a big pack of Gillette refills, these clippers work beautifully for shaving, and last years with proper care.</li>
            <li>They are very durable as I would drop it often by accidentally hitting it off my salon station.  </li>
            <li>works very well on longer hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer to have in your arsenal.</li>
            <li>So far these have worked very well.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>With a lot of trimmers &amp; clippers, when I receive a new one, I always take it apart and adjust the blade to make it even closer to the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 6 year old t ouliner cuts sharper than this new trimmer</li>
            <li>the clippers are great, but the seller put misinformation on the web, it said it had two sets of blades one for cutting and one for shaving on a shaving blade came</li>
            <li>This was not made clear on Oster&#x27;s website at all.  </li>
            <li>They will definately stay in my collection with frequent use.</li>
            <li>have had this trimmer and use it pretty much every day for a few months now with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get a new one as a small reward to myself and I felt if I dropped the other one maybe 3-5 more times, the body might crack</li>
            <li>It is a sleeper due to most barbers using the Andis or Wahl outliners, forgetting about this little gem.</li>
            <li>When I got them I was skeptical because they are pretty small but have a good weigth for their size, but I plugged them into the 110v off the converter</li>
            <li>Compared to its competitors, it cuts longer straight hair with ease where the other trimmers will push or move the hair rather than cut it.</li>

            <li> My only solution which I havent attempted yet is sanding the 3/4 inch guide down to as close to 1/4 as I can on a belt sander...</li>
            <li> but it is quitter and smoother in the hand and cuts a bit closer.(after zeroing/adjusting the blade, which is basically just loosening the screws, placing it against a hard flat surface to line up the blade and guard tips and carefully tightening the screws back</li>

            <li> After zero gapping them just a little bit though, they make my line ups a lot cleaner without needing to use the razor.</li>
            <li> You need these to touch up sideburns, back of the neck, and behind the ears.</li>

            <li> I own many edgers/outliners, but I frequently travel and have learned that my Andies outliners when connected to a power converter in order to get the European/Pacific/Middle Eastern 220v to a 110v which andies are, they make an extermely loud buzzing sound on the converted current, and I&#x27;ve even had a few blowout. I&#x27;m told there is a way to adjust this inside the andies but have yet to be shown. So I though I would try the Osters. When I got them I was skeptical because they are pretty small but have a good weigth for their size, but I plugged them into the 110v off the converter and they barely made a sound, and they cut great. I still love my andies they feel more durable, but these osters feel sleek and reliable. They will definately stay in my collection with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Purchased to trim my husband&#x27;s hair at home.  Very quiet trimmer with a perfect cut!</li>
            <li> I have used andis for some time now. however because i am in the military, and always deployed overseas i was never able to use them. A friend told me to try Oster. I was pleased to be able to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price than what i usually paid for andis. So far these have worked very well. They feel and look well built. They have a small hum when i turn them on using the convertor. If with the convertor the andis clippers still sounded like a rocket was taking off. I recommend these to anyone stationed overseas.</li>
            <li> This is not good for edging or shaving it must a knockoff item, it cuts to slow for me, I think I&#x27;m better off with Andy&#x27;s or Wahl&#x27;s. This will scratch you up</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the boyfriend.  The first thing he said is I bought him a quality trimmer.  He uses it all the time and he says it does not nick or cut his bald head.  He seems happy with it and I love the results.</li>
            <li> the clippers are great, but the seller put misinformation on the web, it said it had two sets of blades one for cutting and one for shaving on a shaving blade came</li>
            <li> I purchased the item to shave with and was expecting it to cut closer which  it  did no, it was quieter than the last trimmer I purchase if that makes a difference bottom line I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;This is my third Oster clipper and Oster quality is never disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I still used all three by the way.</li>
            <li> Once adjusted this trimmer is one of the best on the market. It is a sleeper due to most barbers using the Andis or Wahl outliners, forgetting about this little gem. It is quiet and powerful. Compared to its competitors, it cuts longer straight hair with ease where the other trimmers will push or move the hair rather than cut it. Dry shaving is very smooth. I highly recommend this trimmer to have in your arsenal. The only place this trimmer does not excel is when doing a curved outline; it gets the job done well but the magnetic and rotary motor trimmers handle this task slightly better. I will say that out of the box it did not cut perfectly and had to be adjusted to cut closer.</li>
            <li> This is the Rolls Royce of trimmers IMO. It has a very quiet motor and comes from a reputable company. Do yourself a favor and buy this over the Andis.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber and can&#x27;t do haircuts, but  it&#x27;s great for me to use on my husband for trimming around the edges between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Strong and well made this trimmer gets the job done right the first time! The best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> product works well, it&#x27;s not what I originally had but it certainly gets the job done.  would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have used an Oster T-Trimmer similar to this one (standard red colored) for 6 years with no problems.  They are very durable as I would drop it often by accidentally hitting it off my salon station.  I decided to get a new one as a small reward to myself and I felt if I dropped the other one maybe 3-5 more times, the body might crack slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is even quieter than the previous one. Even my clients remark how quiet it is.  The blade is very sharp.  With a lot of trimmers &amp; clippers, when I receive a new one, I always take it apart and adjust the blade to make it even closer to the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this trimmer and use it pretty much every day for a few months now with no problems.  It&#x27;s everything I except from a trimmer.</li>
            <li> works only OK for described purpose. works very well on longer hair. Overall OK, depending on your use. Good luck</li>
            <li> Apparently this model of trimmer is not for &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; or cutting facial hair, it&#x27;s for hair sculpting according to the Oster customer service rep who took my complaint.  This was not made clear on Oster&#x27;s website at all.  The clipper seems well made and I&#x27;m sure I could get many years of use out of it if Oster included 4-6 guide combs with it... But they don&#x27;t.  They do make an accessory kit with 2 guide combs that you can purchase separately, however I had to order it to find out that the included sizes are 3/4 inch and 1/2 inch which is substantially longer than I wear my goatee / beard.  Oster&#x27;s CS rep was only able to send me another clipper head for the unit which really made no difference with my issue.  Great clipper made unuseable by the complete lack of a $2-3 dollar plastic short length guide comb.  My only solution which I havent attempted yet is sanding the 3/4 inch guide down to as close to 1/4 as I can on a belt sander...</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as Andis T -outliner... disappointed with the product.  My 6 year old t ouliner cuts sharper than this new trimmer</li>
            <li> I use it in place of shaving my face, not quite as fast/powerful as the Andis T-liner but it is quitter and smoother in the hand and cuts a bit closer.(after zeroing/adjusting the blade, which is basically just loosening the screws, placing it against a hard flat surface to line up the blade and guard tips and carefully tightening the screws back up[without disturbing the alignment] )</li>
            <li> When I opened box, the box inside was damp, then I opened the clipper box and did not like how clipper came! I had to clean clipper since it was packaged poorly, looking used and stuck in styrofoam.  I turned the clipper on and it has not made any noise! I will use them on Saturday and see how they work! I will get back to you with the performance! I also thought they were a dark purple, prob my own fault! They are black!</li>
            <li> Works as expected from Oster, always a great product. Trimmed nice and close, and they still offer closer trimming blades than what came with it, already a close trim.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.... It was in excellent condition and received it 5 days earlier than expected, overall a great product and now I don&#x27;t have to go pay a barber 12 bucks for a cut!</li>
            <li> I use these clippers to shave my facial hair every other day or so. Regular razors and electrics actually cause my to have many ingrown hairs, which are both painful and gross to look at. These clippers will cut hrs wiskers to just a fraction of a millimeter above the skin, preventing the ingrown hair issue, while shaving close enough to be office-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of a big pack of Gillette refills, these clippers work beautifully for shaving, and last years with proper care. I recommend keeping then lubricated and sanitized with Andis Cool Care. 1 can for personal use will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> These complement the Oster 76 perfectly. You need these to touch up sideburns, back of the neck, and behind the ears. I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer daily as a Licensed Barber and it works well.  It runs quiet and very smooth, and it very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> These trimmers were not the greatest when they first arrived. After zero gapping them just a little bit though, they make my line ups a lot cleaner without needing to use the razor. As a barber student, still learning, I&#x27;m glad I got these so early. I know they&#x27;ll come in handy! The only downside I can think of is when I am lining someone up the cord is a bit weighty, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. I wish it would&#x27;ve came with a blade guard to protect it when I&#x27;m not using them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this edger trimmer to use on my dogs paws. It wouldn&#x27;t cut the fine hair but works great on my husband&#x27;s neck when I cut his hair</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months of use</li>
