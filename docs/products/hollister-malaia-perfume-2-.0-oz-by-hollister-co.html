            <li>it was easy to find on line .</li>
            <li>Not too strong</li>
            <li>You cannot buy atomizers at any store so if you want to use the perfume you will need to put it in a cheap spray bottle from Target.</li>
            <li>Told her to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume off of their website for twenty dollars and free three-day shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this Perfume as a gift, and my friend likes it very much, for me was Ok for the price</li>
            <li>Love love love this perfume, but its about the same price from Hollister</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This perfume reminds me a lot of juicy couture the original perfume.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product came quickly.</li>
            <li>i cant describe it but its not fruity its a very PRETTY smell</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>it smells just like fresh and beachy</li>
            <li>strongly recommend signing up for Hollister’s mailing list because they send new coupons every day.</li>
            <li>Again thanks for delivering a special gift.</li>
            <li>Super glad I finally found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong when applied directly.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>i boughtt the big bottle with the spray pump and its so cute</li>
            <li>:) Hope this helps some of you, I dont want you paying double the price!</li>

            <li>I was very upset</li>
            <li>In fact it was just on same for $25 and free shipping from Hollister a week ago.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume, but you can get the same 2 oz at Hollister itself for only 40 bucks, and it comes with the spray applicator.</li>
            <li>im 20 yrs old</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than what I used to pay, but it was worth every penny to re-create my memories from high</li>
            <li>was sad to learn that Hollister no longer carried this fragrance, but I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had a half of the small bottle a friend gave me and FELL IN LOVE</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this perfume!. Was so sad to find out Holliser stopped selling it. Super glad I finally found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love love love this perfume, but its about the same price from Hollister</li>
            <li> Perfume is great, smells great but there was no atomizer included. You cannot buy atomizers at any store so if you want to use the perfume you will need to put it in a cheap spray bottle from Target. It&#x27;s too strong when applied directly. Tried emailing the company and no response.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my girls favorite perfume, she was very pleased. it was easy to find on line . i used amazon because i have an account and they have a good track record.</li>
            <li> i havent bought it from amazon but i have it already. i had a half of the small bottle a friend gave me and FELL IN LOVE i wore it al lday everyday. its very long lasting smells SO GOOD. it smells just like fresh and beachy i cant describe it but its not fruity its a very PRETTY smell im 20 yrs old and i love it. smells like something for summer deff not winter. i boughtt the big bottle with the spray pump and its so cute but i broke a peice of it when i was moving and it got ALL OVER MY STUFF. so i havent used it in a while lol but it smells good :D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume, but you can get the same 2 oz at Hollister itself for only 40 bucks, and it comes with the spray applicator. :) Hope this helps some of you, I dont want you paying double the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this Perfume as a gift, and my friend likes it very much, for me was Ok for the price</li>
            <li> Glad I found my fav perfume since it was discontinued at Hollister!!! I was very upset but now Im happy!!!</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years I have been wearing Malaia by Holister. Finally found the perfect smelling perfume for me! Then our Holister store quit selling it and closed up shop. I decided to try Amazon. FOUND IT! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, product exactly as described. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than what I used to pay, but it was worth every penny to re-create my memories from high school.&lt;br /&gt;I was sad to learn that Hollister no longer carried this fragrance, but I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost out.....need to re-order soon!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing perfume but too many people are buying them off of amazon which is kind of a rip off. You can go to any Hollister store and buy it for only 40 dollars! I encourage for anyone else thinking of buying this item to just to one of the stores! You&#x27;ll save money!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I am really happy with this purchase. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever! Mine dud include a spritzer thing &amp; works perfect so i dont know why other reviews are bad. Exactly what i was expecting :) BUY BUY BUY!!!</li>
            <li> i love the perfum.. i definetely recommend buying it smell like the actual store when you walk in hollister.. every time i wear makes me feel like im at the beach</li>
            <li> My wife loved it...Told her to enjoy. Why did they quit making this product? Again thanks for delivering a special gift.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly. It came with an atomizer which wasn&#x27;t included in the description, which was an added bonus as I was gonna buy one if it wasn&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> I look online on Hollisterco.com and they wanted 40 + 10 dollars shipping for a 1.7 oz bottle. Go it on here for 45 without shipping plus its a 2oz bottle. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is the favourite one of my wife.She love this parfume.But pitty is, that only way how to get it, is to order it from U.S. We are from Europe, and its hard to get it here.So once again 100% rate for this product.</li>
            <li> This perfume reminds me a lot of juicy couture the original perfume. The notes are Basil - Lavender - Vanilla Bean. It smells really good. Not a perfume I&#x27;d wear at night, this is for the work place, or the beach... something like that.</li>
            <li> Check Hollister. This perfume is not rare or discontinued. In fact it was just on same for $25 and free shipping from Hollister a week ago. Save your money, folks!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, but the one that I ordered seemed faint in the smell. It still good. Just use extra squirts</li>
            <li> Came so fast, and it smells just like it used to! I missed this smell so much, and searched so long and hard for this smell, when I saw it I thought it was too good to be true, but it is, and it is glorious!</li>
            <li> Rip off. Go to hollister and type in Malaia perfume. You get the same amount for about 15 bucks cheaper. It&#x27;s a total of $48.00 including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This is a scam. Kinda.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Wonderful smell&lt;br /&gt;• Not too strong&lt;br /&gt;• Comes with an atomizer to diffuse the scent (I recommend using it)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• This listing is slightly pricey…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best perfume I’ve ever tried. One time, a friend mistook it for a high-end scent and was shocked to find out it came from a mainstream retailer. It smells a lot like the store, and if you want to see how it smells in person visit a Hollister store and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend signing up for Hollister’s mailing list because they send new coupons every day. I purchased this perfume off of their website for twenty dollars and free three-day shipping. This listing is pricey.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had bought at the Hollister store in the past.  This kept me from having to make a special trip to the mall for this item at Christmas!</li>
