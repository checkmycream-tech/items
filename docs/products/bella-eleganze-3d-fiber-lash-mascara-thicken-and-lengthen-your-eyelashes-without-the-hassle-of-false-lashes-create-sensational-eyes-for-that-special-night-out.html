            <li>Nice dupe!</li>
            <li>Love love this mascara!!!</li>
            <li>The results were pleasant because it did increase the volume and length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>so this was a pleasant experiment for me.</li>
            <li>Best thing is that the mascara is so easy to take off at night</li>
            <li>Amazing, amazing, amazing!!</li>
            <li>According to the recipient it isn&#x27;t a good mascara.</li>
            <li>so I question whether or not this is a good look?  </li>
            <li>It was good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I gave this item for Christmas and they loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Younique.</li>
            <li>The gel isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful the good results will continue.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit flaky and clumps, but then the product itself is good.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>mascara and be happy with my own lashes.</li>
            <li>This made my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li>I loved this mascara..</li>
            <li>I loved the 3D fiber lash and went on Amazon to give it another try.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>I found that just one layer is good for me.</li>
            <li>mascara looks gorgeous and stays gorgeous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mascara is good, but it is not AS good as Younique.</li>
            <li>which is good.</li>
            <li>I got it delivered on time and the case it comes in is good.</li>
            <li>They tell me how good it looks on me.</li>
            <li>We all loved the result.</li>
            <li>Loved it because it didn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you read the instructions, remember to seal the fibers with the gel afterwards (and before), and don&#x27;t do more than 2 coats, you can get a gorgeous look!</li>
            <li>and I feel this product works best on clean lashes.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>So easy to use too!!</li>
            <li>but i totally love how beautiful i feel wearing this.</li>

            <li>Overall, this is a great product and would make a great gift given the fancy packaging it comes in!</li>
            <li>I own the younique brand name version of this.</li>
            <li>I liked this Mascara because it did not smudge after repeated applications of eye drops.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it worked any better than a good mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really liked it.</li>
            <li>I wish the fibers would stay in place because they do fall from your lashes and doesn&#x27;t look nice after you applied the make up.</li>
            <li>I really liked the package the items come in, too.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked trying it again though.</li>
            <li>and &amp;#34;how much did you spend because they look &#x27;great&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>Kudos to the merchant as we&#x27;ll for delivering on time and packaging nicely.</li>
            <li>I did enhance it with my own mascara too</li>
            <li>Priced  nicely.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was the absolute best.</li>

            <li>I received a discount on this product to give my honest opinion in return.</li>
            <li>I own the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of the 3-D Fiber Lash and I will NEVER try another brand again</li>
            <li>I have heard many good things about 3D Fiber Mascara.    </li>

            <li>Nice product.</li>

            <li>Very great quality and works very well..</li>
            <li>, I get my own lashes, just improved.</li>
            <li>Apply one layer of your own mascara, then one coat of the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again to set everything.</li>
            <li>I honestly could not be happier..</li>
            <li>My review is an unbiased and honest review.  </li>

            <li>This is my honest unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>I really like how this works, it adds length but not to the point of looking fake,and the thickness it adds is really great!!!</li>
            <li>I liked it but the fibers can get in your eyes at times.</li>
            <li>Was a bit leery about ordering it, but, oh, so nice.</li>
            <li>The case keeps them together and fits nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li>Nice mascara.  </li>
            <li>and she ordered her own immediately after.</li>
            <li>I liked the look</li>

            <li>It was super easy to apply and looked great on!  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I scrubbed my face, put a light coat of my favorite mascara on, and then proceeded to give myself the most incredible lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I call myself the new version of a 2015 elly mae lol,!!  </li>
            <li>Super happy with my purchase</li>

            <li>If your looking for a glamorous look this is a nice mascara:)</li>
            <li>Best of all, there arent any sellers bombarding me with offers and pleas to buy that product.</li>
            <li>but I picked more fibers out of my eyes than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>you can use your own- and use the fiber wand on top of it-</li>
            <li>Just started using this product but so far I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I could not be more thrilled.</li>
            <li>My husband of nearly 20 years even noticed and was very impressed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many directions for fiber mascara and some say use over one coat of your own mascara</li>
            <li>Well my best friend started doing eyelash extensions and she was always having to go in to the salon and have them fixed and have more added, so it was kind of a turn off to me.</li>
            <li>Nice, I wish it had better instructions or suggestions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>This is the best 3D product by far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did this product greatly deliver on its promises of giving me beautiful lashes, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the 10</li>
            <li>I am very excited to see how amazing my lashes look with this product.</li>
            <li>This was recieved very quickly!</li>
            <li>this is quick and nice way and easy of looking great.</li>
            <li>Great for fuller lashes, you have to use it a few times to get used to it, but it works great!</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first that the fibers would get in my eye and irritate when I was trying to brush them on, but everything went great.</li>
            <li>Pretty great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; it goes on great and makes my eyes really pop !</li>
            <li>So go ahead and order you this great mascara and get ready to get compliments !</li>
            <li>It worked great the first couple times then after that, sub par.</li>
            <li>This stuffs great and really works!</li>
            <li>I got compliments all day about how great my lashes looked and how pretty my eyes</li>
            <li>I have very light lashes and it does the job.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to follow the instructions and get an amazing result.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works fine for most people!</li>
            <li>my eyelashes were just as full and beautiful that night as they were when I first put it on!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have never looked like I had that many eyelashes ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It definitely is NOT the best out there!</li>
            <li>Apply my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I love that Bella Eleganze didn&#x27;t skimp on the Font Size!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago.</li>
            <li>the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This mascara is OK.</li>
            <li>and I am still beyond in love.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine another brand working better than this</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>but now I know I can get better results with this one.</li>
            <li>This 3D is better than that Younique version.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>I love the case that this product comes packaged in.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend repeating until you are satisfied with the look of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s maybe $5 more but worked 10x better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff -</li>
            <li>LOVE it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li>I tried my girlfriends younique 3D mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I will not be buying this product again UNLESS thé company sends me another one of better quality.</li>
            <li>Also, the end result looks like &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; (lack of better term)</li>
            <li>Combing does not help because then you will just get more shedding.  </li>
            <li>It does take practice and thinner coats (and I need to be sure to use a lot of the gel coat on top to try and prevent fiber shedding)</li>
            <li>Until you get the hang of it, check your face often! :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this.  </li>
            <li>but I was easily able to brush them off.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and think once I get a hang of the application process, I will love it even more.</li>
            <li>5 stars for the mascara and another 5 stars for the seller. :)</li>
            <li>, glad I did.</li>
            <li>A word cannot explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>this product was ok.  </li>
            <li>This review as written by my lovely wife:  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>STECTION.I CAN GO WITH OUT LOVE</li>
            <li>I WILL OREDER MORE</li>
            <li>but I’m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love the effect without having to use extensions.</li>
            <li>, just make sure you check your face often</li>
            <li>I just recently removed my eye lash extensions and am perfectly happy with this as a summer replacement!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Much better priced than that mlm company.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>and it is okay.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it mostly for my bottom eye lashes to avoid this</li>
            <li>and it still made my eyes look too cute.</li>
            <li>I love the mascara and the fibers do make your lashes look somewhat fuller and longer</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is like a knock off of &amp;#34;Younique&amp;#34; which I like better.</li>
            <li>There is more mascara then the fibers.</li>
            <li>love to use this now  </li>
            <li>I love my lashes after I use this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it ....</li>
            <li>all am really satisfied with it, try it with no doubt, may be</li>
            <li>The fiber is the top pic.</li>
            <li>No irritation and love the case.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC MASCARA!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love what it does for my eyes, but it does flake off.</li>
            <li>Love the product for the price, hope they can improve the quality.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>and i like that you can put as many coats on as you want,</li>
            <li>Absolutely  love  these products ....</li>
            <li>love love love my lashes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But I love making them longer and look fuller</li>
            <li>You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want to.</li>
            <li>so she uses more applications.</li>
            <li>Love this will buy again</li>
            <li>Younique is much better..</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li>I do love the results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this 3D fiber lash mascara by Bella Eleganze.</li>
            <li>I was so hoping that this brand would be more like the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes which doesn&#x27;t smell and fibers stay in place and is $10 cheaper than Bella Eleganze.</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer-</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read the reviews better.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It sure does do what it claims.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the appearance it gives on my eyes but through out the day there is some shedding of the product that falls under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the concept and the appearance it gives.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to learn how to better apply.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even explain how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>You can add as many layers as you want until you get the desired length of lashes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has to be the equivalent because it can&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so it will be interesting to see how many uses I&#x27;ll get from it.</li>
            <li>I got better results with drug store mascara</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It performs precisely as promised!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how it worked-</li>
            <li>so I looked at the directions on the website to make sure I was doing what I was supposed to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I am in love with these 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did run into this promotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>Heres my before and after using Bella Eleganze:)</li>

            <li>Thank you Bella Eleganze Team! :)</li>
            <li>Better than younique lash mascara.</li>
            <li>Drug store brand works better.</li>
            <li>I love the look and they lasted all day without flaking off.</li>
            <li>(I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake,</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this 3D Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li>I love that there wasn&#x27;t a learning curve either</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>but this gives me fuller, better appearing lashes than anything I have tried before  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Younique, Love Alpha, and this brand of fiber lashes, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, when I used this, it made my lashes more pronounced and visible.  </li>
            <li>There are SO many mascaras to chose from - glad</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with just one application you can repeat the steps until you get your desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t rub your eyes or the fibers will fall on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product free of charge for inspection &amp; honest opinion.</li>
            <li>do you probably applied more than two coats.</li>
            <li>Score one big ol&#x27; win for me!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Have had better luck with drugstore brands</li>
            <li>I use an eyelash curler, apply Bella Eleganze mascara, then the fibers, and one more coat of the mascara.</li>
            <li>I love her and mascara</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;Love it&amp;#34;.... i have receive sooo many compliments regarding the way my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I just use make up remover or baby wipes to remove it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I want some more</li>
            <li>This mascara is ok but not</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels on my hair and scalp, love the way it feels in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li>This is better than falsies and getting extensions.</li>
            <li>But the seller is great and thanks to amazon prime</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This product compares favorably to others that sell for much more.</li>
            <li>love that the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li>Was hoping for something more.  </li>
            <li>Younique Moodstruck works &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li>but in so many ways I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascara, but this honestly was the best one I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with fiber lashes  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with my first results but decided to do another coat to see if these Fiber Lashes really would boost the length and thickness with each application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara, the company is very nice and even sent me a free gift!</li>
            <li>I do however like her younique better; it seemed to build more easily on the lash and the fibers didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Not near as good as the Younique 3D Fiber lashes!!</li>
            <li>I loved it at first...</li>
            <li>I now have long beautiful eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li>At one time, I was having them colored at my hair dressers (which is a cool $25 each application), but this product works quit nicely.</li>
            <li>At first, I really loved the effect of this product, but my views have diminished for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it at first.</li>
            <li>Oh this product is so much fun!!</li>
            <li>So worth it!!</li>
            <li>OK bottom line, go ahead and try it and take your time when applying , to me its easy</li>
            <li>It stays put and easily remove able with make up remover.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I expected these results to be as good as they were, but I am really happy they were.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.</li>
            <li>Received my &amp;#34;Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara&amp;#34; and fell in love with the NEW AND IMPROVED Proprietary Formula Sealing Gel that goes on silky smooth and smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend that you try this, you&#x27;ll see just how amazing it is!!&lt;br /&gt;**A product was received to review, all opinions are my own</li>
            <li>Amazing product well worth the money.</li>

            <li>it seems to work great so far.</li>
            <li>The best makeup I&#x27;ve ever spent my money on.</li>

            <li>This is easy and non-clumping.  </li>
            <li>sometimes a fiber will land on my eye, but it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I bought to wear for special occasions but now wear it most of the time.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I can see how this could be an amazing product, but as using this for the first time I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; too well.</li>
            <li>Since this is the first time I have ever used fiber mascara I must say it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I like the effect when I use my own mascara for the first coat and follow-up with the BE system.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this once since I was able to review it free.</li>
            <li>As the seller suggested, I first tried it using my own mascara and just the fibers, until I got used to handling it.  </li>
            <li>so loving how pretty my lashes look while wearing this,usually i get compliments on my hair as it is rainbow in bangs</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the glue only and that alone enhance my lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li>I was kind of sceptical at first and was unsure how it would work.  </li>
            <li>First you have to put on a layer of your own mascara to prep for this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with fiber mascara, and I gotta be honest.  </li>
            <li>I applied my own mascara first..</li>
            <li>I was happy to get this on discount for review because I pretty much have no lashes to speak of.</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s not compatible with contact lenses with those fine fibers.</li>
            <li>I thought were fine using convenience store brands</li>
            <li>They did change their formula a bit but even if they don&#x27;t revert to the previous, it&#x27;s still the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no clumping and fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of my normal mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats.</li>
            <li>fine fibbers gets into the eyes</li>
            <li>My lashes are nice and long and look good with mascara.</li>
            <li>The top photo is what I would wear on a normal day--this is with my own Avon mascara.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of my normal volumizing mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats.</li>
            <li>My lashes went from stubby to long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>For I followed the directions love my eye lashes long, full and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>get eyelashes that look much longer and better!</li>
            <li>Love love love my new lash system</li>
            <li>so this was really cool to see how quickly and easily I could make my eyes poop !</li>
            <li>This mascara does not, and I feel like it looks more natural, which I love!</li>
            <li>Not only is the product fabulous and easy to use, but the seller has great customer service.  </li>
            <li>As you can imagine I do not know very much about makeup, but fortunately for me it must be pretty darn good because she LOVES it.</li>
            <li>i was a huge skeptic</li>
            <li>I enjoy the mascara look but sometimes have fibers fall of under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes my short eyelashes look great and longer.</li>
            <li>but there are great mascara&#x27;s out there that produce a similar look with one tube.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and my lashes look wonderful ....</li>
            <li>light weight wearing lash product I have every tried.</li>
            <li>Totally Fabulous and makes the eyes pop without all the hassle of falsies.</li>

            <li>Really cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly impressed with this product because the fibers are made from green tea.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be adding this to my stash of favorites great job &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>so mascara is always an important part of my routine.</li>
            <li>I only wear there to go out, because for me, at work they are too much lol.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I did, it was definitely the hit of the presents.  </li>
            <li>But compared to how great the product is, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more time to put mascara but its so worth it.</li>
            <li>I got this for FREE and it was ALL the description</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe my lashes could look so fabulous without looking clumpy</li>
            <li>The price difference isn&#x27;t that much, and it is nice to think that the consultant does make some money.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing, it really makes your eyes pop.</li>

            <li>reflection in the mirror revealed Extremely Long and Beautiful Eyelashes</li>

            <li>I have tried a different popular product that was much higher and not as good.</li>
            <li>First you curl your lashes (optional), then you apply your own waterproof mascara (I used Great Lash waterproof), then you carefully layer the fibers and the gel (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara as well, and I like this one better, I will certainly purchase this one moving forward!</li>

            <li>The first day I wore this, it was OKAY.  </li>
            <li>This product changed my mind, it was easy to put on, even though the first application I learned that you need to put the fiber part on right after the gel or you have to apply more gel.....</li>
            <li>I first thought it may be too dark, however; once it was applied, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through 5 different brands of the 3D lash, and this is by far, the best.</li>
            <li>love love this natural looking mascara</li>
            <li>I bought this because my beloved Japanese Scandal Queen fiber mascara is no longer available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I received this today and It was given to me for free as long as I leave my honest opinion, With that said first it comes in a very nice case and a card inside that says you win a free gift not sure what it is</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s printed on High Quality Glossy Paper and the Instructions were Very Easy to Understand and Follow.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and my eyelashes appear to grow right in front of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Saving for special occasions.</li>
            <li>You can wear this every day if you want, but I prefer to stick to the special occasions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it every day, just for a special night out.</li>
            <li>And the price is right for just about anyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li>I love beauty products and I am always looking for new things what will beautify me!!</li>
            <li>This product is also waterproof but it isn&#x27;t hard to remove at the end of the day which is awesome!</li>
            <li>The application is easy and the Transplanting Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Natural Fibers.</li>
            <li>The aplication is easy and the Transplating Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Moodstruck Natural Fibers.  </li>
            <li>Ok ladies , I try everything that the beauty industry puts out , some works some makes us think it does, My honest opinion is this mascara isn&#x27;t a miracle to having long lashes like the stars , However</li>
            <li>Love the look and it really does add length and fillings to lashes....</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>longer after but not as full as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the 3D mascara, it made my eyelashes look so much thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true..</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>it does just as much for ya as a $5 mascara from walmart no matter how many coats you do.</li>
            <li>Just as good as Younique. will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>but I received a full refund TY</li>
            <li>My eyes looks awake and full.</li>
            <li>Full with no clumping.</li>
            <li>so I did not have to pay full price.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous because many people got the fibers in their eyes, causing irritation.</li>
            <li>I love the product but the fibers do not work real well with contacts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper 3d fiber lashes that pulled the mustard much better on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I liked the look of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer!  </li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s easy to apply, gel, fiber, gel, done....</li>
            <li>This is good for a special event but it is too many steps for everyday</li>
            <li>I also had a great experience with their customer service due to packaging error.</li>
            <li>This product really works and does take 5 applications like the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands do, to look full, long and Beautiful.</li>
            <li>I like this product, the gel or sealant mascara goes on first which I love because on its own it already makes my lashes seem longer, once it has been applied the second step is the fibers.</li>
            <li>I love trying new mascara and was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>The gel dries quickly....</li>
            <li>To my surprise the two steps go hand in hand and were rather quick.  </li>
            <li>, the only thing different now is the awesome look my lashes have.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them back and explained that while I did love the mascara, I wish there was just more of it in the tube.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for those big beautiful eyes of their youth!</li>
            <li>Second time at the end I put a coat of my regular mascara to hold in place all well best one I have brought</li>
            <li>It dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and ahead of time it estimated delivery</li>
            <li>However, I liked this fiber lash mascara more than I had expected.</li>
            <li>but false eyelashes never looked good or felt good on my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to apply, looks so natural and complements my lashes beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a mascara that gives me a full and long-lasting look, and this product does that exact thing!</li>
            <li>On the positive side.. it lasts all day and curls easily.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would HIGHLY</li>
            <li>Also, I highly recommend Bella Eleganze as a top seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better than eye extensions which are high maintenance,</li>
            <li>one of my favorite YouTubers (#ColleenBallingerEvans) highly recommended it, so I bought two.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how Bella Eleganze is able to offer such a Premium Product at the affordable under $25 asking price, but I do know that I will definitely be placing another order and happily paying the full asking price when I run out!&lt;br</li>

            <li>My lashes were defined and looked very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that this one had such amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>It IS better than regular mascara but nowhere near as good as the younique brand.</li>
            <li>MAYY ZING!it makes my long eyelashes look so good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake or give me raccoon eyes at the end of the day, they look just as fresh and full as when applied.  </li>
            <li>and I am pretty certain I&#x27;ll get better with technique in time.</li>
            <li>The substance is light and VERY easy to remove especially in the shower.</li>
            <li>will highly recommend it to every woman I know and order it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for producing such a great product.</li>
            <li>I personally love this new wave of gel mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen lots of new products hitting the market advertising the stunning growth of lashes.</li>
            <li>My new favorite item in my makeup box.</li>
            <li>It does not flake, which is very important to me as I wear contacts, and is easily removed with my regular face wash.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is so easy to apply and really brightens up my eyes.  </li>
            <li>, it was easy for me to use straight from the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and fast to come off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to say i love this product ,it was fast and easy to use .The directions are simple and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li>This works really well!!  </li>
            <li>&amp;quot;I&#x27;ve used this product several times and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>In fact, I was amazed at how pretty the packaging was!</li>
            <li>This mascara does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do!</li>
            <li>AND... the fiber brush fell apart the first day I started using this product!</li>
            <li>This is one terrific product I love it  !</li>
            <li>Great for going out or everyday use.</li>
            <li>They look real, feel light weight and not clumpy.  </li>
            <li>It is so light on my lashes and makes them look so much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li>, there was definitely a difference in an amazing way.</li>
            <li>I have to say these are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked this product</li>
            <li>Now I can say after a whole day wear does not look as good as it did when I initially put it on, but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the savings.</li>
            <li>I used it several times and get so many compliments on my eyelashes since they are light and thin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Love this product so far.</li>
            <li>so I have a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth you dollars.</li>
            <li>if it was on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe service, I&#x27;d subscribe as I will be using this as I can&#x27;t afford my lash extentions any longer, this is a nice second choice to that!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and loved it so much that I bought a second as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I am not great at applying make-up, but this was awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I bought an extra set for my sister to give as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Wow finally found a great product that does enhance my lashes lady&#x27;s please try this</li>
            <li>They are worth the what $25.</li>
            <li>another attempt and only lightly sealing the fibers I was satisfied with the look.</li>
            <li>Younique is by far a much better product.</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting</li>
            <li>I only leave reviews if I absolutely love a product or if it has serious issues, and this one is an awesome makeup addition.</li>
            <li>Super drama and no fake lashes or glue to fuss with.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Also the customer service here is A+++, very prompt and friendly.</li>
            <li>I got this due to a youtuber, Colleen ballinger, who said it was really good</li>
            <li>I had been using falsh lashes- and never got them right.</li>
            <li>Just received this and tried it right away</li>
            <li>apply the fibers right away and keep alternating to desired look.</li>
            <li>Right after applying the product the fibers also flake under my eyes</li>
            <li>Comes right off in the shower too.</li>
            <li>My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li>Fiber mascara is all the rage right now so of course I had to give it a try</li>
            <li>and the right has 1 coat of the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>He noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>However Bella Eleganze 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is nothing but positive for me!</li>
            <li>After writing my first review, I realized that thé product was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Love it great product and costs much less than younique for same results (I&#x27;ve tried younique.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to get it right, but looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I certainly would not pay the full price for this item.  </li>
            <li>But it was easily removed with a little coconut oil and warm water.</li>
            <li>love that it does not matter how many coats that you apply, it does not weigh your lashes down.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants fuller/longer lashes!!!</li>
            <li>This mascara does what it promises; I am thrilled with the long lashes it provides.</li>
            <li>The end result is good, but not worth the hassle for every day.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect for the color to be as bold and dark as it is so that was a happy unexpected affect.</li>
            <li>I love that this came in a nice hard shelled case.</li>
            <li>I remove all makeup with just pure Vaseline !</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get it right the first time</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff, very natural looking dramatically long eyelashes..recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li>The mascara is so easy to apply and WOW at the difference it makes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheaper, similar products that were far superior to this one.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and so easy.</li>
            <li>This product is every bit as good for half the price)</li>
            <li>directions were clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my lashes full and long!</li>
            <li>I am liking this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to apply and if you can apply mascara you can apply this going down the rd.</li>
            <li>It took a week or so to get use to the application (one eye always came out better than the other at first) but now that I have had practice I can make both eyes look fabulous in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>Product is good - fibers are a little hard to work with but the result is great.</li>
            <li>Inside the appealing box was a sturdy and high quality hinged case with the 2 vials clearly</li>
            <li>and wow there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>First, you apply the gel, then you apply the fibers, then you seal in the fibers with the gel.</li>
            <li>I bought a metal lash comb and that comes in handy though it is really not a clumpy formula.</li>
            <li>this product I was able to enchance what I have left of my eye lashes to their fullest.</li>
            <li>First product I have used that lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li>So the next time I used it I tried it that way and so much better.</li>
            <li>First you put on a coat of the sealing gel</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of mascara</li>
            <li>First, you put on your mascara.</li>
            <li>This one does stay on very well!</li>
            <li>I suggest to put on ur favorite regular mascara</li>
            <li>first then the transplanting gel, fiber.</li>
            <li>Row 3 is first application of the 3D Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li>Sure enough this is the easiest,</li>
            <li>The first time, I purchased this for $17.99   2 weeks ago I purchased it for $20.99.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to use it</li>
            <li>u first try it.</li>
            <li>Used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be back to buy more of this product.</li>
            <li>When I first received the package I opened it up from it’s fancy case, I had no clue you had to apply in two steps.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do once you follow the instruction.</li>
            <li>After the first attempt I got these results.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper too!</li>
            <li>these fell short in so many areas.</li>
            <li>If i want more of an &amp;#34;everyday makeup&amp;#34; look I only apply each tube once..</li>
            <li>Gave me an eye infection first use.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>I bought this mascara and instantly fell in love upon first usage.</li>
            <li>I have short eyelashes and felt like I could get a lovely length with younique, not with this brand.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, only needed about 2 coats and it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Love that my lashes grow instantly.  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments, and even was asked if I have extensions while having a facial.  </li>
            <li>The application process is simple- logically, the more you add the clumpier it will look.</li>
            <li>My daughter used this product and it really worked, her eyelashes looked long and beautiful, would definitely buy again..</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind digging out fibers from your eyeballs occasionally, you will love it.</li>
            <li>First 3-D</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I have never used fiber mascara before so this was my first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li>I was considering getting latisse, but since I have blue eyes this is a better alternative for the price.</li>
            <li>When applying this I first off noticed the application brush.  </li>
            <li>I love how you can keep applying to get different effects!</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my eyes has been burning and itching.</li>
            <li>Since then I have found that if I put another coat of regular mascara on top of the fibers it helps to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li>This is the first 3D fiber mascara that tells you where and what the fibers are made of.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>this gives the same effect even better then lashes</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve not used this type of mascara system, it&#x27;s a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li>This mascara really opens up your eyes!</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and I tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying fiber mascara</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>First, you put on your mascara.</li>
            <li>Once I add some cat eye liner and shadow I will be able to achieve the va-voom look I want for our next trip to Vegas.  </li>
            <li>So, this is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>First time i used it the fiber lashes it got in my eye</li>
            <li>Would get a higher rating but it does flake all day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was a bit clumpy</li>
            <li>Make sure you coat your lashes well with it, or the fibers will fall out, which left me picking at my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using fiber mascara</li>
            <li>I received lots of compliments on my eyelashes the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love this product but only gave it four stars instead of five because I am a contact wearer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been going back and forth for a while now trying to decide if wanted to give it a try or not, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I actually like this a lot more than the younique version.</li>
            <li>I do put a coat of mascara on first the follow with the steps per the package.</li>
            <li>This fiber mascara works really well!</li>
            <li>Put the sealer on first.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in trying a fiber mascara after my friends posted about another brand on facebook.</li>
            <li>saying how pretty my eyes are.</li>
            <li>Sure, it makes your lashes appear longer, but only for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was pretty underwhelmed by this lash system.</li>
            <li>Glad I only paid a $1.00 for it.</li>
            <li>it is summer here and Hot</li>
            <li>I played with it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>I followed others recommendations and applied a coat of my fav mascara first, L&#x27;Oreal Manga Lash.</li>
            <li>First time trying 3D Fiber mascara and before purchasing, I had to read the reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I used the product exactly per instructions)</li>
            <li>but my eyes were pretty irritates throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying fiber lash.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;this product is wonderful at giving me that false eyelash look!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it makes my eyelashes look super long when I don&#x27;t have much it begin with.</li>
            <li>Stunning new &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; that seem perfectly natural.</li>
            <li>It does take practice to apply this mascara, its a two step process and you want to make sure to apply the fibers while the gel is still wet and seal it again quickly with the gel.</li>
            <li>Not as good quality as buying direct from company..maybe old..kinda dry.</li>
            <li>I got a lot on my eyes and that&#x27;s how I also knew it made a difference because no one usually complimented my lashes as much but even if they didn&#x27;t , I love it and will buy again!!</li>
            <li>Sorry if this review sounds too good to be true but this is seriously the greatest cosmetic to come out on the market in years!</li>
            <li>My lashes looked triple the thickness, the color was a beautiful dark black and it was extremely easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Amazing product...just be careful not to get fibers in your eyes!</li>
            <li>Love this product  works great,stays on, and definitely made my lashes lush and full.</li>
            <li>I applied 3 layers of fibers+gel; my lashes are straight and pretty short, so I&#x27;m better off appling 2 layers</li>
            <li>Incredible if you want a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I used it just a few times so far and each time I got great results.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to and it won&#x27;t completely replace my regular mascara but for a more dramatic look this is perfect!</li>
            <li>These are just as good as the more expensive 3D fiber mascaras.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive stuff IMO</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara, no clumps, makes them fuller and much longer, and it washes off 10x easier than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Got so many compliments about my eyelashes being so long and pretty.</li>
            <li>Tried this (by the way; it wasn&#x27;t as much as they quoted on the show) and I am so amazed I can&#x27;t feel it, but it sure is different.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price,  much better than what other brands charge!.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brand off of Amazon and was super surprised at the transformation!</li>
            <li>Since the reviews were all positive, I went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li>This makes my eyelashes look full and long, just make sure you follow the directions clearly for optimal results.</li>
            <li>First of all, the fibers do not stick to your lashes (no matter how much gel you use) I feel like it literally does nothing but irritate the hell out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have since learned that many of these kits are fakes from China, which may explain the long ship time.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes seemed pretty much non-existent after chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great purchase and cheaper than the other 3d lash mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li>works really well, surprisingly...wasn&#x27;t expecting much!</li>
            <li>and I pretty much just went through life with my mascara etc.  </li>
            <li>I love having long thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>and I was okay all night long.  </li>
            <li>but if you feel like spending the extra time on your lashes you can get a nice full and long look.</li>
            <li>but its on its way:)  i right away put this on and i was simply amazed by how it went from having super thin almost invisible lashes to full plump lush lashes really nice,  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that really works for me -  gives me very long, full looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake off all over my face and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling like I&#x27;ve stuck tiny needles into them like some kind of medieval torture routine.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this made my eyelashes look so long!</li>
            <li>This may not be the best mascara for everyone but in my opinion it does a better job than all the other expensive name brand mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love long eyelashes!</li>
            <li>But like I said, that&#x27;s a problem easily solved by simply taking your make-up off every night.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to try rather than the much more expensive brands and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This mascara isn&#x27;t as easy to take off as basic mascaras are, but I use abolene, vaseline, or makeup wipes to do the trick.</li>
            <li>The instructions that came with it are simple and easy to follow and getting the fibers off is a sinch.</li>
            <li>My eyes are super sensitive and often tear from makeup, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with allergies or irritation.</li>
            <li>, however I can wear it for five or six hours at the most, as the fibers begin to dry and get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mascara and spooly come in a nice black case.</li>
            <li>The second time making sure I applied the fibers very quickly so the gel didn&#x27;t dry and</li>
            <li>Definitely far from waterproof and is super clumpy</li>
            <li>Awesome mascara for thick and long lashes</li>
            <li>Love this much, makes my eyelashes long.</li>
            <li>the first one I bought was great the second one I purchased was dried out.</li>
            <li>Great the first application, dried out and goopy on the 2nd application, also flakes off during the day</li>
            <li>The setting gel is a good mascara alone, you put this on first and while it is still wet, you put the fibers on and then put the setting one back on...</li>
            <li>Lashes do look super long and full, just a matter of practice to achieve the look you want.  </li>
            <li>never before used a 3D Fiber Mascara, my expectations were not very high, however, I don&#x27;t think I have ever used the word WOW as much as I did when I received this product and opened the box!&lt;br /&gt;My initial WOW came out of my mouth as I removed the Super Sturdy and Attractive, Textured Case with Bella Eleganze&#x27;s Name Embossed in Gold from the outer box.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The best part is that my eyelashes do not look fake or lumpy, they look very natural.</li>
            <li>The trick to not getting fibers all over you is to apply a coat of gel from the bottom to top of your lashes and apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look super full and long!</li>
            <li>The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and (as a bonus) it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my eyes!  </li>
            <li>I did apply a second coat with the same steps and was floored at how amazing it</li>
            <li>We have a huge commercial farm and</li>
            <li>I really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I really like 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara really does seal so no embarrassing flakes or smudges.</li>
            <li>but it was too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real or one from the Too Faced line.</li>
            <li>With They&#x27;re Real, I have to apply maybe two or three coats.</li>
            <li>It is really high quality!</li>
            <li>and it really works, but I noticed after an hour or so my eyes felt irritated.</li>
            <li>but this one really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>if price really matters that much-</li>
            <li>Much.</li>
            <li>I think it requires too much effort for an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And I really like the look I had get when I wear it</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to purchase and to really make it pop</li>
            <li>Application takes 5 minutes, and then lashes aren&#x27;t much longer than with my Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a product issue as much as it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li>No matter how much gel i put on.</li>
            <li>I really like the outcome of my lashes after using it.</li>
            <li>It really makes your lashes look thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>I use about 3 coats and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how they do it...  </li>
            <li>THAT MUCH</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a younique cosmetics consultant and I bought this to try it against our brand and this is absolutely garbage.</li>
            <li>SO SO MUCH PEOPLE LOOK AT ME</li>
            <li>This really worked for me too</li>
            <li>I really saw no difference after using it for over a week.</li>
            <li>I became very clumpy.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can work that out because I really like this product.</li>
            <li>not so much that I would repurchase this again.</li>
            <li>Hurt my eyes so much by the end of the day it felt like I had sand in my eyes.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the fiber tube, mine already ran out.</li>
            <li>Mascara didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li>And some mascara and eye shadows really irritate my eyes so that they watered for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it is light and it does definitely makes your lashes look darker and longer, BUT not thicker!  </li>
            <li>When you remove, I use Vaseline and a Q tip and gently rub off .</li>
            <li>My lashes were very clumpy and did not lengthen.</li>
            <li>My lashes looks so much longer.</li>
            <li>It adds incredible volume Without the fake lash troubles.  </li>
            <li>so I was not using it very often.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>but this one really doesn&#x27;t make me do that</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this mascara</li>
            <li>I expected more of this product.</li>
            <li>This irritated my eyes so much that I had to flush them out and put ointment in my eyes to keep my eyes from feeling like they were burning.</li>
            <li>The travel case is very durable too.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars as I did not notice too much difference in the length of my lashes, just the fullness of them.</li>
            <li>really does work and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>be careful how many coats you put on though</li>
            <li>It stays on without irritation and really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>so I was ready to try it when it came.</li>
            <li>Removes much easier than anticipated</li>
            <li>This really works well.</li>
            <li>I really got, &#x27;movie star&#x27; lashes.</li>
            <li>It is very non-toxic smelling, and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very drawn to getting eyelash extensions, but I&#x27;ve been too scared.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Repeat as much as you want until you get the desired look.</li>
            <li>haha   </li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I like product, works well, really Makes lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>

            <li>Very flaky....</li>
            <li>You can really build with it and &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; your lashes to look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>This one is not clumpy and not too much fiber.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really just wanted you see what it looked like.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>really works, my lashes look longer and thicker</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to not get it to clump so much.</li>
            <li>I will have pictures ready this weekend so everyone can see.</li>
            <li>I accidentally got this in my eye and could see straight for two days...</li>
            <li>Very comparable to Younique.</li>
            <li>My lashes look so much thicker and longer ...</li>
            <li>I really like what this does to my eye lashes and all my friends are coming over to see what it is.</li>
            <li>It really does make your lashes look fuller</li>
            <li>when really it&#x27;s just the mascara.</li>
            <li>and I was very leery about trying this.</li>
            <li>I Really like this product.</li>
            <li>flakes way to much, all day&lt;</li>
            <li>I was really scared to try this mascara</li>
            <li>It really lives up to its videos and youtube trials.</li>
            <li>and thought I&#x27;d see if price really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have really light lashes and have tried several extending mascaras and none of them compare!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help that much with the lash length and would clump up.</li>
            <li>could also use a spooley after applying fibers before the 2nd coat of gel for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>went from little eye lashes to beautiful long lashes!</li>
            <li>Would be great if this replaced false or lash extensions.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone wanting great looking lashes without the hassle of glue and false lashes.</li>
            <li>but it actually doesn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to just fish it right back out with a tissue.  </li>
            <li>Make my eyelashes so long and full!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of fiber lash mascara and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t love having to order through a distributor.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had the chance to try out the new 3D fiber trend that&#x27;s been going around</li>
            <li>Also, I live in Florida and it&#x27;s hot and humid, and this mascara didn&#x27;t smudge or irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Although the results were good, I&#x27;m not sure they were significantly that much better than my traditional mascara which costs about fives times less.</li>
            <li>It takes a few coats for my desired length but worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>thought I would get it all over my face since Im very clumsy but its very precise and easy to apply</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and it last all day with the initial application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other type of fiber lashes and wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>On special occasions, I apply several coats to make my eyes stand out even more, but the first coat definitely makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is great for adding length to the eyelashes which is what I wanted, Also if you want a dramatic look I would suggest using an additional mascara before applying this one.</li>
            <li>Lashes look amazing and it doesn&#x27;t flake off and end up on your cheek 1/2 way through the day so long as you seal it after the last fiber application.</li>
            <li>( Hahaha, I said I was older).</li>
            <li>but I brushed it out with a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li>In fact, it gives me full lashes, easy to apply and last all day long.  </li>
            <li>My original plan was to use only on special occasions and or going out, but I can&#x27;t resist, I use it daily.</li>
            <li>Only had to do one layer and they came out amazing and long!</li>
            <li>Not something I use as a daily mascara, but works for those special occasions.  </li>
            <li>But subsequent uses, the fibers fell right off the brush!</li>
            <li>The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my contacts even thought it said it was not recommended for them.</li>
            <li>So very sad that I thought I had found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>They look pretty natural too, except it looks like you just put a bunch of mascara or something.</li>
            <li>The only warning I have is that if you wear it for a full day, but the end of the day there will be fibers on your face or under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I was very wrong, this mascara is the BEST!</li>
            <li>Works better than the average mascara</li>
            <li>I am hoping that when I need a refill they will have another coupon on this product because I will differently be ordering this again; even if I have to pay full price.</li>
            <li>Use on special occasions, gives nice dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>Works much better than other fiber lash mascaras!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone that needs some new mascara!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, love the results, long thick lashes!</li>
            <li>Less than most.</li>
            <li>Up cclose it looked kind caked on but form farther away and in photos my eyelashes looked fantastic and no need for fake eyelashes here.</li>
            <li>I had never used fiber lash mascaras, but when I read the reviews on this particular one, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>She said she does one coat regular mascara-gel-fibers-gel-fibers-gel-and one more regular mascara coat.</li>
            <li>Decent mascara, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Better than the more expensive name brand.</li>
            <li>For some reason my lashes got shorter as I got older.  </li>
            <li>It really does help with the thinning lashes, making them look full and long.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am older.</li>
            <li>I used to thicken my lashes with baby powder--this has the same effect only a thousand times better.</li>
            <li>My  4 dollar Wet and Wild mascara works better than this 30 dollar scam.</li>
            <li>It ends up giving a decent mascara look but it is not revolutionary by any means.</li>
            <li>Super clumpy and fuzzy and was constantly shedding and getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li>If you put it on right it doesn&#x27;t look fake like other brands, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Washed off super easy with a swipe of Avon&#x27;s eye make up remover, then plain old soapy water.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews for products, but this one really made an impression on me.</li>
            <li>Well, at least the fibers can be used w/own/other mascara for added volume and a bit more length!  </li>
            <li>These fiber lashes are the new cool faze and after actually using them I understand WHY.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this mascara; it makes my lashes look super long.</li>
            <li>, I think it depends on how much you apply and how long your lashes are naturally, mine was always full and not long or short so this does add more volume</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the high $$$ that some of my friends were paying for their YOUNIQUE fiber mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly as I think you will also.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Plus, the packaging is high end quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li>but every time I wear this, my family or friends doubt that I&#x27;m high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It works wonders and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I left one lash without and applied The Lash on the other and it was AMAZING the difference.</li>
            <li>The usually clump very easily and flake off.</li>
            <li>applying these Fiber Lashes you want to do it quick to make sure the first coat of Transfer Gel is still wet to apply the green tea fibers.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the little case it comes in</li>
            <li>Yes, applying them is a little more time consuming than using JUST mascara -</li>
            <li>I put on a little more gel after the fibers and it holds up all night.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;You can make your lashes as long as you desire!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My most recent bottle doesn&#x27;t have the original fresh scent and instead smells more like tar :(</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply but has to be reapplied once or twice during the day due to the fibers falling off.</li>
            <li>Product returned due to having a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look long and full, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>but most of all makes them look very thick and full.</li>
            <li>I also really love how the tubes come in a cute little black snap close case so I can carry this with me wherever I want!</li>
            <li>And even if I didn&#x27;t like the product so much (which I clearly do), I would still recommend this brand based solely on their customer service.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately for me, it wasn&#x27;t a great match.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and they don&#x27;t look like fake eyelashes, they look great.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I really like this product.</li>
            <li>All I really can say is wow.</li>
            <li>This duo worked OK for a few weeks, then seemed like the fiber tube was all used up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple.</li>
            <li>Row 1 are normal lashes.</li>
            <li>Row 2 is normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I love how my lashes look without feeling heavy or clumpy looking.</li>
            <li>It flaked off all day - I followed instructions exactly and after 2 hours it would start flaking off and continue during the day - left you feeling very paranoid and had to keep checking - won&#x27;t be using this</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as 3d by Youngique, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>and I have to tell you - for a normal day of running errands</li>
            <li>a normal person&#x27;s reaction would be to this product.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying i am obsessed with finding the BEST mascara to make my thin and light lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because I have watery eyes and it smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li>I normally like to brighten up the lashes I have and call it a day.</li>
            <li>I have tried it twice, thinking I possibly didn&#x27;t follow the directions very well the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple.</li>
            <li>As long as these tubes last a couple months, I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>all the fibers had fallen off and her lashes looked normal again.</li>
            <li>I am now a firm believer, I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I applied the fibers, I got a few clumps, but was able to fix that no problem.</li>
            <li>I can now skip trying to fuss with false lashes and still have big, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>the application - gel is fine, but the other is just a bunch of clumps.  </li>
            <li>but I would recommend applying less fibers to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>soon as I applied the Sealing Gel to my right eye, I could already see that my non existent lashes were not as non existent as I was led to believe when using my regular over the counter mascara products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone.</li>
            <li>You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone.</li>
            <li>Then, I applied the 2-step Bella Eleganze mascara, per the instructions, only on my right eye for comparison purposes.</li>
            <li>gives me very long full looking lashes,does not flack off all</li>
            <li>super mega long.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes super long</li>
            <li>I have alright lashes, they aren&#x27;t super long or anything</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product because I had good results with younique fiber lashes, however, this product has several negative issues.</li>
            <li>I figured I would try something new.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this new fiber lashes through a promotional price to see if it works.</li>
            <li>I just told him it was new mascara</li>
            <li>but I have rosacea (this is new)</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Love my new hairbrush.</li>
            <li>the fact that I have vision issues and when I use conventional over the counter mascara products it usually ends up on my nose and eyelids, and I had all but given up on having attractive eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really no better than a very cheap dollar store mascara.  </li>
            <li>You do have to work quickly, but your lashes do not clump and they are very long.</li>
            <li>I never leave my house without, this was really easy to apply and less time.</li>
            <li>A cheap imitation of Youniques Fiber Lashes.  </li>
            <li>Always put a final coat of the gel or regular mascara on to secure the fibers in place.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and worried the fibers would bother me, but so far not so much.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and was worried about that also, but the mascara does not seem to irritate my eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you want a very natural look, use THIS mascara by itself.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive eyes and was worried about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also takes a lot of effort to get a long eyelash effect if you have short lashes like me, so you might as well be better off spending $20 on buying some really good pairs of fake lashes that you can re-use a couple of times.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used fiber mascara, I have about 10 different mascaras and not one of them has come close to giving me longer fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li>I first put a coat of my regular mascara</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The only thing that I&#x27;ve run into (and its really my own fault for being lazy) is that you have to make sure you take it off every evening because if you leave it on, the next morning you will be clumpy and it&#x27;s harder to get off after sleeping with it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s legit the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>I apply my regular mascara first, then the gel -</li>
            <li>First you apply the gel to one set of lashes only.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to come across an extreme coupon for this product.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use but only if I I am willing to put up with some eye irritation if the flakes fall in.</li>
            <li>I only had issues with the fibers falling off onto my face the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as younique...case and everything but way cheaper.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used any mascara that wasn&#x27;t the traditional mascara.  </li>
            <li>I only needed the first swipe with the fibers.</li>
            <li>I have pretty short lashes</li>
            <li>I was a bit unconvinced of this product&#x27;s claims with the recent push of fiber mascaras but this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>the 3rd time with a coat of mascara first.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t ever have to worry about getting your lashes fixed at a salon again!</li>
            <li>no smudge at all  for those of you who are not sure, try it you will love it..</li>
            <li>all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I went ahead and applied a coat of my regular mascara first, then the sealer, then the fibers, then the sealers.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable improvement with first application compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look natural while standing out!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral.</li>
            <li>actually could see my eyelashes which made it very easy to apply the Green Tea Fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This  removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this for everything, but especially any event or special occasion, especially the upcoming holidays!</li>
            <li>I have thin short eyelashes and this worked amazingly on me!</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li>It makes your eyelashes longer in a few seconds and easy to use</li>
            <li>Less expensive and works great!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these 3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for everyone who wants natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li>It works really well for 2-3 weeks, and it actually makes my super short Asian eyelashes look a lot longer!</li>
            <li>The second one leaves little bits of lint like material around my eyes (mostly underneath) and I have to &amp;</li>
            <li>Tubes feel cheaply made, the gel doesn&#x27;t&#x27; seem wet enough to hold the fibers.</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>WOW was when I applied the product!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>and we just couldn&#x27;t get it to come out looking natural.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think it will be in my everyday ration since my daily look is more natural.</li>
            <li>This product looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Younique and has the same effect.</li>
            <li>The following day I ordered the product through Amazon at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>The fiber lashes are absolutely what they say they are I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li>WOW, tried to take a picture to show everyone, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>They look natural and no clumps.</li>
            <li>I look at my husband&#x27;s lashes and just wonder why I can&#x27;t have those naturally.</li>
            <li>I must have just gotten unlucky &amp; got an old batch.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The gel is stringy and the fibers don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>I do have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>no problem, easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have an issues with fibers falling off into my eyes, and my normally sensitive eyes showed no irritation with this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, spend the extra $5.00 and get the real 3-D Fiber-lash.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes fuller and they&#x27;re natural.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and my eyelashes have thinned,</li>
            <li>Your eyelashes will definitely appear much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>I would have stuck with the fiber lash if it at least made my lashes look fuller/longer, but i get better results with just the L&#x27;oreal and Revlon mascaras.</li>
            <li>It does not give you tarantula looking lashes and it leaves your lashes looking like a natural lash falsies look.</li>
            <li>i actually change my mind and like it as much as younique.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, too.</li>
            <li>I am 82 years old and I tried this product, and I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>Just spend the extra cash and buy Younique the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about make up and have to do a lot of experimenting with different products, which can get costly.</li>
            <li>everyday wear, I go with a light application of mascara.</li>
            <li>My lashes look natural but enhanced.</li>
            <li>I only tried one coat and lashes were fuller and much longer appearing than with just mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I at least got to try it.</li>
            <li>and she loves sealing gel but the natural fiber</li>
            <li>She says with the sealing gel she loves the way it looks without the natural fiber one.</li>
            <li>but I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>3D Fiber Lash Mascara claims to provide a 300% INCREASE to your lashes and look completely natural and it does just that.</li>
            <li>, that my lashes don&#x27;t stick together and that the product is not heavy.</li>
            <li>This girl maybe in her early 20 came up to me ask me was</li>
            <li>By the time that she is done putting several coats on her lashes are as long and full looking as mine.</li>
            <li>If you are patient and careful, this can be a great alternative to false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this when I want my eyelashes to look full, long and evenly spread out.  </li>
            <li>, it looks good when I leave the house in the morning but by 4:30 in the afternoon it looks fake and clumpy.</li>
            <li>The gel is an ok base, but after the fibers, I suggest using own mascara.  </li>
            <li>It kind of looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>, make it look like I have on fake lashes especially the left eye that I had did good on then the right eye.</li>
            <li>Haha its my perfect little secret!!  </li>
            <li>My lashes look more  natural and not clumpy like the other which is more expensive and tacky looking.</li>
            <li>the product also gets pretty thick quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use false lashes for events and be happy with my natural lashes with mascara for the other days...</li>
            <li>The only time you should be quick is between the transporting gel and the micro-fibers (don&#x27;t want the gel to dry before the fibers get on)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara for those looking to avoid the clumped eyelash look and looking for the long thin eyelash look!</li>
            <li>I recommend using regular mascara first and then following the steps for the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to say that I WILL be coming back and referring other ladies.</li>
            <li>The gel isn&#x27;t as good - not as thick or as dark.</li>
            <li>It pretty much doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore, so it&#x27;s extremely pricey for the short amount of time that it lasts.</li>
            <li>The product is okay, not worth $20 (certainly not over $20).</li>
            <li>It is a little tricky and might take me a time or too to master, but on first attempt the minimal clumping I saw was easily fixed with a quick swipe of an eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>I love how wide my eyes look, and there&#x27;s little to no fallout throughout my busy workday.</li>
            <li>This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li>My lashes naturally are barely visible.</li>
            <li>The formula was light enough that my lashes did not feel heavy or look like one of those old vintage dolls with gobs of mascara on</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m used to using fake lashes and L&#x27;oreal or Revlon mascaras, and those work far better than this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in what other products this company offers.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that the Green Tea I drink pretty much daily, combined with a specially formulated Sealing Gel could make my eyelashes appear so Long</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that the Green Tea I drink pretty much daily, combined with a specially formulated Sealing Gel could make my eyelashes appear so Long</li>
            <li>But even for $10.00, I would have expected a little better</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes so thick and full!</li>
            <li>Follow the simple directions and your lashes will take on a new life.</li>
            <li>My lashes were very long but very clumpy.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess if you love the thick, clumpy &amp;#34;looks horrible&amp;#34;, messy look, then, yes, this mascara will certainly do that for you!</li>
            <li>After I applied this, I left my house about 20 minutes later, and my eyes really started to water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first tube, the transplanting gel, looks just like regular mascara, that alone did make my lashes long.</li>
            <li>After a few tries I was able to get a look</li>
            <li>Paying the little extra for the more well known brands goes a long way.</li>
            <li>No other mascara beats this.</li>
            <li>and it actually made my eyelashes look a lot longer and natural!</li>
            <li>It was my first time using such a product and although I have wanted to use something like this for a very long time</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this type of product and it took a few tries for me to get it right.</li>
            <li>One of the sticks seemed dried up and the other one wasn&#x27;t any better than the mascara I got at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li>With more use and practice I found that using less fibers creates less fall out on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I found that it is important to only apply a little of the fiber each layer, otherwise there is the potential for eye irritation.</li>
            <li>Not easy to layer and would require more product than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They are short and stubby and I have bare spots where the lashes have completely stopped growing.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up really liking the finished result aside from some minor clumping</li>
            <li>second WOW came when I looked at the Instruction sheet that is included.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have very short natural lashes</li>
            <li>I was afraid of massive raccoon eyes, but it comes off in clumps with warm soapy water or in the shower--which is so  much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a couple times now and it barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li>they said could barely tell I had any mascara</li>
            <li>I wore it daily for 7 days then decided to take a break and wear my old mascara...</li>
            <li>And they actually look quite natural.</li>
            <li>one eye bare...  </li>
            <li>I have barely there lashes</li>
            <li>This may work for women already generous eyelashes -- but, for someone like me, who barely has lashes, this did not work.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to do one side at a time and have both tubes in hand, but it really does work.</li>
            <li>As a beauty industry professional I have found that all fiber mascara helps lengthen and add volume to your lashes since the tiny fibers are added to it.</li>
            <li>Finally a mascara that looks natural on and does not clump.</li>
            <li>Definitely does not have natural ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>for real girls and drag queens</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure my reaction was 100x worse than</li>
            <li>I love how thick and long this makes my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always  liked the fake eyelash look but thought it was cliche to glue things on your eyelids.  </li>
            <li>The nice part is it wasn&#x27;t clumpy and looking all fake.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but with somewhat difficult and long application process my lashes did look good.  </li>
            <li>i was so excited to try this product with all the good reviews, but i am soooo disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Almost like the gel was starting to dry out and the fibers weren&#x27;t  as much.</li>
            <li>A few extra steps in your daily routine, but definately worth it to me!</li>
            <li>, my lash line is too uneven for them to sit right.</li>
            <li>I did what other suggested and just did one eye at a time, but because of the results with the first one, I was in a hurry to do the second.  </li>
            <li>So if you want multiple coats, you have to do this multiple times, meaning I had to complete six steps with this mascara, where I would only need to complete 2 or 3 with another mascara.    </li>
            <li>Other than it making my eyes really irritated, I like this but</li>
            <li>and my lashes are long, full, and dark, and last all day.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were long and black, very pretty.</li>
            <li>I will say that this did NOT flake down my face throughout the day, so that was positive.</li>
            <li>It is a bit time consuming, but the effect is so worth the extra minute or two to apply another few coats.</li>
            <li>I was excited at first, but the product became messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>I personally found it easier to apply than false eyelashes and the look is more</li>
            <li>They did make my eyes water a little at first</li>
            <li>have never before owned a Mascara Product that comes with a Carry Case, and this case has an Extremely High Class and Expensive Appearance!&lt;br /&gt;Inside the case I found the Beautiful Tubes of the 3D collagen grafted carbon black liquid Sealing Gel and the Green Tea Fibers.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if I was just sweating more then typical</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to use and makes you lash long and thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascaras before and this one has been my least favorite.</li>
            <li>They did not come out looking like a big hot mess like some others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I repeatedly spent so much $ on different  type of mascara&#x27;s all promising to make my lashes longer, thicker, &amp; all of the above.</li>
            <li>First you use the grafting mascara and then add the green tea fibers over and keep building until you have the desired effect.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase a few weeks ago and I loooove how it makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer!</li>
            <li>You apply that first, then the green tea fiber, and another coat of the gel.  </li>
            <li>I was amusingly surprised seeing anything near my eyes tear me up, I have to be so very careful of the make up I buy and use,</li>
            <li>For the most dramatic results I curl mine, put a coat of my regular mascara, and then do 2-3 cycles of the gel/fiber.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the need to repeat and have this whole process down to taking about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try these because I have horribly short brittle thin lashes, but when they arrived I noticed the website says  DO NOT use with contact lenses, so i was so depressed, but I gave them to my sister who has the same issues I do and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I have very long eyelashes naturally, but they are on the thinner side.  </li>
            <li>It gives your lashes a little more length than regular mascara, but I won&#x27;t be using it again :/</li>
            <li>The fibers go on next and was a little different at first</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes about this after reading several other reviews.</li>
            <li>It cakes up too much and you have constant black dots on your face from flaking</li>
            <li>and I will honestly say that I was a little cautious because I have hard both negative and positive things about 3D fiber.</li>
            <li>worked very well however by the end of the day you get lots of little fibers all over your face.</li>
            <li>Fast glam with little</li>
            <li>I put a little bid of my regular mascara on (don&#x27;t have to use as much), then I used the gel which is just like putting on mascara.  </li>
            <li>Did not work as well as other similar mascaras and dried up quickly.</li>

            <li> Love love this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> The results were pleasant because it did increase the volume and length of my lashes.</li>

            <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing!!</li>
            <li> According to the recipient it isn&#x27;t a good mascara.</li>
            <li> so I question whether or not this is a good look?  </li>
            <li> It was good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I gave this item for Christmas and they loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique.</li>
            <li> The gel isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful the good results will continue.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit flaky and clumps, but then the product itself is good.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> mascara and be happy with my own lashes.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara..</li>
            <li> I loved the 3D fiber lash and went on Amazon to give it another try.  </li>
            <li> Loved this product.</li>
            <li> I found that just one layer is good for me.</li>
            <li> mascara looks gorgeous and stays gorgeous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mascara is good, but it is not AS good as Younique.</li>
            <li> which is good.</li>
            <li> I got it delivered on time and the case it comes in is good.</li>
            <li> They tell me how good it looks on me.</li>
            <li> We all loved the result.</li>
            <li> Loved it because it didn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you read the instructions, remember to seal the fibers with the gel afterwards (and before), and don&#x27;t do more than 2 coats, you can get a gorgeous look!</li>
            <li> and I feel this product works best on clean lashes.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> So easy to use too!!</li>
            <li> but i totally love how beautiful i feel wearing this.</li>

            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> It is amazing to see the difference in your lashes when comparing one that is &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; with another that has been &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  </li>

            <li> They look amazing when I am wearing this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> her lashes looked amazing</li>

            <li> The mascara comes with an amazing case which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I tell you this 3d mascara is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was plesently suprised and how much I liked this.</li>
            <li> Gave me great length to my short lashes ,wonderful mascara</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and would make a great gift given the fancy packaging it comes in!</li>
            <li> I own the younique brand name version of this.</li>
            <li> I liked this Mascara because it did not smudge after repeated applications of eye drops.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it worked any better than a good mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really liked it.</li>
            <li> I wish the fibers would stay in place because they do fall from your lashes and doesn&#x27;t look nice after you applied the make up.</li>
            <li> I really liked the package the items come in, too.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked trying it again though.</li>
            <li> and &amp;#34;how much did you spend because they look &#x27;great&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Kudos to the merchant as we&#x27;ll for delivering on time and packaging nicely.</li>
            <li> I did enhance it with my own mascara too</li>
            <li> Priced  nicely.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was the absolute best.</li>
            <li> received a discount on this product for reviewing purposes and these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this product to give my honest opinion in return.</li>
            <li> I own the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of the 3-D Fiber Lash and I will NEVER try another brand again</li>
            <li> I have heard many good things about 3D Fiber Mascara.    </li>
            <li> My husband even noticed how nice my lashes looked after using this product.</li>
            <li> One hint  from my own experience -  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I must say that I&#x27;m really loving the effects of this product!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very great quality and works very well..</li>
            <li> , I get my own lashes, just improved.</li>
            <li> Apply one layer of your own mascara, then one coat of the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again to set everything.</li>
            <li> I honestly could not be happier..</li>
            <li> My review is an unbiased and honest review.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my honest unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like how this works, it adds length but not to the point of looking fake,and the thickness it adds is really great!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it but the fibers can get in your eyes at times.</li>
            <li> Was a bit leery about ordering it, but, oh, so nice.</li>
            <li> The case keeps them together and fits nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara.  </li>
            <li> and she ordered her own immediately after.</li>
            <li> I liked the look</li>
            <li> love love love!!</li>

            <li> It was super easy to apply and looked great on!  </li>
            <li> Its very easy to wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I scrubbed my face, put a light coat of my favorite mascara on, and then proceeded to give myself the most incredible lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I call myself the new version of a 2015 elly mae lol,!!  </li>
            <li> Super happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> It did come off very easy and seemed to stay put throughout the day</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and remove.  </li>
            <li> product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Would rebuy -  very easy to use</li>
            <li> It also washes off very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy.  </li>

            <li> If your looking for a glamorous look this is a nice mascara:)</li>
            <li> Best of all, there arent any sellers bombarding me with offers and pleas to buy that product.</li>
            <li> but I picked more fibers out of my eyes than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> you can use your own- and use the fiber wand on top of it-</li>
            <li> Just started using this product but so far I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I could not be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> My husband of nearly 20 years even noticed and was very impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many directions for fiber mascara and some say use over one coat of your own mascara</li>
            <li> Well my best friend started doing eyelash extensions and she was always having to go in to the salon and have them fixed and have more added, so it was kind of a turn off to me.</li>
            <li> Nice, I wish it had better instructions or suggestions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best 3D product by far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did this product greatly deliver on its promises of giving me beautiful lashes, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the 10</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see how amazing my lashes look with this product.</li>
            <li> This was recieved very quickly!</li>
            <li> this is quick and nice way and easy of looking great.</li>
            <li> Great for fuller lashes, you have to use it a few times to get used to it, but it works great!</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first that the fibers would get in my eye and irritate when I was trying to brush them on, but everything went great.</li>
            <li> Pretty great product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; it goes on great and makes my eyes really pop !</li>
            <li> So go ahead and order you this great mascara and get ready to get compliments !</li>
            <li> It worked great the first couple times then after that, sub par.</li>
            <li> This stuffs great and really works!</li>
            <li> I got compliments all day about how great my lashes looked and how pretty my eyes</li>
            <li> I have very light lashes and it does the job.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to follow the instructions and get an amazing result.</li>
            <li> I am sure it works fine for most people!</li>
            <li> my eyelashes were just as full and beautiful that night as they were when I first put it on!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I have never looked like I had that many eyelashes ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It definitely is NOT the best out there!</li>
            <li> Apply my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> I love that Bella Eleganze didn&#x27;t skimp on the Font Size!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago.</li>
            <li> the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK.</li>
            <li> and I am still beyond in love.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine another brand working better than this</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> but now I know I can get better results with this one.</li>
            <li> This 3D is better than that Younique version.</li>
            <li> its ok.</li>
            <li> I love the case that this product comes packaged in.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend repeating until you are satisfied with the look of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s maybe $5 more but worked 10x better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff -</li>
            <li> LOVE it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li> I tried my girlfriends younique 3D mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this product again UNLESS thé company sends me another one of better quality.</li>
            <li> Also, the end result looks like &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; (lack of better term)</li>
            <li> Combing does not help because then you will just get more shedding.  </li>
            <li> It does take practice and thinner coats (and I need to be sure to use a lot of the gel coat on top to try and prevent fiber shedding)</li>
            <li> Until you get the hang of it, check your face often! :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this.  </li>
            <li> but I was easily able to brush them off.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and think once I get a hang of the application process, I will love it even more.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the mascara and another 5 stars for the seller. :)</li>
            <li> , glad I did.</li>
            <li> A word cannot explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> this product was ok.  </li>
            <li> This review as written by my lovely wife:  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> STECTION.I CAN GO WITH OUT LOVE</li>
            <li> I WILL OREDER MORE</li>
            <li> but I’m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love the effect without having to use extensions.</li>
            <li> , just make sure you check your face often</li>
            <li> I just recently removed my eye lash extensions and am perfectly happy with this as a summer replacement!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Much better priced than that mlm company.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> and it is okay.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it mostly for my bottom eye lashes to avoid this</li>
            <li> and it still made my eyes look too cute.</li>
            <li> I love the mascara and the fibers do make your lashes look somewhat fuller and longer</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is like a knock off of &amp;#34;Younique&amp;#34; which I like better.</li>
            <li> There is more mascara then the fibers.</li>
            <li> love to use this now  </li>
            <li> I love my lashes after I use this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it ....</li>
            <li> all am really satisfied with it, try it with no doubt, may be</li>
            <li> The fiber is the top pic.</li>
            <li> No irritation and love the case.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC MASCARA!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love what it does for my eyes, but it does flake off.</li>
            <li> Love the product for the price, hope they can improve the quality.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> and i like that you can put as many coats on as you want,</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love  these products ....</li>
            <li> love love love my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> But I love making them longer and look fuller</li>
            <li> You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want to.</li>
            <li> so she uses more applications.</li>
            <li> Love this will buy again</li>
            <li> Younique is much better..</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I do love the results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this 3D fiber lash mascara by Bella Eleganze.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping that this brand would be more like the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes which doesn&#x27;t smell and fibers stay in place and is $10 cheaper than Bella Eleganze.</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer-</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the reviews better.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It sure does do what it claims.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the appearance it gives on my eyes but through out the day there is some shedding of the product that falls under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the concept and the appearance it gives.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to learn how to better apply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li> You can add as many layers as you want until you get the desired length of lashes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has to be the equivalent because it can&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Better than younique lash mascara.</li>
            <li> Drug store brand works better.</li>
            <li> I love the look and they lasted all day without flaking off.</li>
            <li> (I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake,</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love it love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this 3D Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li> I love that there wasn&#x27;t a learning curve either</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> but this gives me fuller, better appearing lashes than anything I have tried before  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Younique, Love Alpha, and this brand of fiber lashes, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> However, when I used this, it made my lashes more pronounced and visible.  </li>
            <li> There are SO many mascaras to chose from - glad</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with just one application you can repeat the steps until you get your desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t rub your eyes or the fibers will fall on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product free of charge for inspection &amp; honest opinion.</li>
            <li> do you probably applied more than two coats.</li>
            <li> Score one big ol&#x27; win for me!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Have had better luck with drugstore brands</li>
            <li> I use an eyelash curler, apply Bella Eleganze mascara, then the fibers, and one more coat of the mascara.</li>
            <li> I love her and mascara</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;Love it&amp;#34;.... i have receive sooo many compliments regarding the way my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I just use make up remover or baby wipes to remove it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I want some more</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok but not</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my hair and scalp, love the way it feels in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 3D Mascara.</li>
            <li> This is better than falsies and getting extensions.</li>
            <li> But the seller is great and thanks to amazon prime</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product compares favorably to others that sell for much more.</li>
            <li> love that the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> Was hoping for something more.  </li>
            <li> Younique Moodstruck works &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li> but in so many ways I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascara, but this honestly was the best one I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with fiber lashes  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed with my first results but decided to do another coat to see if these Fiber Lashes really would boost the length and thickness with each application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara, the company is very nice and even sent me a free gift!</li>
            <li> I do however like her younique better; it seemed to build more easily on the lash and the fibers didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Younique 3D Fiber lashes!!</li>
            <li> I loved it at first...</li>
            <li> I now have long beautiful eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li> At one time, I was having them colored at my hair dressers (which is a cool $25 each application), but this product works quit nicely.</li>
            <li> At first, I really loved the effect of this product, but my views have diminished for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loved it at first.</li>
            <li> Oh this product is so much fun!!</li>
            <li> So worth it!!</li>
            <li> OK bottom line, go ahead and try it and take your time when applying , to me its easy</li>
            <li> It stays put and easily remove able with make up remover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I expected these results to be as good as they were, but I am really happy they were.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.</li>
            <li> Received my &amp;#34;Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara&amp;#34; and fell in love with the NEW AND IMPROVED Proprietary Formula Sealing Gel that goes on silky smooth and smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend that you try this, you&#x27;ll see just how amazing it is!!&lt;br /&gt;**A product was received to review, all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Amazing product well worth the money.</li>

            <li> The best makeup I&#x27;ve ever spent my money on.</li>

            <li> This is easy and non-clumping.  </li>
            <li> sometimes a fiber will land on my eye, but it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I bought to wear for special occasions but now wear it most of the time.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be an amazing product, but as using this for the first time I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; too well.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I have ever used fiber mascara I must say it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like the effect when I use my own mascara for the first coat and follow-up with the BE system.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this once since I was able to review it free.</li>
            <li> As the seller suggested, I first tried it using my own mascara and just the fibers, until I got used to handling it.  </li>
            <li> so loving how pretty my lashes look while wearing this,usually i get compliments on my hair as it is rainbow in bangs</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the glue only and that alone enhance my lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> I was kind of sceptical at first and was unsure how it would work.  </li>
            <li> First you have to put on a layer of your own mascara to prep for this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with fiber mascara, and I gotta be honest.  </li>
            <li> I applied my own mascara first..</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this on discount for review because I pretty much have no lashes to speak of.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s not compatible with contact lenses with those fine fibers.</li>
            <li> I thought were fine using convenience store brands</li>
            <li> They did change their formula a bit but even if they don&#x27;t revert to the previous, it&#x27;s still the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no clumping and fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li> I used it on top of my normal mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats.</li>
            <li> fine fibbers gets into the eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes are nice and long and look good with mascara.</li>
            <li> The top photo is what I would wear on a normal day--this is with my own Avon mascara.</li>
            <li> I used it on top of my normal volumizing mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats.</li>
            <li> My lashes went from stubby to long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> For I followed the directions love my eye lashes long, full and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> get eyelashes that look much longer and better!</li>
            <li> Love love love my new lash system</li>
            <li> so this was really cool to see how quickly and easily I could make my eyes poop !</li>
            <li> This mascara does not, and I feel like it looks more natural, which I love!</li>
            <li> Not only is the product fabulous and easy to use, but the seller has great customer service.  </li>
            <li> As you can imagine I do not know very much about makeup, but fortunately for me it must be pretty darn good because she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> i was a huge skeptic</li>
            <li> I enjoy the mascara look but sometimes have fibers fall of under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes my short eyelashes look great and longer.</li>
            <li> but there are great mascara&#x27;s out there that produce a similar look with one tube.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and my lashes look wonderful ....</li>
            <li> light weight wearing lash product I have every tried.</li>
            <li> Totally Fabulous and makes the eyes pop without all the hassle of falsies.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Bella Eleganze and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a makeup junkie was happy to get to try this</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> This works fabulous....</li>
            <li> Really cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed with this product because the fibers are made from green tea.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be adding this to my stash of favorites great job &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> so mascara is always an important part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I only wear there to go out, because for me, at work they are too much lol.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I did, it was definitely the hit of the presents.  </li>
            <li> But compared to how great the product is, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit more time to put mascara but its so worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this for FREE and it was ALL the description</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe my lashes could look so fabulous without looking clumpy</li>
            <li> The price difference isn&#x27;t that much, and it is nice to think that the consultant does make some money.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing, it really makes your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> ,i will be buying more when i run out ,the girls at work couldn&#x27;t believe that it was just mascara that had made my lashes look so beautiful,this an A+++++ product ,definetly worth the money.</li>

            <li> reflection in the mirror revealed Extremely Long and Beautiful Eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes and just thought maybe this might be a good alternative given the organic ingredients in the fibers and gel.  </li>
            <li> It made my lashes long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> There is no flaking or smudging...only beautiful and long lashes.</li>

            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve been able to wear that makes me look like I have eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a different popular product that was much higher and not as good.</li>
            <li> First you curl your lashes (optional), then you apply your own waterproof mascara (I used Great Lash waterproof), then you carefully layer the fibers and the gel (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara as well, and I like this one better, I will certainly purchase this one moving forward!</li>
            <li> which was my main concern when I bought it, so that was amazing.</li>
            <li> Applies great, lasts a long time, and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> This was super easy to take off</li>
            <li> and it is nice to just throw  this on and look halfway decent.</li>
            <li> LOVE my new thicker, longer looking lashes!!!</li>
            <li> The package was great and the item defiantly works better than I expected!!</li>

            <li> I was so excited to receive my fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li> Once I got the first coat on they looked ok however within maybe twenty minutes</li>

            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product even if it is not the original.</li>
            <li> Pretty pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because I&#x27;m picky about the mascara I use.  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed and will purchase from you</li>
            <li> There is an involved process, but the end result is worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this mascara truly makes me feel pretty, and a bit better about myself...</li>
            <li> Just make sure to curl your eyelashes first, then apply the mascara &amp;</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras to find one that does exactly what this one does.  </li>
            <li> This is a copy of the original &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34; and caused severe eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have also found, however that the original (younique 3d moodstruck mascara)</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my unreal-looking REAL lashes!</li>
            <li> Worth the $!</li>
            <li> I got free return and full refund</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this.  </li>
            <li> I have never used 3D Fiber Lash mascara before this, but it is fun!  </li>
            <li> Man...so I was really excited to try this product...</li>
            <li> The first day I wore this, it was OKAY.  </li>
            <li> This product changed my mind, it was easy to put on, even though the first application I learned that you need to put the fiber part on right after the gel or you have to apply more gel.....</li>
            <li> I first thought it may be too dark, however; once it was applied, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 5 different brands of the 3D lash, and this is by far, the best.</li>
            <li> love love this natural looking mascara</li>
            <li> I bought this because my beloved Japanese Scandal Queen fiber mascara is no longer available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received this today and It was given to me for free as long as I leave my honest opinion, With that said first it comes in a very nice case and a card inside that says you win a free gift not sure what it is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s printed on High Quality Glossy Paper and the Instructions were Very Easy to Understand and Follow.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and my eyelashes appear to grow right in front of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Saving for special occasions.</li>
            <li> You can wear this every day if you want, but I prefer to stick to the special occasions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it every day, just for a special night out.</li>
            <li> And the price is right for just about anyone to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love beauty products and I am always looking for new things what will beautify me!!</li>
            <li> This product is also waterproof but it isn&#x27;t hard to remove at the end of the day which is awesome!</li>
            <li> The application is easy and the Transplanting Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Natural Fibers.</li>
            <li> The aplication is easy and the Transplating Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Moodstruck Natural Fibers.  </li>
            <li> Ok ladies , I try everything that the beauty industry puts out , some works some makes us think it does, My honest opinion is this mascara isn&#x27;t a miracle to having long lashes like the stars , However</li>
            <li> Love the look and it really does add length and fillings to lashes....</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> longer after but not as full as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the 3D mascara, it made my eyelashes look so much thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s true..</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> it does just as much for ya as a $5 mascara from walmart no matter how many coats you do.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Younique. will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> but I received a full refund TY</li>
            <li> My eyes looks awake and full.</li>
            <li> Full with no clumping.</li>
            <li> so I did not have to pay full price.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous because many people got the fibers in their eyes, causing irritation.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the fibers do not work real well with contacts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper 3d fiber lashes that pulled the mustard much better on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked the look of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer!  </li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s easy to apply, gel, fiber, gel, done....</li>
            <li> This is good for a special event but it is too many steps for everyday</li>
            <li> I also had a great experience with their customer service due to packaging error.</li>
            <li> This product really works and does take 5 applications like the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands do, to look full, long and Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I like this product, the gel or sealant mascara goes on first which I love because on its own it already makes my lashes seem longer, once it has been applied the second step is the fibers.</li>
            <li> I love trying new mascara and was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> The gel dries quickly....</li>
            <li> To my surprise the two steps go hand in hand and were rather quick.  </li>
            <li> , the only thing different now is the awesome look my lashes have.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them back and explained that while I did love the mascara, I wish there was just more of it in the tube.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for those big beautiful eyes of their youth!</li>
            <li> Second time at the end I put a coat of my regular mascara to hold in place all well best one I have brought</li>
            <li> It dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and ahead of time it estimated delivery</li>
            <li> However, I liked this fiber lash mascara more than I had expected.</li>
            <li> but false eyelashes never looked good or felt good on my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to apply, looks so natural and complements my lashes beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that gives me a full and long-lasting look, and this product does that exact thing!</li>
            <li> On the positive side.. it lasts all day and curls easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would HIGHLY</li>
            <li> Also, I highly recommend Bella Eleganze as a top seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better than eye extensions which are high maintenance,</li>
            <li> one of my favorite YouTubers (#ColleenBallingerEvans) highly recommended it, so I bought two.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how Bella Eleganze is able to offer such a Premium Product at the affordable under $25 asking price, but I do know that I will definitely be placing another order and happily paying the full asking price when I run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how Bella Eleganze is able to offer such a Premium Product at the affordable under $25 asking price, but I do know that I will definitely be placing another order and happily paying the full asking price when I run out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes were defined and looked very pretty.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that this one had such amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> It IS better than regular mascara but nowhere near as good as the younique brand.</li>
            <li> MAYY ZING!it makes my long eyelashes look so good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake or give me raccoon eyes at the end of the day, they look just as fresh and full as when applied.  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty certain I&#x27;ll get better with technique in time.</li>
            <li> The substance is light and VERY easy to remove especially in the shower.</li>
            <li> will highly recommend it to every woman I know and order it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for producing such a great product.</li>
            <li> I personally love this new wave of gel mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen lots of new products hitting the market advertising the stunning growth of lashes.</li>
            <li> My new favorite item in my makeup box.</li>
            <li> It does not flake, which is very important to me as I wear contacts, and is easily removed with my regular face wash.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is so easy to apply and really brightens up my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , it was easy for me to use straight from the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and fast to come off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to say i love this product ,it was fast and easy to use .The directions are simple and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> This works really well!!  </li>
            <li> &amp;quot;I&#x27;ve used this product several times and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> In fact, I was amazed at how pretty the packaging was!</li>
            <li> This mascara does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do!</li>
            <li> AND... the fiber brush fell apart the first day I started using this product!</li>
            <li> This is one terrific product I love it  !</li>
            <li> Great for going out or everyday use.</li>
            <li> They look real, feel light weight and not clumpy.  </li>
            <li> It is so light on my lashes and makes them look so much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li> , there was definitely a difference in an amazing way.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked this product</li>
            <li> Now I can say after a whole day wear does not look as good as it did when I initially put it on, but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t worth the savings.</li>
            <li> I used it several times and get so many compliments on my eyelashes since they are light and thin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Love this product so far.</li>
            <li> so I have a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth you dollars.</li>
            <li> if it was on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe service, I&#x27;d subscribe as I will be using this as I can&#x27;t afford my lash extentions any longer, this is a nice second choice to that!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and loved it so much that I bought a second as a gift.  </li>
            <li> I am not great at applying make-up, but this was awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I bought an extra set for my sister to give as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wow finally found a great product that does enhance my lashes lady&#x27;s please try this</li>
            <li> They are worth the what $25.</li>
            <li> another attempt and only lightly sealing the fibers I was satisfied with the look.</li>
            <li> Younique is by far a much better product.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting</li>
            <li> I only leave reviews if I absolutely love a product or if it has serious issues, and this one is an awesome makeup addition.</li>
            <li> Super drama and no fake lashes or glue to fuss with.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Also the customer service here is A+++, very prompt and friendly.</li>
            <li> I got this due to a youtuber, Colleen ballinger, who said it was really good</li>
            <li> I had been using falsh lashes- and never got them right.</li>
            <li> Just received this and tried it right away</li>
            <li> apply the fibers right away and keep alternating to desired look.</li>
            <li> Right after applying the product the fibers also flake under my eyes</li>
            <li> Comes right off in the shower too.</li>
            <li> My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li> Fiber mascara is all the rage right now so of course I had to give it a try</li>
            <li> and the right has 1 coat of the fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> He noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> However Bella Eleganze 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is nothing but positive for me!</li>
            <li> After writing my first review, I realized that thé product was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it great product and costs much less than younique for same results (I&#x27;ve tried younique.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get it right, but looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I certainly would not pay the full price for this item.  </li>
            <li> But it was easily removed with a little coconut oil and warm water.</li>
            <li> love that it does not matter how many coats that you apply, it does not weigh your lashes down.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants fuller/longer lashes!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara does what it promises; I am thrilled with the long lashes it provides.</li>
            <li> The end result is good, but not worth the hassle for every day.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect for the color to be as bold and dark as it is so that was a happy unexpected affect.</li>
            <li> I love that this came in a nice hard shelled case.</li>
            <li> I remove all makeup with just pure Vaseline !</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get it right the first time</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, very natural looking dramatically long eyelashes..recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li> The mascara is so easy to apply and WOW at the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheaper, similar products that were far superior to this one.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural and so easy.</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good for half the price)</li>
            <li> directions were clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lashes full and long!</li>
            <li> I am liking this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to apply and if you can apply mascara you can apply this going down the rd.</li>
            <li> It took a week or so to get use to the application (one eye always came out better than the other at first) but now that I have had practice I can make both eyes look fabulous in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> Product is good - fibers are a little hard to work with but the result is great.</li>
            <li> Inside the appealing box was a sturdy and high quality hinged case with the 2 vials clearly</li>
            <li> and wow there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> First, you apply the gel, then you apply the fibers, then you seal in the fibers with the gel.</li>
            <li> I bought a metal lash comb and that comes in handy though it is really not a clumpy formula.</li>
            <li> this product I was able to enchance what I have left of my eye lashes to their fullest.</li>
            <li> First product I have used that lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li> So the next time I used it I tried it that way and so much better.</li>
            <li> First you put on a coat of the sealing gel</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of mascara</li>
            <li> First, you put on your mascara.</li>
            <li> This one does stay on very well!</li>
            <li> I suggest to put on ur favorite regular mascara</li>
            <li> first then the transplanting gel, fiber.</li>
            <li> Row 3 is first application of the 3D Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li> Sure enough this is the easiest,</li>
            <li> The first time, I purchased this for $17.99   2 weeks ago I purchased it for $20.99.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to use it</li>
            <li> u first try it.</li>
            <li> Used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be back to buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> When I first received the package I opened it up from it’s fancy case, I had no clue you had to apply in two steps.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do once you follow the instruction.</li>
            <li> After the first attempt I got these results.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper too!</li>
            <li> these fell short in so many areas.</li>
            <li> If i want more of an &amp;#34;everyday makeup&amp;#34; look I only apply each tube once..</li>
            <li> Gave me an eye infection first use.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> I bought this mascara and instantly fell in love upon first usage.</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes and felt like I could get a lovely length with younique, not with this brand.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, only needed about 2 coats and it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Love that my lashes grow instantly.  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments, and even was asked if I have extensions while having a facial.  </li>
            <li> The application process is simple- logically, the more you add the clumpier it will look.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and it really worked, her eyelashes looked long and beautiful, would definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind digging out fibers from your eyeballs occasionally, you will love it.</li>
            <li> First 3-D</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I have never used fiber mascara before so this was my first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting latisse, but since I have blue eyes this is a better alternative for the price.</li>
            <li> When applying this I first off noticed the application brush.  </li>
            <li> I love how you can keep applying to get different effects!</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my eyes has been burning and itching.</li>
            <li> Since then I have found that if I put another coat of regular mascara on top of the fibers it helps to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> This is the first 3D fiber mascara that tells you where and what the fibers are made of.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> this gives the same effect even better then lashes</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve not used this type of mascara system, it&#x27;s a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li> This mascara really opens up your eyes!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and I tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying fiber mascara</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> First, you put on your mascara.</li>
            <li> Once I add some cat eye liner and shadow I will be able to achieve the va-voom look I want for our next trip to Vegas.  </li>
            <li> So, this is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> First time i used it the fiber lashes it got in my eye</li>
            <li> Would get a higher rating but it does flake all day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was a bit clumpy</li>
            <li> Make sure you coat your lashes well with it, or the fibers will fall out, which left me picking at my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using fiber mascara</li>
            <li> I received lots of compliments on my eyelashes the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but only gave it four stars instead of five because I am a contact wearer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been going back and forth for a while now trying to decide if wanted to give it a try or not, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I actually like this a lot more than the younique version.</li>
            <li> I do put a coat of mascara on first the follow with the steps per the package.</li>
            <li> This fiber mascara works really well!</li>
            <li> Put the sealer on first.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in trying a fiber mascara after my friends posted about another brand on facebook.</li>
            <li> saying how pretty my eyes are.</li>
            <li> Sure, it makes your lashes appear longer, but only for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was pretty underwhelmed by this lash system.</li>
            <li> Glad I only paid a $1.00 for it.</li>
            <li> it is summer here and Hot</li>
            <li> I played with it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> I followed others recommendations and applied a coat of my fav mascara first, L&#x27;Oreal Manga Lash.</li>
            <li> First time trying 3D Fiber mascara and before purchasing, I had to read the reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I used the product exactly per instructions)</li>
            <li> but my eyes were pretty irritates throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying fiber lash.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;this product is wonderful at giving me that false eyelash look!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it makes my eyelashes look super long when I don&#x27;t have much it begin with.</li>
            <li> Stunning new &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; that seem perfectly natural.</li>
            <li> It does take practice to apply this mascara, its a two step process and you want to make sure to apply the fibers while the gel is still wet and seal it again quickly with the gel.</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as buying direct from company..maybe old..kinda dry.</li>
            <li> I got a lot on my eyes and that&#x27;s how I also knew it made a difference because no one usually complimented my lashes as much but even if they didn&#x27;t , I love it and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Sorry if this review sounds too good to be true but this is seriously the greatest cosmetic to come out on the market in years!</li>
            <li> My lashes looked triple the thickness, the color was a beautiful dark black and it was extremely easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Amazing product...just be careful not to get fibers in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Love this product  works great,stays on, and definitely made my lashes lush and full.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 layers of fibers+gel; my lashes are straight and pretty short, so I&#x27;m better off appling 2 layers</li>
            <li> Incredible if you want a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I used it just a few times so far and each time I got great results.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to and it won&#x27;t completely replace my regular mascara but for a more dramatic look this is perfect!</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the more expensive 3D fiber mascaras.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive stuff IMO</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara, no clumps, makes them fuller and much longer, and it washes off 10x easier than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Got so many compliments about my eyelashes being so long and pretty.</li>
            <li> Tried this (by the way; it wasn&#x27;t as much as they quoted on the show) and I am so amazed I can&#x27;t feel it, but it sure is different.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price,  much better than what other brands charge!.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand off of Amazon and was super surprised at the transformation!</li>
            <li> Since the reviews were all positive, I went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes look full and long, just make sure you follow the directions clearly for optimal results.</li>
            <li> First of all, the fibers do not stick to your lashes (no matter how much gel you use) I feel like it literally does nothing but irritate the hell out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have since learned that many of these kits are fakes from China, which may explain the long ship time.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes seemed pretty much non-existent after chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great purchase and cheaper than the other 3d lash mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li> works really well, surprisingly...wasn&#x27;t expecting much!</li>
            <li> and I pretty much just went through life with my mascara etc.  </li>
            <li> I love having long thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> and I was okay all night long.  </li>
            <li> but if you feel like spending the extra time on your lashes you can get a nice full and long look.</li>
            <li> but its on its way:)  i right away put this on and i was simply amazed by how it went from having super thin almost invisible lashes to full plump lush lashes really nice,  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that really works for me -  gives me very long, full looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake off all over my face and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling like I&#x27;ve stuck tiny needles into them like some kind of medieval torture routine.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this made my eyelashes look so long!</li>
            <li> This may not be the best mascara for everyone but in my opinion it does a better job than all the other expensive name brand mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love long eyelashes!</li>
            <li> But like I said, that&#x27;s a problem easily solved by simply taking your make-up off every night.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to try rather than the much more expensive brands and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t as easy to take off as basic mascaras are, but I use abolene, vaseline, or makeup wipes to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with it are simple and easy to follow and getting the fibers off is a sinch.</li>
            <li> My eyes are super sensitive and often tear from makeup, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with allergies or irritation.</li>
            <li> , however I can wear it for five or six hours at the most, as the fibers begin to dry and get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mascara and spooly come in a nice black case.</li>
            <li> The second time making sure I applied the fibers very quickly so the gel didn&#x27;t dry and</li>
            <li> Definitely far from waterproof and is super clumpy</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara for thick and long lashes</li>
            <li> Love this much, makes my eyelashes long.</li>
            <li> the first one I bought was great the second one I purchased was dried out.</li>
            <li> Great the first application, dried out and goopy on the 2nd application, also flakes off during the day</li>
            <li> The setting gel is a good mascara alone, you put this on first and while it is still wet, you put the fibers on and then put the setting one back on...</li>
            <li> Lashes do look super long and full, just a matter of practice to achieve the look you want.  </li>
            <li> never before used a 3D Fiber Mascara, my expectations were not very high, however, I don&#x27;t think I have ever used the word WOW as much as I did when I received this product and opened the box!&lt;br /&gt;My initial WOW came out of my mouth as I removed the Super Sturdy and Attractive, Textured Case with Bella Eleganze&#x27;s Name Embossed in Gold from the outer box.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The best part is that my eyelashes do not look fake or lumpy, they look very natural.</li>
            <li> The trick to not getting fibers all over you is to apply a coat of gel from the bottom to top of your lashes and apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look super full and long!</li>
            <li> The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and (as a bonus) it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> I did apply a second coat with the same steps and was floored at how amazing it</li>
            <li> We have a huge commercial farm and</li>
            <li> I really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I really like 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara really does seal so no embarrassing flakes or smudges.</li>
            <li> but it was too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real or one from the Too Faced line.</li>
            <li> With They&#x27;re Real, I have to apply maybe two or three coats.</li>
            <li> It is really high quality!</li>
            <li> and it really works, but I noticed after an hour or so my eyes felt irritated.</li>
            <li> but this one really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> if price really matters that much-</li>
            <li> Much.</li>
            <li> I think it requires too much effort for an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And I really like the look I had get when I wear it</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to purchase and to really make it pop</li>
            <li> Application takes 5 minutes, and then lashes aren&#x27;t much longer than with my Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a product issue as much as it&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> No matter how much gel i put on.</li>
            <li> I really like the outcome of my lashes after using it.</li>
            <li> It really makes your lashes look thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> I use about 3 coats and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how they do it...  </li>
            <li> THAT MUCH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a younique cosmetics consultant and I bought this to try it against our brand and this is absolutely garbage.</li>
            <li> SO SO MUCH PEOPLE LOOK AT ME</li>
            <li> This really worked for me too</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference after using it for over a week.</li>
            <li> I became very clumpy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li> I hope I can work that out because I really like this product.</li>
            <li> not so much that I would repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> Hurt my eyes so much by the end of the day it felt like I had sand in my eyes.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much in the fiber tube, mine already ran out.</li>
            <li> Mascara didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li> And some mascara and eye shadows really irritate my eyes so that they watered for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it is light and it does definitely makes your lashes look darker and longer, BUT not thicker!  </li>
            <li> When you remove, I use Vaseline and a Q tip and gently rub off .</li>
            <li> My lashes were very clumpy and did not lengthen.</li>
            <li> My lashes looks so much longer.</li>
            <li> It adds incredible volume Without the fake lash troubles.  </li>
            <li> so I was not using it very often.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> but this one really doesn&#x27;t make me do that</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this mascara</li>
            <li> I expected more of this product.</li>
            <li> This irritated my eyes so much that I had to flush them out and put ointment in my eyes to keep my eyes from feeling like they were burning.</li>
            <li> The travel case is very durable too.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars as I did not notice too much difference in the length of my lashes, just the fullness of them.</li>
            <li> really does work and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> be careful how many coats you put on though</li>
            <li> It stays on without irritation and really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> so I was ready to try it when it came.</li>
            <li> Removes much easier than anticipated</li>
            <li> This really works well.</li>
            <li> I really got, &#x27;movie star&#x27; lashes.</li>
            <li> It is very non-toxic smelling, and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very drawn to getting eyelash extensions, but I&#x27;ve been too scared.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Repeat as much as you want until you get the desired look.</li>
            <li> haha   </li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I like product, works well, really Makes lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my lash length.</li>
            <li> Very flaky....</li>
            <li> You can really build with it and &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; your lashes to look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> This one is not clumpy and not too much fiber.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really just wanted you see what it looked like.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> really works, my lashes look longer and thicker</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to not get it to clump so much.</li>
            <li> I will have pictures ready this weekend so everyone can see.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got this in my eye and could see straight for two days...</li>
            <li> Very comparable to Younique.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so much thicker and longer ...</li>
            <li> I really like what this does to my eye lashes and all my friends are coming over to see what it is.</li>
            <li> It really does make your lashes look fuller</li>
            <li> when really it&#x27;s just the mascara.</li>
            <li> and I was very leery about trying this.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product.</li>
            <li> flakes way to much, all day&lt;</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this mascara</li>
            <li> It really lives up to its videos and youtube trials.</li>
            <li> and thought I&#x27;d see if price really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have really light lashes and have tried several extending mascaras and none of them compare!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help that much with the lash length and would clump up.</li>
            <li> could also use a spooley after applying fibers before the 2nd coat of gel for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> went from little eye lashes to beautiful long lashes!</li>
            <li> Would be great if this replaced false or lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone wanting great looking lashes without the hassle of glue and false lashes.</li>
            <li> but it actually doesn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to just fish it right back out with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> Make my eyelashes so long and full!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of fiber lash mascara and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t love having to order through a distributor.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had the chance to try out the new 3D fiber trend that&#x27;s been going around</li>
            <li> Also, I live in Florida and it&#x27;s hot and humid, and this mascara didn&#x27;t smudge or irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Although the results were good, I&#x27;m not sure they were significantly that much better than my traditional mascara which costs about fives times less.</li>
            <li> It takes a few coats for my desired length but worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> thought I would get it all over my face since Im very clumsy but its very precise and easy to apply</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and it last all day with the initial application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other type of fiber lashes and wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> On special occasions, I apply several coats to make my eyes stand out even more, but the first coat definitely makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is great for adding length to the eyelashes which is what I wanted, Also if you want a dramatic look I would suggest using an additional mascara before applying this one.</li>
            <li> Lashes look amazing and it doesn&#x27;t flake off and end up on your cheek 1/2 way through the day so long as you seal it after the last fiber application.</li>
            <li> ( Hahaha, I said I was older).</li>
            <li> but I brushed it out with a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li> In fact, it gives me full lashes, easy to apply and last all day long.  </li>
            <li> My original plan was to use only on special occasions and or going out, but I can&#x27;t resist, I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Only had to do one layer and they came out amazing and long!</li>
            <li> Not something I use as a daily mascara, but works for those special occasions.  </li>
            <li> But subsequent uses, the fibers fell right off the brush!</li>
            <li> The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my contacts even thought it said it was not recommended for them.</li>
            <li> So very sad that I thought I had found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> They look pretty natural too, except it looks like you just put a bunch of mascara or something.</li>
            <li> The only warning I have is that if you wear it for a full day, but the end of the day there will be fibers on your face or under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong, this mascara is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Works better than the average mascara</li>
            <li> I am hoping that when I need a refill they will have another coupon on this product because I will differently be ordering this again; even if I have to pay full price.</li>
            <li> Use on special occasions, gives nice dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> Works much better than other fiber lash mascaras!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone that needs some new mascara!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, love the results, long thick lashes!</li>
            <li> Less than most.</li>
            <li> Up cclose it looked kind caked on but form farther away and in photos my eyelashes looked fantastic and no need for fake eyelashes here.</li>
            <li> I had never used fiber lash mascaras, but when I read the reviews on this particular one, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> She said she does one coat regular mascara-gel-fibers-gel-fibers-gel-and one more regular mascara coat.</li>
            <li> Decent mascara, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Better than the more expensive name brand.</li>
            <li> For some reason my lashes got shorter as I got older.  </li>
            <li> It really does help with the thinning lashes, making them look full and long.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am older.</li>
            <li> I used to thicken my lashes with baby powder--this has the same effect only a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> My  4 dollar Wet and Wild mascara works better than this 30 dollar scam.</li>
            <li> It ends up giving a decent mascara look but it is not revolutionary by any means.</li>
            <li> Super clumpy and fuzzy and was constantly shedding and getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you put it on right it doesn&#x27;t look fake like other brands, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Washed off super easy with a swipe of Avon&#x27;s eye make up remover, then plain old soapy water.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for products, but this one really made an impression on me.</li>
            <li> Well, at least the fibers can be used w/own/other mascara for added volume and a bit more length!  </li>
            <li> These fiber lashes are the new cool faze and after actually using them I understand WHY.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this mascara; it makes my lashes look super long.</li>
            <li> , I think it depends on how much you apply and how long your lashes are naturally, mine was always full and not long or short so this does add more volume</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the high $$$ that some of my friends were paying for their YOUNIQUE fiber mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly as I think you will also.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Plus, the packaging is high end quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> but every time I wear this, my family or friends doubt that I&#x27;m high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It works wonders and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I left one lash without and applied The Lash on the other and it was AMAZING the difference.</li>
            <li> The usually clump very easily and flake off.</li>
            <li> applying these Fiber Lashes you want to do it quick to make sure the first coat of Transfer Gel is still wet to apply the green tea fibers.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the little case it comes in</li>
            <li> Yes, applying them is a little more time consuming than using JUST mascara -</li>
            <li> I put on a little more gel after the fibers and it holds up all night.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;You can make your lashes as long as you desire!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My most recent bottle doesn&#x27;t have the original fresh scent and instead smells more like tar :(</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply but has to be reapplied once or twice during the day due to the fibers falling off.</li>
            <li> Product returned due to having a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look long and full, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> but most of all makes them look very thick and full.</li>
            <li> I also really love how the tubes come in a cute little black snap close case so I can carry this with me wherever I want!</li>
            <li> And even if I didn&#x27;t like the product so much (which I clearly do), I would still recommend this brand based solely on their customer service.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately for me, it wasn&#x27;t a great match.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and they don&#x27;t look like fake eyelashes, they look great.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I really like this product.</li>
            <li> All I really can say is wow.</li>
            <li> This duo worked OK for a few weeks, then seemed like the fiber tube was all used up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple.</li>
            <li> Row 1 are normal lashes.</li>
            <li> Row 2 is normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I love how my lashes look without feeling heavy or clumpy looking.</li>
            <li> It flaked off all day - I followed instructions exactly and after 2 hours it would start flaking off and continue during the day - left you feeling very paranoid and had to keep checking - won&#x27;t be using this</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as 3d by Youngique, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> and I have to tell you - for a normal day of running errands</li>
            <li> a normal person&#x27;s reaction would be to this product.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying i am obsessed with finding the BEST mascara to make my thin and light lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because I have watery eyes and it smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li> I normally like to brighten up the lashes I have and call it a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried it twice, thinking I possibly didn&#x27;t follow the directions very well the first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple.</li>
            <li> As long as these tubes last a couple months, I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> all the fibers had fallen off and her lashes looked normal again.</li>
            <li> I am now a firm believer, I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I applied the fibers, I got a few clumps, but was able to fix that no problem.</li>
            <li> I can now skip trying to fuss with false lashes and still have big, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> the application - gel is fine, but the other is just a bunch of clumps.  </li>
            <li> but I would recommend applying less fibers to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> soon as I applied the Sealing Gel to my right eye, I could already see that my non existent lashes were not as non existent as I was led to believe when using my regular over the counter mascara products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone.</li>
            <li> You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone.</li>
            <li> Then, I applied the 2-step Bella Eleganze mascara, per the instructions, only on my right eye for comparison purposes.</li>
            <li> gives me very long full looking lashes,does not flack off all</li>
            <li> super mega long.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes super long</li>
            <li> I have alright lashes, they aren&#x27;t super long or anything</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because I had good results with younique fiber lashes, however, this product has several negative issues.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try something new.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new fiber lashes through a promotional price to see if it works.</li>
            <li> I just told him it was new mascara</li>
            <li> but I have rosacea (this is new)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love my new hairbrush.</li>
            <li> the fact that I have vision issues and when I use conventional over the counter mascara products it usually ends up on my nose and eyelids, and I had all but given up on having attractive eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really no better than a very cheap dollar store mascara.  </li>
            <li> You do have to work quickly, but your lashes do not clump and they are very long.</li>
            <li> I never leave my house without, this was really easy to apply and less time.</li>
            <li> A cheap imitation of Youniques Fiber Lashes.  </li>
            <li> Always put a final coat of the gel or regular mascara on to secure the fibers in place.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and worried the fibers would bother me, but so far not so much.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and was worried about that also, but the mascara does not seem to irritate my eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you want a very natural look, use THIS mascara by itself.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive eyes and was worried about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also takes a lot of effort to get a long eyelash effect if you have short lashes like me, so you might as well be better off spending $20 on buying some really good pairs of fake lashes that you can re-use a couple of times.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used fiber mascara, I have about 10 different mascaras and not one of them has come close to giving me longer fuller lashes.  </li>
            <li> I first put a coat of my regular mascara</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;ve run into (and its really my own fault for being lazy) is that you have to make sure you take it off every evening because if you leave it on, the next morning you will be clumpy and it&#x27;s harder to get off after sleeping with it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s legit the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> I apply my regular mascara first, then the gel -</li>
            <li> First you apply the gel to one set of lashes only.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to come across an extreme coupon for this product.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use but only if I I am willing to put up with some eye irritation if the flakes fall in.</li>
            <li> I only had issues with the fibers falling off onto my face the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as younique...case and everything but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used any mascara that wasn&#x27;t the traditional mascara.  </li>
            <li> I only needed the first swipe with the fibers.</li>
            <li> I have pretty short lashes</li>
            <li> I was a bit unconvinced of this product&#x27;s claims with the recent push of fiber mascaras but this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> the 3rd time with a coat of mascara first.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t ever have to worry about getting your lashes fixed at a salon again!</li>
            <li> no smudge at all  for those of you who are not sure, try it you will love it..</li>
            <li> all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> I went ahead and applied a coat of my regular mascara first, then the sealer, then the fibers, then the sealers.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement with first application compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look natural while standing out!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral.</li>
            <li> actually could see my eyelashes which made it very easy to apply the Green Tea Fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This  removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this for everything, but especially any event or special occasion, especially the upcoming holidays!</li>
            <li> I have thin short eyelashes and this worked amazingly on me!</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li> It makes your eyelashes longer in a few seconds and easy to use</li>
            <li> Less expensive and works great!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these 3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for everyone who wants natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> It works really well for 2-3 weeks, and it actually makes my super short Asian eyelashes look a lot longer!</li>
            <li> The second one leaves little bits of lint like material around my eyes (mostly underneath) and I have to &amp;</li>
            <li> Tubes feel cheaply made, the gel doesn&#x27;t&#x27; seem wet enough to hold the fibers.</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> WOW was when I applied the product!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and we just couldn&#x27;t get it to come out looking natural.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t think it will be in my everyday ration since my daily look is more natural.</li>
            <li> This product looks amazingly natural.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Younique and has the same effect.</li>
            <li> The following day I ordered the product through Amazon at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are absolutely what they say they are I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> WOW, tried to take a picture to show everyone, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> They look natural and no clumps.</li>
            <li> I look at my husband&#x27;s lashes and just wonder why I can&#x27;t have those naturally.</li>
            <li> I must have just gotten unlucky &amp; got an old batch.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> The gel is stringy and the fibers don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> I do have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> no problem, easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an issues with fibers falling off into my eyes, and my normally sensitive eyes showed no irritation with this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , spend the extra $5.00 and get the real 3-D Fiber-lash.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes fuller and they&#x27;re natural.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my eyelashes have thinned,</li>
            <li> Your eyelashes will definitely appear much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I would have stuck with the fiber lash if it at least made my lashes look fuller/longer, but i get better results with just the L&#x27;oreal and Revlon mascaras.</li>
            <li> It does not give you tarantula looking lashes and it leaves your lashes looking like a natural lash falsies look.</li>
            <li> i actually change my mind and like it as much as younique.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, too.</li>
            <li> I am 82 years old and I tried this product, and I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> Just spend the extra cash and buy Younique the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about make up and have to do a lot of experimenting with different products, which can get costly.</li>
            <li> everyday wear, I go with a light application of mascara.</li>
            <li> My lashes look natural but enhanced.</li>
            <li> I only tried one coat and lashes were fuller and much longer appearing than with just mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I at least got to try it.</li>
            <li> and she loves sealing gel but the natural fiber</li>
            <li> She says with the sealing gel she loves the way it looks without the natural fiber one.</li>
            <li> but I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> 3D Fiber Lash Mascara claims to provide a 300% INCREASE to your lashes and look completely natural and it does just that.</li>
            <li> , that my lashes don&#x27;t stick together and that the product is not heavy.</li>
            <li> This girl maybe in her early 20 came up to me ask me was</li>
            <li> By the time that she is done putting several coats on her lashes are as long and full looking as mine.</li>
            <li> If you are patient and careful, this can be a great alternative to false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this when I want my eyelashes to look full, long and evenly spread out.  </li>
            <li> , it looks good when I leave the house in the morning but by 4:30 in the afternoon it looks fake and clumpy.</li>
            <li> The gel is an ok base, but after the fibers, I suggest using own mascara.  </li>
            <li> It kind of looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> , make it look like I have on fake lashes especially the left eye that I had did good on then the right eye.</li>
            <li> Haha its my perfect little secret!!  </li>
            <li> My lashes look more  natural and not clumpy like the other which is more expensive and tacky looking.</li>
            <li> the product also gets pretty thick quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use false lashes for events and be happy with my natural lashes with mascara for the other days...</li>
            <li> The only time you should be quick is between the transporting gel and the micro-fibers (don&#x27;t want the gel to dry before the fibers get on)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for those looking to avoid the clumped eyelash look and looking for the long thin eyelash look!</li>
            <li> I recommend using regular mascara first and then following the steps for the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to say that I WILL be coming back and referring other ladies.</li>
            <li> The gel isn&#x27;t as good - not as thick or as dark.</li>
            <li> It pretty much doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore, so it&#x27;s extremely pricey for the short amount of time that it lasts.</li>
            <li> The product is okay, not worth $20 (certainly not over $20).</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky and might take me a time or too to master, but on first attempt the minimal clumping I saw was easily fixed with a quick swipe of an eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> I love how wide my eyes look, and there&#x27;s little to no fallout throughout my busy workday.</li>
            <li> This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers.  </li>
            <li> My lashes naturally are barely visible.</li>
            <li> The formula was light enough that my lashes did not feel heavy or look like one of those old vintage dolls with gobs of mascara on</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m used to using fake lashes and L&#x27;oreal or Revlon mascaras, and those work far better than this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in what other products this company offers.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that the Green Tea I drink pretty much daily, combined with a specially formulated Sealing Gel could make my eyelashes appear so Long</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that the Green Tea I drink pretty much daily, combined with a specially formulated Sealing Gel could make my eyelashes appear so Long</li>
            <li> But even for $10.00, I would have expected a little better</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes so thick and full!</li>
            <li> Follow the simple directions and your lashes will take on a new life.</li>
            <li> My lashes were very long but very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess if you love the thick, clumpy &amp;#34;looks horrible&amp;#34;, messy look, then, yes, this mascara will certainly do that for you!</li>
            <li> After I applied this, I left my house about 20 minutes later, and my eyes really started to water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first tube, the transplanting gel, looks just like regular mascara, that alone did make my lashes long.</li>
            <li> After a few tries I was able to get a look</li>
            <li> Paying the little extra for the more well known brands goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No other mascara beats this.</li>
            <li> and it actually made my eyelashes look a lot longer and natural!</li>
            <li> It was my first time using such a product and although I have wanted to use something like this for a very long time</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this type of product and it took a few tries for me to get it right.</li>
            <li> One of the sticks seemed dried up and the other one wasn&#x27;t any better than the mascara I got at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> With more use and practice I found that using less fibers creates less fall out on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I found that it is important to only apply a little of the fiber each layer, otherwise there is the potential for eye irritation.</li>
            <li> Not easy to layer and would require more product than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are short and stubby and I have bare spots where the lashes have completely stopped growing.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up really liking the finished result aside from some minor clumping</li>
            <li> second WOW came when I looked at the Instruction sheet that is included.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have very short natural lashes</li>
            <li> I was afraid of massive raccoon eyes, but it comes off in clumps with warm soapy water or in the shower--which is so  much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a couple times now and it barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> they said could barely tell I had any mascara</li>
            <li> I wore it daily for 7 days then decided to take a break and wear my old mascara...</li>
            <li> And they actually look quite natural.</li>
            <li> one eye bare...  </li>
            <li> I have barely there lashes</li>
            <li> This may work for women already generous eyelashes -- but, for someone like me, who barely has lashes, this did not work.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to do one side at a time and have both tubes in hand, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> As a beauty industry professional I have found that all fiber mascara helps lengthen and add volume to your lashes since the tiny fibers are added to it.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that looks natural on and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not have natural ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> for real girls and drag queens</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure my reaction was 100x worse than</li>
            <li> I love how thick and long this makes my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always  liked the fake eyelash look but thought it was cliche to glue things on your eyelids.  </li>
            <li> The nice part is it wasn&#x27;t clumpy and looking all fake.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but with somewhat difficult and long application process my lashes did look good.  </li>
            <li> i was so excited to try this product with all the good reviews, but i am soooo disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Almost like the gel was starting to dry out and the fibers weren&#x27;t  as much.</li>
            <li> A few extra steps in your daily routine, but definately worth it to me!</li>
            <li> , my lash line is too uneven for them to sit right.</li>
            <li> I did what other suggested and just did one eye at a time, but because of the results with the first one, I was in a hurry to do the second.  </li>
            <li> So if you want multiple coats, you have to do this multiple times, meaning I had to complete six steps with this mascara, where I would only need to complete 2 or 3 with another mascara.    </li>
            <li> Other than it making my eyes really irritated, I like this but</li>
            <li> and my lashes are long, full, and dark, and last all day.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were long and black, very pretty.</li>
            <li> I will say that this did NOT flake down my face throughout the day, so that was positive.</li>
            <li> It is a bit time consuming, but the effect is so worth the extra minute or two to apply another few coats.</li>
            <li> I was excited at first, but the product became messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I personally found it easier to apply than false eyelashes and the look is more</li>
            <li> They did make my eyes water a little at first</li>
            <li> have never before owned a Mascara Product that comes with a Carry Case, and this case has an Extremely High Class and Expensive Appearance!&lt;br /&gt;Inside the case I found the Beautiful Tubes of the 3D collagen grafted carbon black liquid Sealing Gel and the Green Tea Fibers.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I was just sweating more then typical</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to use and makes you lash long and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascaras before and this one has been my least favorite.</li>
            <li> They did not come out looking like a big hot mess like some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I repeatedly spent so much $ on different  type of mascara&#x27;s all promising to make my lashes longer, thicker, &amp; all of the above.</li>
            <li> First you use the grafting mascara and then add the green tea fibers over and keep building until you have the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase a few weeks ago and I loooove how it makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer!</li>
            <li> You apply that first, then the green tea fiber, and another coat of the gel.  </li>
            <li> I was amusingly surprised seeing anything near my eyes tear me up, I have to be so very careful of the make up I buy and use,</li>
            <li> For the most dramatic results I curl mine, put a coat of my regular mascara, and then do 2-3 cycles of the gel/fiber.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the need to repeat and have this whole process down to taking about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try these because I have horribly short brittle thin lashes, but when they arrived I noticed the website says  DO NOT use with contact lenses, so i was so depressed, but I gave them to my sister who has the same issues I do and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have very long eyelashes naturally, but they are on the thinner side.  </li>
            <li> It gives your lashes a little more length than regular mascara, but I won&#x27;t be using it again :/</li>
            <li> The fibers go on next and was a little different at first</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes about this after reading several other reviews.</li>
            <li> It cakes up too much and you have constant black dots on your face from flaking</li>
            <li> and I will honestly say that I was a little cautious because I have hard both negative and positive things about 3D fiber.</li>
            <li> worked very well however by the end of the day you get lots of little fibers all over your face.</li>
            <li> Fast glam with little</li>
            <li> I put a little bid of my regular mascara on (don&#x27;t have to use as much), then I used the gel which is just like putting on mascara.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as well as other similar mascaras and dried up quickly.</li>
            <li> It gave  her the thick full long lashes she wanted</li>
            <li> I have applied a second coat when going out in the evening, once, but found one coat to be my sweet spot and using this product alone without a base of mascara (I actually prefer it alone), leaves lashes more soft and less crunchy.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only Fiber lash product I&#x27;ve tried and considering I typically don&#x27;t have visible eye lashes this has transformed my eyes, and my life!!</li>
            <li> The other kinds, however, was far more expensive and had mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> and I get compliments on how pretty my plain jane brown eyes are!  </li>
            <li> I had expected my lashes to be much more dramatic than it was.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only weird thing is the seller will try to do a phone call follow up a couple weeks later, but carefully check out your emails because it&#x27;s easy to opt out of!</li>
            <li> amazing substitute for fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Its and old remedy for truly making your face moist and it also saves hundreds on makeup removers and other moisturizers , it helps prevent wrinkles and its all I use</li>
            <li> Crushed since I was so happy with it :(</li>
            <li> The fibers make such a huge difference, and with only one layer of application, yet I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;over done&amp;#34; wearing it for daily errands and casual events.</li>
            <li> The representative responded to my email within a few hours, apologized, and sent a completely new set, which I received 2 days later!</li>
            <li> So previously I could only get so far with mascaras.</li>
            <li> I may use this product again when I have a lot of time to get ready, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy again.    </li>
            <li> But it doesnt last long at all</li>
            <li> Big brown eyes, long lashes.  </li>
            <li> I only do one to two coats because my lashes are so long.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time but if a flake falls in your eye it is irratating.  </li>
            <li> They were definitely long enough!</li>
            <li> Super cute but a major pain in the ass to put on and clumps bad!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go to far down with the fiber brush.</li>
            <li> I spent the same amount of time I normally would with my previous mascara</li>
            <li> I love the look of individually applied false eyelashes, but usually don&#x27;t have the time it takes to get them on properly.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look super long amd thick!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try this product as I was reading the instructions, but WOW!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry then apply the next coat.</li>
            <li> Application isn&#x27;t difficult but it&#x27;s easy to over-apply.</li>
            <li> found the it lasted as long and looked just as much as competitors fiber lash kits I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> However, the gel that attaches the fibers onto your lashes dried out within 3 weeks of opening it, and the effect was no where near the same.</li>
            <li> I have overly short lashes and have trouble finding mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and gives me my desired length while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> This product definitely thickens, lengthens and looks natural for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to my expectations and definitely does not even come close to the way it is advertised!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the positive and negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The gel is different but after getting used to that, the mascara stays on for a real long time and doesnt flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I get it right, I my short, thin eyelashes are transformed into long, fluttery lashes.</li>
            <li> The last time I went on a trip, the inner collar on one of the tubes pushed in and caused a big mess.</li>
            <li> is all I can say I used this for the first time this mrning and my lashes look thick and full, it is insane with the diffrence, I am so in love with this and will be getting this for as long as you make it for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding out that as one gets older, stuff thins out, especially hair, except for those pesky, often thick and wiry CHIN HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too hard to apply but if you use too much the fibers will flake onto your face.  </li>
            <li> They do last long time.......days!!!</li>
            <li> The fibers come out in a huge glob and are difficult to disperse.</li>
            <li> Although the mascara delivers on making your lashes more volumous and long, it sheds like crazy and causes irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li> only was there No Mascara Smudges on my nose or eyelids, but there was absolutely No Flaking, so I didn&#x27;t have to touch up my foundation after applying this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only was there No Mascara Smudges on my nose or eyelids, but there was absolutely No Flaking, so I didn&#x27;t have to touch up my foundation after applying this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> if you have naturally long eyelashes</li>
            <li> It also flakes all freaking day long and falls on my face.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bleed it doesn&#x27;t run or surge even over night and through long days.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this off fast enough, worse yet was the fact that the next morning I was still getting the fibers out of my eye.  </li>
            <li> Again, it is minimal and does not bother me enough to stop using the product.  </li>
            <li> I like how it makes my lashes look so long.</li>
            <li> Must have for long lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look long and a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but with this stuff</li>
            <li> Try and keep your eye as closed as possible when putting on the fibers so they don&#x27;t get in your eye!)</li>
            <li> I achieved the same look minus the irritation with Maybelline + ScandalQueen.</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and look fake but totally my lashes</li>
            <li> In short, yes, you can achieve the look you see in the advertisements, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth all of the steps and the itchiness, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 other fiber lashes that is the same concept as these.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long and voluminous!</li>
            <li> It literally transformed my tiny little lashes into fuller, longer, sexier lashes instantly.</li>
            <li> I will tell you, I did as the other customers, mascara, gel, fibers, gel, fibers and then last coat of mascara to seal it all in.  </li>
            <li> , It stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> , I just apply the mascara and then fibers immediately after then go and do other eye, if you get fibers on your face just put hair dryer on low and blow them off!</li>
            <li> i can not seem to keep them as big as other reviewers are saying without them looking like spiders, but I will keep playing with it.</li>
            <li> The photo that I posted is only ONE coat, and I didn&#x27;t have to use any other mascara</li>
            <li> but yet it gives you thicker looking lashes all day long!</li>
            <li> I did not have the same experience with the other brand I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had long lashes, and this product works as promised!</li>
            <li> I didnt have any problems with fallout with the fibers ,like i have from other fiber mascaras, it left my lashes looking fuller and</li>
            <li> Makes my eye lashes look very long.  </li>
            <li> So dry couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> (I have dry eye and need to keep applying lubricants).</li>
            <li> When I opened the mascara, one of them was dry inside and not working.</li>
            <li> The inside broke within a day, it was so dry</li>
            <li> I swipe a clean mascara brush afterwards to lessen the amount of fibers so my lashes don&#x27;t look as fake.</li>
            <li> I never have considered using them in the past because I have really long eye lashes naturally.</li>
            <li> After having such a positive experience the first time I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but the fibers continually fell into my eyes and it is not very clean looking as if I were to use regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I have the shortest lashes and usually wear false lashes, but after using this it almost seems like I have my false ones in, only more natural!</li>
            <li> The fibers are dry but the transfer gel will hold the fibers as long as the gel is still wet while applying them.</li>
            <li> I can see one or two lashes with a tiny bit of length but the rest just look clumpy and dark.</li>
            <li> Putting this on can be a bit messy if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> it really does make your lashes so long and thick!</li>
            <li> This is the first fiber lash product I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t leave me with little black flecks on my cheeks after a few hours.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, the fibers break loose and you then have fibers in your eye and under it as well.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is trying to keep the fibers out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Took waaayyy to long!!</li>
            <li> I suck at putting fake lashes on, but I want long pretty lashes!</li>
            <li> These need to be added to the still moist sealant and only start at the half way</li>
            <li> I wear contacts daily and these didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, they didn&#x27;t flake or leave black residue under my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> This product was much  less and does the very same thing and it DOES work.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long, thick and lush.  </li>
            <li> , that is as far as I go - it makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes SO thick and lush and long!!  </li>
            <li> Like I said, i&#x27;ve tried a similar product and had a little eye irritation but nothing compared to this.</li>
            <li> the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that after a while it flakes a little.</li>
            <li> The little pieces of fuzz &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; end up going into my eye and causing irritation to my eye ball before I even get the chance to put the second gel coat on.</li>
            <li> and they were hard to get onto my lashes naturally looking.</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment</li>
            <li> They were each held in place by Individual Leather Bands that are firmly attached to the bottom of the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, it adds maybe 5-7 minutes to my routine and comes off just like my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful</li>
            <li> Every fiber lash product is different and it takes a few times to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful I am it flakes and gets in my eyes and irritates them.</li>
            <li> Have to apply a few times before getting desired length, but I have short lashes</li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful or your lashes to end up looking looking a bit clumpy, i wear contacts and it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all</li>
            <li> Do have to be careful not to get them in your eyes though.  </li>
            <li> 4 starts because it is one of the few mascaras that has actually made my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I never really had the time to do my research.</li>
            <li> I am going to try again for I don&#x27;t use it everyday only when going out so will keep trying it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have noticed that the fibers come off onto my face everyday.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is child resistant, it&#x27;s tightly closed.</li>
            <li> Just curious, isn&#x27;t this a copy cat of the Youngtique which you buy thru consultants online.  </li>
            <li> what I expected based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> After that dried, I did a 2nd coat.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my left eye was so irritated that I began investigating.  </li>
            <li> after eye drops, and being careful to not scratch my eye with the fibers, I washed it all off...</li>
            <li> It is messy and gets on my face under my eyes and I feel like I constantly have something in my eyes.</li>
            <li> My lashes look much longer without me having to add false lashes</li>
            <li> I have never had much in the way of lashes and false lashes</li>
            <li> Between the eyelash curler and using these two I end up with very long dark lashes that make my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> one tube has long string like black fibers(?)</li>
            <li> The directions call for you to put on some of your mascara, let it dry, then apply the gel product that comes in a typical mascara tube, then while the gel is still wet, apply the fiber product that also comes in a mascara tube.</li>
            <li> and I have spent well over $100 already on other mascaras and none ever worked.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money for such a little amount.</li>
            <li> With the other brand they were so stiff that if I brushed against them, they moved and stayed moved!</li>
            <li> When I need truly awesome length, I use the mascara that comes with it, along with the fibers, and I get lashes that look like I&#x27;m using artificial lashes -- without the hassle of applying artificial lashes!  </li>
            <li> if you are unhappy or not satisfied with the mascara, Try it risk free!</li>
            <li> Serious wow factor.</li>
            <li> This definetely thickens the eyelashes and makes them a little longer, but not as long as I thought - it looks like you have a lot of mascara on.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes look naturally longer versus clumpy or ridiculous the way the other one worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras to lengthen my eyelashes</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t wear as nicely as other mascaras.</li>
            <li> then on to the other eye.  </li>
            <li> I hope the ingredient list is true and that it doesn&#x27;t have something dangerous that causes the smell.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but she insisted on a trial application.</li>
            <li> The other products would take forever.</li>
            <li> At first it can be difficult to figure out the process</li>
            <li> The taller tube holds the glue-like mascara and the other contains the 3D fibers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 other name brands, and this outperformed both of them.</li>
            <li> , I will buy again due to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just lazy with the extra layers that have to be applied.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other products.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item, due to the fact that my eye lashes have diminished with age.</li>
            <li> I purchased glue on eye lashes, but due to the fact hat I can&#x27;t apply them with my (bi-focal) glasses on and can&#x27;t see to apply them with the glasses off</li>
            <li> I have tried other fiber mascras and did not like them.</li>
            <li> My eye was extremely irritated within minutes of putting this mascara on, then started burning and my vision got blurry.  </li>
            <li> The formula of the sealing gel is thicker than the other mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried which is something that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about that other brand....</li>
            <li> So I wanted to see how this would do in comparison to other mascara I buy from the department store.  </li>
            <li> I put this mascara on one eye and another on the other eye.  </li>
            <li> If you want your eyes to POP, use this WITH your other mascara.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to the product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this version over the other one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products that Bella Eleganze comes out with.</li>
            <li> A LOT cheaper than all the other one&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> Works just like the other brand in my opinion</li>
            <li> I have no need to use any other mascara with this.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am extremely picky about mascara</li>
            <li> Some lashes were noticeably longer than other lashes.</li>
            <li> While I was skeptical, this mascara really does make your lashes fuller and darker!  </li>
            <li> but i was very careful with the application too.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I applied it incorrectly, so I tried it again, being very careful to seal the fibers correctly.  </li>
            <li> The smaller tube contains the fibers, they are tiny thin pieces that you apply just like a mascara</li>
            <li> This really lengthens and volumizes my lashes like crazy definitely my go to mascara</li>
            <li> was not worth the money, something from the drugstore would have been just the same if not better</li>
            <li> , Some people put a coat of regular mascara on first as a base, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first since I have seen some bad results from other fiber last mascsras.</li>
            <li> It does flake a little even when you use the sealer,but that&#x27;s to be expected because it&#x27;s microfiber.</li>
            <li> This is a two step process, actually three steps per eye, so 6 steps at least.  </li>
            <li> I tried eyelash extensions once and hated them - the glue irritated my eyes and I just couldn&#x27;t wear them, but of course I love the long luscious lashes look.  </li>
            <li> Its really not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it to me...</li>
            <li> vanity has a price, but for me my vision is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was careful not to coat too heavily</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come as expected was all dried out</li>
            <li> I like Younique&#x27;s base gel better</li>
            <li> It was just extremely annoying until I was able to remove the fiber from my eye.</li>
            <li> I tried Bella Eleganze as a less expensive version of Younique 3D Fiber mascara and am very dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> even down to eyeliner and eye colors.</li>
            <li> I found that if you lean forward (look down) that can help keep the junk from falling in your eyes when aplying</li>
            <li> After a little research I went with this product because of other reviews and price.  </li>
            <li> Not as thick as some of the other fiber lashes i have purchased, but does the trick with a few extra coats.  </li>
            <li> like you&#x27;re suppose to with other fiber mascara brands!</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!</li>
            <li> Empowering other woman!</li>
            <li> I usually use it when I&#x27;m going for a dramatic or really dark look just because it works really well at thickening and extending your lashes.</li>
            <li> I did notice minimal irritation due to the small fibers getting into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real sure</li>
            <li> I did end up with black flakes</li>
            <li> I find tny black particles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had a slight learning curve using this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super girly.</li>
            <li> Both times the fibers are everywhere on my face, under the eyes, over the eyes, you name it, there are black fibers everywhere on the face.  </li>
            <li> I tried the current big deal brand that all of my friends are selling and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> But I suppose that is what you are to expect for half the price.</li>
            <li> I saw no additional length over my typical products.</li>
            <li> It did extend my lashes, but the fibers flaked all over my face and smudged not to mention flaked in my eyes and the whites of my eyes had black specks all over them.  </li>
            <li> Longer, fuller lashes without the mess of falsies and in less than half the time.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to mess with stinky, messy glue and the dark eyeliner</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked thick and long.  </li>
            <li> It did separate my lashes which made them look long, but not as thick as promised</li>
            <li> My lashes look very long, thick and defined.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I looked in the mirror and all these fibers were all over under my eyes looking as if my under eye area was black.  </li>
            <li> Only small complaint is sometimes when I&#x27;m applying it</li>
            <li> I am so bad with putting on fake lashes, they are always a mess, but I love to look glamorous!</li>
            <li> and I had to use a little bit of force to get it released.</li>
            <li> The little fibers flaked off.  </li>
            <li> Tried this one to save a little money</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of time to get used to using the product</li>
            <li> but when I saw the price of that product I choked a little.  </li>
            <li> I did end up getting a little fiber in my eye.</li>
            <li> I get a little fiber in my eye.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it goes on quite heavy and then gets a little clumpy</li>
            <li> I have always had very short lashes and have tried artificial lashes, glued in individual ones, etc</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, it has abated.</li>
            <li> and I never buy into gimmicky things,</li>
            <li> but my sister like it to the point she is using it everyday</li>
            <li> Doing one eye at a time I applied the gel and immediately applied the 3D fibers let it sit for a few seconds and then applied the gel again.</li>
            <li> I still use it this way for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to use this a few times going out on the town</li>
            <li> I have used this a few months and haven&#x27;t noticed that it broke my lashes or hurt them</li>
            <li> if you have used younique and are looking for a bargain, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it out a few days now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it, so as not to waste the purchase.</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with my lashes clumping and looking uneven and this fixes those problems.</li>
            <li> The green tea fibers can be a bit clumpy, but can be managed.</li>
            <li> I sometimes got green tea flakes in my eyes and on my face during the day.</li>
            <li> This product is messy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and takes a lot of time to apply.</li>
            <li> I had watched a few YouTube videos on this product</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with short, thin eye lashes and no amount of mascara helped.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I finally resolved the tired eyes issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too impatient to wait for an order from younique.</li>
            <li> You put on one of the tubes, then the green tea fibers.  </li>
            <li> I did this a few times and my lashes did get longer each time.  </li>
            <li> My lashes actually look fuller because I have thin lashes.</li>
            <li> It can be irritating if applied too close to the lid, so be forewarned...but if properly used, it makes my lashes longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> and she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked messy.  </li>
            <li> item was dried up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really replaces false lashes, but I personally get annoyed wearing false lashes and this product adds length and thickness without that &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Totally work the cost, they look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> Personally, I found this to be very clumpy and worthless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false lashes before and the glue irritated my eyes, but this gives you the same effect but with NO irritation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person</li>
            <li> That worked better than the other 2 times, but it flakes horribly</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have never used a beauty product that made such a dramatic improvement in a single use.</li>
            <li> There was a bit of a learning curve for me, and it&#x27;s an additional step in my makeup routine, but it does make my lashes long and thick!  </li>
            <li> What I noticed is that my lashes were so long and thick!  </li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS!  </li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked at the way just one coat made my eyelashes fuller without being clumpy.</li>
            <li> This one is a minor issue the elastic piece that is in place to separate the gel tube from the fiber tube was broken.</li>
            <li> long False Lashes.....</li>
            <li> Usually my cover girl and my maybeline brands leave my eye lashes stiff and</li>
            <li> The last two times I ordered it was dried out or something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of the &amp;#34;extended lash&amp;#34; products, only to be frustrated with the results.</li>
            <li> Going back to the cheaper stuff, found out from this crap that I do love the other stuff I usually buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems though that there is very little of the fiber and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an everyday mascara for me and something I&#x27;ll continue to use!</li>
            <li> Horrible this is not the same product I bought at first.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will continue to buy this item if the price is raised again.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but it caused me an eye infection and was not able to wear any mascara for 2 weeks and had to get eye drops.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it; I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Usually when I wear mascara my eyes burn by the end of the day</li>
            <li> not really sure on this</li>
            <li> I usually use physicians formula mascara</li>
            <li> Very similar to fake lashes, but without the hassle of figuring out how to put them on.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I used fake lashes or over compensated with thick dark eyeliner.</li>
            <li> is no more.</li>
            <li> No more for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  </li>
            <li> but no more difficult than applying regular mascara once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if thats typica</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have small eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> This 3D Fiber Lash Mascara gives you the same look of false eyelashes, literally in just seconds!</li>
            <li> I no longer need to buy false lashes cuz it makes them look so thick and long</li>
            <li> I have always had very thin, short eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I felt like little demons were poking my eyes with pitch forks all day.</li>
            <li> It definitely extended my lashes but didn&#x27;t keep them up very long :(</li>
            <li> Very upset :(</li>
            <li> It definitely made my eyelashes look very dramatic.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, results are insane.</li>
            <li> Gave me thick long lashes without making them look fake.</li>
            <li> and I have hardly any eyelashes to begin with 😊</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product but totally disappointed .</li>
            <li> It goes on very thick and clumps heavily.</li>
            <li> At least 3 people have asked me if I am wearing falsies or if I got lash extensions.</li>
            <li> duh......</li>
            <li> Sadly, after about 4 uses, I noticed the tube of fibers was completely empty.</li>
            <li> I looked into returning or replacing the item, but Amazon said it was too late.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be careful of is to apply the fibers mid-lash to the end and not to apply the fibers at the base of the lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed around late afternoon after wearing it all day that the lashes were brushing off and all over my face.</li>
            <li> At least 10-20 fibers were in my eye...</li>
            <li> Still have trouble witn tes getting in my eyes and irritating them.</li>
            <li> It lengthens my lashes and makes them look thick.</li>
            <li> Not amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> and I can build it up to make them as thick as I want.</li>
            <li> hate this soooo much.</li>
            <li> I have missing and broken eyelashes and this products has helped.</li>
            <li> They fill in the broken, missing portion of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Gave me the look of false lashes without all the mess and fuss!</li>
            <li> I mean it does work</li>
            <li> Will stick to my usual Loreal mascara!</li>
            <li> I mean, it works well.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Not cute!</li>
            <li> but to all the scary pictures of people using other fiber mascaras.</li>
            <li> I belong to sweet adelines and hate putting on fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Latisse which is very expensive and can only be purchased from a doctor.  </li>
            <li> Not real impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I used Younique and tried this product because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I went online and did a ton of research and found this brand to be the highest rated and less expensive, so I decided to give it a try for the price.</li>
            <li> I tried it several times and it was so bad</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a good</li>
            <li> But not a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed, can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for it :(</li>
            <li> Thé fiber wand was very thin and dried out.</li>
            <li> What a waste of a lot of money for a very poor product.</li>
            <li> I would see others with the long lushes lashes just making me frustrated</li>
            <li> No more spending on false lashes!</li>
            <li> , you dont want it to be too thick and look like tarantula eyes!    </li>
            <li> I wasted my money!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get out and also smells a LOT like chemicals ... scary.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m addicted,  </li>
            <li> Fibers irritating to eyes.</li>
            <li> Thin lashes before...</li>
            <li> Not happy with</li>
            <li> It is really not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so irritating to my eyes that I just can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely addicted to this mascara now, 3D rocks.</li>
            <li> My lashes just looked clumpy and awful and like I had way too much makeup globbed on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely irritating.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my sister and was slightly confused as how to use it</li>
            <li> My lashes are sparse and short and I hate them.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but still am not happy with the product</li>
            <li> Not happy with my purchase at all</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bothering my eyes, and they look like I have false eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> I blinked, then winked, then asked if I&#x27;d gotten false eyelashes in my package&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you want the false eyelash look but don&#x27;t want the hassle of gluing bits of things to your eye, this is the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes look longer and fuller to where I don&#x27;t need false lashes on my eyes to go out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I put on false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wear false ones</li>
            <li> The girls at work noticed immediately, they thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> she hasnt worn false lashes since then.</li>
            <li> Bella Eleganze gives me that false lash look without any clumps and without having to apply false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think this is a dynamite look without false lashes or tons of gunky mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get false eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> Not good stringy product application difficult</li>
            <li> :(( groups them together, which looks super bad!</li>
            <li> This product produced dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I use Sephora or Dior base mascara, let it dry, apply the gel, then the fibers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge and is not too stiff and annoying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really annoying to have to apply gel / fuzzy thing / gel every single time.</li>
            <li> worst one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> The product smells old, works terrible!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> did everything they said to- fibers to thick!!</li>
            <li> Not too bad if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> a few fibers do get into the eye :(</li>
            <li> Plus, I hate the feel of mascara weighing down my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> the little fibers kept falling into my eyes and irritating me!!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I have almost no lashes its so weird</li>
            <li> I thought it would be complicated to apply but it is not.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use</li>
            <li> Sadly this brand does not come close to the expensive one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, and I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on it!</li>
            <li> and I did not get that \\&quot;spider legs\\&quot; look that causes me to shy away from this technique.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the scary eyes, but To give a closeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the fake lashes..  </li>
            <li> It also has a weird odor to it.</li>
            <li> so you dont look weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really sad about this.</li>
            <li> I am not a Mascara person because I have terrible allergies and my eyes water when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> So sad the quality was not as they claimed.</li>
            <li> the expensive one...</li>
            <li> This is like my holy grail the difference it makes on your eyes is crazy would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like spending time putting false lashes on like myself</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was about to invest in those fake implants</li>
            <li> but think of the time it would take you to put on some fake lashes - and the glue,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when trying this</li>
            <li> They look longer too like fake ones,individual.</li>
            <li> but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> When I typed in my search engine Youniqe lashes, this is what pulled up, needless to say,</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara - this fails.  </li>
            <li> i fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wear fake lashes  anymore and to curl them</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Will never use false lashes again!</li>
            <li> They are also very irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail the other day and it is horrible.</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions to the letter or you will be disappointed, worse</li>
            <li> It was frustrating :(</li>
            <li> The transplanting mascara smells awful and doesn&#x27;t even work well for the green tea lash fibers to stick.</li>
            <li> It flakes and gets into my eyes which drives me absolutely crazy.</li>
            <li> I was very much afraid of getting the dreaded spider-leg-lashes, but that&#x27;s not at all the look that I got from this mascara.</li>
            <li> Went on weird and ugly.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to remove.  </li>
            <li> seriously, it was terrifying!</li>
            <li> The fibers didn&#x27;t stick well except in sections of each lash and that created a bad mascara effect.</li>
            <li> It irritated my eyes so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home from work to take it</li>
            <li> BAD FOR YOU EYES</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think people get frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed .</li>
            <li> but then I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> Fibers get everywhere, it stinks, clumps and burns your eyes!</li>
            <li> It was horrible,  Not good quality and very expensive,  Fancy packaging and case but terrible product.</li>
            <li> flakes got into my eyes :(</li>
            <li> However somewhat disappointed at flaking.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If there is a bad review its crap</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks that they are fake lashes!!</li>
            <li> stupid</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try fiber lash mascara but was afraid I would spend all that money and it wouldn&#x27;t work or it would look terrible and clumpy.</li>
            <li> If you apply at the base of your lashes, the fibers will get in your eyes and cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I lose a lot of items and would hate to lose one of the set.</li>
            <li> Residue falls into the eyes, very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eye...so painful!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I will not experience having fibers in my eyes; it sounds painful!</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Want it refunded ASAP very disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with it and do not plan to try it again.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I personally love this product!  I used it today and i have sensitive eyes and I&#x27;m a contact wearer, makes my eyes look so nice and longgg eyelashes!  Love it</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have almost no lashes its so weird but this along with my regular mascara works awesome! I have never looked like I had that many eyelashes ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would get it all over my face since Im very clumsy but its very precise and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Product works exactly how it claims it will!!</li>
            <li> I hated this product! I had fiber flakes ALL OVER my cheeks. I recommend no one to buy this mascara! It definitely is NOT the best out there! It runs, it flakes, it clumps and it smears! GROSS.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the high $$$ that some of my friends were paying for their YOUNIQUE fiber mascaras.  After a little research I went with this product because of other reviews and price.  I really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;What works best for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply my favorite mascara&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply this gel&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply fiber&lt;br /&gt;4. RE-apply gel.  If you don&#x27;t reapply the gel then you will have fiber under your eye area.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used fiber mascara, I have about 10 different mascaras and not one of them has come close to giving me longer fuller lashes.  I&#x27;ve used Bella Elegance for about three weeks and I have to say I&#x27;m addicted,  I thought it would be complicated to apply but it is not.  I first put a coat of my regular mascara then apply the gel followed by the fibers and then the gel again.  I love this stuff and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The fibers got into my eyes...  Difficult to use</li>
            <li> I have tried other mascaras to lengthen my eyelashes and I have spent well over $100 already on other mascaras and none ever worked.  I really like 3D fiber lash mascara. It truly works.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Donna Geiger</li>
            <li> I love trying new mascara and was so excited to get this. The mascara really does seal so no embarrassing flakes or smudges. It stayed on all day and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply in evening. My lashes look longer and fuller using this.</li>
            <li> Thyroid issues have left me with non existent eyelashes. They are short and stubby and I have bare spots where the lashes have completely stopped growing.  Add to that the fact that I have vision issues and when I use conventional over the counter mascara products it usually ends up on my nose and eyelids, and I had all but given up on having attractive eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;When I was offered the opportunity to test and review this Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Bella Eleganze at a reduced price, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try, so I hesitantly accepted the offer and placed an order.&lt;br /&gt;Having never before used a 3D Fiber Mascara, my expectations were not very high, however, I don&#x27;t think I have ever used the word WOW as much as I did when I received this product and opened the box!&lt;br /&gt;My initial WOW came out of my mouth as I removed the Super Sturdy and Attractive, Textured Case with Bella Eleganze&#x27;s Name Embossed in Gold from the outer box.&lt;br /&gt;I have never before owned a Mascara Product that comes with a Carry Case, and this case has an Extremely High Class and Expensive Appearance!&lt;br /&gt;Inside the case I found the Beautiful Tubes of the 3D collagen grafted carbon black liquid Sealing Gel and the Green Tea Fibers. Each tube was Embossed in Gold Lettering for easy identification. They were each held in place by Individual Leather Bands that are firmly attached to the bottom of the case.&lt;br /&gt;My second WOW came when I looked at the Instruction sheet that is included. It&#x27;s printed on High Quality Glossy Paper and the Instructions were Very Easy to Understand and Follow. I love that Bella Eleganze didn&#x27;t skimp on the Font Size!&lt;br /&gt;But my Loudest WOW was when I applied the product!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I applied the Sealing Gel to my right eye, I could already see that my non existent lashes were not as non existent as I was led to believe when using my regular over the counter mascara products.&lt;br /&gt;I actually could see my eyelashes which made it very easy to apply the Green Tea Fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with a second coat of the Sealing Gel as instructed and when I looked in the mirror, I realized I was grinning from ear to ear!&lt;br /&gt;Not only was there No Mascara Smudges on my nose or eyelids, but there was absolutely No Flaking, so I didn&#x27;t have to touch up my foundation after applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;My reflection in the mirror revealed Extremely Long and Beautiful Eyelashes the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago. Who would have thought that the Green Tea I drink pretty much daily, combined with a specially formulated Sealing Gel could make my eyelashes appear so Long and Luscious!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to Easily Remove this Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara with my favorite makeup remover wipes, and there was no irritation to my sensitive eyes while wearing this Marvelous Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how Bella Eleganze is able to offer such a Premium Product at the affordable under $25 asking price, but I do know that I will definitely be placing another order and happily paying the full asking price when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely pleased to give this Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Bella Eleganze my highest recommendation!apply the Green Tea Fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with a second coat of the Sealing Gel as instructed and when I looked in the mirror, I realized I was grinning from ear to ear!&lt;br /&gt;Not only was there No Mascara Smudges on my nose or eyelids, but there was absolutely No Flaking, so I didn&#x27;t have to touch up my foundation after applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;My reflection in the mirror revealed Extremely Long and Beautiful Eyelashes the likes of which I had not seen since the onset of my thyroid condition many years ago.

            <li> Goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump at all!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Definitely makes your lashes appear 3 times longer than they are!</li>
            <li> its a hoooorrriiiible product! it doesnt work ! AT ALL!!  i cant belive people gave this product a 5 star review...going to the trush for sure!</li>
            <li> Whoa. This stuff is a trip! This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this type of product and it took a few tries for me to get it right. Once I finally got it applied, I felt like I had spider leg eyelashes. They were clumpy and unnatural looking. It could be user error, but I did try several times with a friend and we just couldn&#x27;t get it to come out looking natural. I wanted to love this product but it was too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I like it. I haven&#x27;t had any flaking or eyes burning issues. It goes on easy and makes my lashes look so much thicker and longer!  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is everything it claimed to be. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Was scared to order but so glad I did!! Love it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  Came in a box and the shell &amp;#34;sunglasses&amp;#34; type case and has both products. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I would say I like this product!</li>
            <li> Definitely adds volume and length!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara!!!! I was happy to get this on discount for review because I pretty much have no lashes to speak of. I was nervous at first that the fibers would get in my eye and irritate when I was trying to brush them on, but everything went great. It&#x27;s really easy, and I like that I don&#x27;t have to dig around my makeup case for both bottles because they come together in a case. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants fuller/longer lashes!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK. I achieved the same results with it as I would with a higher-end mascara like Benefit They&#x27;re Real or one from the Too Faced line. With They&#x27;re Real, I have to apply maybe two or three coats. With this mascara, I can achieve the look with two or three coats, but each coat requires two steps.    First, you apply the gel, then you apply the fibers, then you seal in the fibers with the gel. So if you want multiple coats, you have to do this multiple times, meaning I had to complete six steps with this mascara, where I would only need to complete 2 or 3 with another mascara.    After I applied this, I left my house about 20 minutes later, and my eyes really started to water. This lasted for about 15 minutes. Also, as I applied the fiber coat, the fibers would fall onto my cheeks.    In short, yes, you can achieve the look you see in the advertisements, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth all of the steps and the itchiness, at least for me. Perhaps if you have very short natural lashes it may be different. I may use this product again when I have a lot of time to get ready, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy again.    I will say that this did NOT flake down my face throughout the day, so that was positive.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the more expensive 3D fiber mascaras. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 2 weeks and I am still beyond in love. At least 3 people have asked me if I am wearing falsies or if I got lash extensions. Girls, do yourself a favor and buy these. I use them everyday, it adds maybe 5-7 minutes to my routine and comes off just like my regular mascara. For the most dramatic results I curl mine, put a coat of my regular mascara, and then do 2-3 cycles of the gel/fiber. I bought a metal lash comb and that comes in handy though it is really not a clumpy formula. I can&#x27;t imagine another brand working better than this I have zero complaints. Sorry if this review sounds too good to be true but this is seriously the greatest cosmetic to come out on the market in years!</li>
            <li> love this product. It gave me my lashes back. I&#x27;m finding out that as one gets older, stuff thins out, especially hair, except for those pesky, often thick and wiry CHIN HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I was able to enchance what I have left of my eye lashes to their fullest. First product I have used that lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li> ThIs mascara did wonders to my eyes! It may not be brand name, but it sure does the trick! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> According to the recipient it isn&#x27;t a good mascara. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Love the look and it really does add length and fillings to lashes....but, it&#x27;s not compatible with contact lenses with those fine fibers. Disappoint that I couldn&#x27;t use it but my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the mascara look but sometimes have fibers fall of under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, It truly does the job.</li>
            <li> Works much better than other fiber lash mascaras! Takes a little practice to get it right, but looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Quick service, great product!</li>
            <li> OMG 😱 wow! My eyelashes I thought were fine using convenience store brands but now I know I can get better results with this one. My lashes are full and look fake but totally my lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 other fiber lashes that is the same concept as these. I have to say these are my favorite by far. There&#x27;s no discomfort, as the fibers truly stay in place.  I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to a bunch of my friends and recieved compliments on my &amp;#34;long lashes.&amp;#34; Haha its my perfect little secret!!  soo easy to do, just follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;You could also use a spooley after applying fibers before the 2nd coat of gel for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  It takes a few coats for my desired length but worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first since I have seen some bad results from other fiber last mascsras. I was plesently suprised and how much I liked this. Up cclose it looked kind caked on but form farther away and in photos my eyelashes looked fantastic and no need for fake eyelashes here. You need to be careful Becuase it&#x27;s easy to over do it and then look like you have spider legs on your eyes. Overall I liked this product but i don&#x27;t think it will be in my everyday ration since my daily look is more natural. If your looking for a glamorous look this is a nice mascara:)</li>
            <li> love this! Makes my lashes look super full and long! I didn&#x27;t have any fall out and they stayed looking fabulous all day!!</li>
            <li> This is really awesome fiber lash. It is really high quality! Made my lashes longer and fuller. Stayed where it was supposed to! Great product! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> This is a great 3D Mascara!  It makes my short eyelashes look great and longer. I have started using it every day because I love the way it makes my eyes look!</li>
            <li> This 3D is better than that Younique version. The fibers do not irritate my eyes or fall off. My lashes look more  natural and not clumpy like the other which is more expensive and tacky looking. Best of all, there arent any sellers bombarding me with offers and pleas to buy that product.</li>
            <li> So dry couldn&#x27;t use. Want it refunded ASAP very disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes look full and long, just make sure you follow the directions clearly for optimal results. I get many compliments when using this mascara! The tiny fibers work to lengthen and thicken your lashes, then the sealing gel helps keep them all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is exquisite. 2 mascara looking tubes come packaged in a sturdy case that looks very similar to an eye glass case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tube, the transplanting gel, looks just like regular mascara, that alone did make my lashes long. After applying that, before it dries, you add the fibers. The smaller tube contains the fibers, they are tiny thin pieces that you apply just like a mascara and it extends the length of  your eyelashes but most of all makes them look very thick and full.</li>
            <li> I used this the 1st night I got it and it really works, but I noticed after an hour or so my eyes felt irritated. I was going to return it but then I did some research on the product and read that you are only supposed to use it mid line of the lash. So the next time I used it I tried it that way and so much better. Did not irritate my eye nor did this product flake. Now I can say after a whole day wear does not look as good as it did when I initially put it on, but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li> Applies great, lasts a long time, and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> its ok. Iv used Tarte, Lancome and regular stuff at the store. This does work alright but the fibers continually fell into my eyes and it is not very clean looking as if I were to use regular mascara. This also doesn&#x27;t wear as nicely as other mascaras. I wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> Gave me great length to my short lashes ,wonderful mascara</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!!! My eyelashes look long and voluminous! Great price, great product. I totally recommend this mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara for those looking to avoid the clumped eyelash look and looking for the long thin eyelash look! I love the case that this product comes packaged in.  It is very similar to an eyeglasses case but holds both the gel and the fiber tubes.  I found this product to be very effective when applying the gel, then fiber, then gel, then fiber. I would recommend repeating until you are satisfied with the look of your eyelashes. Overall, this is a great product and would make a great gift given the fancy packaging it comes in!</li>
            <li> This is a two step process, actually three steps per eye, so 6 steps at least.  First you put on a coat of the sealing gel, then the fibers, then the sealing gel again...then on to the other eye.  If you don&#x27;t already have a great mascara, this is a good one to show you what you&#x27;re missing...but there are great mascara&#x27;s out there that produce a similar look with one tube.</li>
            <li> I own the younique brand name version of this. I bought this similar item as I was trying to save money. Sadly this brand does not come close to the expensive one. It really isn&#x27;t worth the savings. The transplanting mascara smells awful and doesn&#x27;t even work well for the green tea lash fibers to stick. It IS better than regular mascara but nowhere near as good as the younique brand.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing 3D mascara.  I used it several times and get so many compliments on my eyelashes since they are light and thin.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara makes my eyes jump out at people.  I love-love-love it.</li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE! I&#x27;ve tried similar fiber lash mascara that&#x27;s maybe $5 more but worked 10x better. First of all, the fibers do not stick to your lashes (no matter how much gel you use) I feel like it literally does nothing but irritate the hell out of your eyes. Seriously, I felt like little demons were poking my eyes with pitch forks all day. Like I said, i&#x27;ve tried a similar product and had a little eye irritation but nothing compared to this. Ladies, SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Who invented this? It&#x27;s AH MAYY ZING!it makes my long eyelashes look so good. I love it so much. It&#x27;s way better than YSLs mascara! I love it. I&#x27;ll always buy this mascara from now on</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Easy to use, results are insane.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I will continue using this product for a long time.  Easy to use.  Update:  I truly did love this product the first time I ordered.  It was so easy to use, went on easily and worked so well.  Since then I have ordered this product twice.  I am very disappointed with it and do not plan to try it again.  The last two times I ordered it was dried out or something was wrong.  It wouldn&#x27;t go on well and it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  After having such a positive experience the first time I was really disappointed.  Will be looking for a different product in the future.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about 3D mascara for a while and wanted to try it out for myself. However, I did not want to have to look for a consultant. When I came across the Bella Eleganze I took the opportunity to try it out. My lashes naturally are barely visible. However after trialing this system, I noticed the difference. I like the effect when I use my own mascara for the first coat and follow-up with the BE system.  My lashes were defined and looked very pretty. I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> I figured I would try something new. This is a two step process. First you use the grafting mascara and then add the green tea fibers over and keep building until you have the desired effect. I liked that it gave me wonderful volume and length, the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that after a while it flakes a little.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not as thick as some of the other fiber lashes i have purchased, but does the trick with a few extra coats.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I heard about it through friends on facebook, decided to give it a try.  Not only is the product fabulous and easy to use, but the seller has great customer service.  LOVE my new thicker, longer looking lashes!!!</li>
            <li> Upon opening, I was freaked out at the smell of the product. It was an &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; smell, like something used to lubricate a gear or something! But now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, it has abated. Every fiber lash product is different and it takes a few times to apply correctly. This one goes on more smoothly than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; Fiber Lash set I pay approx $35 for. I hope the ingredient list is true and that it doesn&#x27;t have something dangerous that causes the smell.</li>
            <li> I just received &amp;#34;The Lash&amp;#34; Fiber Mascara by Belle Eleganze. I first thought it may be too dark, however; once it was applied, I was very impressed. The mascara is so easy to apply and WOW at the difference it makes. I have used many different brands of mascara but this one really makes a difference. I also found that it does not smudge like alot of mascaras leaving you with the appearance of a &amp;#34;black eye&amp;#34;. I recommend this product highly as I think you will also.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I tried eyelash extensions once and hated them - the glue irritated my eyes and I just couldn&#x27;t wear them, but of course I love the long luscious lashes look.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of fiber lash mascara and liked it, but I didn&#x27;t love having to order through a distributor. I was really excited to try this once since I was able to review it free. It works great! Lashes look amazing and it doesn&#x27;t flake off and end up on your cheek 1/2 way through the day so long as you seal it after the last fiber application. It&#x27;s definitely an everyday mascara for me and something I&#x27;ll continue to use! The only thing that I&#x27;ve run into (and its really my own fault for being lazy) is that you have to make sure you take it off every evening because if you leave it on, the next morning you will be clumpy and it&#x27;s harder to get off after sleeping with it on. But like I said, that&#x27;s a problem easily solved by simply taking your make-up off every night.</li>
            <li> This duo worked OK for a few weeks, then seemed like the fiber tube was all used up.  The sealer can clump your lashes together unless you wipe off the excess.  I did have fibers on my face throughout the day, maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough sealer.  Not real impressed with this product.  It did come off very easy and seemed to stay put throughout the day but I picked more fibers out of my eyes than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Okayish. Too clumpish for my taste. It&#x27;s also really annoying to have to apply gel / fuzzy thing / gel every single time. It&#x27;s really hard to get out and also smells a LOT like chemicals ... scary.</li>
            <li> Words cannot explain how much I love this Mascara! And that says a lot coming from a mascara nerd. I love the look of individually applied false eyelashes, but usually don&#x27;t have the time it takes to get them on properly. This 3D Fiber Lash Mascara gives you the same look of false eyelashes, literally in just seconds! You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone. It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple. First, you put on your mascara. Then you put on the transplanting gel. Third, you apply the fibers and voila….That’s it! I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could. LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok- for the price- I guess it&#x27;s worth it- I prefer Cherry Blooms. I will try them all. I&#x27;m not real sure if price really matters that much- I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go - low end. This one does stay on very well! I did hear- that once the &#x27;mascara&#x27; tube one wears out- you can use your own- and use the fiber wand on top of it- I just love the 3D fiber mascara!! I&#x27;m 57 and my lashes are thinning- I had been using falsh lashes- and never got them right.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  Get it now!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried my girlfriends younique 3D mascara and fell in love. I read reviews and settled on this one for the price etc. It&#x27;s amazing! I do however like her younique better; it seemed to build more easily on the lash and the fibers didn&#x27;t clump. but for $10 cheaper I&#x27;m very happy with this one</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my fiber lash mascara I applied it just as the instructions said to I even watched a couple videos on YouTube. My lashes came out horrible and clumpy. Never again.</li>
            <li> Loved the product! Make my eyelashes so long and full! I will deff be ordering again. I have gotten so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Not good stringy product application difficult</li>
            <li> It actually works. i was a huge skeptic and I never buy into gimmicky things, but I really enjoy using this. Taking it off is easy too. I was afraid of massive raccoon eyes, but it comes off in clumps with warm soapy water or in the shower--which is so  much easier. I only leave reviews if I absolutely love a product or if it has serious issues, and this one is an awesome makeup addition. I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only weird thing is the seller will try to do a phone call follow up a couple weeks later, but carefully check out your emails because it&#x27;s easy to opt out of!</li>
            <li> OMG!! This stuff is amazing! I like it way more than my Younique! Will DEFINATELY be buying it again, and have already recommended it to all my friends and family that use mascara. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After writing my first review, I realized that thé product was not as good as I expected. Thé fiber wand was very thin and dried out. I will not be buying this product again UNLESS thé company sends me another one of better quality.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product! It doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;ve used cheaper, similar products that were far superior to this one. I&#x27;m disappointed, and I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on it!</li>
            <li> Just received this and tried it right away it seems to work great so far. Don&#x27;t know how well it wears or how easy it is to take off.</li>
            <li> This product looks amazingly natural. It is a bit time consuming, but the effect is so worth the extra minute or two to apply another few coats. Recommend following the instructions and do one eye at a time. The gel dries quickly....apply the fibers right away and keep alternating to desired look. Much cheaper than Younique and has the same effect.</li>
            <li> So. Much. Shedding.  Although the mascara delivers on making your lashes more volumous and long, it sheds like crazy and causes irritated eyes.  Also, the end result looks like &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; (lack of better term) so I question whether or not this is a good look?  Combing does not help because then you will just get more shedding.  I&#x27;m still weighing out the pros and cons of fiber mascara but if this works for you then go for it.  I think it requires too much effort for an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lengthened lashes&lt;br /&gt;Volumized lashes&lt;br /&gt;Easy rinse/wash-off&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t bleed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Multiple/repeated steps&lt;br /&gt;Shedding (during application and throughout day)&lt;br /&gt;Irritated eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subjective:&lt;br /&gt;End result</li>
            <li> Not just me like it but my sister like it to the point she is using it everyday I even give it to her to have.  And I really like the look I had get when I wear it, make it look like I have on fake lashes especially the left eye that I had did good on then the right eye. I would recommend it to purchase and to really make it pop I suggest to put on ur favorite regular mascara first then the transplanting gel, fiber. And like they said when u keep repeating the process with the transplanting gel, fiber u will see the length, thickness.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks ago I was at a friend&#x27;s house. She introduced me to the 3D Fiberlash product. I was skeptical at first, but she insisted on a trial application. I liked this Mascara because it did not smudge after repeated applications of eye drops. (I have dry eye and need to keep applying lubricants). The following day I ordered the product through Amazon at a much lower price. The Fibers and Sealer make my lashes thicker and longer, yet no smudging or running, but can be easily removed with eye make up cleaner.</li>
            <li> Fibers irritating to eyes.</li>
            <li> This took two weeks to be delivered.  It hurts when you put it on, as flakes fall in your eyes.  Application takes 5 minutes, and then lashes aren&#x27;t much longer than with my Cover Girl.  I have since learned that many of these kits are fakes from China, which may explain the long ship time.</li>
            <li> So I kept seeing people&#x27;s posts online about 3D mascara, and I have to admit I was a doubter. But, I decided to give it a try anyway. I bought this brand off of Amazon and was super surprised at the transformation! it is truly mood altering. It is simple to use and you can repeat the process until you get the length you want! Super drama and no fake lashes or glue to fuss with. My picture shows the transformation of the eye on the left. Row 1 are normal lashes. Row 2 is normal mascara. Row 3 is first application of the 3D Lash Mascara. Row 4 is after the second application of the 3D lash Mascara! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was surprisingly more successful with this fiber mascara than I have been with others. I was careful not to coat too heavily and I did not get that \\&quot;spider legs\\&quot; look that causes me to shy away from this technique. It does take practice and thinner coats (and I need to be sure to use a lot of the gel coat on top to try and prevent fiber shedding) but if you feel like spending the extra time on your lashes you can get a nice full and long look.</li>
            <li> Definately mskes lashes thicker &amp; longer.  Still have trouble witn tes getting in my eyes and irritating them.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I&#x27;ve been through 5 different brands of the 3D lash, and this is by far, the best. They did change their formula a bit but even if they don&#x27;t revert to the previous, it&#x27;s still the best on the market. I use Sephora or Dior base mascara, let it dry, apply the gel, then the fibers. It will irritate you if you put it too close to your eyes but that&#x27;s not a product issue as much as it&#x27;s application. Let it dry then apply the next coat. The other products would take forever. This one is 2 rounds and volia~!  And follow up with a coat of the gel after. It keeps the fibers in place. If not, you&#x27;ll have dust on your face. Until you get the hang of it, check your face often! :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this.  I didn&#x27;t find it worked any better than a good mascara.  Had fibers on my face as well,</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara on the market ....I use this everyday and my lashes look wonderful ....I have had tons of compliments .....Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had the chance to try out the new 3D fiber trend that&#x27;s been going around and I will honestly say that I was a little cautious because I have hard both negative and positive things about 3D fiber.However Bella Eleganze 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is nothing but positive for me! I have thin short eyelashes and this worked amazingly on me! I read the directions and did as it says to do. Doing one eye at a time I applied the gel and immediately applied the 3D fibers let it sit for a few seconds and then applied the gel again. I was pretty shocked at the way just one coat made my eyelashes fuller without being clumpy. I did apply a second coat with the same steps and was floored at how amazing it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did both eyes and didn&#x27;t personally have any problems with anything falling in my eye; I did have a couple fibers under my eyes but I was easily able to brush them off. I went the entire day with the 3D Fibers on and kept checking them to see if it had &amp;#34;disappeared&amp;#34; at all and nope my eyelashes were just as full and beautiful that night as they were when I first put it on! I love this product and would HIGHLY recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes about this after reading several other reviews. Putting this on can be a bit messy if you&#x27;re not careful. My lashes ended up looking clumpy afterwards and it irritated my eyes. I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascaras before and this one has been my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and I&#x27;ve really liked it. At first it can be difficult to figure out the process but once you get it, it works well. After a week of using it I did notice the mascara start to flake...which I don&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s why I gave a 3 star. For paying $20 and having the mascara flake like a $5 one. Its really not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The taller tube holds the glue-like mascara and the other contains the 3D fibers. You must apply them in the order of mascara, fibers, and finally mascara again. If you don&#x27;t, the fibers will flake off. Although the results were good, I&#x27;m not sure they were significantly that much better than my traditional mascara which costs about fives times less. Also, don&#x27;t try to curl your lashes afterwards like I did - ouch. My lashes were stuck to the curler and I had to use a little bit of force to get it released.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  As the seller suggested, I first tried it using my own mascara and just the fibers, until I got used to handling it.  I still use it this way for everyday wear.  When I need truly awesome length, I use the mascara that comes with it, along with the fibers, and I get lashes that look like I&#x27;m using artificial lashes -- without the hassle of applying artificial lashes!  I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Not a fan! I&#x27;ve tried it a couple times now and it barely makes a difference. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It was good but I did not like the fibers getting into my eyes</li>
            <li> These are amazing, my lashes have never looked so good. Just follow the directions on the package and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to try rather than the much more expensive brands and am very satisfied. If you put it on right it doesn&#x27;t look fake like other brands, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Still getting the hang of this.  Lashes do look super long and full, just a matter of practice to achieve the look you want.  Always put a final coat of the gel or regular mascara on to secure the fibers in place.</li>
            <li> Good product. Packaged well. Some Fibers flake off but lashes are longer than they have ever been</li>
            <li> Pretty great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and think once I get a hang of the application process, I will love it even more. I also had a great experience with their customer service due to packaging error.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this new fiber lashes through a promotional price to see if it works. Sure enough this is the easiest, light weight wearing lash product I have every tried. I have tried several too! I love how my lashes look without feeling heavy or clumpy looking. Easy to apply and lasts all day. Plus, the packaging is high end quality.</li>
            <li> This mascara does what it promises; I am thrilled with the long lashes it provides. Also, I highly recommend Bella Eleganze as a top seller on Amazon. 5 stars for the mascara and another 5 stars for the seller. :)</li>
            <li> It goes on very thick and clumps heavily. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed . When I opened the mascara, one of them was dry inside and not working. I would never buy this product . I can not request a change because it was a gift and I am from Guatemala . I had high expectations for this product but totally disappointed . The mark should check the merchandise before sending</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are absolutely what they say they are I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Younique 3D Fiber lashes!!</li>
            <li> The fibers fall all over my face and in my eyes throughout the day</li>
            <li> WOW, tried to take a picture to show everyone, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I left one lash without and applied The Lash on the other and it was AMAZING the difference. Ill be a repeat customer for sure. Got it on sale and thought I would l give it a shot, glad I did.</li>
            <li> A word cannot explain how much I love this product. RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE. It definitely made my eyelashes look very dramatic. The best makeup I&#x27;ve ever spent my money on.</li>
            <li> Horrible this is not the same product I bought at first. the first one I bought was great the second one I purchased was dried out.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Totally Fabulous and makes the eyes pop without all the hassle of falsies.</li>
            <li> If you keep hearing about Younique but can&#x27;t justify the price, try this Bella Eleganza mascara! It&#x27;s legit the same exact thing. Bella Eleganza provided me with a discounted product to try and review.. and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - if you are using this or ANY fiber mascara, run a lash comb through your lashes as the final step. Application isn&#x27;t difficult but it&#x27;s easy to over-apply. If you do, clump city. That&#x27;s not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you read the instructions, remember to seal the fibers with the gel afterwards (and before), and don&#x27;t do more than 2 coats, you can get a gorgeous look!</li>
            <li> This the Best fiber mascara I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve used 2 other name brands, and this outperformed both of them. It&#x27;s easy to was off too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several fiber lash brands.  This one was priced middle of the road.  It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t feather off thru out the day.  Lasts all day.  I&#x27;ll purchase this one again!  I just changed my star rating from a 5 to 4.  The reason being is the price.  The first time, I purchased this for $17.99   2 weeks ago I purchased it for $20.99.  I just pulled it up to purchase again and the price is now $23.99.  Not sure I will continue to buy this item if the price is raised again.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Thin lashes before...longer after but not as full as I would like.  Although . For price would get them again.  They do last long time.......days!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it at first...but then I was so disappointed. I was only able to use it 4 times befor it didnt work anymore. The fibers dont seem to stay on my lashes anymore. No matter how much gel i put on. So very sad that I thought I had found the perfect mascara. I mean it does work qhen u first try it. But it doesnt last long at all</li>
            <li> Sorry for the scary eyes, but To give a closeup. These are pretty amazing. Used them for the first time today. They&#x27;re not bothering my eyes, and they look like I have false eyelashes on. If this product holds up, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is as promised and I have found no issues with it yet for me personally. I would buy it again. I have really short eyelashes so this was really cool to see how quickly and easily I could make my eyes poop ! Love the product !</li>
            <li> Love it!! love it!!! Will order when needed.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product for me. I did a test use on one of my bottom lashes. The little fibers flaked off.  It is easy to remove however.  I gave it to my daughter, and she uses it.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I found it easy to apply. After applying the 3D fiber lash mascara my lashes were visibly thicker and longer. Great look. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different fiber lash brands and I like this one the best.  Mostly because it washes off clean and I&#x27;ve yet to see any eyelashes come out when washing.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to do one eye at a time.  Gel, fibers, Gel (repeat if necessary) and end it with your regular mascara.  I don&#x27;t find the need to repeat and have this whole process down to taking about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Bella Eleganze and am quite happy with it. This is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too messy. I really like the outcome of my lashes after using it. They look natural and no clumps. I would highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m such a makeup junkie was happy to get to try this</li>
            <li> Yes!!!! Love this.  It lengthens my lashes and makes them look thick.</li>
            <li> LOVED my lashes...easy to apply and made my lashes stand out!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It really makes your lashes look thicker and longer.  I use about 3 coats and it works very well.  It kind of looks like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes.  No other mascara beats this.</li>
            <li> We love it! Only down fall is trying to keep the fibers out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> this product was ok.  Not amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but it caused me an eye infection and was not able to wear any mascara for 2 weeks and had to get eye drops. Fibers went on my eye and it was terrible and it hurt.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive stuff IMO</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and used it for the first time today.  I was very impressed.  It did what it said it would do.  My lashes immediately were longer.  After two applications, they were thicker.  Love this product so far.</li>
            <li> It flaked off all day - I followed instructions exactly and after 2 hours it would start flaking off and continue during the day - left you feeling very paranoid and had to keep checking - won&#x27;t be using this anymore - very disappointed</li>
            <li> NOTE: This review as written by my lovely wife:  I really don&#x27;t know how they do it...  This product is AMAZING! It literally transformed my tiny little lashes into fuller, longer, sexier lashes instantly. They did not come out looking like a big hot mess like some others I have tried. Don&#x27;t bother with the fake lashes..  Seriously, I have never used a beauty product that made such a dramatic improvement in a single use. They should charge double or triple for this. Buy it, try it, you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> I have tried a different popular product that was much higher and not as good. I will definitely be back to buy more of this product. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was amusingly surprised seeing anything near my eyes tear me up, I have to be so very careful of the make up I buy and use, even down to eyeliner and eye colors. but this is wow, great to make your lashes stand out, all I can say is get a very good eyelash comb. and then you will be all set, no falsies needed if you don&#x27;t want them or you can wear them and use this with it.</li>
            <li> Great you can get longer lashes whenever you want!</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT THAT MUCH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a younique cosmetics consultant and I bought this to try it against our brand and this is absolutely garbage. I&#x27;ve been buying every competitions 3D lashes to compare and the lift and length is no where close to what our brand dose I&#x27;ll be sticking with my line</li>
            <li> Awful! returned!  Mascara flaked off and went everywhere!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not satisfied with this product. It flakes and gets into my eyes which drives me absolutely crazy. Right after applying the product the fibers also flake under my eyes and I have to wipe them off.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She still doesn&#x27;t know how to use.&lt;br /&gt;To women who have already, tryed  who know how to use, please email instructions.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT SO SO MUCH PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND ASK DO YOU HAVE STECTION.I CAN GO WITH OUT LOVE IT I WILL OREDER MORE</li>
            <li> Oh this product is so much fun!! I love beauty products and I am always looking for new things what will beautify me!! I am so bad with putting on fake lashes, they are always a mess, but I love to look glamorous! I look at my husband&#x27;s lashes and just wonder why I can&#x27;t have those naturally. I&#x27;m really enjoying this product! It looks great, feels great!! I&#x27;ve gotten to use this a few times going out on the town and I have recommended it to several friends. I will definitely be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the 3D mascara, it made my eyelashes look so much thicker and longer.  I don’t know where this product has been hiding but I’m glad I found it.  When I first received the package I opened it up from it’s fancy case, I had no clue you had to apply in two steps.  To my surprise the two steps go hand in hand and were rather quick.  I spent the same amount of time I normally would with my previous mascara, the only thing different now is the awesome look my lashes have.  I love this stuff and will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I gave this item for Christmas and they loved it. Works as advertised and looks great. Product came on time in proper packaging for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I had never used fiber lash mascaras, but when I read the reviews on this particular one, I decided to try it.  Granted I have nothing to compare this product to, it has worked great for me.  I had read a review that instructed you on how they&#x27;ve learned to best apply it and that helped me, thank you whoever you were. She said she does one coat regular mascara-gel-fibers-gel-fibers-gel-and one more regular mascara coat. This really worked for me too and I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara like others said to do. It also washed off easily with soap and water and didn&#x27;t flake on me throughout the day.  Overall great product and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am returning this item.  I really saw no difference after using it for over a week. I became very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Okay.  The fibers get in my eyes when I apply it.  The end result is good, but not worth the hassle for every day.  Saving for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this.  I really wanted it to work.  Tried it and saw no visable difference in the mascara I was already using and this also irritated my eyes.  It also has a weird odor to it.</li>
            <li> im so loving how pretty my lashes look while wearing this,usually i get compliments on my hair as it is rainbow in bangs but i went to the store and she looked up to tell me my total and said i love your lashes and asked what brand of fake lashed i had.i shared with her what i used and went on my way but i never had anyone notice lashes before this.i received them at discount to review but i totally love how beautiful i feel wearing this.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. It does exactly what it says it will do once you follow the instruction. I love, love, love the effect without having to use extensions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but every time I wear this, my family or friends doubt that I&#x27;m high but I never smoke. I hope I can work that out because I really like this product. Other than it making my eyes really irritated, I like this but not so much that I would repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Younique. The gel isn&#x27;t as good. Decent mascara, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I wish the fibers would stay in place because they do fall from your lashes and doesn&#x27;t look nice after you applied the make up. But it makes them look bigger, just make sure you check your face often so you dont look weird.</li>
            <li> Hurt my eyes so much by the end of the day it felt like I had sand in my eyes.</li>
            <li> After the first attempt I got these results. Super happy! I just recently removed my eye lash extensions and am perfectly happy with this as a summer replacement! So much cheaper too!</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because I had good results with younique fiber lashes, however, this product has several negative issues. This one is a minor issue the elastic piece that is in place to separate the gel tube from the fiber tube was broken. When I started to use the product, the gel wand  was bending to the point of breaking at any moment. The lashes were flying everywhere as I was trying to get them on the wand. Once I got the first coat on they looked ok however within maybe twenty minutes I noticed the fiber lashes around my eyes and cheek. I am very familiar with fiber lashes  these fell short in so many areas. I am returning them. They are also very irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the application - gel is fine, but the other is just a bunch of clumps.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I think I will try another brand next time. There isn&#x27;t much in the fiber tube, mine already ran out. Not worth the money for such a little amount.</li>
            <li> I a asked people what they thought about my lashes..they said could barely tell I had any mascara on.. worst one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Did not like this mascara at all. Let me start off by saying that the fibers kept falling off every time I winked. Made my eyes so irritated all day and they hurt me all day! Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off! Going to give away or sell it! Will stick to my usual Loreal mascara!</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as 3d by Youngique, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes! Only had to do one layer and they came out amazing and long! They did make my eyes water a little at first but you get adapted to them in no time.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product very much.  My eye lashes seemed pretty much non-existent after chemotherapy.  Mascara didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  And some mascara and eye shadows really irritate my eyes so that they watered for hours at a time.  I thought I was just going to have to give up eye make up.  Then I saw this product advertised.  I looked at some of the videos and read the reviews on how to use and what it did, so decided to try.  So far I am very pleased.  There has been no eye irritation at all, and best of all I can SEE eye lashes again after I use the product!!  Generally I only use one coating and it&#x27;s enough.  I am hopeful the good results will continue.  I really liked the package the items come in, too.  No chance of the tubes getting separated or lost.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara based on the reviews. But once again, another fiber mascara that disappoints!   To the people that raved about this mascara, please tell me how you find this to be SO AMAZING??  Well, I guess if you love the thick, clumpy &amp;#34;looks horrible&amp;#34;, messy look, then, yes, this mascara will certainly do that for you! I guess it&#x27;s true.. you get what you pay for!  But even for $10.00, I would have expected a little better that what you get with his HORRIBLE mascara!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;m going to ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Sometimes I use the glue only and that alone enhance my lashes beautifully. Whenever I want fuller lashes I apply the fiber.</li>
            <li> I must have just gotten unlucky &amp; got an old batch.  The inside broke within a day, it was so dry I couldn&#x27;t even get the look they boasted about.  I did get a refund, thank you. I would have liked trying it again though.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The only problem I have is with the fibers (step 2).  They get on my checks and I have to constantly look to see if there&#x27;s any on my face. If that happens to you, try doing one eye at a time and apply the fibers before the gel dries.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments!</li>
            <li> I was not as pleased as I was with the yo unique lash</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and remove.  Better than eye extensions which are high maintenance, and I felt I got the look that I wanted, longer thicker lashes duh......</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. If i want more of an &amp;#34;everyday makeup&amp;#34; look I only apply each tube once.. If I am going out I do two coats. This mascara is great for adding length to the eyelashes which is what I wanted, Also if you want a dramatic look I would suggest using an additional mascara before applying this one. Also, I love the little case it comes in so I can easily keep up with both tubes. This mascara isn&#x27;t as easy to take off as basic mascaras are, but I use abolene, vaseline, or makeup wipes to do the trick. Overall, this was a great purchase and cheaper than the other 3d lash mascaras on the market.</li>
            <li> All the reviews got it right!! The product is wonderful!  I have sensitive eyes and I will forever use this product because it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  In fact, it gives me full lashes, easy to apply and last all day long.  I will tell you, I did as the other customers, mascara, gel, fibers, gel, fibers and then last coat of mascara to seal it all in.  I have amazing eyes now.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love this product  works great,stays on, and definitely made my lashes lush and full.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is very affordable.  have been wanting to try for awhile and finally did..So worth it!!</li>
            <li> ... no words. Just save your time and money</li>
            <li> OMG! Makes my eyes burn and water. Can&#x27;t wear it. Gave me an eye infection first use.</li>
            <li> I love this mascarra! I belong to sweet adelines and hate putting on fake eyelashes. These are the best I tried. Easy to use, no clumping and fabulous lashes. Much better priced than that mlm company. I&#x27;ll be telling all the ladies in the chorus!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I apply as directed and it has never flaked for me.  I bought to wear for special occasions but now wear it most of the time.  It looks so natural and so easy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and bypass applying regular mascara. I applied the gel tube then the fiber and it made my lashes look as though I had applied  3 coats of regular mascara, &amp;#34;I really love the look&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;  Finally ordered this product and it is okay. I do wear contact lenses and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It is a bit flaky and clumps, but then the product itself is good. it is light and it does definitely makes your lashes look darker and longer, BUT not thicker!  &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;irritate&amp;#34; my eyes as a reaction, but a fiber always seems to fall into my eye and it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to remove.  I ended up using it mostly for my bottom eye lashes to avoid this and it still made my eyes look too cute.</li>
            <li> I think I can count on one hand the number of reviews I&#x27;ve posted, but when you instantly like a product, I just feel you need to share.  I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; this, I love it!  When I was in my teens, my eyes and lashes were noticed.  Big brown eyes, long lashes.  Over time, my lashes thinned.  I received this package today, and while my husband and granddaughter ran to the store, I ran to the mirror to try this out.  First off, it&#x27;s easy to apply, gel, fiber, gel, done.... in my case, I decided to do a second coat.  I did what other suggested and just did one eye at a time, but because of the results with the first one, I was in a hurry to do the second.  When the family returned, my husband &amp;#34;noticed&amp;#34; something was different.  I blinked, then winked, then asked if I&#x27;d gotten false eyelashes in my package&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;how much did you spend because they look &#x27;great&#x27;!  I just told him it was new mascara I was trying ;)  I don&#x27;t know if I expected these results to be as good as they were, but I am really happy they were.</li>
            <li> Ok ladies , I try everything that the beauty industry puts out , some works some makes us think it does, My honest opinion is this mascara isn&#x27;t a miracle to having long lashes like the stars , However ; it goes on great and makes my eyes really pop ! I love how easy it is to apply and if you can apply mascara you can apply this going down the rd. I love the mascara and the fibers do make your lashes look somewhat fuller and longer , I think it depends on how much you apply and how long your lashes are naturally, mine was always full and not long or short so this does add more volume, It stays on all day long! We have a huge commercial farm and im out in heat and humidity a lot and this stuff doesn&#x27;t run or come off! Yes I do my hair and makeup even as a farmer lol I call myself the new version of a 2015 elly mae lol,!!  OK bottom line, go ahead and try it and take your time when applying , to me its easy and I don&#x27;t soak brushes in water or do anything extra, I just apply the mascara and then fibers immediately after then go and do other eye, if you get fibers on your face just put hair dryer on low and blow them off! I have used this a few months and haven&#x27;t noticed that it broke my lashes or hurt them , I will buy again due to how well it stays on ! When you remove, I use Vaseline and a Q tip and gently rub off . I remove all makeup with just pure Vaseline ! Its and old remedy for truly making your face moist and it also saves hundreds on makeup removers and other moisturizers , it helps prevent wrinkles and its all I use and my grandmother used and mom , They all had glowing skin and never looked their age!! Thought Id throw that in because Vaseline is awesome!! So go ahead and order you this great mascara and get ready to get compliments ! I got a lot on my eyes and that&#x27;s how I also knew it made a difference because no one usually complimented my lashes as much but even if they didn&#x27;t , I love it and will buy again!! I hope my review gave you some insight on helping you make your decision!!</li>
            <li> I used Younique and tried this product because it was less expensive. It is really not great. The gel isn&#x27;t as good - not as thick or as dark. The fibers come out in a huge glob and are difficult to disperse. It was not possible to create the same look I got with Younique. My lashes were very clumpy and did not lengthen. Sending back.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is like a knock off of &amp;#34;Younique&amp;#34; which I like better. It flaked some when I wore it, but it is cheaper price.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The fibers clump on the brush and fall off of it. There is more mascara then the fibers.</li>
            <li> I m very happy with this mascara !gives me very long full looking lashes,does not flack off all and this removes with soapy  facial cleanser  .i love to use this now  I will give A+</li>
            <li> Works really well!  There was a bit of a learning curve for me, and it&#x27;s an additional step in my makeup routine, but it does make my lashes long and thick!  It stays put and easily remove able with make up remover.  I would definitely recommend and purchase again!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. My lashes looks so much longer. It does what it is suppose to do. I love my lashes after I use this product. A very good product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Take your time when applying lashes. Result is awesome</li>
            <li> hmmn I was so excited. It does work but it is not as lasting as I had hoped. I did end up with black flakes u see the eyes... Bummer</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara and instantly fell in love upon first usage. My lashes went from stubby to long and gorgeous! Sadly, after about 4 uses, I noticed the tube of fibers was completely empty. Coincidentally, the company (Bella Eleganze) emailed me that same day to ask what I thought of the product. I emailed them back and explained that while I did love the mascara, I wish there was just more of it in the tube. The representative responded to my email within a few hours, apologized, and sent a completely new set, which I received 2 days later! I absolutely recommend this mascara; it makes my lashes look super long. And even if I didn&#x27;t like the product so much (which I clearly do), I would still recommend this brand based solely on their customer service. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff. Better than the more expensive name brand. Exactly as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Super impressed with the results of my lashes!!</li>
            <li> if you have used younique and are looking for a bargain, don&#x27;t waste your money.  The gel is stringy and the fibers don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well.  I have short eyelashes and felt like I could get a lovely length with younique, not with this brand.  It was a huge disappointment</li>
            <li> love this mascara. went from little eye lashes to beautiful long lashes!</li>
            <li> Excellent !  Love it ....</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for daughter.  She loves the product.  Easy to use. Company sends follow up email.  Great customer service</li>
            <li> It works really well for 2-3 weeks, and it actually makes my super short Asian eyelashes look a lot longer! They look pretty natural too, except it looks like you just put a bunch of mascara or something. However, the gel that attaches the fibers onto your lashes dried out within 3 weeks of opening it, and the effect was no where near the same. It pretty much doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore, so it&#x27;s extremely pricey for the short amount of time that it lasts. It also takes a lot of effort to get a long eyelash effect if you have short lashes like me, so you might as well be better off spending $20 on buying some really good pairs of fake lashes that you can re-use a couple of times.</li>
            <li> This mascara make my lashes  GREAT!! Another woman who I  do not know at all meet me in store and she say:You&#x27;s lashes are fabulous!!Between all am really satisfied with it, try it with no doubt, may be I post a picture later.</li>
            <li> This really lengthens and volumizes my lashes like crazy definitely my go to mascara</li>
            <li> I love this product, only needed about 2 coats and it does what it says it does. Will never go back buying regular  mascara. This one does the job. Mascara is something  I never leave my house without, this was really easy to apply and less time. Does wash off easily, will never buy  another.</li>
            <li> Great the first application, dried out and goopy on the 2nd application, also flakes off during the day</li>
            <li> Was a gift for somebody and she was happy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a HORRIBLE product.  I wasted my money!!!  After a few hours, I looked in the mirror and all these fibers were all over under my eyes looking as if my under eye area was black.  Really terrible and embarrassing too.</li>
            <li> If you want the false eyelash look but don&#x27;t want the hassle of gluing bits of things to your eye, this is the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Take your time applying! The only time you should be quick is between the transporting gel and the micro-fibers (don&#x27;t want the gel to dry before the fibers get on)&lt;br /&gt;2, Some people put a coat of regular mascara on first as a base, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways and I feel this product works best on clean lashes.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can wear this every day if you want, but I prefer to stick to the special occasions.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great and does not come off unless you rub your eyes</li>
            <li> I like the gel but the micro fibers seem to make the gel too clumpy!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this. It worked great the first couple times then after that, sub par. Almost like the gel was starting to dry out and the fibers weren&#x27;t  as much. Crushed since I was so happy with it :(</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this stuff. I can see the potential for &#x27;clumpiness&#x27; in the future because the second coat of setting gel will inevitably get fiber in it, which then gets into the setting gel.  We will see, tho.  The picture is of no mascara (obvious which one), regular mascara from Sephora, and the fiber.  The fiber is the top pic.</li>
            <li> I personally love this new wave of gel mascara. I usually use it when I&#x27;m going for a dramatic or really dark look just because it works really well at thickening and extending your lashes. It&#x27;s not a simple &amp;#34;throw on and go&amp;#34; type of product so if you lack patience, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen lots of new products hitting the market advertising the stunning growth of lashes. I was a little hesitant to try this product as I was reading the instructions, but WOW! So easy to put on and take off. Stunning new &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; that seem perfectly natural. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out on Date Night next weekend! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is great to use.It makes your eyelashes longer in a few seconds and easy to use</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It adds incredible volume Without the fake lash troubles.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t compare to Younique brand.  It&#x27;s runny</li>
            <li> Love this 3D mascara so much that I got my girlfriend one too as a gift!</li>
            <li> Love it make  my lashes look gorgeous !!</li>
            <li> This makes your lashes look fuller and way longer. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love that my lashes grow instantly.  For some reason my lashes got shorter as I got older.  3D Fiber Mascara gives me the lashed that I use to have.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I returned it. Spending the extra $10 and going with the brand I know works.</li>
            <li> It flakes. I find tny black particles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to apply it my lashes were popping. No irritation and love the case.</li>
            <li> Love love this mascara!!! Makes my lashes look super long amd thick!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and lasts all day. It really does help with the thinning lashes, making them look full and long.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC MASCARA! MY EYE&#x27;S NEVER LOOKED BETTER!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product! I just apply one coat because I don&#x27;t like my eyelashes to look too clumpy. I will buy this again and again! I don&#x27;t think it really replaces false lashes, but I personally get annoyed wearing false lashes and this product adds length and thickness without that &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; feeling. A few extra steps in your daily routine, but definately worth it to me!</li>
            <li> if you have naturally long eyelashes I don&#x27;t recommend this. it does just as much for ya as a $5 mascara from walmart no matter how many coats you do.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I now have long beautiful eyelashes!!! Just a tip..... Don&#x27;t go to far down with the fiber brush.</li>
            <li> A cheap imitation of Youniques Fiber Lashes.  Clumpy</li>
            <li> I have to give this one star for the following reason… The caller on one of the tubes broke so the mascara is unusable to me. I left this mascara in a travel bag so I was not using it very often. The last time I went on a trip, the inner collar on one of the tubes pushed in and caused a big mess. The brush comes out with big globs of product. I looked into returning or replacing the item, but Amazon said it was too late.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it out a few days now and I just don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s so messy. I&#x27;ve followed the directions but it&#x27;s just not working for me. No matter how careful I am it flakes and gets in my eyes and irritates them. It also flakes all freaking day long and falls on my face. This product is not for me. I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
            <li> I like this, people thought I had on lashes.</li>
            <li> was not worth the money, something from the drugstore would have been just the same if not better</li>
            <li> This product does work. Best to use fiber on the tips of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Delivered next day as promised. The product is okay, not worth $20 (certainly not over $20). I&#x27;ll use it, so as not to waste the purchase. I don&#x27;t hate it; I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like this, but it can cause some eye irritation if you are already pre-disposed. It works very well.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to Tea Tree so I can&#x27;t use the fibers. The gel is wonderful though!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great product!&amp;#34;  I have had no issues with the seller or the product, and I use it every day.  I have had many compliments, and even was asked if I have extensions while having a facial.  Love, love, love the mascara.  Note...Only put on the tips of your lashes to avoid any getting in your eyes.  Super easy to use!</li>
            <li> I did not like the product it did nothing formy  lashes.</li>
            <li> come just the box without come mascara or fiber</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my eyes, but it does flake off. I&#x27;m always finding fibers around my eyes, sometimes in. Love the product for the price, hope they can improve the quality.</li>
            <li> This mascara did wonders for me! The were noticed by many people and I wear them as often as I can! I recommend this to everyone that needs some new mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will probably buy again.  No clumping and no fibers falling off!  Looks great!</li>
            <li> I am very excited to see how amazing my lashes look with this product. The formula was light enough that my lashes did not feel heavy or look like one of those old vintage dolls with gobs of mascara on and I had put about three coats of it on so that is amazing! My lashes looked triple the thickness, the color was a beautiful dark black and it was extremely easy to put on. The instructions that came with it are simple and easy to follow and getting the fibers off is a sinch. I am in love with this mascara it has done me wonders! Also there was no irritation at all, which was my main concern when I bought it, so that was amazing. Usually when I wear mascara my eyes burn by the end of the day but this one really doesn&#x27;t make me do that so I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> worked very well however by the end of the day you get lots of little fibers all over your face.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Have to apply a few times before getting desired length, but I have short lashes so it may be different for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was exstatic to receive this product. The results were pleasant because it did increase the volume and length of my lashes. The application process is simple- logically, the more you add the clumpier it will look. I applied 3 layers of fibers+gel; my lashes are straight and pretty short, so I&#x27;m better off appling 2 layers so I have a more natural look. I do recommend this product even if it is not the original. The substance is light and VERY easy to remove especially in the shower. It does not leave stains or residue on your lashes. GIVE IT A TRY! Kudos to the merchant as we&#x27;ll for delivering on time and packaging nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;You can make your lashes as long as you desire!!!!!! Comes right off in the shower too. My new favorite item in my makeup box.</li>
            <li> Just buy it! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Just as good as Younique. will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I wore it daily for 7 days then decided to take a break and wear my old mascara...I felt naked. I ended up going back into the bathroom, midday, and applying my Bella 3D Fiber Lash. The fibers make such a huge difference, and with only one layer of application, yet I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;over done&amp;#34; wearing it for daily errands and casual events. I have applied a second coat when going out in the evening, once, but found one coat to be my sweet spot and using this product alone without a base of mascara (I actually prefer it alone), leaves lashes more soft and less crunchy. This is the first fiber lash product I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t leave me with little black flecks on my cheeks after a few hours. I&#x27;ve worked out in it and had no issues or running. My eyes are super sensitive and often tear from makeup, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with allergies or irritation. You apply it and it stays put!  I will be ordering this product again. Definitely worth you dollars. A+++</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t decided if it&#x27;s something I would buy again. I&#x27;m just lazy with the extra layers that have to be applied. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it every day, just for a special night out.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  don&#x27;t think I will ever use regular mascara again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara. My eyelashes are fuller and longer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to apply. My lashes are definitely fuller and longer. I use it daily!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and it really worked, her eyelashes looked long and beautiful, would definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> Residue falls into the eyes, very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this mascara and I have to admit that it looks great once applied but the downside is the fibers fall into your eyes as the day goes on. It&#x27;s so irritating to my eyes that I just can&#x27;t use it so it was a waste of money for me. If you don&#x27;t mind digging out fibers from your eyeballs occasionally, you will love it.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous....so much better than getting falsies!</li>
            <li> Amazing. I don&#x27;t have the longest lashes around, so I am always looking for mascara that will enhance my stubby lashes. I have finally found it. I apply my regular mascara first, then the gel - and I have to tell you - for a normal day of running errands, that is as far as I go - it makes my lashes look thick and long. For an evening out, I apply the fibers after the gel then gel again. I absolutely love this product, and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I luv the 3D fiber lash mascara!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lashes full and long! Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.. The product smells old, works terrible! Would love a refund!!!</li>
            <li> It did make my lashes look longer and i like that you can put as many coats on as you want, but you do have to be careful or your lashes to end up looking looking a bit clumpy, i wear contacts and it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all but i was very careful with the application too.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn. I always have trouble with my lashes clumping and looking uneven and this fixes those problems. It stays perfect it doesn&#x27;t bleed it doesn&#x27;t run or surge even over night and through long days. I ordered this for my cousin and used it when she got it and immediately ordered one for myself. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other products.  The only product I&#x27;ve been able to wear that makes me look like I have eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I expected more of this product.It did not work as promised.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Amazing! No more spending on false lashes! This product can give you that, AND MORE! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> truly does lengthen.  Though it takes a bit of time to put on, as there are two different products and I do a couple of coats... it is a real nice product.  if it was on Amazon&#x27;s subscribe service, I&#x27;d subscribe as I will be using this as I can&#x27;t afford my lash extentions any longer, this is a nice second choice to that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really sad about this. I suck at putting fake lashes on, but I want long pretty lashes! I was so excited that this one had such amazing reviews. But unfortunately for me, it wasn&#x27;t a great match. This irritated my eyes so much that I had to flush them out and put ointment in my eyes to keep my eyes from feeling like they were burning. I do have really sensitive eyes so I&#x27;m sure my reaction was 100x worse than a normal person&#x27;s reaction would be to this product. I mean, it works well. It gives your lashes a little more length than regular mascara, but I won&#x27;t be using it again :/</li>
            <li> It cakes up too much and you have constant black dots on your face from flaking</li>
            <li> This mascara actually holds true to what it claims, which is great! I used it on top of my normal mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats. The application is easy and the Transplanting Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Natural Fibers. The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my contacts even thought it said it was not recommended for them. HA! I felt that one coat gave me the desired fullness and thickness, but the instructions do say you can add additional coating for an even fuller look. Definitely makes your eyes pop! First 3-D I have ever purchased or even actually heard of so this was a pleasant experiment for me. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for those big beautiful eyes of their youth! I received this item at no cost for testing and evaluation purposes. This review is my  unbiased and independent opinion and based entirely on my examination of, and my personal experience with,  this product. My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love  these products ....Glad I got chosen to do a review ..a discount and a great product ..Yay me</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am older. I purchased this item, due to the fact that my eye lashes have diminished with age. I purchased glue on eye lashes, but due to the fact hat I can&#x27;t apply them with my (bi-focal) glasses on and can&#x27;t see to apply them with the glasses off ( Hahaha, I said I was older). At one time, I was having them colored at my hair dressers (which is a cool $25 each application), but this product works quit nicely. I can actually apply it as instructed. The mascara fills in the lashes, plus makes them appear longer. Just think what it would do for someone much younger. I have very sensitive eyes and was worried about that also, but the mascara does not seem to irritate my eyes at all.  The green tea fibers can be a bit clumpy, but can be managed.</li>
            <li> I am not a Mascara person because I have terrible allergies and my eyes water when I&#x27;m outside. Plus, I hate the feel of mascara weighing down my eyelashes. I have always wanted to try fiber lash mascara but was afraid I would spend all that money and it wouldn&#x27;t work or it would look terrible and clumpy. This product changed my mind, it was easy to put on, even though the first application I learned that you need to put the fiber part on right after the gel or you have to apply more gel.....no problem, easily fixed. I gave this product 5 stars because of how easy it was for a Granny to put it on after decades of not using mascara.</li>
            <li> I have to try this again. The fibers are there but I didn&#x27;t get any thickness on my lashes</li>
            <li> love love love my lashes. super mega long.</li>
            <li> Fiber mascara is all the rage right now so of course I had to give it a try and I like it more than I thought i would!  It isn&#x27;t too hard to apply but if you use too much the fibers will flake onto your face.  I was able to use one nice layer and my lashes look great, very long and full.  It takes a bit of getting used to and it won&#x27;t completely replace my regular mascara but for a more dramatic look this is perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is the best in 3d fiber lashes, I have tried other brands and they do not compare.  This product really works and does take 5 applications like the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands do, to look full, long and Beautiful.</li>
            <li> At first, I really loved the effect of this product, but my views have diminished for a couple reasons. 1) It lasts about 30 days 2) My most recent bottle doesn&#x27;t have the original fresh scent and instead smells more like tar :(</li>
            <li> I received these 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Bella Eleganze and I love it. I did not expect for the color to be as bold and dark as it is so that was a happy unexpected affect. It is very easy to use and it last all day with the initial application. These fiber lashes are the new cool faze and after actually using them I understand WHY. I never have considered using them in the past because I have really long eye lashes naturally. But I love making them longer and look fuller so I have become engrossed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very easy to use. First you apply the gel to one set of lashes only. Then go over the gel with the fiber lashes. Then seal the lashes with another application of the gel. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want to. I only do one to two coats because my lashes are so long. My mom has virtually no lashes so she uses more applications. By the time that she is done putting several coats on her lashes are as long and full looking as mine. This mascara has a miracle grow effect on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it does not matter how many coats that you apply, it does not weigh your lashes down. I actually think that it feels lighter than my cover girl mascara. My eyelashes are definitely softer to the touch with this 3D fiber mascara as compared to when I use my Walgreens make up products. Usually my cover girl and my maybeline brands leave my eye lashes stiff and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is sweat, tear and rain proof! However, it is easy to remove at the end of the day. I use a simple makeup removing wipe and it comes off with no problem or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a money back guarantee if you are unhappy or not satisfied with the mascara, Try it risk free!</li>
            <li> It really works! And I wear contacts and it does not irritate them. My sister tried it and now she is buying it! Totally work the cost, they look like false lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this will buy again</li>
            <li> It did what it said it would. However I did not like the tiny fibers falling under my eye. I did enhance it with my own mascara too</li>
            <li> Super cute but a major pain in the ass to put on and clumps bad!! The product EASILY gets into your eyes and irritates your eyes all day. On the positive side.. it lasts all day and curls easily.</li>
            <li> Younique is much better.. Tried this one to save a little money but it didnt compare to younique</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love love love this natural looking mascara - I have lashes like my teens again~&amp;#34;  ***If you accidentally get ANY in your eye - it hurts like the dickens until thoroughly washed out, or removed then have to reapply</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes and just thought maybe this might be a good alternative given the organic ingredients in the fibers and gel.  But not a good choice for me.  I am sure it works fine for most people!</li>
            <li> item as described. i can not seem to keep them as big as other reviewers are saying without them looking like spiders, but I will keep playing with it. thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes my eye lashes seem more fuller!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come as expected was all dried out but I received a full refund TY</li>
            <li> OMG! I am impressed with this!  My eyelashes look amazing. I wish I could give it more stars. Easy to apply and after two rounds, my lashes are longer than they have ever been.  Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I do love the results. My eyes looks awake and full. The only warning I have is that if you wear it for a full day, but the end of the day there will be fibers on your face or under your eyes. Additionally, I find that at the end of teh day as the fibers loosen away from my eyelashes, some can fall into my eyes which causes burning. Just be mindful. Do NOT work out with this on. If you wear it to work and go to the gym afterwards, please remove before working out otehrwise the sweat will loosen the fibers and can cause your eyes to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these were waterproof.</li>
            <li> I just got it I&#x27;m going to try it today</li>
            <li> Personally, I found this to be very clumpy and worthless.  The fibers didn&#x27;t stick well except in sections of each lash and that created a bad mascara effect.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Younique&#x27;s fiber lash mascara as well, and I like this one better, I will certainly purchase this one moving forward!</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Less than most. Priced  nicely.</li>
            <li> Is there a catch and I will be charged every month for a reorder???  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara! The brush for the gel is perfect for separating your lashes and preventing clumps. The travel case is very durable too. My lashes look long and full, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stays put and make my eyes look glamorous.</li>
            <li> not really sure on this how great it is.....I had expected my lashes to be much more dramatic than it was.  And it does cause eye itchiness.  And the fibers do come off on your face through out the day.  the product also gets pretty thick quickly.  I am out, but didn&#x27;t reorder...I will stick with my lancome, or may try another brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara!  I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician so I&#x27;ve used just about everything.  This mascara is so easy to apply and really brightens up my eyes.  I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> Not something I use as a daily mascara, but works for those special occasions.  I have sensitive eyes and worried the fibers would bother me, but so far not so much.  Do have to be careful not to get them in your eyes though.  I gave 4 stars as I did not notice too much difference in the length of my lashes, just the fullness of them.</li>
            <li> This works really well!!  I&#x27;n very impressed and will order more from them  :)</li>
            <li> Product is good - fibers are a little hard to work with but the result is great. Lashes definitely look fuller! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It really does work and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really love this 3D fiber lash mascara by Bella Eleganze. It made my eyelashes so thick and full! I usually use physicians formula mascara and I thought it was the absolute best. I was very wrong, this mascara is the BEST! It made my lashes long and beautiful. They did get into my contacts and irritate them, but I didn&#x27;t read where it said I shouldn&#x27;t use with contacts so that was my fault. I recommend using regular mascara first and then following the steps for the fiber lash mascara. I would recommend this product to every woman I know and even some I don&#x27;t! Its very easy to wash off with warm water. received a discount on this product for reviewing purposes and these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I used to thicken my lashes with baby powder--this has the same effect only a thousand times better. I love how wide my eyes look, and there&#x27;s little to no fallout throughout my busy workday. Amazing</li>
            <li> Love how smooth my eye lashes are when using this product.  Full with no clumping.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I was hesitant to try this product but after receiving and it and watching some youtube tutorials I took the plunge and tried this out. I actually ended up really liking the finished result aside from some minor clumping but I brushed it out with a clean mascara wand. I didn&#x27;t have an issues with fibers falling off into my eyes, and my normally sensitive eyes showed no irritation with this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered this when I saw a post on Facebook offering this for $1.00. I have been looking at fiber mascara for some months, but they are price prohibitive. I like the way my eyelashes look using this, however I can wear it for five or six hours at the most, as the fibers begin to dry and get into my eyes. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I had a slight learning curve using this mascara. It is basically a three step process (four if you curl your lashes). First you curl your lashes (optional), then you apply your own waterproof mascara (I used Great Lash waterproof), then you carefully layer the fibers and the gel (both included), you can repeat the layers to build your lashes. I found that it is important to only apply a little of the fiber each layer, otherwise there is the potential for eye irritation. When I get it right, I my short, thin eyelashes are transformed into long, fluttery lashes. And they actually look quite natural. I tested the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; claims by splashing water on my face and the mascara didn&#x27;t budge. But it was easily removed with a little coconut oil and warm water. If you are patient and careful, this can be a great alternative to false eyelashes. I personally found it easier to apply than false eyelashes and the look is more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive  a sample of this product to review. I have never used fiber mascara before so this was my first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product, but decided to give it a try. I followed the directions and holy moly did it work. My lashes look longer and fuller to where I don&#x27;t need false lashes on my eyes to go out. I was considering getting latisse, but since I have blue eyes this is a better alternative for the price. The only thing to be careful of is to apply the fibers mid-lash to the end and not to apply the fibers at the base of the lashes. If you apply at the base of your lashes, the fibers will get in your eyes and cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bella Eleganza mascara today and it&#x27;s GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply, looks so natural and complements my lashes beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend it to every woman I know and order it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for producing such a great product. 10 ATARS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, the gel or sealant mascara goes on first which I love because on its own it already makes my lashes seem longer, once it has been applied the second step is the fibers. These need to be added to the still moist sealant and only start at the half way lash line, if these fibers get too close they irritate the eyes. Once applied go over again with sealant, and that&#x27;s it. Great for going out or everyday use. I wear contacts and this product did not cause irritation unless fibers get too close to eye. The case it comes with is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper 3D mascara and liked it, but thought I would look for something I loved. Tried this and HATED IT! It&#x27;s the worst 3D mascara I&#x27;ve ever owed! Doesn&#x27;t give you the big eye look at all. Going back to the cheaper stuff, found out from this crap that I do love the other stuff I usually buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> &amp;quot;I&#x27;ve used this product several times and absolutely love it! My lashes look much longer without me having to add false lashes</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and she is very happy. She call it awesome and that she feel like she has eye lashes like a Hollywood star. I will continue buying this for her!</li>
            <li> I have tried 3D fiber lash mascara ranging from $10 to $40. I saw no difference between Bella Eleganze 3D Fiber Lashes and the cheapest 3D fiber lashes. It is awful! Fibers get everywhere, it stinks, clumps and burns your eyes! I was so hoping that this brand would be more like the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes which doesn&#x27;t smell and fibers stay in place and is $10 cheaper than Bella Eleganze.Would not purchase again. Really cheap quality. You can get the same quality from the $10 to $15 3D fiber lashes offered here on amazon. So sad the quality was not as they claimed. The case, tubes and instruction insert were the same as one of the cheaper 3D fiber lash brands they smelled the saame too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I have tried other fiber mascras and did not like them. The usually clump very easily and flake off. This mascara does not, and I feel like it looks more natural, which I love! I have overly short lashes and have trouble finding mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and gives me my desired length while still looking natural. I am so glad I found this product! The photo that I posted is only ONE coat, and I didn&#x27;t have to use any other mascara like you&#x27;re suppose to with other fiber mascara brands! I am more than satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer- I received a discount on this product to give my honest opinion in return.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but with somewhat difficult and long application process my lashes did look good.  I guess I should have read the reviews better.  I sometimes got green tea flakes in my eyes and on my face during the day.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month now and I can say that it is a great mascara.  It is the first time I have tried using a &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara and was not sure what to expect.  It took a week or so to get use to the application (one eye always came out better than the other at first) but now that I have had practice I can make both eyes look fabulous in no time at all.  It is amazing to see the difference in your lashes when comparing one that is &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; with another that has been &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  They look real, feel light weight and not clumpy.  Best thing is that the mascara is so easy to take off at night but yet it gives you thicker looking lashes all day long!</li>
            <li> WOW! is all I can say I used this for the first time this mrning and my lashes look thick and full, it is insane with the diffrence, I am so in love with this and will be getting this for as long as you make it for! Love it Love it Love it!!</li>
            <li> While I wanted to give this product a great review, I just can&#x27;t.  Word to the wise, spend the extra $5.00 and get the real 3-D Fiber-lash.  When applying this I first off noticed the application brush.  It was thinner, and felt like if was scraping my lashes as I tried to apply it.  Next off was the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; tube.... WHAT A MESS!  I took the applicator out of the tube, but before I could even try to apply it I had fibers falling all over my face and into my eye.  I managed to get the fibers on, then &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it with a topcoat.... that lasted all of 5 minutes.  My eye was extremely irritated within minutes of putting this mascara on, then started burning and my vision got blurry.  I couldn&#x27;t get this off fast enough, worse yet was the fact that the next morning I was still getting the fibers out of my eye.  I own the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of the 3-D Fiber Lash and I will NEVER try another brand again</li>
            <li> It sure does do what it claims. Gave me thick long lashes without making them look fake. I love it and will be telling my friends and family!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!  I was kind of sceptical at first and was unsure how it would work.  But I absolutely love it.  I put a little bid of my regular mascara on (don&#x27;t have to use as much), then I used the gel which is just like putting on mascara.  The fibers go on next and was a little different at first and then I finalize with another coat of gel to set the fibers.  My eyelashes have never looked so good.  It stays on all day and they don&#x27;t look like fake eyelashes, they look great.  I admit it takes about 3 extra minutes a day but well worth it.  I have had people ask me what I&#x27;ve done different and that I look &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; as they say.  I am so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Love it great product and costs much less than younique for same results (I&#x27;ve tried younique. This product is every bit as good for half the price)</li>
            <li> This product is messy to use. I was excited at first, but the product became messy and hard to apply. I will go back to&lt;br /&gt;regular mascara and be happy with my own lashes.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this!!!  I was so excited to come across an extreme coupon for this product.  I have heard many good things about 3D Fiber Mascara.    First let me start by saying i am obsessed with finding the BEST mascara to make my thin and light lashes look longer and fuller. I have tried eye serums as well... but still end up using 3-4 coats of my go to mascara....    well, this has solved all my problems!  It is so easy to use and you see instant results.  The setting gel is a good mascara alone, you put this on first and while it is still wet, you put the fibers on and then put the setting one back on... This gave me wonderful eyelashes.  If you want them to be longer, they you would just repeat as needed.  I use 2 coats of the fibers and adore the results!    be careful how many coats you put on though, you dont want it to be too thick and look like tarantula eyes!    This is a great buy!    the picture attached is one eye with 2 fiber coats and one eye bare...  and then a pic with both done.</li>
            <li> Love the appearance it gives on my eyes but through out the day there is some shedding of the product that falls under my eyes. Maybe I&#x27;m not applying correctly, is that supposed to happen? Also when removing I always seem to get particles in my eyes. It&#x27;s really annoying! All in all I love the concept and the appearance it gives. Perhaps I need to learn how to better apply.</li>
            <li> This flakes like snow flakes that don&#x27;t melt.  It will last a long time but if a flake falls in your eye it is irratating.  I will continue to use but only if I I am willing to put up with some eye irritation if the flakes fall in.</li>
            <li> I loved it!  My lashes have thinned out over the years and this mascara made them thicker and fuller!  I love how you can keep applying to get different effects!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims. Would be great if this replaced false or lash extensions. It&#x27;s messy and takes a lot of time to apply.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 days. It irritated my eyes so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home from work to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;All day it seemed as though I had sand in both of my eyes.  Would not purchase again,</li>
            <li> I have no eye lashes and when I apply this mascara as directed my eyelashes are amazing!  It&#x27;s like I put on false eyelashes.  I can&#x27;t even explain how much I love this product.  I&#x27;ve never used a mascara that works the way this does.  I will continue buying this mascara forever!</li>
            <li> a few fibers do get into the eye :( but the effect is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this couple month as ago, I got an eye infection until this day. At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my eyes has been burning and itching. It was from this product. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! BAD FOR YOU EYES, I COULDN&#x27;T WEAR MY CONTACTS FOR A MONTH.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have weenie eyelashes and this product helped a great deal!  You can add as many layers as you want until you get the desired length of lashes.  My husband even noticed how nice my lashes looked after using this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty pleased with this purchase.  I only had issues with the fibers falling off onto my face the first time I used them.  Since then I have found that if I put another coat of regular mascara on top of the fibers it helps to hold them in place.  No issues with clumping.  Not bad at all for the price,  much better than what other brands charge!.  Really love the way my lashes look when I use this!!</li>
            <li> This is the first 3D fiber mascara that tells you where and what the fibers are made of. I&#x27;m highly impressed with this product because the fibers are made from green tea. The formula of the sealing gel is thicker than the other mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried which is something that I like. I don&#x27;t like the ones that are too liquidity. Makes my lashes fuller and they&#x27;re natural. This product is also waterproof but it isn&#x27;t hard to remove at the end of the day which is awesome!</li>
            <li> This made my lashes look so good. The trick to not getting fibers all over you is to apply a coat of gel from the bottom to top of your lashes and apply the fibers only to the top half of your lashes. I use about 3 coats to get the look i want.</li>
            <li> I bought this and loved it so much that I bought a second as a gift.  This mascara is amazing.  I&#x27;ve heard about that other brand....the expensive one...and I&#x27;ve wanted to try it.  This stuff has to be the equivalent because it can&#x27;t get any better.  I only use one coat and I get compliments on how pretty my plain jane brown eyes are!  it really does make your lashes so long and thick!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase a few weeks ago and I loooove how it makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer! I&#x27;ll definitely make this purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> This is like my holy grail the difference it makes on your eyes is crazy would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like spending time putting false lashes on like myself this gives the same effect even better then lashes I would say and you build it up ass u go</li>
            <li> Best Thickening Mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  Lashes look great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara because I have watery eyes and it smudges everywhere. This mascara is great! It stays on without irritation and really makes my eyes pop. My lashes look very long, thick and defined. Very similar to fake lashes, but without the hassle of figuring out how to put them on. I will definitely re-purchase this!</li>
            <li> This is good for a special event but it is too many steps for everyday</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  I never write reviews but for this product I will.  Follow the simple directions and your lashes will take on a new life.</li>
            <li> Received this today and could not wait to try it. I had watched a few YouTube videos on this product so I was ready to try it when it came. I am 58 years old and my eyelashes have thinned, using this product was like my lashes were 15 years ago. I love it.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product but so far I am very impressed with it. It is easy to apply for someone that is not a makeup artist and looks great. Removes much easier than anticipated so I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well but after you layer is even once it clumps and the fallout when applying is painful ( got into my eyes!!). 4 starts because it is one of the few mascaras that has actually made my lashes look longer and fuller. I found that if you lean forward (look down) that can help keep the junk from falling in your eyes when aplying</li>
            <li> one tube has long string like black fibers(?) that follow the brush as I pull it out to apply.  The second one leaves little bits of lint like material around my eyes (mostly underneath) and I have to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Your eyelashes will definitely appear much longer and thicker. It seems though that there is very little of the fiber and the gel mascara so it will be interesting to see how many uses I&#x27;ll get from it.</li>
            <li> I love how thick and long this makes my lashes. It does take a little bit of time to get used to using the product but once you get it it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I got better results with drug store mascara</li>
            <li> Great Product. I have always had very thin, short eye lashes. These give them 3 times the length and fullness. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Wow! This really works well. It is absolutely my new favorite mascara! There is no flaking or smudging...only beautiful and long lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of the fiber-type mascaras.  This is the only one that really works for me -  gives me very long, full looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t flake off all over my face and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling like I&#x27;ve stuck tiny needles into them like some kind of medieval torture routine.    If you&#x27;ve not used this type of mascara system, it&#x27;s a bit tricky at first &amp; I think people get frustrated.  You must follow the directions to the letter or you will be disappointed, worse yet you probably will feel like someone&#x27;s stuck those tiny needles in your eyeballs.    Per the instructions, do one eye at a time. This is essential because you apply the gel then quickly apply the fibers while the gel is still wet, wait about 20 seconds for the fibers to set then apply the gel again to seal in the fibers.  The sequence is gel-fibers-gel.  You can repeat these steps as often as you wish to get the desired effect.  I find 2 total coats of the system gives me the look I want.    One hint  from my own experience -  I find it helps to apply one coat of your regular mascara first before you begin the gel/fiber application then seal everything with a final coat of regular mascara.  It helps keep the fibers locked in.  My routine is regular mascara - gel -  fibers -  gel -  fibers -  gel  -  regular mascara.  Hope that helps you too.    This  removes easily with soapy facial cleanser and water provided you&#x27;re not using a waterproof mascara to seal the whole deal down.  I&#x27;ve now purchased this twice, and have also found their customer service to be great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It performs precisely as promised!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Would rebuy -  very easy to use</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!! I wear contacts daily and these didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, they didn&#x27;t flake or leave black residue under my eye lashes. They looked great all day! I&#x27;ve worn false lashes before and the glue irritated my eyes, but this gives you the same effect but with NO irritation! This was super easy to take off and I was just amazed by the product. -Jenn @ mommytime365.com</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try this product with all the good reviews, but i am soooo disappointed!  the little fibers kept falling into my eyes and irritating me!!!  i tried different ways of application, but the fibers always ended up falling into my eyes.  i&#x27;m used to using fake lashes and L&#x27;oreal or Revlon mascaras, and those work far better than this!  I&#x27;m ok with beauty is pain, but not if i can get better results without the pain!! I would have stuck with the fiber lash if it at least made my lashes look fuller/longer, but i get better results with just the L&#x27;oreal and Revlon mascaras. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is really great! First you have to put on a layer of your own mascara to prep for this product. Second you put on the stuff in the,&#x27;lengthening/ thickening&#x27; tube. Third, you put on their mascara to set the lengthening thickening stuff. Every eyelash is totally separated. My lashes turned out 1/3 longer and about 1/5 thicker, You can swim all day and it doesn&#x27;t come off. I really got, &#x27;movie star&#x27; lashes. It is very non-toxic smelling, and non-irritating. I&#x27;ve always been very drawn to getting eyelash extensions, but I&#x27;ve been too scared. Now I don&#x27;t even have to consider such a thing!</li>
            <li> This mascara made my eyes pop! I&#x27;m not super girly. I normally like to brighten up the lashes I have and call it a day. But, this product actually made me say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after I put it on. I wasn&#x27;t really sure how it worked- so I looked at the directions on the website to make sure I was doing what I was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara and spooly come in a nice black case. In fact, I was amazed at how pretty the packaging was! Would make an excellent gift, too!</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! All I can say is you MUST try!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try these because I have horribly short brittle thin lashes, but when they arrived I noticed the website says  DO NOT use with contact lenses, so i was so depressed, but I gave them to my sister who has the same issues I do and she loves it. She has very sensitive skin and this did not bother her at all. It lengthened them quite a bit and filled them out great.</li>
            <li> For I followed the directions love my eye lashes long, full and beautiful.  I wear contacts no problems, some fibers on my face here and there the fir time. Second time at the end I put a coat of my regular mascara to hold in place all well best one I have brought</li>
            <li> So I wanted to see how this would do in comparison to other mascara I buy from the department store.  I put this mascara on one eye and another on the other eye.  If you want a very natural look, use THIS mascara by itself.  If you want your eyes to POP, use this WITH your other mascara.  My eye&#x27;s look amazing!  I will definitely use this when I want my eyelashes to look full, long and evenly spread out.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must have for your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these 3D fiber lash mascara. I have always struggled with short, thin eye lashes and no amount of mascara helped. For as long as I can remember I used fake lashes or over compensated with thick dark eyeliner. I would see others with the long lushes lashes just making me frustrated I can&#x27;t have that. I was about to invest in those fake implants but I found this 3D fiber lashes and was in luck that they were running a promotion. I had to try this before I went and invested on the implants. I am so glad I did run into this promotion. The 3D fiber lashes gives me the lashes I want and the price oh I will be buying this from now on. I actually have lashes! I no longer have to mess with stinky, messy glue and the dark eyeliner is no more.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try and asked to leave feedback.  I was excited because I&#x27;m picky about the mascara I use.  It&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge and is not too stiff and annoying.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it because it&#x27;s a three or more step process; I love it!!!  The gel gives your lashes the length.  You apply that first, then the green tea fiber, and another coat of the gel.  Your lashes are beautiful, long, and they don&#x27;t clump.  I even had compliments from ladies at church, asking me where did I purchase this??  They love the look!!!  There are ladies who put their before and after photos, and I have the same experience.  Also, I live in Florida and it&#x27;s hot and humid, and this mascara didn&#x27;t smudge or irritate my eyes.  Also, they stayed looking beautiful. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! This was recieved very quickly!</li>
            <li> I love, Love, love the box!!! I love the fact that it makes my eyelashes look super long when I don&#x27;t have much it begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person but My lashes were noticeably fuller and thicker 1st application! !  Definitely recommend! !!</li>
            <li> This mascara is Fabulous! It does not give you tarantula looking lashes and it leaves your lashes looking like a natural lash falsies look. I am very pleased with this product! Heres my before and after using Bella Eleganze:)</li>
            <li> Today was the 1st day that I&#x27;ve tried Bella Eleganze....&amp; I must say that I&#x27;m really loving the effects of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;So long False Lashes.....Hello Bella Eleganze!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara really opens up your eyes! I&#x27;m still getting use to the fiber thing and have tiny issues with clumping but I&#x27;m sure with more practice and an eyelash comb this problem will be solved! I would recommend this product and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara.. Very great quality and works very well.. I will definitely be adding this to my stash of favorites great job &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Awesome product and I would definitely buy from again!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara way better than younique brand</li>
            <li> Opened my eyes up beautifully with 2 coats.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, it stays on all day at work and then is easy to remove at night. I&#x27;m completely addicted to this mascara now, 3D rocks. I&#x27;m interested in what other products this company offers.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail the other day and it is horrible. The brush was just falling apart. Will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> These come in a beautiful case ! Mascara works well for me and I have hardly any eyelashes to begin with 😊</li>
            <li> I love this mascara,  i don&#x27;t think i will go back to regular. Awesome sauce!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great product and easy to use.  Will never use false lashes again!</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly impressed with this mascara. I saw a Facebook friend post about it with results and knew I had to have it. The product arrived on time and I tried it for the first time yesterday. I am not great at applying make-up, but this was awesome. My lashes were long and black, very pretty. Several compliments on them throughout the day. Removal was easy with face wash and a wash cloth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works!  I watched a video about a product like this but when I saw the price of that product I choked a little.  This product was much  less and does the very same thing and it DOES work.  My lashes are longer and fuller without a doubt after I apply this. I&#x27;ve always  liked the fake eyelash look but thought it was cliche to glue things on your eyelids.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that, I get my own lashes, just improved.</li>
            <li> This mascara does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do! Gave me the look of false lashes without all the mess and fuss! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> amazing substitute for fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> works really well, surprisingly...wasn&#x27;t expecting much!</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this mascara when I was visiting last year.  I&#x27;ve been using Latisse which is very expensive and can only be purchased from a doctor.  I loved the 3D fiber lash and went on Amazon to give it another try.  Not disappointed and will purchase from you again.&lt;br /&gt;Jo Kelly,&lt;br /&gt;Huntington Beach, Ca</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be an amazing product, but as using this for the first time I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; too well. My lashes were very long but very clumpy. I think it&#x27;s due to the product.</li>
            <li> Great product, love how it makes my eyelashes look fuller</li>
            <li> The fibers come off and land under my eyes</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone wanting great looking lashes without the hassle of glue and false lashes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;this product is wonderful at giving me that false eyelash look! love it!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Do not like it! Does not live up to my expectations and definitely does not even come close to the way it is advertised!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  I have tried it twice, thinking I possibly didn&#x27;t follow the directions very well the first time.  Both times the fibers are everywhere on my face, under the eyes, over the eyes, you name it, there are black fibers everywhere on the face.  I will not be using this again.  What a waste of a lot of money for a very poor product.</li>
            <li> fibers keep falling into my eye which causes irritation</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying fiber mascara and I absolutely love this stuff!  It was super easy to apply and looked great on!  I probably won&#x27;t use it everyday but it&#x27;s great for special occasions or date night!  Also, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it coming off or smudging like some mascaras do.  Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Lots of steps involved, and it flakes off easily. I got it for a promo price because they were looking for reviews on their product.  If you&#x27;re going to do something like this, just go with a younique product.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it goes on quite heavy and then gets a little clumpy</li>
            <li> Love love love this product😍 ive always wanted longer eyelashes but false eyelashes never looked good or felt good on my eyes. I would definitely recommend to a lot of people.</li>
            <li> best think ever invented for lashes!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is Great stuff! I love it.</li>
            <li> Of course I have heard of 3D lashes before but have always been reluctant to get any because of the mixed reviews and the hefty price tag. I got these while they were doing a promotion so I did not have to pay full price. I am glad I stumbled upon them because I have to say that I love them! Yes, applying them is a little more time consuming than using JUST mascara - but think of the time it would take you to put on some fake lashes - and the glue, oh the glue! There is an involved process, but the end result is worth it! Apply one layer of your own mascara, then one coat of the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again to set everything. Repeat as much as you want until you get the desired look. I found that just one layer is good for me. I have barely there lashes so mascara is always an important part of my routine. I only wear there to go out, because for me, at work they are too much lol. But I am a fan for sure!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I really like this product. You do have to work quickly, but your lashes do not clump and they are very long. Doesn&#x27;t flake off mid day. Great product.</li>
            <li> Fast glam with little fuss.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara looks gorgeous and stays gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;This is a two step process.&lt;br /&gt;Both products go on easy and the extensions stay on without straying.&lt;br /&gt;YES it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Make my eyes BURN!&lt;br /&gt;the fine fibbers gets into the eyes any hurt ALOT !!&lt;br /&gt;this is junk</li>
            <li> I honestly could not be happier.. This is the first and only Fiber lash product I&#x27;ve tried and considering I typically don&#x27;t have visible eye lashes this has transformed my eyes, and my life!! I&#x27;m so excited to say that I WILL be coming back and referring other ladies. I&#x27;m already sharing my before and after shots. thanks!</li>
            <li> I SO wanted to like this -- one of my favorite YouTubers (#ColleenBallingerEvans) highly recommended it, so I bought two. This may work for women already generous eyelashes -- but, for someone like me, who barely has lashes, this did not work. It did not stay on and repeatedly flaked off. I could not get it to stay on or work. It was frustrating :(</li>
            <li> You get much better volume with this than you do with just plain ol&#x27; mascara alone. It&#x27;s fun to use, and simple. First, you put on your mascara. Then you put on the transplanting gel. Third, you apply the fiber&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get eyelashes that look much longer and better! It works great! &amp;#60;3 I enjoyed using it. It&#x27;s fun. A bit of work, but I can tell a good difference with just 1 layer! You keep layering it if you want more length.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so light on my lashes and makes them look so much longer and fuller.  I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used!!  It has all kinds of filaments that glop on and get in your eyes.  :Last time I used this, I had a filament in my eye for about 2 hours.  It was horrible,  Not good quality and very expensive,  Fancy packaging and case but terrible product.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eye...so painful!</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that works! I tried the current big deal brand that all of my friends are selling and was not impressed. My lashes just looked clumpy and awful and like I had way too much makeup globbed on. I tried it several times and it was so bad I just gave it away.  The reviews said this one was much better so I ordered some. When it arrived, I scrubbed my face, put a light coat of my favorite mascara on, and then proceeded to give myself the most incredible lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen. I have too many rows of lashes so I can&#x27;t wear false ones, my lash line is too uneven for them to sit right. So previously I could only get so far with mascaras. This made my lashes SO thick and lush and long!!  I did get fibers everywhere but I tend to be a klutz about things and I am pretty certain I&#x27;ll get better with technique in time. I even got the fibers in my eyes as I was putting it on but it actually doesn&#x27;t hurt and I was able to just fish it right back out with a tissue.  I could not be more thrilled. My husband of nearly 20 years even noticed and was very impressed! Once I add some cat eye liner and shadow I will be able to achieve the va-voom look I want for our next trip to Vegas.  I highly recommend this brand. My lashes are nice and long and look good with mascara. With this stuff? Serious wow factor. My lashes are still flexible too. With the other brand they were so stiff that if I brushed against them, they moved and stayed moved! Not cute! They do not have that &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34; look with the Bella Eleganze 3D Fiber Mascara either. Spider legs are creepy...not cute. haha   And the price is right for just about anyone to give it a try! Go for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. :)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is my second time ordering this mascara. I&#x27;ll order it again as well.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is way more complicated than I imagined it would be to apply! The little pieces of fuzz &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; end up going into my eye and causing irritation to my eye ball before I even get the chance to put the second gel coat on. It&#x27;s extremely irritating. Have used it twice. My eyelashes looked clumpy both times. No more for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as younique...case and everything but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that product! I finally resolved the tired eyes issue. Being over 40 requires a better way to show your eyes. I hate fake eyelashes. So, this is exactly what I was hoping for. I wish I knew sooner this product is out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it! I absolutely love it and have recommended this brand to others!</li>
            <li> Took waaayyy to long!! First time i used it the fiber lashes it got in my eye and it took hours to get out.</li>
            <li> This mascara is magic!!! I looooooove it.  My eyelashes are long, thick and lush.  I love the way my eyes look.  The girls at work noticed immediately, they thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  I had to show them the product.  I&#x27;m ordering another two, another for myself, I love this fiber lash mascara so much I don&#x27;t want to use it all before I have another one in my makeup bag.  And, one for my mother. She couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my lashes.  Thanks for making, what most women want, great eyelashes.  AND, all I do is soak a cotton ball in water to remove the mascara, it&#x27;s that  simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A customer forever.&lt;br /&gt;MaryJo</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product returned due to having a strong chemical smell.  After using product, I ended up with eye irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted rate.  My review is an unbiased and honest review.  This is my opinion and experience.</li>
            <li> I really liked this fiber mascara. It was my first time using such a product and although I have wanted to use something like this for a very long time (I love mascara and it&#x27;s the only makeup I use besides occasional lip gloss and lip stains) I never really had the time to do my research. I actually ordered this by mistake (pressed the 1-click purchase button by mistake and didn&#x27;t realize until after I got the email stating it was shipped). However, I am so glad I did! It was easy to use. I was very nervous because many people got the fibers in their eyes, causing irritation. I applied mascara, then the gel then the fibers and repeated two times. Loved the results! My lashes look longer, fuller and make my eyes stand out. Hopefully, I will not experience having fibers in my eyes; it sounds painful!</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with this Mascara I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> **update 4/27/15 after using this mascara for a month or 2 i actually change my mind and like it as much as younique. The gel is different but after getting used to that, the mascara stays on for a real long time and doesnt flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is good, but it is not AS good as Younique. I like Younique&#x27;s base gel better, I feel that it applies easier and the fibers stick better. But I suppose that is what you are to expect for half the price.</li>
            <li> Just got my order today and I love it , have to be patient and repeat steps for longer length,</li>
            <li> Loved the case for the mascara, such a great touch. Super easy to use, love the results, long thick lashes!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara I no longer need to buy false lashes cuz it makes them look so thick and long</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used any mascara that wasn&#x27;t the traditional mascara.  Easy to apply and it did make my lashes fuller and longer but there was some clumping.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and my eyelashes appear to grow right in front of my eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with fiber mascara, and I gotta be honest.  I have been using this for about a week and I&#x27;m not sure I like it.  It may be that I haven&#x27;t quite got the knack of yet, it looks good when I leave the house in the morning but by 4:30 in the afternoon it looks fake and clumpy. So for now I give it three stars.  I&#x27;m going to keep working on  the application though.</li>
            <li> I like product, works well, really Makes lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> Would get a higher rating but it does flake all day.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?! This mascara is easy to use and makes you lash long and thick. Be prepared to get many compliments on your beautiful eyes. I also like that this products last all day and do not have to apply additional coats.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the fibers do not work real well with contacts. I am going to try again for I don&#x27;t use it everyday only when going out so will keep trying it. I do think it makes the eyelashes longer and thicker which is good.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that gives me a full and long-lasting look, and this product does that exact thing! Also I&#x27;d like to mention it does not leave clumps on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara for thick and long lashes</li>
            <li> I thought this mascara was AMAZING! The first time I used it, it was a bit clumpy and I had bits falling into my eyes all day..but I went online for some tips, and learned that the sealing gel is CRUCIAL..before AND after. Make sure you coat your lashes well with it, or the fibers will fall out, which left me picking at my eyes. I tried it again, doing ONE EYE AT A TIME, and had amazing results! No fallout, no clumps..just the prettiest eyelashes I have had in years! I have to say that this mascara truly makes me feel pretty, and a bit better about myself...I felt like everybody noticed me!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. You have to be careful to do one side at a time and have both tubes in hand, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes longer than they have ever been.  I use it every day and love it!</li>
            <li> My  4 dollar Wet and Wild mascara works better than this 30 dollar scam. AND... the fiber brush fell apart the first day I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! Definitely try it out</li>
            <li> This is really great!  I actually tried a different brand before purchasing, but since I couldn&#x27;t get it in time for Christmas, I though I would try this one.  I am so happy I did, it was definitely the hit of the presents.  I use it regularly to make my lashes longer and fuller.  It does not flake, which is very important to me as I wear contacts, and is easily removed with my regular face wash.  On special occasions, I apply several coats to make my eyes stand out even more, but the first coat definitely makes a big difference.  Do one eye at a time, and you will see the results immediately.  I highly recommend and will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara, no clumps, makes them fuller and much longer, and it washes off 10x easier than regular mascara. This is my first time using fiber mascara and I&#x27;m never going back to regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!! Does not run! Leave lashes looking full!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try fiber lash mascara for awhile. I&#x27;m too impatient to wait for an order from younique. I LOVE this mascara. I now see what the big deal is all about! Definite MUST TRY! I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Loooove this!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I applied my own mascara first..then I start layering with  the seal then followed by fiber mascara...love love love!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Lashes look great and it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> This mascara works wonders, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is trying to achieve the look of having longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara ever. It elongates my eyelashes and added lots of volume. The best part is that my eyelashes do not look fake or lumpy, they look very natural. I received lots of compliments on my eyelashes the first time I tried it. Also, it comes off easily with eye make-up remover. I usually do not write reviews for products, but this one really made an impression on me.</li>
            <li> My go to favorite mascara product! Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this made my eyelashes look so long! They look amazing when I am wearing this. I like it even more than the Younique version.</li>
            <li> I love this product but only gave it four stars instead of five because I am a contact wearer.  I did notice minimal irritation due to the small fibers getting into my eyes.  Again, it is minimal and does not bother me enough to stop using the product.  I have very long eyelashes naturally, but they are on the thinner side.  This product definitely thickens, lengthens and looks natural for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This give me great looking lashes but it irritates my eyes. I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> This is my first time using 3D fiber lash mascara. I have to say, I am definitely impressed. I have been going back and forth for a while now trying to decide if wanted to give it a try or not, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I was very much afraid of getting the dreaded spider-leg-lashes, but that&#x27;s not at all the look that I got from this mascara. It makes my lashes super long and I can build it up to make them as thick as I want. I like this best for the length it gives my lashes. I can now skip trying to fuss with false lashes and still have big, beautiful lashes. I did end up getting a little fiber in my eye. It didn&#x27;t burn, sting, or hurt.. It was just extremely annoying until I was able to remove the fiber from my eye. I have extremely sensitive eyes, too. These didn&#x27;t bother me at all! I&#x27;m really loving this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Love this much, makes my eyelashes long. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This definetely thickens the eyelashes and makes them a little longer, but not as long as I thought - it looks like you have a lot of mascara on.</li>
            <li> I actually like this a lot more than the younique version. It made my eyelashes look naturally longer versus clumpy or ridiculous the way the other one worked for me. I would recommend this version over the other one. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products that Bella Eleganze comes out with. Nice dupe!</li>
            <li> It burns your eyes and the fibers fall off</li>
            <li> Less expensive and works great!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> It works! Just make sure to curl your eyelashes first, then apply the mascara &amp;#34;the gel&amp;#34;, right after apply the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; &amp; repeat the procress until you are satisfied with the results. This may not be the best mascara for everyone but in my opinion it does a better job than all the other expensive name brand mascara&#x27;s. I repeatedly spent so much $ on different  type of mascara&#x27;s all promising to make my lashes longer, thicker, &amp; all of the above. The difference  is this one does a better job &amp; it&#x27;s  A LOT cheaper than all the other one&#x27;s  I&#x27;ve  purchased.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have noticed that the fibers come off onto my face everyday.  I did not have the same experience with the other brand I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!!!  I have tried so many mascaras to find one that does exactly what this one does.  I was worried that the fibers would start falling off during the day and they don&#x27;t.  In fact, I slept with it on just to see what it would look like in the morning, and it still looked great!  This will be the only mascara I use from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. My lashes are indeed longer when I use this product. I loved it so much, I bought an extra set for my sister to give as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I love these. I can really see a difference in my lash length. I loveeee these. I wish I had more. Only small complaint is sometimes when I&#x27;m applying it I get a little fiber in my eye. And it can be a pain getting it out. But compared to how great the product is, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely amazing!  Directions say to do two coats or as desired. Well I only had to do one coat and it was enough! I&#x27;ve read many directions for fiber mascara and some say use over one coat of your own mascara and then the two coats of the fiber one, I did it that way and was very pleased with the results. I wanted to compare the two mascaras by seeing the difference and its like night and day! My daughter tried the fiber one alone and was very happy with how her lashes turned out. I give 5* to The Lash Fiber Mascara.</li>
            <li> This works wonders!  I have really short lashes and have been looking for a mascara to help thicken and lengthen for a while now.  Nothing has worked or has clumped.  I was skeptical when trying this but immediately I saw it worked.  You put on one of the tubes, then the green tea fibers.  Then you recoat.  I did this a few times and my lashes did get longer each time.  I probably could have kept going, but had to stop at some point!  Yes it works and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Definitely not for contact users.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers got into my eyes and irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works wonders and I highly recommend it. I was 110% satsified and I am such a fan!</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my lashes look so long. I do put a coat of mascara on first the follow with the steps per the package.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The more I use it the better I like it.</li>
            <li> Very flaky....flakes got into my eyes :( very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a copy of the original &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34; and caused severe eye irritation.  DO NO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have alright lashes, they aren&#x27;t super long or anything but they&#x27;re alright. Well my best friend started doing eyelash extensions and she was always having to go in to the salon and have them fixed and have more added, so it was kind of a turn off to me. So when I was offered this3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it. So it arrived and I used it like the directions stated. I only needed the first swipe with the fibers. They were definitely long enough! The nice part is it wasn&#x27;t clumpy and looking all fake. I definitely recommend these 3D Fiber Lash Mascara from Bella Eleganze for everyone who wants natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> best. SO so great. Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love it</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my sister and was slightly confused as how to use it but I ended up getting the hang of it and wow there is a huge difference. I applied it to my eyelashes without curling it to see the difference then applied the mascara stuff after I curled it, there was definitely a difference in an amazing way. It takes a bit more time to put mascara but its so worth it. I applied it 3x - switching from gel to fiber 3x to get it the length and thickness that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am 82 years old and I tried this product, and I was amazed.  My eyelashes looked thick and long.  OMG I love this product</li>
            <li> Great product, packaging and quality. I have been a makeup artist for over 8 years and am very impressed with the customer service satisfaction follow up. I will remain a customer for the VIP treatment. Appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds a bit of volume to my eye lashes. As long as these tubes last a couple months, I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> As advertised does improve the look of lashes. Thicker and longer. However somewhat disappointed at flaking.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. My Cover Girl mascara is easier to apply and had the same results.</li>
            <li> This fiber mascara works really well! I saw Colleen Ballinger a youtuber saying she used it and her lashes looked amazing so I thought I should try it. Glad I did! You can really build with it and &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; your lashes to look longer and fuller. I have the shortest lashes and usually wear false lashes, but after using this it almost seems like I have my false ones in, only more natural! It does take practice to apply this mascara, its a two step process and you want to make sure to apply the fibers while the gel is still wet and seal it again quickly with the gel. I think the best part is that you can keep adding as much length as you want while still looking natural. It really is amazing! Also the customer service here is A+++, very prompt and friendly. Thank you Bella Eleganze Team! :)</li>
            <li> Horrible. Just spend the extra cash and buy Younique the real deal.</li>
            <li> It dries out quickly.  It didn&#x27;t last very long.  I find that after 2 weeks, I need to purchase another set.</li>
            <li> Does add length but flakes off in your eyes and on your face.</li>
            <li> Better than younique lash mascara. This one is not clumpy and not too much fiber. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gave it a lot of chances before writing a review. I can see one or two lashes with a tiny bit of length but the rest just look clumpy and dark. I will not buy this product again. Drug store brand works better.</li>
            <li> Wow finally found a great product that does enhance my lashes lady&#x27;s please try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.Amazing product well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works just like the other brand in my opinion but I prefer traditional mascara.  Is you are into fiber mascara this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have wanted 3D lashes for a year now. After reading reviews on these I ordered this brand. I am very happy with them. Put the sealer on first.  I have a eye lash brush I used between coats so that they don&#x27;t stick together because that can happen with anything you out on your lashes. I would have posted pictures up of the before and after but I have rosacea (this is new) and I don&#x27;t want people to see that. Lol. They are worth the what $25. I just ordered these last night and hit over night shipping on them. I do not wear a lot of make up so this will last me awhile. I really just wanted you see what it looked like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other type of fiber lashes and wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to expect. I have pretty short lashes and I was pleasantly surprised. In the picture, the left side has lengthing mascara only and the right has 1 coat of the fiber lashes. I love the look and they lasted all day without flaking off.</li>
            <li> As a beauty industry professional I have found that all fiber mascara helps lengthen and add volume to your lashes since the tiny fibers are added to it. I have also found, however that the original (younique 3d moodstruck mascara) (I get mine from lashalert.com) are definitely the best. Younique&#x27;s are better because they don&#x27;t flake, don&#x27;t dry out through the day, dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it is completely mineral. If you want longer thicker lashes use fiber mascara, and if you want the very best longer thicker lashed, use younique!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love it love it love it. If there is a bad review its crap I am a makeup artist and have putting on lashes this is quick and nice way and easy of looking great. It&#x27;s not clumpy doesn&#x27;t run of the eye! This stuff is addicting!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, very natural looking dramatically long eyelashes..recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works. My eyelashes now touch my eye brows.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this 3D Fiber Mascara. I was interested in trying a fiber mascara after my friends posted about another brand on facebook. The other kinds, however, was far more expensive and had mixed reviews. I went online and did a ton of research and found this brand to be the highest rated and less expensive, so I decided to give it a try for the price. I fell in love! I first wore it when I went out for my best friend and mine&#x27;s birthday. I came home after going out with here and my fiance asked me if I was wearing some of my contacts (they make my eyes look bigger). I said &amp;#34;nope, just fiber mascara&amp;#34; and he said it made my big brown eyes look even brighter! He noticed the difference right away. I get comments all the time when I go out from people saying how pretty my eyes are. I love that there wasn&#x27;t a learning curve either, it was easy for me to use straight from the package. The only thing I caution is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes longer to put on than regular mascara since you have to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;2. When taking it off a night, it does leave the fiber flakes in the sink and takes longer to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, I love this! I will certainly be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> really works, my lashes look longer and thicker</li>
            <li> I was a bit unconvinced of this product&#x27;s claims with the recent push of fiber mascaras but this is the real deal! I am in LOVE with my unreal-looking REAL lashes! It does take a bit of practice to get the fibers just right but no more difficult than applying regular mascara once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried applying this on 3 separate occasions now.  The second time making sure I applied the fibers very quickly so the gel didn&#x27;t dry and the 3rd time with a coat of mascara first.  That worked better than the other 2 times, but it flakes horribly, I constantly feel like there is something in my eyes, and every time I look in the mirror it&#x27;s on my face.  For me, it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not too bad if you can get past the smell. It takes some practice to not get it to clump so much. I&#x27;ll use it, but I won&#x27;t likely order it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and as soon as it arrived she tried it. She absolutely loved it at first. It gave  her the thick full long lashes she wanted but when she wore it for not when an hour the fibers started falling off her lashes on to her face. By the time she came home from work all the fibers had fallen off and her lashes looked normal again. So this product she would only recommend carrying with to reapply if you plan on have your luscious lashes all day or night.</li>
            <li> I got this fiber mascara because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try it and since it was on promotion I bought it. Since this is the first time I have ever used fiber mascara I must say it is amazing. I absolutely love it and I use it every day since I&#x27;ve gotten it. I get plenty of complements on it.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try Fiber Mascara for months. I have seen before and after pictures and have never believed them. When the opportunity came to purchase this item under 30 dollars, I read the reviews, didn&#x27;t believe them, but was encouraged to buy them by my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is wow. I used these on the weekend because I wanted to be close to home if and when I had to remove the mascara. I have VERY sensitive eyes and was worried about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this product greatly deliver on its promises of giving me beautiful lashes, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the 10+ hours I wore it. I am so happy I found this mascara and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have always had very short lashes and have tried artificial lashes, glued in individual ones, etc but this gives me fuller, better appearing lashes than anything I have tried before  It lasts all day also, love it!</li>
            <li> Incredible if you want a dramatic effect. Irritates the eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this mascara. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It is the best and lives up to all it&#x27;s advertising. It also washes off very easy.</li>
            <li> I got this for FREE and it was ALL the description says that it was. I just have to practice putting it on my eyes. I will have pictures ready this weekend so everyone can see. I got it delivered on time and the case it comes in is good. It is child resistant, it&#x27;s tightly closed. I can carry it without worrying about it opening up. My lashes actually look fuller because I have thin lashes. They look longer too like fake ones,individual. This is my honest unbiased opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Must have for long lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Younique, Love Alpha, and this brand of fiber lashes, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> hate this soooo much. Went on weird and ugly. Then, flaked off in my eyes all day. stupid</li>
            <li> This stuffs great and really works!</li>
            <li> I accidentally got this in my eye and could see straight for two days... seriously, it was terrifying! No thank you.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to Younique.</li>
            <li> Love love love my new lash system</li>
            <li> Flakes, so. Over all it does extend the lashes though</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister in law  as a christmas gift..she hasnt worn false lashes since then. She was amazed with the results! Everyone thinks that they are fake lashes!! Amazing product...just be careful not to get fibers in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Tubes feel cheaply made, the gel doesn&#x27;t&#x27; seem wet enough to hold the fibers. It did separate my lashes which made them look long, but not as thick as promised</li>
            <li> This product is awful. It makes your lashes all clumpy. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I don&#x27;t know much about make up and have to do a lot of experimenting with different products, which can get costly. It is safe to say I found my mascara!!</li>
            <li> I found this mascara from a You Tube video.  My lashes are sparse and short and I hate them.  However, when I used this, it made my lashes more pronounced and visible.  There are SO many mascaras to chose from - glad I tried this one!</li>
            <li> Nice, I wish it had better instructions or suggestions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, no clumbs goes on nice and looks good when you finish. Also&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have to apply multiple times throught the day if I&#x27;m going out in the evening&lt;br /&gt;I would reapply for touch up otherwise one application is enough.</li>
            <li> Sure, it makes your lashes appear longer, but only for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, the fibers break loose and you then have fibers in your eye and under it as well. If you want flawless lashes, don&#x27;t use this product. EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with my first results but decided to do another coat to see if these Fiber Lashes really would boost the length and thickness with each application.  I didn&#x27;t believe my lashes could look so fabulous without looking clumpy but I was proven wrong. Bella Eleganze gives me that false lash look without any clumps and without having to apply false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying these Fiber Lashes you want to do it quick to make sure the first coat of Transfer Gel is still wet to apply the green tea fibers. The fibers are dry but the transfer gel will hold the fibers as long as the gel is still wet while applying them. After you apply your fibers add an extra coat of gel to seal on the fibers. If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with just one application you can repeat the steps until you get your desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with these Fiber Lashes. Just make sure you don&#x27;t rub your eyes or the fibers will fall on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product free of charge for inspection &amp; honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the positive and negative reviews. I really like how this works, it adds length but not to the point of looking fake,and the thickness it adds is really great!!! It does flake a little even when you use the sealer,but that&#x27;s to be expected because it&#x27;s microfiber. Also I don&#x27;t have a problem with washing it off either. Guess of you do you probably applied more than two coats.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering Youniqe, my fault for not reading throughly enough. When I typed in my search engine Youniqe lashes, this is what pulled up, needless to say, I was disappointed. It&#x27;s not even comparable to Youniqe.</li>
            <li> it seems to work well, I had some cataract surgery and couldn&#x27;t wear it for a week. but I think I&#x27;m going to like it. Makes my lashes look long and a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Awesome results!  I got my mascara today. I watched the YouTube video on how to apply.  Very easy.  I have beautiful long eyelashes without clumpy spider eyelashes. I love long eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had long lashes, and this product works as promised! It can be irritating if applied too close to the lid, so be forewarned...but if properly used, it makes my lashes longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> I liked it but the fibers can get in your eyes at times. Works better than the average mascara but I would recommend applying less fibers to make it look more natural. I swipe a clean mascara brush afterwards to lessen the amount of fibers so my lashes don&#x27;t look as fake.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It has great coverage.  Application is easy and there was no smudging throughout the day and evening.  Finally a mascara that looks natural on and does not clump.</li>
            <li> I actually took a shot and ordered this for my wife. As you can imagine I do not know very much about makeup, but fortunately for me it must be pretty darn good because she LOVES it. In fact she told me to make sure to reorder so that she doesn&#x27;t run out! Score one big ol&#x27; win for me! (and her it seems)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A before/after pic and a with/without pic the 2-pc Bella Eleaganze mascara is attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday wear, I go with a light application of mascara. The top photo is what I would wear on a normal day--this is with my own Avon mascara. Then, I applied the 2-step Bella Eleganze mascara, per the instructions, only on my right eye for comparison purposes. The lower picture is after application on only one eye. The directions call for you to put on some of your mascara, let it dry, then apply the gel product that comes in a typical mascara tube, then while the gel is still wet, apply the fiber product that also comes in a mascara tube. Follow with the gel product to set the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a dynamite look without false lashes or tons of gunky mascara. Love it!</li>
            <li> I certainly would not pay the full price for this item.  One of the sticks seemed dried up and the other one wasn&#x27;t any better than the mascara I got at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so much thicker and longer ... Love it.</li>
            <li> Does not meet my expectations at all! Runs and flakes. Have had better luck with drugstore brands</li>
            <li> Great Mascara, I would buy this again.  Makes my eye lashes look very long.  I bought one for me and one for my daughter.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I was pretty underwhelmed by this lash system. It ends up giving a decent mascara look but it is not revolutionary by any means. I saw no additional length over my typical products. I wear it sometimes, as I have a tendency to switch out my lash makeup but don&#x27;t think that I will purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> All I really can say is wow. I really like what this does to my eye lashes and all my friends are coming over to see what it is. They tell me how good it looks on me. I am hoping that when I need a refill they will have another coupon on this product because I will differently be ordering this again; even if I have to pay full price.</li>
            <li> It definitely extended my lashes but didn&#x27;t keep them up very long :( but I love the case it comes in!</li>
            <li> Concept is great if it worked which in this case it didn&#x27;t. I followed the directions to a tee but within an hour or two the fibers kept getting in my eyes. Wish it did work but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t. Glad I only paid a $1.00 for it.</li>
            <li> I love this set! I use an eyelash curler, apply Bella Eleganze mascara, then the fibers, and one more coat of the mascara. I have no need to use any other mascara with this. Between the eyelash curler and using these two I end up with very long dark lashes that make my eyes pop. I also really love how the tubes come in a cute little black snap close case so I can carry this with me wherever I want!</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the &amp;#34;extended lash&amp;#34; products, only to be frustrated with the results. Lots of smudging, clumping and glopping.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read a review about Eleganza Lashes and I could tell it was different. So I bought it and took it to a wedding, and used it on my daughter(a bridesmaid), on my sister and myself. We all loved the result. It was so easy to follow the instructions and get an amazing result. We are all hooked on it. Going to buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Works as described. I used it just a few times so far and each time I got great results. It really does make your lashes look fuller and it&#x27;s not clumpy looking.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My lashes look natural but enhanced. Does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just curious, isn&#x27;t this a copy cat of the Youngtique which you buy thru consultants online.  I wonder if anyone has tried this product and compared it to this???  The price difference isn&#x27;t that much, and it is nice to think that the consultant does make some money.  Empowering other woman!</li>
            <li> I got this due to a youtuber, Colleen ballinger, who said it was really good and she uses it everyday. I love her and mascara lol so I gave it a whirl! After I got it in the mail(on time) I was very unhappy with the outcome. It smudges and smears and runs almost instantly! Very upset :(</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and ahead of time it estimated delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the packaging of the product was great. Inside the appealing box was a sturdy and high quality hinged case with the 2 vials clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were clear and easy to read. The product was easy to use and apply as directed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product and the sealing gel was great, it went on smoothly and without clumping  next you apply the fibers and they were hard to get onto my lashes naturally looking. After a few tries I was able to get a look I was satisfied with but when I went to seal the fibers with the sealing gel again I found that it brushed all the fibers off and I had to begin again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After another attempt and only lightly sealing the fibers I was satisfied with the look. I got compliments all day about how great my lashes looked and how pretty my eyes were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed around late afternoon after wearing it all day that the lashes were brushing off and all over my face. I&#x27;m not sure if thats typica--l it is summer here and Hot so I&#x27;m not sure if I was just sweating more then typical and thats what caused the smudging and flaking or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I dont dislike the product and will continue to use it and perfect application and sealing technique as application can be tricky with these systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the it lasted as long and looked just as much as competitors fiber lash kits I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 3D mascara, but this honestly was the best one I&#x27;ve used! Loved it because it didn&#x27;t flake (like there&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had) and it actually made my eyelashes look a lot longer and natural! Got so many compliments about my eyelashes being so long and pretty. Recommend them 100% would order from them again!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it really makes your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! It transforms your lashes in minutes. You won&#x27;t ever have to worry about getting your lashes fixed at a salon again! You will not be disappointed with this product girls!! With the price you can&#x27;t beat it!! Go ahead and don&#x27;t look any further for another mascar!</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;Love it&amp;#34;.... i have receive sooo many compliments regarding the way my lashes look. this was truly a great investment on myself.!!!.</li>
            <li> Use on special occasions, gives nice dramatic effect. I have very light lashes and it does the job. It does have a learning curve so read the directions. This is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I just use make up remover or baby wipes to remove it. I am a RN and it is nice to just throw  this on and look halfway decent.</li>
            <li> I love it and I want some more (:</li>
            <li> I played with it for the first time tonight. I followed others recommendations and applied a coat of my fav mascara first, L&#x27;Oreal Manga Lash. Then working on only one eye, applied the get from midlash out, then fibers, then gel. I only tried one coat and lashes were fuller and much longer appearing than with just mascara. It is a little tricky and might take me a time or too to master, but on first attempt the minimal clumping I saw was easily fixed with a quick swipe of an eyebrow brush. Didn&#x27;t look clumpy or spidery at all, just looked as advertised, like falsies! Washed off super easy with a swipe of Avon&#x27;s eye make up remover, then plain old soapy water.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service and great product</li>
            <li> I am still learning to use it to benefit my lashes.</li>
            <li> got a refund not for me they were very nice prompt refund.</li>
            <li> Not as good quality as buying direct from company..maybe old..kinda dry.</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok but not what I expected based on the reviews. A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love my new hairbrush. Was a bit leery about ordering it, but, oh, so nice. Love the way it feels on my hair and scalp, love the way it feels in the palm of my hand. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Lived up to all expectations.  Shipping was great</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This mascara actually holds true to what it claims, which is great! I used it on top of my normal volumizing mascara and then added these two amazing thickening coats. The aplication is easy and the Transplating Gel goes on smoothly followed by and easy smooth application of the Moodstruck Natural Fibers.  The two applications went on clump free, and made my eyelashes look fuller and longer, and (as a bonus) it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t smudge or end up under my eyes!  I felt that one coat gave me the desired fullness and thickness, but the instructions do say you can add additional coating for an even fuller look.  Definitely makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> The package was great and the item defiantly works better than I expected!! It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara, the company is very nice and even sent me a free gift!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 3D Mascara. First time trying 3D Fiber mascara and before purchasing, I had to read the reviews. Since the reviews were all positive, I went ahead and purchased it. This is better than falsies and getting extensions. Easy to apply and looks really great. I get compliments everytime and people always think I have falsies or extensions on when really it&#x27;s just the mascara. Worth the $!</li>
            <li> Saw a product like this demonstrated on &amp;#34;the Doctors&amp;#34; tv show.  I have never had much in the way of lashes and false lashes just aren&#x27;t for me.  I&#x27;m 64 years old and I pretty much just went through life with my mascara etc.  Tried this (by the way; it wasn&#x27;t as much as they quoted on the show) and I am so amazed I can&#x27;t feel it, but it sure is different.  I have lashes!</li>
            <li> I have not used a product like this before. However, I liked this fiber lash mascara more than I had expected. If used with care it extends your lashes without the glumpy look that I was concerned about. I would purchase this again at the same price.</li>
            <li> I am now a firm believer, I absolutely love this product.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all. Super clumpy and fuzzy and was constantly shedding and getting into my eyes. But the seller is great and thanks to amazon prime I got free return and full refund so I&#x27;m glad I at least got to try it. Maybe it will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am extremely picky about mascara and I was very leery about trying this. A couple weeks into using it, I have to say... I am beyond impressed! I will definitely be ordering again!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> fibers fall off on a continual basis. Not recommended for contact lens wearers</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product compares favorably to others that sell for much more. It greatly increases the length of your lashes. I definitely recommend it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> My wife says this is a great product and she loves sealing gel but the natural fiber one makes her eyes water so she cannot use that part. She says with the sealing gel she loves the way it looks without the natural fiber one.</li>
            <li> This is one terrific product I love it  ! I&#x27;ll never get false eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> Would never get again- did everything they said to- fibers to thick!!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this product &amp; wish I would have saved my money.  It flakes off and gets in my eye. My eyes are red &amp; irritated when I have worn this.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use and think this makes my eyelashes look great but I have really sensitive eyes and it irritates them a lot!</li>
            <li> this product causes spider lash. It just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would. I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper 3d fiber lashes that pulled the mustard much better on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It is Amazing!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply but has to be reapplied once or twice during the day due to the fibers falling off.</li>
            <li> I received this today and It was given to me for free as long as I leave my honest opinion, With that said first it comes in a very nice case and a card inside that says you win a free gift not sure what it is but its on its way:)  i right away put this on and i was simply amazed by how it went from having super thin almost invisible lashes to full plump lush lashes really nice,  No irritation and I only had to apply it once in 8 hours. no smudge at all  for those of you who are not sure, try it you will love it..</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as other similar mascaras and dried up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to say i love this product ,it was fast and easy to use .The directions are simple and easy to understand. I didnt have any problems with fallout with the fibers ,like i have from other fiber mascaras, it left my lashes looking fuller and longer.the difference this mascara makes is absolutly amazing,i will be buying more when i run out ,the girls at work couldn&#x27;t believe that it was just mascara that had made my lashes look so beautiful,this an A+++++ product ,definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Received my &amp;#34;Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara&amp;#34; and fell in love with the NEW AND IMPROVED Proprietary Formula Sealing Gel that goes on silky smooth and smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best 3D Fiber Lash Mascara claims to provide a 300% INCREASE to your lashes and look completely natural and it does just that. My eyes went from feeling invisible to receiving regular compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, that my lashes don&#x27;t stick together and that the product is not heavy. I love that my lashes don&#x27;t flake and that the appear as though I&#x27;m wearing fake eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Bella Eleganze is committed to providing exceptional customer service and fast shipping. The mascara comes with an amazing case which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product. I will order it again. I love having long thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product I am always looking for something that makes my eyelashes look&lt;br /&gt;Longer and fuller and this does! Super happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this.  It did extend my lashes, but the fibers flaked all over my face and smudged not to mention flaked in my eyes and the whites of my eyes had black specks all over them.  My eyes looked messy.  I followed the directions, but still am not happy with the product</li>
            <li> The lashes started falling off the brush as soon as i removed the brush from the tube without me even getting close to my lashes. The lashes did not adhere in a uniform fashion. Some lashes were noticeably longer than other lashes. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Younique is by far a much better product.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara - this fails.  My eyes were itchy and red after applying - and when opening the wand, there was a smell like chemicals. Definitely does not have natural ingredients in it.  Will stick to Younique&#x27;s mascara.</li>
            <li> The first use was great! But subsequent uses, the fibers fell right off the brush! Never stayed on my lashes. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for it :( Well, at least the fibers can be used w/own/other mascara for added volume and a bit more length!  The gel is an ok base, but after the fibers, I suggest using own mascara.  If I use the gel over the fibers, my lashes look like I have just about 4 lashes after about an hour :(( groups them together, which looks super bad!</li>
            <li> I tried Bella Eleganze as a less expensive version of Younique 3D Fiber mascara and am very dissatisfied.  It&#x27;s really no better than a very cheap dollar store mascara.  With Younique, one coat of sealing/transplanting gel, one coat of fiber and then the sealing gel again and my lashes are long, full, and dark, and last all day.  With this product, I have to use about three steps of the process to get the same effect, then it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.... for real girls and drag queens</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent  price,works awesome!</li>
            <li> Was hoping for something more.  Nothing exciting</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my lashes&lt;br /&gt;It flakes way to much, all day&lt;br /&gt;(I used the product exactly per instructions)</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this mascara but to all the scary pictures of people using other fiber mascaras. But I had to try it! I am sooo so happy I did! I already have long lashes but with this stuff all I can say is wow! So easy to use too!!</li>
            <li> While I was skeptical, this mascara really does make your lashes fuller and darker!  I went ahead and applied a coat of my regular mascara first, then the sealer, then the fibers, then the sealers.  After that dried, I did a 2nd coat.  I could have kept going but since my lashes were brushing against my glasses at that point, I figured that might be enough.  What I noticed is that my lashes were so long and thick!  It made me feel good!  I wore it to a concert and I was okay all night long.  I often have eye issues and this mascara did not bother my eyes at all!  I would suggest this for everything, but especially any event or special occasion, especially the upcoming holidays!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked the look of my lashes.  This is easy and non-clumping.  Downside is...it doesn&#x27;t last/hold up and the fibers do fall onto your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** With more use and practice I found that using less fibers creates less fall out on my cheeks.  I put on a little more gel after the fibers and it holds up all night.</li>
            <li> It is different from my current Mascara but it works well.</li>
            <li> Definitely far from waterproof and is super clumpy</li>
            <li> I have never used 3D Fiber Lash mascara before this, but it is fun!  I was amazed at the difference. This product produced dramatic results.  When I applied the fibers, I got a few clumps, but was able to fix that no problem. I love that this came in a nice hard shelled case. I lose a lot of items and would hate to lose one of the set. The case keeps them together and fits nicely in my purse. Love it!</li>
            <li> Wife very pleased with product results. Noticeable improvement with first application compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> Love this Mascara! It makes my lashes look natural while standing out!</li>
            <li> Great product! I recommend!</li>
            <li> I tell you this 3d mascara is amazing. I wore it while grocery shopping and got a compliment and stares. This girl maybe in her early 20 came up to me ask me was i fake lashes. I told her no i am wearing mascara thats all told her.she told me that my lashes look flawless. I even suggested the 3d  mascara to her.</li>
            <li> item was dried up. Not happy with my purchase at all</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Once you get how to apply it, it works wonders. I have missing and broken eyelashes and this products has helped. I don&#x27;t need to wear fake lashes  anymore and to curl them you just push them up. They fill in the broken, missing portion of your lashes. I  think this will help my lashes to grow back!</li>
            <li> Nice mascara.  I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I think I&#x27;m going to like it, use it up, and buy more!</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter and I for Christmas.  It really lives up to its videos and youtube trials. I&#x27;ll never have small eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every fiber lash mascara on the market. I saw this was a lower price and thought I&#x27;d see if price really made a difference.  Not easy to layer and would require more product than the other brands I&#x27;ve used. Paying the little extra for the more well known brands goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara and highly recommend it. Longer, fuller lashes without the mess of falsies and in less than half the time. I let my sister borrow it and she ordered her own immediately after.</li>
            <li> For $1.00 oh yeah I had to buy it. And was surprised to see how great it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I went from wanting to save this for &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; occasions to using this as an every day mascara. I have really light lashes and have tried several extending mascaras and none of them compare!  Doesn&#x27;t flake or give me raccoon eyes at the end of the day, they look just as fresh and full as when applied.  It&#x27;s easy to use and fast to come off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that you try this, you&#x27;ll see just how amazing it is!!&lt;br /&gt;**A product was received to review, all opinions are my own**</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t really help that much with the lash length and would clump up.</li>
            <li> Great for fuller lashes, you have to use it a few times to get used to it, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Younique Moodstruck works &amp; feels better.</li>
            <li> The fibers fall off all over my face and in my eyes</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Fiber Mascara!  Works wonderfully! Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> This is the best 3D product by far.  Easy to use and makes my lashes look great, not clumpy at all.  If you are thinking about a 3D product, buy this one.</li>
            <li> Man...so I was really excited to try this product...but in so many ways I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  The first day I wore this, it was OKAY.  I liked the look but my eyes were pretty irritates throughout the day.  When I finally removed the mascara, I also got a lot of fibers out of my eyes that had been there all day.  I thought maybe I applied it incorrectly, so I tried it again, being very careful to seal the fibers correctly.  Within a few minutes my left eye was so irritated that I began investigating.  At least 10-20 fibers were in my eye...after eye drops, and being careful to not scratch my eye with the fibers, I washed it all off...my eye still hurts.  I am worried that this type of mascara can cause permanent damage to the eye.  It&#x27;s just not worth it to me...guess I&#x27;m not that vain.  I&#x27;d rather use false lashes for events and be happy with my natural lashes with mascara for the other days...vanity has a price, but for me my vision is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it! You have to be patient! You won&#x27;t get it right the first time but you&#x27;ll love the results when you get the hang of it! (Ps. Try and keep your eye as closed as possible when putting on the fibers so they don&#x27;t get in your eye!) glad I got this over the 30 dollars stuff! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my beloved Japanese Scandal Queen fiber mascara is no longer available on Amazon. I am a former make-up artist and I found that this was a pain to apply and the tiny fibers flaked into my eyes and on my eyelid even after applying the sealing gel. They only stayed put when I put a coat of regular mascara on them. Not impressed. I achieved the same look minus the irritation with Maybelline + ScandalQueen.</li>
            <li> Amazing product telling everyone all about it! It totally transforms my look and I definitely feel naked without using it now. My original plan was to use only on special occasions and or going out, but I can&#x27;t resist, I use it daily. I bought one for my mom who has sparse lashes like me, she loves it too</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying fiber lash. It is messy and gets on my face under my eyes and I feel like I constantly have something in my eyes. Like possibly the fibers are getting in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product. Although it does say not to use it while wearing contact lenses, I do it anyway. it does not bother my eyes. sometimes a fiber will land on my eye, but it is easy to remove. the price is great, I would recommend this to anyone considering purchasing a fiber lash mascara.</li>
