            <li>So nice on your eyes!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I feel my eyes getting better</li>
            <li>it smells good, though</li>
            <li>I came up with a great idea of how to use them to be more of a &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I didn’t expect to feel so good, so it was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I like having peace of mind that I am getting a good product, and more than just reading about it, I am feeling the results.</li>
            <li>love love love it!!</li>
            <li>I just wish I had more! :)</li>
            <li>I loved it, it has a full moisturizer for ur eye</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Like most women my age</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say they stay in place with just gentle pressing</li>
            <li>I am glad I found them.</li>
            <li>I love these eye patches, it feels refreshing while wearing the patches.</li>
            <li>I had to constantlly adjust them to make sure they don&#x27;t slide.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night before bedtime and when I get up in the morning there is notable difference in the size of my eye bags.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>a cucumber slice may have given me better results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once, and can&#x27;t really say whether or not I look better, but I can say that they feel great on the eyes and the smell of rose water is great.  </li>
            <li>experience because they are so nice and cool and refreshing smelling.  </li>
            <li>and most importantly, it does NOT work for me.</li>
            <li>Ahhh...what a peaceful and refreshing experience!  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it works better after a taking a shower and a mild moisturizer after applying....</li>
            <li>Packaging was secure.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so so, is ok, but do not help to much!</li>
            <li>I originally bought them to check out the anti-aging properties.  </li>
            <li>Love these, really relaxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that if you try these, you will love them as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>This product is best used while lying down, as the holes for your eyes really aren&#x27;t made for optimal vision.  </li>
            <li>and I feel I can recommend it to others, which is a rare occurrence for me.</li>
            <li>I also think they&#x27;ll make a nice and thoughtful little gift for some of my special friends.</li>
            <li>But then after receiving the product, it occurred to me that since I don&#x27;t generally take time out of my hectic schedule for pampering, I wasn&#x27;t sure when I would use them.  </li>
            <li>Repeated use may be needed to see longer lasting results, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that worked pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin looks so smooth, soft and no bags or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>With that said, I do like the way it feels when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>My eyes looked MORE puffy and wrinkled after I tried them (slept with them so they were on for several hours).</li>
            <li>still have some heavy circles; but they do feel good when you put them on.</li>
            <li>Like pretty much everything else made in China, this is pure junk.</li>
            <li>, I have tried many different products and this was something new.  </li>
            <li>I regret this has happened as I really wanted to use them.  </li>
            <li>and I found that by wearing my masks it helps me to relax into my practice much quicker.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I have used them twice, but havn&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky and doesn&#x27;t do much except it cools the eye area..</li>
            <li>they are very slippery.</li>
            <li>I could already see a difference after one use  WOW !!  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so amazing about these masks is that when you wake up the moisture has wicked out of the individual eye masks and you are left with little golden papers.</li>
            <li>Also developed a red eye on the right eye.  </li>
            <li>tried it once and it feels soft and soothing</li>
            <li>The packaging says to throw them out after one use, but I rinsed mine off and put them in the fridge because they are made of a durable silicone type of material and, although there is no product on it, they can be used to cool the eyes down and de-puff.  </li>
            <li>they were hard to get out of package and they rip easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement around my eyes from regular use.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You have to be careful to take the time to put them on correctly and just let it stick.</li>
            <li> In the morning i still have tiny narrow peepers.</li>

            <li> If not, you can feel some discomfort or some slight burning if some of the moisture in the product gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> it applies moisture that gets robbed everyday.  </li>
            <li> The areas under my eyes were brightened and the skin was less sunken in than it usually is.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep on the eyes</li>
            <li> it was hard to keep them on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash under both eyes very badly.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> What A Great product. I could already see a difference after one use  WOW !!  They are so easy to use and not the least bit messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone can sleep in these things! They are SO slimy and slippery--they are sliding all over my face and I&#x27;m lying here perfectly still!</li>
            <li> I loved it, it has a full moisturizer for ur eye</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love these, really relaxing and they do help with bags under your eyes!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my  eyes.</li>
            <li> tried it once and it feels soft and soothing</li>
            <li> it applies moisture that gets robbed everyday.  it feels wonderful</li>
            <li> Made in China - Chinese test on animals - I returned this item!</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash under both eyes very badly.  Also developed a red eye on the right eye.  I regret this has happened as I really wanted to use them.  Have contacted Amazon and they are going to give me a refund.</li>
            <li> so so, is ok, but do not help to much!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this purchase.  I originally bought them to check out the anti-aging properties.  Like most women my age, I have tried many different products and this was something new.  But then after receiving the product, it occurred to me that since I don&#x27;t generally take time out of my hectic schedule for pampering, I wasn&#x27;t sure when I would use them.  So I tried putting them on while relaxing watching TV for a half hour or so before bed.  I&#x27;m happy to say they stay in place with just gentle pressing so that worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came up with a great idea of how to use them to be more of a &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34; experience because they are so nice and cool and refreshing smelling.  Meditating is a regular practice for me and I found that by wearing my masks it helps me to relax into my practice much quicker.  Ahhh...what a peaceful and refreshing experience!  I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement around my eyes from regular use.  I&#x27;m a fan -and will be a regular customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that if you try these, you will love them as much as I do.  Like spa-day at home!  I also think they&#x27;ll make a nice and thoughtful little gift for some of my special friends.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! I am very impressed with the eye mask. Even though I have only used it once I have noticed quite a substantial improvement in my skin tone after one use! The mask really helped hydrate my eye area which had become so dry with all the wind we&#x27;ve had the last few seeks.  Shipping time was as stated. Packaging was secure.</li>
            <li> It really does the job of keeping my eyes feeling softer, tight with less visible lines and pores...I also noticed that it works better after a taking a shower and a mild moisturizer after applying....love love love it!! I like having peace of mind that I am getting a good product, and more than just reading about it, I am feeling the results. The product is definitely working for me and I feel I can recommend it to others, which is a rare occurrence for me. I am glad I found them.</li>
            <li> I love these eye patches, it feels refreshing while wearing the patches. The skin looks so smooth, soft and no bags or wrinkles. It&#x27;s awesome!! I felt so energized, a big difference. I know they are working. I didn’t expect to feel so good, so it was a nice surprise. Plus it provides a great &amp;#34;at home spa&amp;#34; opportunity to RELAX while I wear these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packagin is a little too simple that I am slightly concerned.&lt;br /&gt;The masks are bursting in serum. I had to constantlly adjust them to make sure they don&#x27;t slide. I have used them twice, but havn&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant relief from my tired puffy eyes. This product does a great job moisturizing &amp; cooling my eyes and it greatly reduced my puffy under-eye bags. I don’t feel as wiped out because of this.</li>
            <li> I normally have bags and dark circles under my eyes. I slept in my mask for about 5 hours and saw a noticeable difference the next morning. The areas under my eyes were brightened and the skin was less sunken in than it usually is. Repeated use may be needed to see longer lasting results, but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> great , feel good product...</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only used once. Products were delivered on time.</li>
            <li> ZERO STARS!!! These things are so slimy they won&#x27;t even stay on my face. NEVER BUY AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> So nice on your eyes! The masks are cooling and relaxing, and make me feel like I&#x27;ve gone to a spa. I just wish I had more! :)</li>
            <li> these help with dark circles a lot</li>
            <li> A+++ product. As described and shown in photo. Bravo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once, and can&#x27;t really say whether or not I look better, but I can say that they feel great on the eyes and the smell of rose water is great.  They also stay in place so I assume it&#x27;s possible to sleep in them like the directions say, although I only left them on for about 30 min. The eyes do feel refreshed after you use them.  The packaging says to throw them out after one use, but I rinsed mine off and put them in the fridge because they are made of a durable silicone type of material and, although there is no product on it, they can be used to cool the eyes down and de-puff.  I can&#x27;t remember what I paid for them, but I like it and will probably re-order.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I feel my eyes getting better</li>
            <li> This is definitely a temporary solution for eye bags, not permanent.  With that said, I do like the way it feels when I first put it on.  This product is best used while lying down, as the holes for your eyes really aren&#x27;t made for optimal vision.  I put this on at night before bedtime and when I get up in the morning there is notable difference in the size of my eye bags.  The effect on eye bags is only temporary, though, as they are back by the evening.</li>
            <li> Love this product. You have to be careful to take the time to put them on correctly and just let it stick. If not, you can feel some discomfort or some slight burning if some of the moisture in the product gets in your eyes. What&#x27;s so amazing about these masks is that when you wake up the moisture has wicked out of the individual eye masks and you are left with little golden papers. Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> still have some heavy circles; but they do feel good when you put them on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and doesn&#x27;t do much except it cools the eye area..a cucumber slice may have given me better results</li>
            <li> Hard to keep on the eyes</li>
            <li> they are very slippery. it was hard to keep them on my eyes. and most importantly, it does NOT work for me. In the morning i still have tiny narrow peepers. it smells good, though</li>
            <li> they were hard to get out of package and they rip easy</li>
            <li> They got here in time but I can&#x27;t actually see any result</li>
            <li> These things are extremely slippery and wet -- you have to lie very still on your back for at least 45 minutes before they adhere and you have to keep pushing them back in place while you do. Worse, they do absolutely nothing. My eyes looked MORE puffy and wrinkled after I tried them (slept with them so they were on for several hours). Like pretty much everything else made in China, this is pure junk.</li>
