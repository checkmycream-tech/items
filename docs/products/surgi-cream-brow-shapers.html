    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think they work best when you have someone else placing and pulling the strips for you.  </li>
            <li>Suprisingly these strips work great</li>
            <li>They work just great with me, you have to get your own, great buy!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Honestly, it feels like tape.</li>
            <li>, I have gotten many friends into them.  </li>
            <li>If you add it where you need it and rub it for a bit, it grabs more hair it seems.</li>
            <li>Works well, just be sure you wash the area well to get any oils off your skin before you apply the wax strip</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try because it seems to work form some people but not everybody like most beauty products.</li>
            <li>make sure to wash your face before you use them for better results</li>
            <li>If you stick it on your brow where you need to and rub it for a second or two it works best.</li>
            <li>worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>And they work pretty good.</li>
            <li>They have a good adhesive on them which removes the unwanted brows and fine hairs with the first application.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>I used them right away!  </li>
            <li>ideal but a waste..</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast delivery on my product :)</li>
            <li>They arrived fairly quick.</li>
            <li>As long as I remember to use toner over the brow area first, to remove any trace of oil, the strips remove a fair amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect any brow strip to remove as much hair as a true, hot was method, without being gooey/messy!</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that you use more one set per eyebrow.</li>
            <li>sure you wash and dry your face first, if it is greasy they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>These eye brow shapers work really well.  </li>
            <li>Or my eyebrows are just too much..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using theses the past how many months</li>
            <li>yes it&#x27;s cheap but not worth buying</li>

            <li> Suprisingly these strips work great, I have gotten many friends into them.  I think they work best when you have someone else placing and pulling the strips for you.  ALSO - make sure you wash and dry your face first, if it is greasy they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all they didn&#x27;t work I was dissatisfied an wasted my money  an will never buy these products again advice don&#x27;t not buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using theses the past how many months and I really enjoy using them. Curved helps with keeping them the same everytime without changing anything. Only downfall is that you use more one set per eyebrow. I end up using about 4-5 sets (upper bottom) just to get the job done! If you add it where you need it and rub it for a bit, it grabs more hair it seems.</li>
            <li> Works well, just be sure you wash the area well to get any oils off your skin before you apply the wax strip or else it will not work</li>
            <li> terrible they don&#x27;t stick to skin let alone hair</li>
            <li> This is a junk. Doesn&#x27;t work atall.  It&#x27;s just waste of money.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes the usually tedious job of plucking unnecessary! I like the control it gives me when brow shaping!</li>
            <li> These eye brow shapers work really well.  They have a good adhesive on them which removes the unwanted brows and fine hairs with the first application.</li>
            <li> Time.. U won&#x27;t have the time it takes... Should b simple.. NOT!&lt;br /&gt;Good ideal but a waste.. Plucking is faster ....</li>
            <li> these do not take hair off at all</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for me. I kept trying to use it and there was no effect. I assumed I was doing it incorrectly so I let my mom try and still, nothing. Honestly, it feels like tape. I even washed my face. Maybe I didn&#x27;t receive everything in the box? Or my eyebrows are just too much..&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try because it seems to work form some people but not everybody like most beauty products.</li>
            <li> You have to go over some spots multiple times as it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I&#x27;d say buy something else, it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> worked pretty good. make sure to wash your face before you use them for better results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This here is a 10, different strokes for different folks. They work just great with me, you have to get your own, great buy!</li>
            <li> I like these because they get me started with the correct shape.  As long as I remember to use toner over the brow area first, to remove any trace of oil, the strips remove a fair amount of hair.  Then, I still need to use my tweezers to remove the strays.  I don&#x27;t expect any brow strip to remove as much hair as a true, hot was method, without being gooey/messy!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast delivery on my product :) it works amazing and less painful than using tweezers. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that does not like tweezing their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> dont waste ur money!!! its like buying some clear tape lmfao waste of my money n time</li>
            <li> This product is horrible yes it&#x27;s cheap but not worth buying</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well at all. ðŸ˜¡</li>
            <li> They arrived fairly quick. I used them right away!  And they work pretty good. If you stick it on your brow where you need to and rub it for a second or two it works best. Only downfall is they&#x27;re one shape. But they worked we still!</li>
            <li> It is so fake it doesn&#x27;t work please people do waste money on that I all I try it on me and my daughter it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove anything</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!</li>
