            <li>I have super chapped lips and this lip balm makes my lips feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lip balm for years and just love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing</li>
            <li>It moisturize and nice smell.</li>
            <li>but instead I recieved the Minted Rose version.</li>
            <li>The product provides nice moisture to my lips without being sticky or tacky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mint rose version of this lip balm</li>
            <li>and it feels nice on my lips for a while,</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely wonderful - a nice fresh peppermint - but it isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm is honestly the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Gives you shiny, sexy lips.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the freshness the peppermint gives.</li>
            <li>The scent is feminine and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I keep a tub at my desk and just bought more to stash in my purse and at home.  </li>
            <li>I like all the Rosebud salves, but this lipbalm is my favorite, I love the strawberry scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many girlfriends hooked over the years.</li>
            <li>never sticky!! :)</li>
            <li>be purchasing this one again for sure.</li>
            <li>I apply my lipsticks and they apply so smooth over it with no creasing!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so the 3 stars has nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim because I thought the tin looked cute, and it has been a godsend.</li>
            <li>The consistency is more jelly-like, but not as oily as vaseline.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between the two, but the strawberry one is so much better.</li>
            <li>Like A LOT more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>This keeps your lips smooth and the lip butter smells nice.</li>
            <li>It feels like it softens the skin, and isn&#x27;t just a waxy layer sitting on top.</li>
            <li>However, this is not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I thought I would fall in love with this</li>
            <li>That was until I tried Rosebud Lip Balm, this product is truly amazing; easy to carry around, easy to spread on lips, has a soft scent of strawberries, soothes and moisturize lips immediately, best of all the balm gets absorbed leaving lips moisturized for many hours...</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent years looking for the perfect lip balm, and have tried them all-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, though mild.</li>
            <li>After telling my entire family about how great your lip balm was??</li>
            <li>It is so soft and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>smells good and keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I bough the original at sephora....</li>
            <li>, I love the refreshing strawberry scent and it makes my lips so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was the</li>
            <li>I feel like this really soaks into lips and heals them, rather than sitting on top of lips like all of the lip balms I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the mint version a bit better, but I still really like this one</li>
            <li>Huge amount, long lasting and smells great!</li>
            <li>Recieved my order quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li>BEST Lip Balm around, by far, a must try!&lt;br /&gt;I have dry lips and in the search for a good product I&#x27;ve tried every single chopstick and lip balm out there</li>
            <li>To be honest, I like the Nivea lip balm a lot better; it moisturizes and costs much less than this balm.</li>
            <li>There really is no color to it and it has a very light, appealing scent.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and does moisturizer your lips, but it is not worth $8!</li>
            <li>So I watch a beauty guru that swears by this lip balm to make her lips soft and smooth for lip products!</li>
            <li>and it keeps my lips soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li>$7 bucks is an incredibly hefty price to pay for some lip balm, even more expensive than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is my go to lip product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you spread it on, it seems to soothe at first, but quickly dries up and needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the tin is huge and it contains over 5x more than a regular lip balm tube/chapstick.</li>
            <li>all day long i love it!</li>
            <li>Have not yet used the strawberry one, i used the original one, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;re-melted\\&quot; it by setting it right side up on the dash of my car for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>the good thing is that yes, the balm actually does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice light pink shade, which goes really well with any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am waiting to really test it in the winter time, but so far i love it</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at Sephora.</li>
            <li>though the product is only .8 ounces, it feels like a bunch more.</li>
            <li>Guess I will make sure to tell them not to order from you guys as you won&#x27;t send them the proper products chosen.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing any of Smith&#x27;s lip balms.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well-</li>
            <li>So now I can crack big &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; smiles :)  </li>
            <li>It feels a little thicker, but goes on really smoothly and is also somehow more hydrating.</li>
            <li>The strawberry flavor is light and refreshing, not too heavy, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was relatively quick and it arrived in a surprisingly large box for such a teeny tiny item, kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used so many other lip products to achieve that soft smooth look and nothing compares to the wonders this one does.</li>
            <li>Super soft and doesn&#x27;t taste like medicine.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and if you put a little on your nose after using tissues, you won&#x27;t get a chapped nose.</li>
            <li>When applied the lip balm provides a nice shine - just a moist look nothing too glossy - and there is little or no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has the feel &amp; consistency of Vaseline and that doesn&#x27;t work on my lips either.</li>
            <li>So...there is so much hype about this lipbalm.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed after such high hopes from the first shipment I ordered was perfect rose flavored!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving this in a hot car as you will most certainly find a gloppy mess.</li>
            <li>I love other Smith&#x27;s products so when I saw this strawberry lip balm I wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>lip balm is much more waxy feeling than the other Smith&#x27;s lip balms.</li>
            <li>The tin holds more balm than you would imagine, and lasts forever, it&#x27;s not something you have to replace every other day.  </li>
            <li>This lip balm is amazing and this small jar lasts for absolutely forever.</li>
            <li>I have tried Smith&#x27;s Lip Balm in the past but this newer Minted Rose variety caught my eye</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Went right back!</li>
            <li>(though I live in Texas so this might not be an issue for you).</li>
            <li>it moistures more than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and the moisture last overnight.</li>
            <li>The smell is little too strong, but it works well on my hands and lips.</li>
            <li>After the first use my lips were soft, hydrated, and after several applications, looked plumper.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great for when you have a cold and have to blow your nose a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend it who wants deep moisturize!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one real draw back to this</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the size of the tin that the lip balm came in...</li>
            <li>I bought a tin on Sephora a few months back and have been extremely pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle tingle of the mint and it&#x27;s less of a salve feeling than the original.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and provides just the right amount of sheen over whatever lipstick I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is an absolute must for dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It dried them out tremendously and did not hydrate my lips at all.</li>
            <li>Instead of giving me that smooth, moisturized feeling, I felt like I had coated my lips in thick dollar store chap stick.</li>
            <li>Although this product is a lot softer than some other balms (like Burt&#x27;s Bees), once I got used to the vaseline-like consistency I really do like it.</li>
            <li>A lot of bad lip balms are actually more irritating than good for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of how it performs as a lip balm, the 2nd ingredient is lanolin which I think contributes to it being a lot more moisturising than other common ingredients (beeswax, shea butter, castor oil, etc).</li>
            <li>Since using it, early spring, i have not had a single split lip.</li>
            <li>Soft and soothing for dry lips !</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love other Smith&#x27;s products so when I saw this strawberry lip balm I wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> lip balm is much more waxy feeling than the other Smith&#x27;s lip balms.</li>
            <li> The tin holds more balm than you would imagine, and lasts forever, it&#x27;s not something you have to replace every other day.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing and this small jar lasts for absolutely forever.</li>
            <li> I have tried Smith&#x27;s Lip Balm in the past but this newer Minted Rose variety caught my eye</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Went right back!</li>
            <li> (though I live in Texas so this might not be an issue for you).</li>
            <li> it moistures more than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and the moisture last overnight.</li>
            <li> The smell is little too strong, but it works well on my hands and lips.</li>
            <li> After the first use my lips were soft, hydrated, and after several applications, looked plumper.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also great for when you have a cold and have to blow your nose a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend it who wants deep moisturize!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one real draw back to this</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the size of the tin that the lip balm came in...</li>
            <li> I bought a tin on Sephora a few months back and have been extremely pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle tingle of the mint and it&#x27;s less of a salve feeling than the original.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and provides just the right amount of sheen over whatever lipstick I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is an absolute must for dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> It dried them out tremendously and did not hydrate my lips at all.</li>
            <li> Instead of giving me that smooth, moisturized feeling, I felt like I had coated my lips in thick dollar store chap stick.</li>
            <li> Although this product is a lot softer than some other balms (like Burt&#x27;s Bees), once I got used to the vaseline-like consistency I really do like it.</li>
            <li> A lot of bad lip balms are actually more irritating than good for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of how it performs as a lip balm, the 2nd ingredient is lanolin which I think contributes to it being a lot more moisturising than other common ingredients (beeswax, shea butter, castor oil, etc).</li>
            <li> Since using it, early spring, i have not had a single split lip.</li>
            <li> Soft and soothing for dry lips !</li>
            <li> The balm is not too thick or too shiny - just right.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong and artificial for my tastes, but it&#x27;s worth it for healed lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm since discovering it in a little boutique in NYC nearly 10 years ago and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I used it for long time.</li>
            <li> it was much bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> the tin goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> The tin is actually pretty big, maybe like an inch and a half in diameter, and three quarters of an inch thick.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it gives a subtle, pretty pink sheen to my lips.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be repurchasing, and am looking forward to trying all the other Smith&#x27;s salves.</li>
            <li> It also stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I do not like that dry lip feeling and this balm provides a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> Be careful of what you order, because now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This can also be used on flaky patches of skin, cuticles (and I&#x27;ve even used it on healing scabs when they get dry and tight on the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have extremely chapped lips-</li>
            <li> and I have thrown out  all other chap sticks and balms.</li>
            <li> If they would have sent me the proper lip balm I had already paid for then they would get 5 stars, but since they sent me the mint rose flavored lip balm that is DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> only thing that annoys me a little is how hard it is to remove the lid when you have dry hands and can&#x27;t get any grip!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing more I hate than dried out lips, so I decided to try this product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little minty tingle.</li>
            <li> think: the way your My Little Pony smelled in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately they&#x27;ve all fail to work (some do work for the first few mins only but disappear after, leaving lips dry/drier).</li>
            <li> plain Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Eos, Lip Smackers, Jack Black, Softlips, Neutrogena-</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips everyday</li>
            <li> so I had a to of waste</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, is not sticky at all, and leaves your lips with a slight shine.</li>
            <li> My lips were in really bad shape, so I decided to splurge and get something that would really work &amp; got this.</li>
            <li> I might add, they only get one measly star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed you guys let me down this time around.</li>
            <li> The smell is also overwhelmingly fake strawberry-</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong flavor.</li>
            <li> blah blah blah&amp;#34; and of course, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of bulky that way, which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist found that camphor, phenol and menthol were the ingredients in bad lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually shocked it worked this well, because it&#x27;s basically flavored Vaseline, and Vaseline works terribly for my lips.</li>
            <li> This was awful for my lips!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My entire family loves this lip balm.  Definately a staple especially for travel. Great scent!</li>
            <li> The smell is little too strong, but it works well on my hands and lips.</li>
            <li> The greatest lip balm ever. Gives you shiny, sexy lips. A little minty tingle. Love it.</li>
            <li> this lip balm does everthing it claims. it moistures more than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and the moisture last overnight. a little goes a long way. I also love the freshness the peppermint gives. I would recommend this to everyone. I purshased 10 after I tried one.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  The scent is feminine and refreshing.  The balm is not too thick or too shiny - just right.  My lips always feel great after applying it.  I keep a tub at my desk and just bought more to stash in my purse and at home.  The tub lasts several months.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If the tub melts on one side, I \\&quot;re-melted\\&quot; it by setting it right side up on the dash of my car for a couple of hours.  Went right back!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Keeps my lips smooth and soft. I like all the Rosebud salves, but this lipbalm is my favorite, I love the strawberry scent.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and feels good on my lips</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm since discovering it in a little boutique in NYC nearly 10 years ago and never looked back. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and provides just the right amount of sheen over whatever lipstick I&#x27;m wearing. It also stays on for a very long time. I&#x27;ve gotten so many girlfriends hooked over the years.</li>
            <li> smells great. never sticky!! :)</li>
            <li> I love other Smith&#x27;s products so when I saw this strawberry lip balm I wanted to give it a shot. Shipping was relatively quick and it arrived in a surprisingly large box for such a teeny tiny item, kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm is much more waxy feeling than the other Smith&#x27;s lip balms. Instead of giving me that smooth, moisturized feeling, I felt like I had coated my lips in thick dollar store chap stick. The smell is also overwhelmingly fake strawberry- think: the way your My Little Pony smelled in the 80&#x27;s. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again for sure.</li>
            <li> Soft and soothing for dry lips !</li>
            <li> So I watch a beauty guru that swears by this lip balm to make her lips soft and smooth for lip products! It&#x27;s amazing. I have used so many other lip products to achieve that soft smooth look and nothing compares to the wonders this one does. It is so soft and it smells so good. I apply it before I apply my makeup and it keeps my lips soft and healthy looking all day long i love it! I apply my lipsticks and they apply so smooth over it with no creasing! I will def be buying this from now on! The best ever!</li>
            <li> This was awful for my lips! It dried them out tremendously and did not hydrate my lips at all. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this and a lot of people seemed to love this, but unfortunately it just did not work for me. It really has the feel &amp; consistency of Vaseline and that doesn&#x27;t work on my lips either. The only good thing was the it smelled good.</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips everyday but it&#x27;s also great for when you have a cold and have to blow your nose a lot. It smells nice and if you put a little on your nose after using tissues, you won&#x27;t get a chapped nose.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm. I bought my first one at Sephora. Gets chapped lips Super soft and doesn&#x27;t taste like medicine. Kissable strawberry fragrance. A+</li>
            <li> Recieved my order quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I used it for long time. It moisturize and nice smell. Great use! I&#x27;ll recommend it who wants deep moisturize!</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong flavor. I ordered the Strawberry  lip balm but instead I recieved the Minted Rose version. Be careful of what you order, because now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> smells good and keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so the 3 stars has nothing to do with the product. When I recieved it, it was all melted in the tin so I had a to of waste but it&#x27;s a great gloss.</li>
            <li> I have extremely chapped lips- if I don&#x27;t regularly drink water and wear lip balm, my lips will crack and peel after an hour. I&#x27;ve spent years looking for the perfect lip balm, and have tried them all- plain Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Eos, Lip Smackers, Jack Black, Softlips, Neutrogena- everything. Nothing worked, and my lips were always chapped. I bought this on a whim because I thought the tin looked cute, and it has been a godsend. I apply this 3 times a day, and my lips are perfectly moist. As an added bonus, it gives a subtle, pretty pink sheen to my lips.The smell is a little strong and artificial for my tastes, but it&#x27;s worth it for healed lips. I feel like this really soaks into lips and heals them, rather than sitting on top of lips like all of the lip balms I&#x27;ve tried before. I&#x27;m actually shocked it worked this well, because it&#x27;s basically flavored Vaseline, and Vaseline works terribly for my lips. However it works, I&#x27;m so grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOVE this stuff! Best price is here.</li>
            <li> So...there is so much hype about this lipbalm. &amp;#34;All the celebrities use it, blah blah blah&amp;#34; and of course, I was skeptical. $7 bucks is an incredibly hefty price to pay for some lip balm, even more expensive than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is my go to lip product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing more I hate than dried out lips, so I decided to try this product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the product is only .8 ounces, it feels like a bunch more. The tin is actually pretty big, maybe like an inch and a half in diameter, and three quarters of an inch thick. It&#x27;s sort of bulky that way, which is unfortunate. However. the good thing is that yes, the balm actually does live up to the hype. The consistency is more jelly-like, but not as oily as vaseline. The color is a nice light pink shade, which goes really well with any skin tone. The strawberry flavor is light and refreshing, not too heavy, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one real draw back to this is the price!</li>
            <li> I have tried Smith&#x27;s Lip Balm in the past but this newer Minted Rose variety caught my eye and I decided to try it.  I am very happy with this product and I am glad I took a chance on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the size of the tin that the lip balm came in...it was much bigger than I expected.  The product provides nice moisture to my lips without being sticky or tacky feeling.  If I had to describe the consistency of the product I would say it is like A&amp;D Ointment or a thinner version of Vaseline.  The scent is absolutely wonderful - a nice fresh peppermint - but it isn&#x27;t too strong.  I like the cooling effect it provides on my lips as well.  When applied the lip balm provides a nice shine - just a moist look nothing too glossy - and there is little or no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BIG fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm with Mango Butter and Burt&#x27;s Bee Lip Balm with Acai Berry.  If you like these products then I think you will be happy with Rosebud Perfume Co&#x27;s product.  You will see similar results.</li>
            <li> If they would have sent me the proper lip balm I had already paid for then they would get 5 stars, but since they sent me the mint rose flavored lip balm that is DISGUSTING I might add, they only get one measly star. Very disappointed after such high hopes from the first shipment I ordered was perfect rose flavored! I wanted strawberry, thats what I paid for and I believe thats what I deserve after pre paying for the product! Rosebud I am disappointed you guys let me down this time around. After telling my entire family about how great your lip balm was?? Guess I will make sure to tell them not to order from you guys as you won&#x27;t send them the proper products chosen.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see the hype, but my best friend loves it so i buy it as a gift for her occasionally.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have found!! I found this on a list of &amp;#34;best lip balms&amp;#34;. I order 4 of the picks out of 10 and this is the best!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing any of Smith&#x27;s lip balms. Although this product is a lot softer than some other balms (like Burt&#x27;s Bees), once I got used to the vaseline-like consistency I really do like it. It goes on very smoothly, is not sticky at all, and leaves your lips with a slight shine. The scent is refreshing but not too strong. As this product is 0.8 ounces (a traditional chapstick tube is 0.15 ounces) the tin goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a caution, this lip balm has a very low melting point. My order actually arrived melted (though I live in Texas so this might not be an issue for you). Nonetheless, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving this in a hot car as you will most certainly find a gloppy mess. I simply cleaned up the tin and put in the oven at low heat to get it back into shape. I will definitely be repurchasing, and am looking forward to trying all the other Smith&#x27;s salves.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for years and just love it! I can&#x27;t imagine life without it. I do not like that dry lip feeling and this balm provides a lot of moisture. It stays on pretty well- I will put some on at bedtime and there will still be some remaining in the morning. My husband even uses it at night. There really is no color to it and it has a very light, appealing scent. It is not like regular chapstick that is addicting and can make lips peel. Give it a try and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mint rose version of this lip balm and it was alright, but then I tried this one and... oh ma gosh. I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between the two, but the strawberry one is so much better. It feels a little thicker, but goes on really smoothly and is also somehow more hydrating. Like A LOT more. How does that happen? I like the smell of the mint version a bit better, but I still really like this one too albeit it&#x27;s a bit strong. This lip balm is honestly the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far and I&#x27;ve trust me I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. I absolutely love this stuff and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> My lips were in really bad shape, so I decided to splurge and get something that would really work &amp; got this. I&#x27;m really not impressed. I like the smell and it feels nice on my lips for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize nearly enough. To be honest, I like the Nivea lip balm a lot better; it moisturizes and costs much less than this balm.</li>
            <li> I bought a tin on Sephora a few months back and have been extremely pleased with its performance. After the first use my lips were soft, hydrated, and after several applications, looked plumper. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had my tin for months and I have thrown out  all other chap sticks and balms. I don&#x27;t use anything else except for Carmex from time to time. The scent is very nice. Definitely get this.</li>
            <li> This keeps your lips smooth and the lip butter smells nice. It&#x27;s not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on.</li>
            <li> I always carry a tin of this with me.  I have one at work, in my purse, at home...I love the subtle tingle of the mint and it&#x27;s less of a salve feeling than the original.  And, no sticky or greasy feeling...just perfect.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is my go-to lip balm. It stays on for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply and it keeps my lips moisturized. Plus it smells great. I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever stopped making this.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the tin is huge and it contains over 5x more than a regular lip balm tube/chapstick. Secondly, the strawberry scent is divine and reminds me of strawberries and cream lollies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how it performs as a lip balm, the 2nd ingredient is lanolin which I think contributes to it being a lot more moisturising than other common ingredients (beeswax, shea butter, castor oil, etc). It feels like it softens the skin, and isn&#x27;t just a waxy layer sitting on top. This can also be used on flaky patches of skin, cuticles (and I&#x27;ve even used it on healing scabs when they get dry and tight on the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that annoys me a little is how hard it is to remove the lid when you have dry hands and can&#x27;t get any grip!</li>
            <li> Huge amount, long lasting and smells great!</li>
            <li> BEST Lip Balm around, by far, a must try!&lt;br /&gt;I have dry lips and in the search for a good product I&#x27;ve tried every single chopstick and lip balm out there, unfortunately they&#x27;ve all fail to work (some do work for the first few mins only but disappear after, leaving lips dry/drier). That was until I tried Rosebud Lip Balm, this product is truly amazing; easy to carry around, easy to spread on lips, has a soft scent of strawberries, soothes and moisturize lips immediately, best of all the balm gets absorbed leaving lips moisturized for many hours... So now I can crack big &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; smiles :)  I only reapply after meals and before bed.</li>
            <li> I bough the original at sephora.... Have not yet used the strawberry one, i used the original one, but this stuff really works. Since using it, early spring, i have not had a single split lip. I am waiting to really test it in the winter time, but so far i love it</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing and this small jar lasts for absolutely forever. I&#x27;ve had it for a year now and I&#x27;m maybe 1/3 of the way through. I have super chapped lips and this lip balm makes my lips feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and does moisturizer your lips, but it is not worth $8!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is an absolute must for dry, chapped lips.  It deeply penetrates the tissue on your lips, especially when applied at bed time.  The tin holds more balm than you would imagine, and lasts forever, it&#x27;s not something you have to replace every other day.  A lot of bad lip balms are actually more irritating than good for you.  A dermatologist found that camphor, phenol and menthol were the ingredients in bad lip balm.  When you spread it on, it seems to soothe at first, but quickly dries up and needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, though mild.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm!!! Its amazing, I love the refreshing strawberry scent and it makes my lips so soft and smooth. I definitely recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> However, this is not my favorite scent. Being a person who loves all things mint and menthol I thought I would fall in love with this but for some reason it is not the &#x27;mint&#x27; scent I had in mind. Oh well, Maybe you will like it! Works great though.</li>
