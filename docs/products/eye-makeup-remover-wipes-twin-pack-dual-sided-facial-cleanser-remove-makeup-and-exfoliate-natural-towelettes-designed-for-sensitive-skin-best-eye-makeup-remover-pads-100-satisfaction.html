            <li>It feels nice getting to rub the bumpy side on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I have to use my own cleaner to get them to work.</li>
            <li>When you purchase these they do come in a twin pack of 2 which is nice.</li>
            <li>all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>They have little ridges that will help grip oil and make up while cleansing your face.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect unfold-able size and have a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Removes my makeup great and leaves my face feeling moisturizer and clean.</li>
            <li>and I especially love being able to go to bed that much faster!</li>

            <li>I love these  make up remover wipes.</li>
            <li>have tried many makeup remover wipes and they don&#x27;t compare to these .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel so much better after using these as well.</li>
            <li>I love the textured pattern of the wipes, it seems to help grab the makeup off my face.</li>

            <li>Seemed to clean well, smelled fresh, good texture to scrub with.</li>
            <li>The scent they have is like aloe and citrus - it&#x27;s very fresh and it leaves very light feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>Great wipes for removing my make-up in my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a refreshing &amp;#34;facial in a packet.&amp;#34;  Good for sensitive skin too...love it!</li>

            <li>There is no alcohol in these and that is huge.</li>
            <li>These wipes are alcohol and oil free, a must for my acne prone skin.</li>

            <li>These take off all of the makeup and it&#x27;s super easy.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite makeup fwipes!</li>
            <li>Quiet happy with this purchase and recommend them to anyone wanting a good quality facial cleanser wipe.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient for traveling--removes the foundation easily !</li>

            <li>They seemed the clean the eyes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I find I have to wipe a lot to get the eyes really clean.  </li>
            <li>I use them to clean the oil off my face and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a strong smell and are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think these are a good buy.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and removes most of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love these wipws so much there is a flast side and a bumpy side for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>so when I use the side without the bumps I don&#x27;t still feel the bumps, that way I could use these more often, because I really like them.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>They work great with my sensitive skin and leave my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if the package was more easily and tightly reclosable.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I think these work  great</li>
            <li>According to her, she likes it; wipes well; makes her face clean and fresh,</li>
            <li>Remove make quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to these wipes since I was running low and they seemed like a great deal.</li>
            <li>It takes off all my makeup quickly and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>would of liked for them to be a little more moist</li>
            <li>and they are so exfoliating, but they are great to use a few times a week.</li>
            <li>The aloe has been known to help calm and sooth the skin.</li>
            <li>These are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, natural ingredients, hypoallergenic, and safe for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li>All worth it of buying it.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe the manufacturer can read this (and other reviews) and add more &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to moisten it more.</li>
            <li>The other side is honeycombed raised to help with more of the more stubborn makeup.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean, soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>Quick, convenient, they smell nice, and they don&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin that break out so easy.</li>
            <li>I really like that these wipes contain Aloe which soothes the skin and  green tea and vitamin E  which contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage, and it&#x27;s great that they are also fragrance free and alcohol free because that would always cause my skin to feel and look dry.</li>
            <li>but this is a very gentle formula.</li>
            <li>wipes are a good size and thickness, I just wish they were a little moister (would&#x27;ve been 5 stars).</li>
            <li>This wipes are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, they are gentle on my skin but are still able to remove all my makeup very easily even my mascara and eyeliner which for me has always been the most difficult thing to remove when it comes to removing my makeup.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin so for me that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my sister, and she says they are much more convenient than whatever she does with a regular cloth and pouring solution on it from some bottle thing.</li>
            <li>Hope this was helpful in some way ;)</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>so this is very convenience to have in your purse or suite case!</li>
            <li>First, the directions were unclear--</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so good, you only need ONE wipe for your entire face worth of makeup.</li>
            <li>After trying several face wipes, these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I prefer using them as a make up removers more than just for exfoliation, they are moist enough for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need more than 2 for my regular daily make up - they clean very well and easy.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>They removed all my make up with just one wipe (I don&#x27;t wear heavy or bright make up</li>
            <li>I am giving 2 stars because I quickly got a refund and was offered a new set.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but generally work fine for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>

            <li>Specific Beauty&#x27;s has developed an amazingly durable, multi purpose ( exfoliates on one side and takes off make-up on the other side) wipe.  </li>
            <li>my skin is getting a little more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that these were a little dry and not as great as my regular wipes.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really get rid of the eye makeup (like black on the lid and mascara) but do make the skin feel clean and scrubbed.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin ans</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes,  </li>
            <li>The only reason for 4/5 stars was due to finding it difficult to separate these wipes from many others on the market--while they were pleasant to use and &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>One side is smooth for makeup removal, the other has textured beads for facial cleansing and gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased them is that I currently have a little eye infection and want to clean the eye lashes and eye thoroughly (not using makeup actually right now).  </li>
            <li>They work pretty well to take off makeup and other than the bumps the formula is gentle on you skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who wants some makeup remover wipes that will actually benefit their skin.</li>
            <li>Green tea and vitamin E contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li>The cloths are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these did not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or sensitive skin, and that it is dual sided.</li>
            <li>For me, I can&#x27;t use them every night because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, low priced and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I think you can get just as good a product, if not better,  at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t find that they were that much improved from many other makeup remover wipes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if you might need two wipes for those days) and the exfoliating side seemed to make my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>They dry up too fast.</li>
            <li>These wipes left my skin feeling soft and smooth and removed all of my makeup, I had to scrub a little on the eyeliner but one cloth removed it all!  </li>
            <li>No other wipes I&#x27;ve used gave me that feeling.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a major plus for this product.</li>
            <li>It removes my makeup completely and exfoliate my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>But they are not rough feeling.</li>
            <li>Leaves sensitive, contact lens wearer eyes red.</li>
            <li>They did not dry out my skin after use and they have no smell.</li>
            <li>for using it to remove makeup, I&#x27;m not a big fan since it&#x27;s not wet</li>
            <li>When removing my eye makeup, the cloth was so soft and gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any eye irritation, a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m not giving these wipes 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not wet enough.</li>
            <li>They have these little exfoliating dots all over them which really help to get all the makeup off.</li>

            <li> It feels nice getting to rub the bumpy side on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have to use my own cleaner to get them to work.</li>
            <li> When you purchase these they do come in a twin pack of 2 which is nice.</li>
            <li> all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> They have little ridges that will help grip oil and make up while cleansing your face.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect unfold-able size and have a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Removes my makeup great and leaves my face feeling moisturizer and clean.</li>

            <li> Overall, I think these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and removes most of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love these wipws so much there is a flast side and a bumpy side for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> so when I use the side without the bumps I don&#x27;t still feel the bumps, that way I could use these more often, because I really like them.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> They work great with my sensitive skin and leave my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if the package was more easily and tightly reclosable.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I think these work  great</li>
            <li> According to her, she likes it; wipes well; makes her face clean and fresh,</li>
            <li> Remove make quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to these wipes since I was running low and they seemed like a great deal.</li>
            <li> It takes off all my makeup quickly and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> would of liked for them to be a little more moist</li>
            <li> and they are so exfoliating, but they are great to use a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The aloe has been known to help calm and sooth the skin.</li>
            <li> These are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, natural ingredients, hypoallergenic, and safe for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> All worth it of buying it.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the manufacturer can read this (and other reviews) and add more &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to moisten it more.</li>
            <li> The other side is honeycombed raised to help with more of the more stubborn makeup.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean, soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Quick, convenient, they smell nice, and they don&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin that break out so easy.</li>
            <li> I really like that these wipes contain Aloe which soothes the skin and  green tea and vitamin E  which contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage, and it&#x27;s great that they are also fragrance free and alcohol free because that would always cause my skin to feel and look dry.</li>
            <li> but this is a very gentle formula.</li>
            <li> wipes are a good size and thickness, I just wish they were a little moister (would&#x27;ve been 5 stars).</li>
            <li> This wipes are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, they are gentle on my skin but are still able to remove all my makeup very easily even my mascara and eyeliner which for me has always been the most difficult thing to remove when it comes to removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin so for me that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister, and she says they are much more convenient than whatever she does with a regular cloth and pouring solution on it from some bottle thing.</li>
            <li> Hope this was helpful in some way ;)</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> so this is very convenience to have in your purse or suite case!</li>
            <li> First, the directions were unclear--</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so good, you only need ONE wipe for your entire face worth of makeup.</li>
            <li> After trying several face wipes, these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I prefer using them as a make up removers more than just for exfoliation, they are moist enough for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need more than 2 for my regular daily make up - they clean very well and easy.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> They removed all my make up with just one wipe (I don&#x27;t wear heavy or bright make up</li>
            <li> I am giving 2 stars because I quickly got a refund and was offered a new set.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but generally work fine for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> They worked fine for a general makeup remover.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really take any of my make up of.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the wipes I&#x27;ve only used them once</li>
            <li> For me the thing that really makes or breaks a makeup remover wipe is if it burns my eyes and these did not it removed all my make even the waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance</li>
            <li> These make up remover cloths work very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that removes makeup without irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t burn my eyes and they get my makeup off really well.</li>
            <li> they take off makeup really well.</li>
            <li> One side of this cleanser remover cloth is smooth for basic remover off.</li>
            <li> It does gently take off the makeup.</li>
            <li> Plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> They are very rough and are more like exfoliating wipes.</li>
            <li> Not damp enough to clean a thing.</li>
            <li> They clean and at the same time exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li> These facial cleaning cloths really do leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The wipes are very gentle and appeal to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most cleaners either break me out or dry my face out.</li>
            <li> The soft package will also make it easy for any traveling later this summer too!</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for my face to remove the foundation</li>
            <li> so they have the extra benefit of a mild exfoliation each time one is used.</li>
            <li> I just like the ones I mentioned better even though they are so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I would have to say as I have gotten older</li>
            <li> very well removing my most long lasting eye make up.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this for on the go</li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing these cloths.</li>
            <li> Make up removing wipes is my way to take all make up,dirt of just clean my face after a long day.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a little more moisture in them.</li>
            <li> I still like them but had they been a little more moist would of gotten a 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes, but they are not all natural...</li>
            <li> One side is soft for the eye area and the beaded side for gentle exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I normally have issues with eye makeup remover burning my eyes</li>
            <li> I love that they have aloe, green tea and vitamin E in them.</li>
            <li> Nice thick towels.  </li>
            <li> Specific Beauty&#x27;s has developed an amazingly durable, multi purpose ( exfoliates on one side and takes off make-up on the other side) wipe.  </li>
            <li> my skin is getting a little more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that these were a little dry and not as great as my regular wipes.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really get rid of the eye makeup (like black on the lid and mascara) but do make the skin feel clean and scrubbed.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin ans</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes,  </li>
            <li> The only reason for 4/5 stars was due to finding it difficult to separate these wipes from many others on the market--while they were pleasant to use and &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> One side is smooth for makeup removal, the other has textured beads for facial cleansing and gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased them is that I currently have a little eye infection and want to clean the eye lashes and eye thoroughly (not using makeup actually right now).  </li>
            <li> They work pretty well to take off makeup and other than the bumps the formula is gentle on you skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who wants some makeup remover wipes that will actually benefit their skin.</li>
            <li> Green tea and vitamin E contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> The cloths are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these did not irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or sensitive skin, and that it is dual sided.</li>
            <li> For me, I can&#x27;t use them every night because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, low priced and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I think you can get just as good a product, if not better,  at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li> ; I didn&#x27;t find that they were that much improved from many other makeup remover wipes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if you might need two wipes for those days) and the exfoliating side seemed to make my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> They dry up too fast.</li>
            <li> These wipes left my skin feeling soft and smooth and removed all of my makeup, I had to scrub a little on the eyeliner but one cloth removed it all!  </li>
            <li> No other wipes I&#x27;ve used gave me that feeling.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a major plus for this product.</li>
            <li> It removes my makeup completely and exfoliate my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> But they are not rough feeling.</li>
            <li> Leaves sensitive, contact lens wearer eyes red.</li>
            <li> They did not dry out my skin after use and they have no smell.</li>
            <li> for using it to remove makeup, I&#x27;m not a big fan since it&#x27;s not wet</li>
            <li> When removing my eye makeup, the cloth was so soft and gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any eye irritation, a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not giving these wipes 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not wet enough.</li>
            <li> They have these little exfoliating dots all over them which really help to get all the makeup off.</li>
            <li> I expected the exfoliated side (with little bumps) to feel rough on the skin, but they were very gentle and soft causing no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> As far as skin texture/quality after using this product, I did not notice any difference, but I already use several other products in addition to these wipes.</li>
            <li> Soft on one side and textured on the other.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m too lazy to do the whole soap &amp; water thing, I&#x27;ll grab one of these.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using these for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I had to scrub pretty hard to try to remove eye makeup and still felt like it did not completely remove all my mascara.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these nearly as well as the Eye Scrubs I bought previously on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One side has tiny bumps and  is used to exfoliate and the other side is a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Works well removing eye make up but requires wiping over several times with pressure as the wipes are not too wet.</li>
            <li> But she said they don&#x27;t work nearly as well, since she has to work a little harder to get her eyeliner off.</li>
            <li> All other makeup wipes give me the same effect of a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I have to give this 4 stars due to the fact they are not moist enough.</li>
            <li> Removed all my makeup after a long night at prom!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave it oily.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face well without making it feel too oily or too dry.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and does not strip or dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Some constructive feedback -- I wish they were wetter; they seemed a bit dry to me.</li>
            <li> Wipes are too dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and very few wipes work for me.  </li>
            <li> The wipes I received were very dry and didn&#x27;t remove any of the makeup I tried to take off.</li>
            <li> I have previously had a problem with other brands being too moist/wet, especially when you get to the bottom of the package.</li>
            <li> -some make up is harder to take off than others-</li>
            <li> Wipes were not very saturated.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other wipes I&#x27;ve tried, these do not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t stick to each other.  </li>
            <li> If your face can tolerate other face products</li>
            <li> Other brands seem to still leave mascara on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> The other products did not exfoliate so</li>
            <li> One side has bumps and the other side does not.</li>
            <li> You can leave one in your gym or school bag and leave the other set at home.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s a little on the dry side.</li>
            <li> They are a little dry</li>
            <li> For my skin the exfoliating side was a little bit rough</li>
            <li> They have these little bumps on one side, and you can use the other side without the bumps, but it still is a bit scrubby on that side too.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have an odd smell,  and they didn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I used them to remove my eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> They have little bumps or the exfoliating  things on them that help to wipe off the make up and scrub skin.</li>
            <li> The clothes have little bumps on them that help to realy remove the make up from my skin.</li>
            <li> but they do have a little flap to close the package.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little funky, and I don&#x27;t know that I would use them for anything else.</li>
            <li> They seem a little dried up.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever had sensitivity to other face products, I would stay away!!  </li>
            <li> Takes off everyday makeup with ease with one wipe.</li>
            <li> These contain a blend of aloe, green tea, and vitamin E. Aloe soothes and calms the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now</li>
            <li> do I use water or not--because, yes, they are damp but almost imperceptibly damp.</li>
            <li> Specific Beauty&#x27;s eye makeup remover wipe is so durable that, if I need to use the wipe again (immediately) when I am not happy with my how I put on my eye makeup</li>
            <li> and it burned, after a few uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these wipes now for a few times</li>
            <li> Not sure that I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t get my eye make up off</li>
            <li> I wear water-proof mascara and usually have a hard time getting it all off without feeling like my eyelashes are going to all fall out.</li>
            <li> I am also using these at the end of the day to clean off my face from dirt and grim.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of cleansing wipes, I hate washing my face, so I am glad to have these for when I feel the need to exfoliate and get off those nasty dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad batch of these; they were dry and didn&#x27;t do the job removing my make up.</li>
            <li> I use them on the nights I am so tired that I can&#x27;t even move, but still want to get the makeup off my face.</li>
            <li> My skin was not sticky or uncomfortable immediately after using these, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> They also taste kinda weird after they pass over your mouth.</li>
            <li> My skin unfortunately seems to have a bad reaction to them.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Horrible shipping packaging, but</li>
            <li> They dont smell horrible either!</li>

            <li> Takes off everyday makeup with ease with one wipe. When raking off heavier makeup it take 2 wipes. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave it oily.</li>
            <li> Nice thick towels.  Work very well removing my most long lasting eye make up.  My face feels very clean after using.</li>
            <li> Removes all my makeup with one wipe. Leave my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> removes even waterproof makeup.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that these were a little dry and not as great as my regular wipes. Just go get the Neutrogena ones at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I love these  make up remover wipes. They do an awesome job and leave your face feeling  refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister, and she says they are much more convenient than whatever she does with a regular cloth and pouring solution on it from some bottle thing. (I have a vast knowledge of makeup products) But she said they don&#x27;t work nearly as well, since she has to work a little harder to get her eyeliner off. She told me she would recommend them to her friends for road trips or when they&#x27;re out places, but for just at-home use they aren&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said she&#x27;d give them 4 stars for the convenience, and they are decently effective, so that&#x27;s what I did. Hope this was helpful in some way ;)</li>
            <li> Specific beauty eye makeup remover wipes serve a dual purpose. One side has tiny bumps and  is used to exfoliate and the other side is a facial cleanser. I am a contact lens wearer so when offered a promotion to try these wipes in exchange for my honest opinion, I was thrilled. When removing my eye makeup, the cloth was so soft and gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any eye irritation, a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past. The exfoliating side helped remove all traces of makeup, yet didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. These wipes are alcohol and oil free, a must for my acne prone skin. My face felt clean, soft and smooth after using. Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product.  It cleaned my face well without making it feel too oily or too dry.  For my skin the exfoliating side was a little bit rough so I just used the smooth side with no issues.</li>
            <li> Removes my makeup great and leaves my face feeling moisturizer and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty product , this product arrived just as described .The packaging was perfect and arrived in a timely manner , the product was in perfect condition on arrival .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is eye makeup remover wipes, you will receive a twin pack of dual-sided facial cleanser wipes.These dual sided eye makeup remover and exfoliating wipes for use on your face and eyes. One side is smooth for makeup removal, the other has textured beads for facial cleansing and gentle exfoliation.These are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, natural ingredients, hypoallergenic, and safe for contact lens wearers.These contain a blend of aloe, green tea, and vitamin E. Aloe soothes and calms the skin. Green tea and vitamin E contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great they do the job perfectly , they remove your makeup with ease .The exfoliating side gently scrubs your skin.You will feel refreshed and amazing after you are done .I have tried many makeup remover wipes and they don&#x27;t compare to these .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> These take off all of the makeup and it&#x27;s super easy. You don&#x27;t need to scrub, it wipes away with no problem. They make my skin feel so much better after using these as well.</li>
            <li> These do the job well. I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> item was very neatly packaged, liked the way it felt on my skin and did take away most of my make up i highly recommend this for on the go i travel a bit sometimes so this is very convenience to have in your purse or suite case!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now and they work very well for removing eye makeup. I love the textured pattern of the wipes, it seems to help grab the makeup off my face. Unlike other wipes I&#x27;ve tried, these do not leave any residue. Just a clean, makeup-free face. Perfect for using before bed. I keep a pack in my bathroom, and one on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels after i clean my face at the end of the day. would of liked for them to be a little more moist but it cleans well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  it takes off make up well and does not leave your face oil nor does it sting</li>
            <li> I really like these makeup wipes. They work rest for waterproof eye make up.  Great for on the go.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> These wipes are perfect for my sensitive eye area I use these wipes to remove all my makeup not just my eye makeup. This wipes are dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested, they are gentle on my skin but are still able to remove all my makeup very easily even my mascara and eyeliner which for me has always been the most difficult thing to remove when it comes to removing my makeup. I really like that these wipes contain Aloe which soothes the skin and  green tea and vitamin E  which contain antioxidants that protect the skin from free radical damage, and it&#x27;s great that they are also fragrance free and alcohol free because that would always cause my skin to feel and look dry. After I Remove my make up with the wipes my skin just feels fresh and soft and looks brighter. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or someone who wants some makeup remover wipes that will actually benefit their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought two packages. What was I thinking about? First, the directions were unclear--do I use water or not--because, yes, they are damp but almost imperceptibly damp. Not damp enough to clean a thing. And they don&#x27;t. Do not waste your time and money. I am so disappointed.  Oh, and when the directions say &amp;#34;no rinsing necessary&amp;#34;--I guess not. Nothing gets on the skin--you can wipe all day--nothing appears on the wipe and there is nothing discernible on your face.  I tried them on my eye make up. Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Great product! It removes my makeup completely and exfoliate my skin at the same time. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Great buy! These facial wipes does the job. I have used many different ones and this has a good texture and removes my makeup with ease. I recommended this product!</li>
            <li> I really like these wipes, but they are not all natural...but I still like them regardless. Quick, convenient, they smell nice, and they don&#x27;t dry out my face. They are also moist enough that they work efficiently.</li>
            <li> They are very rough and are more like exfoliating wipes. They don&#x27;t really take any of my make up of. But they are great for exfoliating your face! They also dried out really fast and there&#x27;s no&lt;br /&gt;Cover to close the package(it&#x27;s a piece of tape) they aren&#x27;t something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good. I wish they had a little more moisture in them. They are better than some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the wipes I&#x27;ve only used them once but they didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin so for me that is a huge plus. I like that they have two sides depending on what I need to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife since she uses face wipes daily. According to her, she likes it; wipes well; makes her face clean and fresh, But, it&#x27;s a little on the dry side. Otherwise, four stars for lacking wetness.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have very sensitive skin ans this does not irritate my face and leaves it soo clean!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;m not the only one who doesn&#x27;t mind spending 20 minutes putting makeup on, yet loathes spending 20 minutes taking it off! I can never seem to get my waterlines clean with a wipe since they tend to irritate my eyes, but that was not the case with these! I was able to wipe off every trace of mascara and eyeliner in a swipe or two with no pain or tearing up. I love how clean they leave my skin feeling and I especially love being able to go to bed that much faster! I did receive a discount on these but price says nothing about how effective they are!</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that there are 2 sides and one to exfoliate.  I think they are a good idea for traveling or camping for that convenient way to remove makeup.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it made my partner break out with pimples.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes! You get TWO packages of these wipes, each with 30 wipes. They&#x27;re so good, you only need ONE wipe for your entire face worth of makeup. They have these little exfoliating dots all over them which really help to get all the makeup off. I normally have issues with eye makeup remover burning my eyes but this is a very gentle formula. They smell great too! *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really get rid of the eye makeup (like black on the lid and mascara) but do make the skin feel clean and scrubbed.</li>
            <li> Make up removing wipes is my way to take all make up,dirt of just clean my face after a long day. Very easy to handle, I keep them in my sink they take everything out without drying my face.&lt;br /&gt;Good value and always make sure you use the amount you have to do -some make up is harder to take off than others-</li>
            <li> I love these wipes compared to many others. They have little ridges that will help grip oil and make up while cleansing your face.&lt;br /&gt;They are the perfect unfold-able size and have a very pleasant scent. Quiet happy with this purchase and recommend them to anyone wanting a good quality facial cleanser wipe.</li>
            <li> Great Eye Makeup Remover Wipes - I actually used them to wipe the makeup off of my entire face, not just my eyes.  Job well done - the cloths wiped all my makeup away, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed.  The cloths are soft and durable.  I expected the exfoliated side (with little bumps) to feel rough on the skin, but they were very gentle and soft causing no discomfort.  Highly recommend purchasing these cloths.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient for traveling--removes the foundation easily !</li>
            <li> After trying several face wipes, these are my favorite. They work great with my sensitive skin and leave my face feeling clean and soft. They don&#x27;t have a strong smell and are well worth the cost. I also like that they do not have a ton of chemicals. I try to use healthier products.</li>
            <li> I use these wipes every night to take off my make up. They are really good. They are not overly moist, which is a good thing. They have little bumps or the exfoliating  things on them that help to wipe off the make up and scrub skin. But they are not rough feeling.</li>
            <li> I find that these makeup remover towelettes have the perfect amount of moisture for me. I have previously had a problem with other brands being too moist/wet, especially when you get to the bottom of the package. These are just moist enough to remove makeup, and won&#x27;t make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;They have small &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; on them in order to exfoliate skin, which is a good addition to makeup remover wipes. The packaging is easy to access. The scent is nice and pleasant. As far as skin texture/quality after using this product, I did not notice any difference, but I already use several other products in addition to these wipes. My skin was not sticky or uncomfortable immediately after using these, so that was a plus. My eye makeup was completely removed (I tend to wear a fair amount of eye makeup including eyeliner, eyeshadow/primer, eyebrow gel/color). Overall, I think these are a good buy. The only reason for 4/5 stars was due to finding it difficult to separate these wipes from many others on the market--while they were pleasant to use and &amp;#34;did the job,&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t find that they were that much improved from many other makeup remover wipes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not good. They dry up too fast.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  Very cool Eye Makeup Remover Wipes by Specific Beauty. With the two sided eye makeup remover and exfoliating wipes, these make the perfect product to clean your face. Each pack has 30 wipes, but they were way thicker than I thought they would be, which is great! This way I know that they won&#x27;t rip off when I&#x27;m using them. Very easy to pull the out of the package and they don&#x27;t stick to each other.  I prefer using them as a make up removers more than just for exfoliation, they are moist enough for me. I don&#x27;t need more than 2 for my regular daily make up - they clean very well and easy. The scent they have is like aloe and citrus - it&#x27;s very fresh and it leaves very light feeling on your skin. I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase.  A 5 star product!</li>
            <li> I really love it when the first time I used it, I love the smell and the fact that it&#x27;s organic it really good for my skin esp. I have a very sensitive skin that break out so easy. All worth it of buying it.</li>
            <li> I really love that I can put these anywhere I feel the need to just take my makeup off. They send you 2 packs so I have one upstairs and one downstairs, so I can easily grab them &amp; wash the makeup off my face really easily.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly! Great products! Horrible shipping packaging, but not like it could get damaged just throwing them in a box like they did.</li>
            <li> Remove make quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite makeup fwipes! I wear water-proof mascara and usually have a hard time getting it all off without feeling like my eyelashes are going to all fall out. Literally, 2 swipes with these, and my mascara was off, and not all over my face! I&#x27;ll never use another makeup remover wipe.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Works great on eye makeup too. Leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I received these and they do t say that they are for eye makeup. They are a little dry but generally work fine for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Nice towelettes. Does what it is supposed to do and does not strip or dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t sting or irritate at all.  Perfect also for travel or post workout.</li>
            <li> I would normally buy the store brand that would leave my skin dry, after giving these a try I started noticing that it left my skin looking and feeling great. This is a great makeup remover that also helps to exfoliate at the same time.</li>
            <li> Used these last night to remove the makeup from my face. Not only did it do a WONDEFUL job cleaning all the mascara off, but my skin actually looks healthier today. I wonder if that has something to do with the exfoliation part. Oh well. It works, and thats all that matters! They dont smell horrible either!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Good as a makeup remover but I still like to use regular eye makeup remover with a q-tip, remove residue/remaining makeup with these wipes, and then wash my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these makeup remover wipe.!! I have sensitive skin and most cleaners either break me out or dry my face out. These wipes left my skin feeling soft and smooth and removed all of my makeup, I had to scrub a little on the eyeliner but one cloth removed it all!  I would gladly purchase these again. I also highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Eye makeup remover-The Best I Ever tried! Specific Beauty&#x27;s has developed an amazingly durable, multi purpose ( exfoliates on one side and takes off make-up on the other side) wipe.  Specific Beauty&#x27;s eye makeup remover wipe is so durable that, if I need to use the wipe again (immediately) when I am not happy with my how I put on my eye makeup and I want to redo it, all I have to do is  pour some of my Mary Kay Eye Makeup Remover and presto it works great!</li>
            <li> Love these cleansing cloths. The exfoliating side leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I have sensitive skin and these did not irritate me at all. I will definitely be using these for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It is a refreshing &amp;#34;facial in a packet.&amp;#34;  Good for sensitive skin too...love it!</li>
            <li> Makeup remover wipes are so handy. I use them on the nights I am so tired that I can&#x27;t even move, but still want to get the makeup off my face. I also like to keep some in my car in case I need to freshen up my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are a good size and thickness, I just wish they were a little moister (would&#x27;ve been 5 stars). That being said they still work pretty good at removing foundation and eye makeup. When it comes to my eyes there was no burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific Beauty provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite! Soft on one side and textured on the other. I just use these to wash my make up off. No soap or water. Smooths out my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well removing eye make up but requires wiping over several times with pressure as the wipes are not too wet. Leaves sensitive, contact lens wearer eyes red.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely call this a holy grail item. All other makeup wipes give me the same effect of a chemical peel. This is gentle and removes most of my makeup. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love these wipws so much there is a flast side and a bumpy side for exfoliating. For me the thing that really makes or breaks a makeup remover wipe is if it burns my eyes and these did not it removed all my make even the waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Wipes were not very saturated.  They worked fine for a general makeup remover.  I had to scrub pretty hard to try to remove eye makeup and still felt like it did not completely remove all my mascara.  It was regular mascara, not waterproof.  I would not buy these again.  I want my makeup remover cloths to take everything off, eye makeup included.  I think you can get just as good a product, if not better,  at the drugstore for half the price.</li>
            <li> I got these to try and review. I have used a lot of makeup removing clothes but I have never had any like this. The clothes have little bumps on them that help to realy remove the make up from my skin. They did not dry out my skin after use and they have no smell. They side of the cloth is perfect for removing all of my face make up.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not giving these wipes 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not wet enough. However, when I use it to clean my face without makeup, it works great. I was impressed on how Fresh and clean my face felt after. No other wipes I&#x27;ve used gave me that feeling. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;As for using it to remove makeup, I&#x27;m not a big fan since it&#x27;s not wet enough.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the manufacturer can read this (and other reviews) and add more &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; to moisten it more. Maybe then, it&#x27;ll earn 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It does take a bit of rubbing to get my eyeliners off. I mainly use it for my face to remove the foundation and it works great.</li>
            <li> Good for removing makeup</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to these wipes since I was running low and they seemed like a great deal. The packaging comes stuffed full of wipes and looks comically puffy :) I liked that. The wipes themselves are pretty thick and good sized. One side has exfoliating bumps (you can feel them) that I was happy to see. They removed all my make up with just one wipe (I don&#x27;t wear heavy or bright make up so I&#x27;m not sure if you might need two wipes for those days) and the exfoliating side seemed to make my face feel smooth. My skin unfortunately seems to have a bad reaction to them. It made my cheeks and nose extremely red and it burned, after a few uses. I stopped the product and had to apply coconut oil to help soothe the area. If you have ever had sensitivity to other face products, I would stay away!!  If your face can tolerate other face products well I would say give them a try, they do work well.</li>
            <li> This worked good at removing my make up as well as my mascara. Other brands seem to still leave mascara on my lashes.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or sensitive skin, and that it is dual sided. One side is soft for the eye area and the beaded side for gentle exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The Specific Beauty Eye Makeup Remover Wipes clean my face quickly and well - I love the convenience they offer.</li>
            <li> I think these wipes are great, and they are super scrubby. They definitely are exfoliating. They have these little bumps on one side, and you can use the other side without the bumps, but it still is a bit scrubby on that side too. For me, I can&#x27;t use them every night because I have sensitive skin and they are so exfoliating, but they are great to use a few times a week. I am a lover of cleansing wipes, I hate washing my face, so I am glad to have these for when I feel the need to exfoliate and get off those nasty dead skin cells. They work pretty well to take off makeup and other than the bumps the formula is gentle on you skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I kinda wish the cloth was a bit thicker or something so when I use the side without the bumps I don&#x27;t still feel the bumps, that way I could use these more often, because I really like them. They don&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals, or scents and are very soothing. I love that they have chamomile, cucumber and aloe, all ingredients I look for. They are refreshing and leave your skin super clean. Even my hubby likes them, and he is super picky when it comes to skin care products! I would certainly recommend these, and haven&#x27;t found anything else like them.</li>
            <li> These facial cleaning cloths really do leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  When I&#x27;m too lazy to do the whole soap &amp; water thing, I&#x27;ll grab one of these.  I&#x27;m also going to throw a pack in our camping gear for night (and morning) cleanings rather than using baby wipes.</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean well, smelled fresh, good texture to scrub with. Some constructive feedback -- I wish they were wetter; they seemed a bit dry to me. It would also be nice if the package was more easily and tightly reclosable. The sticker didn&#x27;t stick well or very securely after I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I think these work  great and I use them every night.  They remove even my mascara (not waterproof) without stinging or leaving my eyes red.  I just wish that they had more moisture.  They seem a little dried up.  Hopefully my second pack will not be.</li>
            <li> These make up remover cloths work very well.  Not only do they remove my makeup well but the wipe has one side with ridges so they have the extra benefit of a mild exfoliation each time one is used.</li>
            <li> I like the wipes to take off make-up but I find that I dislike the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; somewhat.  The reason I purchased them is that I currently have a little eye infection and want to clean the eye lashes and eye thoroughly (not using makeup actually right now).  I don&#x27;t like these nearly as well as the Eye Scrubs I bought previously on Amazon.  They seemed the clean the eyes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these wipes now for a few times and I find I have to wipe a lot to get the eyes really clean.  I also wish they came in a refillable container but they do have a little flap to close the package.  The price is very good for two packages at $14.95 with Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if a person is just looking for an eye makeup remover, this is a very good product.  It&#x27;s gentle, low priced and does it&#x27;s job.  I just like the ones I mentioned better even though they are so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I have been using my Specific Beauty wipes every night since I got them and I just love the &amp;#34;clean and scrubbed&amp;#34; way my skin feels each night. I use the exfoliating side to remove all my makeup and mascara with just one wipe. As an added bonus I use the smooth side in the morning to clean my face before I start my day. The soft package will also make it easy for any traveling later this summer too!</li>
            <li> Love love love! I use these wipes for everything. After the gym, at night to take my makeup off and exfoliate my skin, during the day when I need to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love these face wipes. Perfect for getting make up off  or if you get dirt on your face. They smell pretty good too.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product.  It takes off all my makeup quickly and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  I have tried similar products and this one stands out as being the best I have ever used. The other products did not exfoliate so it&#x27;s a major plus for this product. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These wipes are great! I love the dual side as I can exfoliate my skin, clean, and get moisture afterwards.  I have sensitive skin and very few wipes work for me.  I&#x27;m very happy to learn that I can buy them in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not as effective for removing make up as id hoped. Wipes are too dry.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the price. I had a full face of makeup on and it came off so easily. I had waterproof eyeliner and it came off in like a second. It felt really nice on my skin and I loved the dual-sideness. One side has bumps and the other side does not. It feels nice getting to rub the bumpy side on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and works so well.</li>
            <li> The wipes I received were very dry and didn&#x27;t remove any of the makeup I tried to take off. I do like the cloth but I have to use my own cleaner to get them to work.</li>
            <li> This wipes are a great tool when it comes to removing your make up. They clean and at the same time exfoliate your skin.  They have no scent but they don&#x27;t smell bad either. Great product</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have an odd smell,  and they didn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I used them to remove my eyeshadow.  I have very sensitive eyes,  so I was worried about that.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I actually used them to get the makeup off of my eyes as well as my face. The texture helps to make sure your face is really clean.</li>
            <li> Came fast great product for price</li>
            <li> The wipes are very gentle and appeal to sensitive skin.  This is a great product that removes makeup without irritating your skin.  Must try!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it highly! Best exfoliating wipes I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;~ Stephanie</li>
            <li> Great wipes for removing my make-up in my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great deal for what you get. I don&#x27;t love the texture of these but they don&#x27;t burn my eyes and they get my makeup off really well.</li>
            <li> they take off makeup really well. The smell is a little funky, and I don&#x27;t know that I would use them for anything else. They also taste kinda weird after they pass over your mouth. Not sure that I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad batch of these; they were dry and didn&#x27;t do the job removing my make up. I am giving 2 stars because I quickly got a refund and was offered a new set.</li>
            <li> I have to give this 4 stars due to the fact they are not moist enough. I still like them but had they been a little more moist would of gotten a 5 stars from me. One side of this cleanser remover cloth is smooth for basic remover off. The other side is honeycombed raised to help with more of the more stubborn makeup. It does gently take off the makeup. I am also using these at the end of the day to clean off my face from dirt and grim. I love that they have aloe, green tea and vitamin E in them. The aloe has been known to help calm and sooth the skin. There is no alcohol in these and that is huge. It seems like a lot of the products have some form of alcohol in them. I have found that somethings with alcohol in them break me out. I would have to say as I have gotten older my skin is getting a little more sensitive. When you purchase these they do come in a twin pack of 2 which is nice. You can leave one in your gym or school bag and leave the other set at home. I can say these have no fragrance so if the men want these also to put in gym bag they could. I would consider these unisex product. I will say they are about the same size as a wash cloth. I will try to get back on here and give update how my skin is reacting to these.  As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> These eye makeup remover wipes are wonderful! They take off my mascara and eye liner with ease! Plus fast shipping</li>
            <li> These work great. Removed all my makeup after a long night at prom!</li>
            <li> Theses are great! They remove my makeup easily and without irritation. Perfect package for traveling too!</li>
            <li> I use them to clean the oil off my face and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eye make removal.  My skin is so sensitive. This did not irritate my skin at all. Removes makeup with ease.</li>
            <li> Good wipes!  I usually can&#x27;t get my eye make up off but with this one I was able to in just a couple of wipes!</li>
