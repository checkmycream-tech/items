            <li>My son had this fragrance before and he love it.  </li>
            <li>my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li>You can tell Its been damage for a while because there was cologne under the cologne top that poured out copper brown when I pulled the fragrance out box.  </li>
            <li>I have used realities for quite sometime and like it because it has a refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne but it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I bought this just trying something new, and it surprised me how good it smells once you put it on...and this site has the best price i have seen for any cologne.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it my GF said \\&quot;What are you wearing, GOOD LORD</li>
            <li>Love his cologne and it&#x27;s light scent.</li>
            <li>It spilled into the box hence the strong fragrance upon opening it.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for me ! :)</li>
            <li>it was a big surprise beacuse i didnt think it smelled sooo good and so damn sexy.</li>
            <li>So far im very pleased with all 3 phases...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of different colognes over the years but this is far the best for me.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves this cologne because it is a perfect fresh fragrance that has such strong appeal and really makes a difference when you smell it up close.</li>
            <li>Not too over powering and good enough to get the compliments going</li>
            <li>this is the most reasonable price i found out there.</li>
            <li>the original one and most of the sites have the new version of this scent.</li>
            <li>It used to disappear rather quickly from the shelves</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>but I must say Realities is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The smell is soft and sexy.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>it was well worth it</li>
            <li>I was taken back by how great it smelled and by the fact that it was actually worth wearing since free stuff is usually not worth having.</li>
            <li>last most of the day -- this knock off the fregrance</li>
            <li>I got this cologne for myself after several people recommended it and after looking at so many department store</li>
            <li>He really loves the fresh scent and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon from FragranceOrbit at a decent price!</li>
            <li>I am very picky about the cologne I wear</li>
            <li>To get to the point I really dont wear cologne anymore</li>
            <li>The real product made by Liz Claborne (which i thought I was purchasing)</li>
            <li>Really miss seeing it on the shelves in the store.</li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>this is not the real one...</li>
            <li>I first smelled this on my (then) new boyfriend</li>
            <li>He has a very expensive taste in cologne, Creed being a number one pick, but he finds this to be the perfect inexpensive accent to his workday.</li>
            <li>I am more into oils, but this cologne left a lasting impression and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the oil scent.</li>
            <li>enough - glad he&#x27;s running low</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is currently my favorite everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>I gotta Try to find a new one now</li>
            <li>A female friend bought the first bottle of this for me.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t understand why they no longer carry it--but still seem to carry Old Spice, and other OLD colognes on the shelves.</li>

            <li> Smells as expected, and seems to last.</li>
            <li> but I will test it out and see if the smell lasts long.</li>
            <li> and I was unsure about the scent, because it is different from the average \\&quot;male\\&quot; colognes.</li>

            <li> The price was sooooo much less than any price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I had a bottle and it came up missing, so I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to find now</li>
            <li> greatly disappointed - had I realized that this was a knock off</li>
            <li> As a suggestion they should take the funds they spend on doing the copycat of the boxing and bottling and put it into the product,  My opinion a horrible price for a knockoff.</li>

            <li> Smells really good. Highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite everyday cologne. Nice clean smell. I get a lot of compliments on realities. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my hubby. it was a big surprise beacuse i didnt think it smelled sooo good and so damn sexy. all my lady friends compliment him about it. actually my cousin also ordered a bottle for her boyfriend. its a very nice cologne. smells really good.</li>
            <li> Well to tell you the truth I still have not got the product. I am deployed, but I know that this cologne is great. It has been delivered to my house. To get to the point I really dont wear cologne anymore I am more into oils, but this cologne left a lasting impression and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the oil scent. I had a bottle and it came up missing, so I bought another one. The smell is soft and sexy. It is not overpowering at all and it is something a lot of women have been drawn to. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> liz claiborne,love at firts sight.......</li>
            <li> greatly disappointed - had I realized that this was a knock off i would have never purchased it.  The real product made by Liz Claborne (which i thought I was purchasing) last most of the day -- this knock off the fregrance is gone the moment you spray it.  As a suggestion they should take the funds they spend on doing the copycat of the boxing and bottling and put it into the product,  My opinion a horrible price for a knockoff.</li>
            <li> For the cost of the amount I purchased it was well worth it you surely couldn&#x27;t get it for the price I paid in a department store! I was truly pleased...</li>
            <li> I bought this just trying something new, and it surprised me how good it smells once you put it on...and this site has the best price i have seen for any cologne. But even if you don&#x27;t like it....but you like women BUY IT!! you&#x27;ll hear good comments all day. all around good.</li>
            <li> Love his cologne and it&#x27;s light scent. Really miss seeing it on the shelves in the store. It used to disappear rather quickly from the shelves so I don&#x27;t understand why they no longer carry it--but still seem to carry Old Spice, and other OLD colognes on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find more of this......I like the original one and most of the sites have the new version of this scent.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for myself after several people recommended it and after looking at so many department store this is the most reasonable price i found out there. Now on to the cologne it smells awesome and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My son had this fragrance before and he love it.  He had been looking to replinish his his supply when I found it on Amazon.com.  The price was sooooo much less than any price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  A real bargain.</li>
            <li> My father wears ONE cologne, and one cologne only, Realities for Men. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to find now, I think it&#x27;s been discontinued? I took a gamble on this seller, and if it&#x27;s a knock-off, we can&#x27;t tell. Dad opened it up this morning for Father&#x27;s Day and he was very happy. Smells as expected, and seems to last.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now. I&#x27;ve tried alot of different colognes over the years but this is far the best for me. It&#x27;s very light and refreshing. Not heavy at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the transaction was very smooth!!!! the price was very very reasonable!!! i would deal with them again in a HEART BEAT! without a 2nd thought! check &#x27;em out!</li>
            <li> It is what it is. The smell is spicy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, and the online price is much better than in the store.. Excellent choice for me</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on my (then) new boyfriend and I was unsure about the scent, because it is different from the average \\&quot;male\\&quot; colognes. It only took a few days and I was hooked!  Now I can&#x27;t get enough - glad he&#x27;s running low, it&#x27;s a no-brainer Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> This cologne was a present for my step father. He really loves the fresh scent and my 7 year brother likes to use it too.</li>
            <li> first time I got this productive with an excellent price and no change in quality. I very happy I made the right choice about this seller.</li>
            <li> Order arrived with the cologne bottle damage. It spilled into the box hence the strong fragrance upon opening it.  You can tell Its been damage for a while because there was cologne under the cologne top that poured out copper brown when I pulled the fragrance out box.  I gotta Try to find a new one now</li>
            <li> I have used realities for quite sometime and like it because it has a refreshing fragrance.  I like the convenience&lt;br /&gt;of ordering it on line...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this cologne because it is a perfect fresh fragrance that has such strong appeal and really makes a difference when you smell it up close. He always gets compliments on how he smells during the day with this! He has a very expensive taste in cologne, Creed being a number one pick, but he finds this to be the perfect inexpensive accent to his workday. Love it!</li>
            <li> Delivered &amp; described as promised.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price!</li>
            <li> I got a sample bottle of this cologne when my girlfriend bought a different cologne recently. I was taken back by how great it smelled and by the fact that it was actually worth wearing since free stuff is usually not worth having. Realities also has a product called after shave smoother that smells just as good as the cologne. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time and the cologne is excellent.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in the dept stores anymore and my husband really likes it. If Amazon keeps carrying it we will purchase again in the future. Scent is nice and not overpowering like many colognes.</li>
            <li> My wife got me a smaller bottle of this cologne and I LOVED the way it smelled but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores! Found it on Amazon from FragranceOrbit at a decent price! Ordered it on the 3rd and I got it TODAY!! So far im very pleased with all 3 phases...It smells good, the price was good, and the delivery speed was fantastic!! I hope its not a knockoff...but I will test it out and see if the smell lasts long. If not, I will be writing another review and will definitely put FragranceOrbit on BLAST!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> this is not the real one...it doesn&#x27;t say Liz Claiborne anywhere on the box or bottle..and it smells like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne but it has been discontinued. I&#x27;m so happy I was able to find it on Amazon. 3.4 oz will last him a LONG time. Fast shipping!</li>
