            <li>What a great deal!</li>
            <li>I would say the best way to describe the smell of this would be like if I had a pine scented car air freshener and hung it up in the lumber department at a hardware</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful....</li>
            <li>beautiful price and product</li>

            <li>It has an amazing smell.. earthy but not in that granola hippy kind of way.  </li>
            <li>Very light lotion...</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is nice, goes on easily and isn&#x27;t greasy so that gets it up to three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>We love this stuff in our house.  </li>

            <li>This is my favorite smelling lotion for men.</li>
            <li>I love lotions that smell edible, and these lotions made me feel like i&#x27;m a walking candy!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I love patchouli...</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is lovely and I have gotten compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually love it.</li>
            <li>Let me say, that I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand, and I love that they make organic Eco friendly</li>
            <li>I love this smell and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>strong patchouli</li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous-</li>
            <li>It is a light texture lotion.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>And I love hot showers</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a light feel to the skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t love is that it seems like it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin and sometimes feels kinda tacky,  </li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and the smell softly lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my rough elbows smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your quick service and great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>You know that feeling when your skin is super</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic - a good true patchouli smell that doesn&#x27;t sour.</li>
            <li>lotion works good on my very dry sking and the smell is devine, stays with you and like others say, clings to your clothes.</li>
            <li>We are granola as they come and we love our all natural body products.  </li>
            <li>skin does ok with most regular natural body lotion brands like Burt&#x27;s bees and kiss my face.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong and seems pretty masculine.  </li>
            <li>At first application it smells like used motor oil then</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of reading I settled on this lotion first.  </li>
            <li>it is light and refreshing- not what you might usually think of patchouli.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it had something to do with my skin type, or certain ingredients in the lotion, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just going to be very brief:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband says it is soothing when his skin has had too much sun, as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I get much of hydrating feeling.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li>problem I have with this particular lotion is the scent.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to wit a few minutes to put on any clothing after applying.  </li>
            <li>And it left an oily shine on my skin, like it wasn&#x27;t really absorbed at all.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike the smell, but it&#x27;s also not a huge selling point; the patchouli is overwhelmingly monotonous.</li>
            <li>only thing that I did not like was the container the top was loose when I had received and the lotion leaked into the plastic bag that surrounded the container.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit weird at first but quickly disappears to a light Patchouli smell.</li>
            <li>A thinner lotion that sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much, but this is entirely subjective.  </li>
            <li>I first put the lotion on, it had a weird texture, not creamy or watery, more on the watery side, almost like lubricants....</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and am very sensitive to detergents and chemical smells and this product fits my needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty let down.</li>
            <li>although it doesn&#x27;t last overly long like a classic patchouli oil would.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given this a three if it didn&#x27;t burn my legs so much after a shave (and not right after).</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel great in the wintertime, I live in a cold place and use it everyday, my hands and arms don&#x27;t dry out, and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> when u bend over and the skin on your back got stretched and it itches?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried typing this review out several times and each time I&#x27;m unable to accurately express my opinion of this lotion</li>
            <li> Asian and I have dry skin..</li>
            <li> The Patchouli is masculine and not overwhelming enough that a woman couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> This is a strange combination of patchouli and lime.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days I noticed my skin was soft and</li>
            <li> I have long hair and find that two drops is all I need to control fly-away and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s working, because when I go without for a couple of days, my skin starts complaining and turning dry.</li>
            <li> Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on.</li>
            <li> (note some dry skin is an allergy).</li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle in less than a week and my skin was feeling more miserable than ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I get to skip all the chemicals the other brands use.</li>
            <li> (This did NOT flake off for me as in the other review.)  </li>
            <li> I  am always very careful about what I put on my skin because my liver needs to be protected so this organic product helps</li>
            <li> The star rating was high for this one, but there were enough dissenters to prepare me for the possibility of disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have found myself using it less because of this.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little milky, so</li>
            <li> I dont smell the lime, but the patchouli is faint enough not to be overpowering...</li>
            <li> if u never tried it, just but a small bottle to see how it works with your skin...</li>
            <li> There is some sort of alcohol in it that if you don&#x27;t wait at least a day after shaving it burns.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> (this is a tough scent, not for everyone)</li>
            <li> after a few hours my skin started itching every time I move!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awfully watery; you know from that alone that it&#x27;s not going to hydrate very well, and it does not.</li>
            <li> I lost approximately two tablespoons of the lotion.</li>
            <li> may just have gotten a bad bottle based on other reviews</li>
            <li> I can handle weird texture and shine....</li>
            <li> And yes, as a lotion, I found this highly disappointing.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not the worst part....  </li>
            <li> not saying its a terrible product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin...  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like that its watery but it  still feels a lil greasy. Smell mellows out after short time. At first application it smells like used motor oil then a hospital disinfectant......then mellows out in a piney way. Not for females, not patchouli like. I will use it all up but i will not reorder</li>
            <li> I dont smell the lime, but the patchouli is faint enough not to be overpowering...Love it is all organic and Dr Bronners!  Very light lotion...</li>
            <li> We love this stuff in our house.  We are granola as they come and we love our all natural body products.  We have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for years but recently delved into the lotions.  We have not found one that we don&#x27;t like.  The Patchouli is masculine and not overwhelming enough that a woman couldn&#x27;t use it.  It softens and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy at all.  What a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried typing this review out several times and each time I&#x27;m unable to accurately express my opinion of this lotion so I&#x27;m just going to be very brief:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and the company, so this gets two stars for that. The lotion itself is nice, goes on easily and isn&#x27;t greasy so that gets it up to three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with this particular lotion is the scent. I can&#x27;t detect any Patchouli. To me it smells like lumber but to my co-workers it smells like pine. I would say the best way to describe the smell of this would be like if I had a pine scented car air freshener and hung it up in the lumber department at a hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just have gotten a bad bottle based on other reviews but personally I don&#x27;t like this scent.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. A thinner lotion that sinks in quickly. Keeps your skin moisturized without being \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; all day. The smell is fantastic - a good true patchouli smell that doesn&#x27;t sour. I know it&#x27;s working, because when I go without for a couple of days, my skin starts complaining and turning dry. This is truly a find, and a keeper.</li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous- it is light and refreshing- not what you might usually think of patchouli.  It is a light texture lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and love the company. It makes my skin feel great in the wintertime, I live in a cold place and use it everyday, my hands and arms don&#x27;t dry out, and I get to skip all the chemicals the other brands use.</li>
            <li> I  am always very careful about what I put on my skin because my liver needs to be protected so this organic product helps and this is a great product for supple skin. The scent reminds me of the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite lotion.  The smell is wonderful....strong patchouli although it doesn&#x27;t last overly long like a classic patchouli oil would.  It&#x27;s super moisturizing.  He uses it on his face and bald head.  We&#x27;ve purchased this lotion repeatedly and won&#x27;t want to run out! Husband says it is soothing when his skin has had too much sun, as well.</li>
            <li> I love patchouli, and the smell softly lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my rough elbows smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your quick service and great price.</li>
            <li> I received the Patchouli Lime as a gift.  It has an amazing smell.. earthy but not in that granola hippy kind of way.  Goes on smooth, absorbs quickly.  (This did NOT flake off for me as in the other review.)  I have normal to dry skin and am very sensitive to detergents and chemical smells and this product fits my needs.  I will definitely purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> beautiful price and product</li>
            <li> The star rating was high for this one, but there were enough dissenters to prepare me for the possibility of disappointment. And yes, as a lotion, I found this highly disappointing. I don&#x27;t dislike the smell, but it&#x27;s also not a huge selling point; the patchouli is overwhelmingly monotonous. Happily, it does fade in 20 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as a lotion I&#x27;m pretty let down. It&#x27;s awfully watery; you know from that alone that it&#x27;s not going to hydrate very well, and it does not.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smelling lotion for men. It is not too strong and seems pretty masculine.  What I don&#x27;t love is that it seems like it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin and sometimes feels kinda tacky,  I just make sure to wit a few minutes to put on any clothing after applying.  I have found myself using it less because of this.</li>
            <li> Let me say, that I love dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand, and I love that they make organic Eco friendly stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian and I have dry skin.. And I love hot showers so I know that makes it worse.&lt;br /&gt;My skin does ok with most regular natural body lotion brands like Burt&#x27;s bees and kiss my face.  Shea moisture, and Nubian heritage work wonders on my skin and they smell amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dr. bronner&#x27;s lotion, I have tried both the peppermint and patchouli ones.  Both of them smell pretty awesome.  I love lotions that smell edible, and these lotions made me feel like i&#x27;m a walking candy!&lt;br /&gt;When I first put the lotion on, it had a weird texture, not creamy or watery, more on the watery side, almost like lubricants.... And it left an oily shine on my skin, like it wasn&#x27;t really absorbed at all.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the worst part....  I can handle weird texture and shine....&lt;br /&gt;But after a few hours my skin started itching every time I move!!!  You know that feeling when your skin is super dry?&lt;br /&gt;Like when u bend over and the skin on your back got stretched and it itches?  Or like when you reach to one side with the opposite arm and your shoulder starts itching?  I thought I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on, so I applied like a quarter of the bottle the next day, still didn&#x27;t help.  I used up the whole bottle in less than a week and my skin was feeling more miserable than ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying its a terrible product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin...  Maybe it had something to do with my skin type, or certain ingredients in the lotion, I don&#x27;t know. But it seems to be working well with some people.&lt;br /&gt;So if u never tried it, just but a small bottle to see how it works with your skin...</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this a three if it didn&#x27;t burn my legs so much after a shave (and not right after). There is some sort of alcohol in it that if you don&#x27;t wait at least a day after shaving it burns. Also, it is a little milky, so I don&#x27;t feel like I get much of hydrating feeling. I do however like the ingredients that it is natural (minus the alcohol), and I&#x27;m a big fan of the aromatheraphy smell. I can&#x27;t say that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> lotion works good on my very dry sking and the smell is devine, stays with you and like others say, clings to your clothes.</li>
            <li> This is a strange combination of patchouli and lime.  My husband really likes it.  I don&#x27;t much, but this is entirely subjective.  I love patchouli...</li>
            <li> Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion. Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on. Try this and you will see the difference, moist skin at last. (note some dry skin is an allergy). (this is a tough scent, not for everyone)</li>
            <li> I love this smell and good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used any of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products before but after I read all of the favorable reviews I bought and I am so glad I did.  I like the constancy of the lotion.  It has a light feel to the skin and absorbs quickly.  Within a few days I noticed my skin was soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is lovely and I have gotten compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body lotion can also be used as a hair smoother.  I have long hair and find that two drops is all I need to control fly-away and frizzy hair.  The lotion leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I did not like was the container the top was loose when I had received and the lotion leaked into the plastic bag that surrounded the container.  I lost approximately two tablespoons of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a Patchouli lover! With the added lime and gentle fragrance of the Patchouli, a little of this lotion goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my first time with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  After a lot of reading I settled on this lotion first.  It is just as billed and something I know I&#x27;ll reorder again and again.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or thick.  The scent is a bit weird at first but quickly disappears to a light Patchouli smell. I actually love it.</li>
