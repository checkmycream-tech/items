            <li>so just okay</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It comes with so many sizes.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Most of the nails don&#x27;t fit my nails.</li>
            <li>You can reshape them rather easy and they aren&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li>They come in separate individually numbered bags for each size, and the shape of them is fantastic - a pointy oval shape that looks really great on.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my fingers at all.</li>
            <li>TOOK AN EXACT WEEK TO GET HERE!!</li>
            <li>Super easy to put on, paint + file if you need too.</li>
            <li>they are long but strong and stay on good...</li>
            <li>though I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a great product, but some nails are shorter than others not really noticeable though.</li>
            <li>It was easy to take nails off after 7 days and it held pretty well.  </li>
            <li>They need a little shaping but otherwise excellent for the price I paid and got here fast</li>
            <li>but I still gave a five star rating because the nails are high quality and come in so many sizes</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sure to find a nail that matches each one of your natural nails.</li>
            <li>They came about two weeks early too. :)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping I received in about a week!</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>they stay on great with the help of a little nail glue!  </li>
            <li>I love these nails, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Omg it is exactly what I wanted and got shipped</li>
            <li>LOVE these nails- came with 10 different sizes-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fake nail girl ...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I just received mine several weeks early they look nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these nails, the style now is the long and oval shape ive been looking for this type of nails for a while.</li>
            <li>I have long nail beds that are moderately slim and MOST of these nails DON&#x27;T fit me.  </li>
            <li>Came sorted by size, which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Sooo fast..</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they do not have a natural curve, so be sure that the nail is properly glued on by applying pressure to all points.</li>
            <li>They are quite long, but easy to trim and file.</li>
            <li>super super fast like 3 weeks before the due date.</li>
            <li>Which is honestly the only bummer about these nails being that I like long nails.</li>
            <li>lasted 2 weeks with proper prep (clean cuticles, gentle buffing, nail dehydrator, high quality nail glue</li>
            <li>But they still look fantastic and I&#x27;ll still purchase from the for a long time!</li>
            <li>it gets more and more difficult to find oval nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall pleased with my purchase and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you have flat or wide nail beds, there might be 2 sizes that can fit you--if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to use some for fake teeth (like for Halloween and cosplay) and they&#x27;re pretty great for that.</li>
            <li>But I also live in AZ and its 110 out.</li>
            <li>extra long, great for creating all shapes such as almond, round, ballerina, square etc.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>They have a natural colored hue and are oval shaped.</li>
            <li>Much faster than last time</li>
            <li>As far as the nails you might as well buy the Kiss nails from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I gave them to my 9 year old to make art projects with.</li>
            <li>I mean, most of the nails they send you, and they send A LOT,  are pinky sizes.   </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>so they arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>DURABLE, sharp edges stay sharp and true, do not bend even when kept</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re long (major pro for me!!)</li>
            <li>I received these a lil early,, they are sorta small,, but you do get a whole lot,,</li>

            <li> I received these a lil early,, they are sorta small,, but you do get a whole lot,,</li>
            <li> These are thick white oval medium length nails of high quality material.</li>
            <li> The expected delivery was mid April</li>
            <li> They are also fairly long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for longer presson nails for a long time.</li>
            <li> but they are almost too long for me</li>
            <li> is crap otherwise good product</li>
            <li> They come in Ten different sizes (0-9) and they were all individually packaged by size in small Ziploc baggies.</li>
            <li> so you will likely need/want to cut down or shape</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t use that because none of the thumbnails that means they&#x27;re made for small people apparently</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s])&lt;br /&gt;- holds polish, though I suggest a gentle buff to take off shine of false nail&lt;</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting a high quality false nail to wear or practice nail art on then these are the ones for you.</li>
            <li> I have very narrow tiny nails</li>
            <li> and I usually have to file down the rest of my nails to get them in line with the middle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice that one number is slightly shorter than the rest.</li>
            <li> So natural, of course, I always file artificial nails down so they aren&#x27;t real long.</li>
            <li> They come in little plastic bags and mine also came with a little tube of nail glue.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need somewhat narrow nails</li>
            <li> I have small fingers though.</li>
            <li> However, I actually haven&#x27;t wore them as fake nails yet, so I can&#x27;t tell you how they hold up in that aspect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these types of nails and this seller has them.</li>
            <li> I got these to paint for a friend who wears false nails, and she loves them.</li>
            <li> they are not curved and look so fake.</li>
            <li> Waaaayy too small and really fake looking even for artificial nails!</li>
            <li> These are  just poor quality period!</li>
            <li> Used them 2 make fake</li>
            <li> Disappointed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the nail was made terribly, it almost looks like it has two ends...</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting a high quality false nail to wear or practice nail art on then these are the ones for you. Shipping speed was a litter slower than what I liked but I still gave a five star rating because the nails are high quality and come in so many sizes you&#x27;re sure to find a nail that matches each one of your natural nails. These are thick white oval medium length nails of high quality material. I would recommend them to anyone in need of press on nails!</li>
            <li> I love these nails, especially for the price! Super easy to put on, paint + file if you need too.</li>
            <li> I love these nails.  My hands look so much better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nails, the style now is the long and oval shape ive been looking for this type of nails for a while. i, so happy with these i will b ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Me and my sisters think that these are wonderful!! I&#x27;m going to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> The best nails I have found yet. So natural, of course, I always file artificial nails down so they aren&#x27;t real long. They look great.</li>
            <li> So many nails, all sizes, just as pictured! Bought them for my niece who&#x27;s learning nail design. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Good shape, good size. I got these to paint for a friend who wears false nails, and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I just got my order and I am in love with these nails. Omg it is exactly what I wanted and got shipped super super fast like 3 weeks before the due date. This is a aahmaaziiinggg!! Definitely would recommend this seller. It&#x27;s hard to find these types of nails and this seller has them.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li> it gets more and more difficult to find oval nails. These are the perfect length and shape and an excellent value</li>
            <li> Loveee these , &amp; recieved very quick! (:</li>
            <li> the nail was made terribly, it almost looks like it has two ends...</li>
            <li> These are great full cover nails. They come in separate individually numbered bags for each size, and the shape of them is fantastic - a pointy oval shape that looks really great on. Delivery was quick and packaging was great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m happy with the product but I couldn&#x27;t use that because none of the thumbnails that means they&#x27;re made for small people apparently</li>
            <li> Always love these! My go to. I&#x27;ve purchased many from them being that I love to do my own nails and they are best ones I&#x27;ve purchased get. I do have the shape them some but only to get them to my desired shape. Still great as is though! I&#x27;ve notice that one number is slightly shorter than the rest. I believe it&#x27;s five. That one fits my middle finger and I usually have to file down the rest of my nails to get them in line with the middle. Which is honestly the only bummer about these nails being that I like long nails. But they still look fantastic and I&#x27;ll still purchase from the for a long time! 😊</li>
            <li> Came sorted by size, which was very helpful. They are quite long, but easy to trim and file.</li>
            <li> I received these a lil early,, they are sorta small,, but you do get a whole lot,,</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping I received in about a week! But the glue exploded! It covered my hands when I opened the package. But I also live in AZ and its 110 out. Wish they could put the glue on a seperate bag. Nails seem sturdy but haven&#x27;t tried. For the price. Its unbeatable. Just watch out for the glue!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my fingers at all. Disappointed... none of them did. I have small fingers though.</li>
            <li> LOVE these nails- came with 10 different sizes- they stay on great with the help of a little nail glue!  They&#x27;re awesome and I love being able to color them and file them as desired!</li>
            <li> I placed my order on March 8  2015 and received them today, March 21. The expected delivery was mid April so they arrived much sooner than expected. They shipped from the UK and were delivered via Air mail by royal air. They come in Ten different sizes (0-9) and they were all individually packaged by size in small Ziploc baggies. They have a natural colored hue and are oval shaped. Glue is included. I&#x27;m overall pleased with my purchase and will definitely order again.  UPDATE: Ordered 2nd set on 5/18/15 and received on 5/27/15. Sooo fast.. Much faster than last time</li>
            <li> Im sending back not the 1&#x27;s imblooking 4, im looking 4 the plus curve nails, these r gud but not the 1&#x27;s I like</li>
            <li> These were perfect nails. They need a little shaping but otherwise excellent for the price I paid and got here fast</li>
            <li> You can wear them polished or unpolished they come in a variety of sizes so your size will be there.</li>
            <li> Glue it comes with is crap otherwise good product</li>
            <li> So I had to change my review after actually using them. Most of the nails don&#x27;t fit my nails. If you have flat or wide nail beds, there might be 2 sizes that can fit you--if you&#x27;re lucky. I have long nail beds that are moderately slim and MOST of these nails DON&#x27;T fit me.  The glue is really good. It was easy to take nails off after 7 days and it held pretty well.  As far as the nails you might as well buy the Kiss nails from the drugstore. I mean, most of the nails they send you, and they send A LOT,  are pinky sizes.   These otherwise would be perfect if they fit normal sized nails.</li>
            <li> Great nails u can color them. The glue dosen&#x27;t work that good though I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a great product, but some nails are shorter than others not really noticeable though. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice nails. Great sizes and all numbered in nine dif bags. I have very narrow tiny nails so these look great and very feminine. They came about two weeks early too. :)</li>
            <li> TOOK AN EXACT WEEK TO GET HERE!! I LOVE THESE NAILS!! GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I had expected. So I am pleased to use these nails as &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; for my nail art! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I cant use them at all. they are not curved and look so fake. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not what I&#x27;m looking for. ...so just okay</li>
            <li> Love them. It comes with so many sizes. I&#x27;m actually going to use some for fake teeth (like for Halloween and cosplay) and they&#x27;re pretty great for that. You can reshape them rather easy and they aren&#x27;t flimsy. They are also fairly long. However, I actually haven&#x27;t wore them as fake nails yet, so I can&#x27;t tell you how they hold up in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I love them they are long but strong and stay on good...</li>
            <li> Waaaayy too small and really fake looking even for artificial nails! Couldn&#x27;t use any of them. I gave them to my 9 year old to make art projects with. These are  just poor quality period! Don&#x27;t waist your time or money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for longer presson nails for a long time. These are absolutely perfect and the quantity is amazing for the price. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this . Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> A lot of nails for an awesome price! Lots of sizes! Good buy but it helped me figure out I&#x27;m not a fake nail girl ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several full-nail glue-on nails. Drug store brands, &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brands at Cosmoprof and now these. I am VERY pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- extra long, great for creating all shapes such as almond, round, ballerina, square etc.&lt;br /&gt;- DURABLE, sharp edges stay sharp and true, do not bend even when kept long&lt;br /&gt;- lasted 2 weeks with proper prep (clean cuticles, gentle buffing, nail dehydrator, high quality nail glue [mine is from Sally&#x27;s])&lt;br /&gt;- holds polish, though I suggest a gentle buff to take off shine of false nail&lt;br /&gt;- 500 nails for $4!!!! That&#x27;s a year a awesome nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- you&#x27;ll need somewhat narrow nails (guess I&#x27;m lucky)&lt;br /&gt;- they&#x27;re long (major pro for me!!) so you will likely need/want to cut down or shape&lt;br /&gt;- they do not have a natural curve, so be sure that the nail is properly glued on by applying pressure to all points. If done correctly, you&#x27;ll have have a curve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall VERY happy!</li>
            <li> Bunch of sizes and look great for the price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> They were whiter than I wanted.  Used them 2 make fake Zombie teeth - worked well...</li>
            <li> I just received mine several weeks early they look nice. Were supossed to come July 27th and they came yesterday.  They come organized by size 0-9. They come in little plastic bags and mine also came with a little tube of nail glue. I havent used mine yet i am waiting to use them for a concert in August. Ordered a finger stand so i can paint them and design them to my liking (not from same seller).</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful, elegant, and well made nails.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping! Product is as shown</li>
            <li> I like the nails but they are almost too long for me</li>
