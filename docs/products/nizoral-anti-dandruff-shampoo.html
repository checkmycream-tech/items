            <li>Nizoral ad shampoo is a great shampoo.</li>

            <li>Since then I have been using it all the time and think it works great.</li>
            <li>Nitzoral has worked great for me for a couple of years now, but with the shortage I looked for another alternative, and I think I found one.</li>

            <li>Great transaction A+++++++++++</li>
            <li>This shampoo has proven very effective in reducing fungal infection that generates dandruff.</li>
            <li>If you have a fungal infection of the scalp, this is a very effective product to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look very nice, too.</li>
            <li>It is a thicker consistency and while it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful, it smells much better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>Good product, great service</li>
            <li>happened to see this shampoo on another site and heard good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good product and received packaging in good conditon.</li>
            <li>Reviewers say it is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is bit costly but a good one.</li>
            <li>The one star is for the price not the product the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fairly reliable.  </li>
            <li>i did get any benefit from it still i suffer from dandruff, so i can&#x27;t say its good</li>
            <li>I also received relief to my itchy scalp, so I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>So glad!</li>
            <li>more embarrassing flakes!</li>
            <li>This just dries out your hair even more!</li>
            <li>It truly works for hair loss amazing.</li>
            <li>In just 3 days of using this amazing product my dandruff is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that Nizoral is available at Amazon and immediately ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>it had AMAZING reviews</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too...didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li>How is Nizoral different/more effective?</li>
            <li>Its really effective on dandruff even with just 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but does not keep my scalp from itching which I thought it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>is a good shampoo, so far it does what it says it does, I use with rogane and they work perfect together</li>
            <li>When it was no longer stocked in the stores, we had tried Neutrogena and Head and Shoulders, but those products didn&#x27;t work as effectively as Nizoral.  </li>
            <li>Nizoral over the counter is not as effective as prescription strength, but it still helps when alternated with Neutrogena T/Gel.</li>
            <li>Did not find this product effective.</li>
            <li>Great smell and rich lather.</li>
            <li>No, it didn&#x27;t make me fabulously rich nor irresistibly attractive.  </li>
            <li>I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look at three I used and explain their differences with the most effective shampoo first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>in all honestly, I find much better results with Coal Tar products that can be purchased at your neighborhood superstore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was delighted to find this product available on line--saves making an appointment with the doctor and then a trip to the pharmacy,</li>
            <li>By far one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li>I know results can vary with individuals, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo if you have dandruff, it really works good.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because on the very first use the shampoo was soothing to my scalp and not to mention the fragrance was a pleasant one unlike medicine.  </li>
            <li>i choose this rating because i recieved the correct item , it was exactly what i wanted,the price was great.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>It works very well for dandruff and great for hair loss.</li>
            <li>I have also read that keto causes sexual side effects.</li>
            <li>I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li>Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still hoping Nitzoral is made again because I&#x27;ve really enjoyed their product.</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more as soon as this bottle runs out.....</li>
            <li>I have looked all over for this shampoo and don&#x27;t seem to know why it is no longer on the stores, but anyway, I shop at Amazon all the time and was able to find it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Firt time used Nizoral about 10 or more years ago in Europe.</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t control itching as stated, my scalp itched more than before I used it.</li>
            <li>Most of my dandruff and itching concerns seem to have come about after discontinuing long-term antibiotic therapy.  </li>
            <li>My one star is more for the price from this seller.</li>
            <li>I researched and tried so many things.</li>
            <li>I just made sure to keep it from her eyes, since it is not truly meant for babies.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon but some things just don&#x27;t make any sense at all.</li>
            <li>It works for dandraft more than i thought it would be&lt;</li>
            <li>Helps keep my hair from coming out more.</li>
            <li>Time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li>Tried many over the counter anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo worked okay for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is better that anything on the market.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed Cosmetologist, so I have access to many products.</li>
            <li>cause all of my scalp problems were gone :).</li>
            <li>Your better off just putting vaseline on your scalp.</li>
            <li>it for many years...</li>
            <li>I got Nizoral 2% about two months ago, used at most 1/4 tsp.</li>
            <li>Wish it was cheaper, but this product seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>It works like magic, Plus guys</li>
            <li>i used it for my infant&#x27;s cradle cap and it made the condition better with continued use.</li>
            <li>I tried many anti-dandruff products.  </li>
            <li>So pleased.</li>
            <li>His hair even looked better.</li>
            <li>This product has changed my life for the better</li>
            <li>I can confidently wear my hair in any style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and it has made a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I contacted CS to be sure this item was indeed \\&quot;new\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am glad i found it here.</li>
            <li>Glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and great value for money</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too and not medicinal like some others.</li>
            <li>fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, makes a nice lather and really does stop flaking.</li>
            <li>I was glad when it was finally available again</li>
            <li>Great stuff for your hair - makes it soft and improves your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have used other dandruff shampoos and I like this best of all.</li>
            <li>product itself is great, it is just that McNeil has apparently stopped making it</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for two weeks and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Smell is fine too.  </li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>I used many dandruff shampoos in the past and this one could be rated as the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    </li>
            <li>Just after a 3 or 4 uses I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%).</li>
            <li>The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis</li>
            <li>I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>As of August 2013, Nizoral is once again available through mainstream outlets.</li>
            <li>This is great for scalp issues such as seborreic dermatitis, etc.</li>
            <li>you should know that Ketaconazol has ANTI-ANDROGENIC EFFECT, which is great if it is use topically to decrease hair fall,</li>
            <li>By the end of the week I am flake free.</li>
            <li>Somewhat effective on my stubborn bodybuilders acne on my shoulders and back, effective on the scalp, too.</li>
            <li>felt the price was higher than I am use to paying!!  </li>
            <li>It cleared out the scalp pretty well and hopefully in the coming weeks it will get even better.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Nizoral is pretty close to the magical medicine I was looking for to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>It works, keeps your shoulder clean.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Pretty good so far</li>
            <li>I recomend Triplus shampoo the most, it really works.</li>
            <li>I feel like the reviews made this out to be a truely miracle shampoo..</li>
            <li>This Nizoral didn&#x27;t seem to help much, but it was better than Selsun.</li>
            <li>Doesnt smell nearly as good as Nizoral, but works the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t even care about the implications of that an antifungal worked when other antidandruff stuff didnt work.</li>
            <li>It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole</li>
            <li>May you be as lucky as the rest of us.</li>
            <li>Also, quick advice I wish I&#x27;d known before.</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo is adequate for mild dandruff, but my case was too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This worked surprisingly quick after just a couple of shampoos.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent but I wish it had a slightly better aroma.</li>
            <li>I have used Nizoral for several years and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have tried many normal off-the-shelf shampoos, and this one is by far doing a much better job.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works this quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>great part is that I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers well, and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair like some of the coal tar treatments do.</li>
            <li>Triplus shampoo works wonders, even better than nizoral without side effects because it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Surprised this stuff does not get more hype.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>I think a good practice of changing products every few months as I researched would be wise, but I am really enjoying the present time of a clear non-itching scalp.</li>
            <li>The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews it has for hair loss are true.</li>
            <li>Other than that, product seems to work good.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons that I had to use Amazon is that there is a supply problem right now from the factory being moved</li>
            <li>my esthetician is very smart and has helped me get my skin under control.</li>
            <li>I just found the OTC nizoral and have seen great results after the first shampoo,I have thick natural aa hair and have not had any flaking or scaling, so far so good.</li>
            <li>this is the best shampoo for dry scalp, dandruff or other skin issues with the scalp...</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Great product that can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    </li>
            <li>Many of the reviews I have read say the same results are obtained from either.</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference after first application.  </li>
            <li>After the first bout with Nizoral, her cradle cap was almost gone.  </li>
            <li>It took only one more dose to get it cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I heard so much hype about this stuff I had to try it!</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li>you have access to a journal database via a medical library, you can locate many research studies demonstrating the DHT blocking capabilities of ketoconazole.  </li>
            <li>This means that not only is this product okay for hair</li>
            <li>In two wks, for the first time in 15yrs, flakes were no longer falling.</li>
            <li>this really works!</li>
            <li>It was gone after the first treatment using Nizoral.</li>
            <li>I recently ran out however and came here to buy more.</li>
            <li>when I know exactly what I need anyway.  </li>
            <li>After the first use my dandruff problem is reduced by 90%.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this exact product in a 7.0z bottle for around $20.  </li>
            <li>At first I used it 4-5 showers in a row, and I saw a difference after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>let it sit for a few minutes and rinse use a good conditioner .</li>
            <li>I have moderate dandruff, this product definitely worked on my scalp and also has pleasant smell not like some medicated dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li>, it probably is a myth or only works under certain conditions but would love to hear if that has grown hair for others.</li>
            <li>It also works great with conditioner, and I could not really notice a difference between using this and my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and have been and still quite pleased that it really does control my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some positive reviews for Nizoral and decided to scour the stores for it</li>
            <li>Took some time (3-4 weeks) but my dandruff is pretty much done.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this for the first time and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much before I knew if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great product, but hard to find!</li>
            <li>This blue pearly shampoo is gentle enough for such young and tender skin, and it worked beautifully!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo also leaves your hair super soft and silky.    </li>
            <li>I wish that it stayed in stock more, but I think that they produce it in limited runs.</li>
            <li>Works great as a weekly shampoo for someone who has a small amount of flaking or everyday for more severe flaking.</li>
            <li>That said, this stuff works great and is the only shampoo I know of with this particular active ingredient</li>
            <li>Its not as pleasing as the scent of shampoos like Pantene but for a medical product it is all fine.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dandRuff and have a hard time finding a good shampoo</li>
            <li>though I am not going to try this on myself (not yet anyway), there are numerous ketaconazole shampoos available at reasonable cost for dogs.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see it available again, at least online.  </li>
            <li>On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helped keep it all in check while I was there.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink like the tar based shampoos, smells pretty normal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a shampoo that might or might not work</li>
            <li>After 2-3 uses my lifelong dandruff is gone, for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to reorder and will try the 1%.</li>
            <li>When it eventually comes back, I perform this routine again and am TV free for another 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li>Took about two weeks before it too really work.</li>
            <li>2 100ML bottles (about 7 oz total) for $24 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I had been using Head and Shoulders and while that helped immediately after use, the benefits were very short-lived.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t scrub it on to her, but gently swiped the bubbles from her head onto her face.  </li>
            <li>But using this stuff 2-3 times a week really helped.</li>
            <li>dont have much to say</li>
            <li>I felt like some shampoos I tried helped reduce dandruff, but I couldn&#x27;t really get rid of it.</li>
            <li>as much for this stuff.</li>
            <li>Overseas the product is still available for one fourth the price they are asking!</li>
            <li>Nizoral really does work.  </li>
            <li>Would like the 7oz botl next time if still available</li>
            <li>About 2yrs ago it became very scarce</li>
            <li>in all, there&#x27;s a reason this product gets high reviews, and that is because nothing else compares!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>After trying head and shoulders, denorex, T-Gel, tea tree oil, and virtually every other type of scalp treatment available in the drug store without any success, I was ready to schedule an appointment with the dermatologist to discover what was causing my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Use more than you think you need to create a rich, thick lather, then let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes while you shave your legs or just soak in the shower.  </li>
            <li>About 1.5 years ago I did more research to see what other products are offered.  </li>
            <li>Upon doing additional research I found that it may help re-grow  hair on the familiar male pattern baldness area.   </li>
            <li>Works better than any other dandruff shampoo on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I tried so many other things.(wasting money).</li>
            <li>I had tried many other products for dandruff, Head &amp; Shoulders,T-Gel..etc.</li>
            <li>I get significant itching and flaking twice a year when the weather changes, and Nizoral has the problem totally solved within 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li>But it did what so many other anti-dandruff products couldn&#x27;t ...</li>
            <li>It is strong and it doesn&#x27;t dry out you hair.</li>
            <li>Very effective on fungal infection and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Selsun Blue (the medicated one) worked in ONE treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product mainly to control scaling and itching.  </li>
            <li>Price is way too high for one bottle.  </li>
            <li>The old, original yellow formula.</li>
            <li>I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    </li>
            <li>This is great stuff, but, unless you&#x27;re unable to get a prescription, don&#x27;t buy the name brand.</li>
            <li>can say that my dandruff has completely disappeared and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch much at all now.</li>
            <li>The bottle labels clearly state it is for animal use only - but your doctor may know if it is safe for human use.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much all the anti dandruff shampoo and Nizoral is the only one that works.</li>
            <li>This shampoo uses zinc pyrithione which heals the scalp and reduces sebum production to normal levels.</li>
            <li>My wife normally does all the shopping</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use it every shampoo, fortunately, after the first few times, and it keeps the itching under control.</li>
            <li>cost is a little higher, but think of the cost of seeing a skin doc.. Or getting a prescription!It s worth spending 10-15$!</li>
            <li>AND IT WILL MOST LIKELY GET RID OF THE FLAKES AND DRY SCALP.</li>
            <li>I used it two different times in the shower, and my scalp healed right up, making the eczema disappear.  </li>
            <li>You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually).</li>
            <li>Further, I can use only a tab (sz of a fingernail), and it suds up far, far better than Tgel.</li>
            <li>Its blue-silver-colored creamy 1% formula is silkier to the touch, lightly scented and soaks the scalp in ways the red-orange or other syrupy alternative formulas cannot match.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The info on the web site did not ID the product as being from New Zealand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without Nizoral.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know if what I bought was new or used.</li>
            <li>what really helped my dry scalp eventually and permanently was using sulfate/paraben free shampoo and condish, tea tree lavender, rosemary and lemon essential oils, and supplementing with borage and vitamin e and omegas.</li>
            <li>The reasons Nizoral 1% ketoconazole - is still preferred EVEN over the always available (by prescription only) 2% generic ketoconazole -</li>
            <li>It normally works within the first use, especially for itching.</li>
            <li>Major plus, this shampoo lathers very well</li>
            <li>and so beware that you may be purchasing very old stock.</li>
            <li>It smells like the anti-itch animal shampoo we used for our dog and was very very watery.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the blue bottle US version of Nizoral.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, the itching was gone and the second time using the shampoo, the dandruff was gone as well.  </li>
            <li>My hair started falling out more than the usual rate.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash daily or every other day.</li>
            <li>This is the only anti-dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;m not allergic to and that consistently and reliably works.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from dandruff since middle school (when I first started having acne and oily skin).</li>
            <li>As usual, I had another satisfying experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nizoral has an active ingredient unique to this shampoo called Ketoconazole.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a dermatologist and I need help.</li>
            <li>They usually also contain an anti bacterial agent (chlorhexidine)and are effective on various canine skin conditions including fungal ones.</li>
            <li>In fact, I expect to have to use it again at least once to twice more in the very near term to keep the situation in check.  </li>
            <li>As long as you are careful, Nizoral is an amazing cure for cradle cap and minor eczema break outs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive and it&#x27;s only a 4 oz bottle, but I just add it to my shampoo, and it works great.</li>
            <li>The only reason I dont give the 5 stars is because nizoral ad is still a very srong shampoo and it has side effects (nervousness and dificulty breathing).</li>
            <li>Luckly I discovered a shampoo that works like nizoral for hair loss but can be used frequently</li>
            <li>It appears that McNeil has stopped producing this product and what is being sold is old stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently trying to find out how much Ketoconazole is in this product so I can compare it to Nitzoral (which is 1% non-prescription).</li>
            <li>Symptoms completely gone after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an old remedy.</li>
            <li>Made it soft but fuzzy.</li>
            <li>After using this one time, my dandruff was nearly gone.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that really worked.  </li>
            <li>Also reduces redness/flaking near my side burns.</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]].</li>
            <li>Can not always find this locally and REALLY need it.  </li>
            <li>She loves the Nizoral shampoo so far.  </li>
            <li>This completely got rid of my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on Amazon havong it and was plesantly surprised that they did.  </li>
            <li>I was just surprised at that price, the condition of the packaging.</li>
            <li>After just one treatment I am back to normal life again!</li>
            <li>I had recently started to get a dry scalp along with itching and flaking and was looking for something that could give me a quick solve.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient, ketoconazole, has been shown to block DHT and, hence, reduce male pattern hair loss.  </li>
            <li>Since the substance is less jelly-like than the regular products, be careful when using, it comes out of the bottle very easily.</li>
            <li>I used to have very minimal dandruff but after using this for around 5 times, my entire head is full of dandruff.</li>
            <li>It makes my other half wash his hair more often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried different dandruff shampoos that would temporarily work and because my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>Older children get a similar case, but is actually dandruff!)  </li>
            <li>The price is high, but one bottle will fix your problem versus long time use of head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen it available for at least two years now.</li>
            <li>The only problem now is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to get it anywhere locally</li>
            <li>Used Selsum Blue, Head &amp; Shoulder, natural shampoos with tea tree oil...</li>
            <li>The Kroger near me is almost always low or out of stock</li>
            <li>Was getting really worried hoping it wasn&#x27;t folliculitis, but I read several articles and posts from people with similar skin issues and several swore on this product.</li>
            <li>So far, it does control flaking, scaling and itching very well, and I also have less dandruff than before.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is more expensive because of its active ingredient Ketoconazole, but believe me; the price is worth getting rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Two to three such applications is enough to completely eradicate my TV and keep it gone for 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair with a tiny bit of regular shampoo and rinse it out quickly, then I find I only need a little of the nizoral, and I leave it in my hair for 3 - 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many other options, but plain and simple, it works, period.</li>
            <li>so I wasted my money trying everything else first.  </li>
            <li>Coal tar shampoos like Neutragena T-Gel or others such as Head &amp; Shoulders are just so much money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have loosely coiled &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; hair and wear it naturally.</li>
            <li>Still not restocked in NYC in 2014 and the real reason is the FDA learned that this product although helps control dandruff flakes of the scalp and face, and relieves the itch factor also at the same time helps promote less hair loss in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good product, great service</li>
            <li> happened to see this shampoo on another site and heard good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good product and received packaging in good conditon.</li>
            <li> Reviewers say it is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is bit costly but a good one.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the price not the product the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fairly reliable.  </li>
            <li> i did get any benefit from it still i suffer from dandruff, so i can&#x27;t say its good</li>

            <li> But this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that Nizoral is available at Amazon and immediately ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> it had AMAZING reviews</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice too...didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> How is Nizoral different/more effective?</li>
            <li> Its really effective on dandruff even with just 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but does not keep my scalp from itching which I thought it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> is a good shampoo, so far it does what it says it does, I use with rogane and they work perfect together</li>
            <li> When it was no longer stocked in the stores, we had tried Neutrogena and Head and Shoulders, but those products didn&#x27;t work as effectively as Nizoral.  </li>
            <li> Nizoral over the counter is not as effective as prescription strength, but it still helps when alternated with Neutrogena T/Gel.</li>
            <li> Did not find this product effective.</li>
            <li> Great smell and rich lather.</li>
            <li> No, it didn&#x27;t make me fabulously rich nor irresistibly attractive.  </li>
            <li> I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look at three I used and explain their differences with the most effective shampoo first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> in all honestly, I find much better results with Coal Tar products that can be purchased at your neighborhood superstore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was delighted to find this product available on line--saves making an appointment with the doctor and then a trip to the pharmacy,</li>
            <li> By far one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I know results can vary with individuals, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo if you have dandruff, it really works good.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because on the very first use the shampoo was soothing to my scalp and not to mention the fragrance was a pleasant one unlike medicine.  </li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i recieved the correct item , it was exactly what i wanted,the price was great.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> It works very well for dandruff and great for hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have also read that keto causes sexual side effects.</li>
            <li> I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still hoping Nitzoral is made again because I&#x27;ve really enjoyed their product.</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more as soon as this bottle runs out.....</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for this shampoo and don&#x27;t seem to know why it is no longer on the stores, but anyway, I shop at Amazon all the time and was able to find it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Firt time used Nizoral about 10 or more years ago in Europe.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t control itching as stated, my scalp itched more than before I used it.</li>
            <li> Most of my dandruff and itching concerns seem to have come about after discontinuing long-term antibiotic therapy.  </li>
            <li> My one star is more for the price from this seller.</li>
            <li> I researched and tried so many things.</li>
            <li> I just made sure to keep it from her eyes, since it is not truly meant for babies.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon but some things just don&#x27;t make any sense at all.</li>
            <li> It works for dandraft more than i thought it would be&lt;</li>
            <li> Helps keep my hair from coming out more.</li>
            <li> Time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li> Tried many over the counter anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo worked okay for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is better that anything on the market.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist, so I have access to many products.</li>
            <li> cause all of my scalp problems were gone :).</li>
            <li> Your better off just putting vaseline on your scalp.</li>
            <li> it for many years...</li>
            <li> I got Nizoral 2% about two months ago, used at most 1/4 tsp.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper, but this product seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> It works like magic, Plus guys</li>
            <li> i used it for my infant&#x27;s cradle cap and it made the condition better with continued use.</li>
            <li> I tried many anti-dandruff products.  </li>
            <li> So pleased.</li>
            <li> His hair even looked better.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life for the better</li>
            <li> I can confidently wear my hair in any style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and it has made a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I contacted CS to be sure this item was indeed \\&quot;new\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am glad i found it here.</li>
            <li> Glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great value for money</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good too and not medicinal like some others.</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, makes a nice lather and really does stop flaking.</li>
            <li> I was glad when it was finally available again</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your hair - makes it soft and improves your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used other dandruff shampoos and I like this best of all.</li>
            <li> product itself is great, it is just that McNeil has apparently stopped making it</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for two weeks and it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Smell is fine too.  </li>
            <li> It was fine.</li>
            <li> I used many dandruff shampoos in the past and this one could be rated as the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    </li>
            <li> Just after a 3 or 4 uses I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%).</li>
            <li> The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis</li>
            <li> I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> As of August 2013, Nizoral is once again available through mainstream outlets.</li>
            <li> This is great for scalp issues such as seborreic dermatitis, etc.</li>
            <li> you should know that Ketaconazol has ANTI-ANDROGENIC EFFECT, which is great if it is use topically to decrease hair fall,</li>
            <li> By the end of the week I am flake free.</li>
            <li> Somewhat effective on my stubborn bodybuilders acne on my shoulders and back, effective on the scalp, too.</li>
            <li> felt the price was higher than I am use to paying!!  </li>
            <li> It cleared out the scalp pretty well and hopefully in the coming weeks it will get even better.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Nizoral is pretty close to the magical medicine I was looking for to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> well worth it!</li>
            <li> It works, keeps your shoulder clean.</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far</li>
            <li> I recomend Triplus shampoo the most, it really works.</li>
            <li> I feel like the reviews made this out to be a truely miracle shampoo..</li>
            <li> This Nizoral didn&#x27;t seem to help much, but it was better than Selsun.</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell nearly as good as Nizoral, but works the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t even care about the implications of that an antifungal worked when other antidandruff stuff didnt work.</li>
            <li> It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole</li>
            <li> May you be as lucky as the rest of us.</li>
            <li> Also, quick advice I wish I&#x27;d known before.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo is adequate for mild dandruff, but my case was too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This worked surprisingly quick after just a couple of shampoos.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent but I wish it had a slightly better aroma.</li>
            <li> I have used Nizoral for several years and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have tried many normal off-the-shelf shampoos, and this one is by far doing a much better job.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works this quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li> great part is that I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It smells great, lathers well, and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair like some of the coal tar treatments do.</li>
            <li> Triplus shampoo works wonders, even better than nizoral without side effects because it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Surprised this stuff does not get more hype.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li> I think a good practice of changing products every few months as I researched would be wise, but I am really enjoying the present time of a clear non-itching scalp.</li>
            <li> The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews it has for hair loss are true.</li>
            <li> Other than that, product seems to work good.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons that I had to use Amazon is that there is a supply problem right now from the factory being moved</li>
            <li> my esthetician is very smart and has helped me get my skin under control.</li>
            <li> I just found the OTC nizoral and have seen great results after the first shampoo,I have thick natural aa hair and have not had any flaking or scaling, so far so good.</li>
            <li> this is the best shampoo for dry scalp, dandruff or other skin issues with the scalp...</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great product that can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews I have read say the same results are obtained from either.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after first application.  </li>
            <li> After the first bout with Nizoral, her cradle cap was almost gone.  </li>
            <li> It took only one more dose to get it cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I heard so much hype about this stuff I had to try it!</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> you have access to a journal database via a medical library, you can locate many research studies demonstrating the DHT blocking capabilities of ketoconazole.  </li>
            <li> This means that not only is this product okay for hair</li>
            <li> In two wks, for the first time in 15yrs, flakes were no longer falling.</li>
            <li> this really works!</li>
            <li> It was gone after the first treatment using Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out however and came here to buy more.</li>
            <li> when I know exactly what I need anyway.  </li>
            <li> After the first use my dandruff problem is reduced by 90%.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this exact product in a 7.0z bottle for around $20.  </li>
            <li> At first I used it 4-5 showers in a row, and I saw a difference after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> let it sit for a few minutes and rinse use a good conditioner .</li>
            <li> I have moderate dandruff, this product definitely worked on my scalp and also has pleasant smell not like some medicated dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li> , it probably is a myth or only works under certain conditions but would love to hear if that has grown hair for others.</li>
            <li> It also works great with conditioner, and I could not really notice a difference between using this and my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have been and still quite pleased that it really does control my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some positive reviews for Nizoral and decided to scour the stores for it</li>
            <li> Took some time (3-4 weeks) but my dandruff is pretty much done.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this for the first time and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much before I knew if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great product, but hard to find!</li>
            <li> This blue pearly shampoo is gentle enough for such young and tender skin, and it worked beautifully!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo also leaves your hair super soft and silky.    </li>
            <li> I wish that it stayed in stock more, but I think that they produce it in limited runs.</li>
            <li> Works great as a weekly shampoo for someone who has a small amount of flaking or everyday for more severe flaking.</li>
            <li> That said, this stuff works great and is the only shampoo I know of with this particular active ingredient</li>
            <li> Its not as pleasing as the scent of shampoos like Pantene but for a medical product it is all fine.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dandRuff and have a hard time finding a good shampoo</li>
            <li> though I am not going to try this on myself (not yet anyway), there are numerous ketaconazole shampoos available at reasonable cost for dogs.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see it available again, at least online.  </li>
            <li> On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped keep it all in check while I was there.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink like the tar based shampoos, smells pretty normal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a shampoo that might or might not work</li>
            <li> After 2-3 uses my lifelong dandruff is gone, for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to reorder and will try the 1%.</li>
            <li> When it eventually comes back, I perform this routine again and am TV free for another 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> Took about two weeks before it too really work.</li>
            <li> 2 100ML bottles (about 7 oz total) for $24 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I had been using Head and Shoulders and while that helped immediately after use, the benefits were very short-lived.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t scrub it on to her, but gently swiped the bubbles from her head onto her face.  </li>
            <li> But using this stuff 2-3 times a week really helped.</li>
            <li> dont have much to say</li>
            <li> I felt like some shampoos I tried helped reduce dandruff, but I couldn&#x27;t really get rid of it.</li>
            <li> as much for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Overseas the product is still available for one fourth the price they are asking!</li>
            <li> Nizoral really does work.  </li>
            <li> Would like the 7oz botl next time if still available</li>
            <li> About 2yrs ago it became very scarce</li>
            <li> in all, there&#x27;s a reason this product gets high reviews, and that is because nothing else compares!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> After trying head and shoulders, denorex, T-Gel, tea tree oil, and virtually every other type of scalp treatment available in the drug store without any success, I was ready to schedule an appointment with the dermatologist to discover what was causing my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Use more than you think you need to create a rich, thick lather, then let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes while you shave your legs or just soak in the shower.  </li>
            <li> About 1.5 years ago I did more research to see what other products are offered.  </li>
            <li> Upon doing additional research I found that it may help re-grow  hair on the familiar male pattern baldness area.   </li>
            <li> Works better than any other dandruff shampoo on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tried so many other things.(wasting money).</li>
            <li> I had tried many other products for dandruff, Head &amp; Shoulders,T-Gel..etc.</li>
            <li> I get significant itching and flaking twice a year when the weather changes, and Nizoral has the problem totally solved within 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> But it did what so many other anti-dandruff products couldn&#x27;t ...</li>
            <li> It is strong and it doesn&#x27;t dry out you hair.</li>
            <li> Very effective on fungal infection and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Luckily, Selsun Blue (the medicated one) worked in ONE treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product mainly to control scaling and itching.  </li>
            <li> Price is way too high for one bottle.  </li>
            <li> The old, original yellow formula.</li>
            <li> I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    </li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but, unless you&#x27;re unable to get a prescription, don&#x27;t buy the name brand.</li>
            <li> can say that my dandruff has completely disappeared and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch much at all now.</li>
            <li> The bottle labels clearly state it is for animal use only - but your doctor may know if it is safe for human use.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much all the anti dandruff shampoo and Nizoral is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo uses zinc pyrithione which heals the scalp and reduces sebum production to normal levels.</li>
            <li> My wife normally does all the shopping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use it every shampoo, fortunately, after the first few times, and it keeps the itching under control.</li>
            <li> cost is a little higher, but think of the cost of seeing a skin doc.. Or getting a prescription!It s worth spending 10-15$!</li>
            <li> AND IT WILL MOST LIKELY GET RID OF THE FLAKES AND DRY SCALP.</li>
            <li> I used it two different times in the shower, and my scalp healed right up, making the eczema disappear.  </li>
            <li> You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually).</li>
            <li> Further, I can use only a tab (sz of a fingernail), and it suds up far, far better than Tgel.</li>
            <li> Its blue-silver-colored creamy 1% formula is silkier to the touch, lightly scented and soaks the scalp in ways the red-orange or other syrupy alternative formulas cannot match.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The info on the web site did not ID the product as being from New Zealand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know if what I bought was new or used.</li>
            <li> what really helped my dry scalp eventually and permanently was using sulfate/paraben free shampoo and condish, tea tree lavender, rosemary and lemon essential oils, and supplementing with borage and vitamin e and omegas.</li>
            <li> The reasons Nizoral 1% ketoconazole - is still preferred EVEN over the always available (by prescription only) 2% generic ketoconazole -</li>
            <li> It normally works within the first use, especially for itching.</li>
            <li> Major plus, this shampoo lathers very well</li>
            <li> and so beware that you may be purchasing very old stock.</li>
            <li> It smells like the anti-itch animal shampoo we used for our dog and was very very watery.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the blue bottle US version of Nizoral.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo, the itching was gone and the second time using the shampoo, the dandruff was gone as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair started falling out more than the usual rate.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;m not allergic to and that consistently and reliably works.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff since middle school (when I first started having acne and oily skin).</li>
            <li> As usual, I had another satisfying experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nizoral has an active ingredient unique to this shampoo called Ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a dermatologist and I need help.</li>
            <li> They usually also contain an anti bacterial agent (chlorhexidine)and are effective on various canine skin conditions including fungal ones.</li>
            <li> In fact, I expect to have to use it again at least once to twice more in the very near term to keep the situation in check.  </li>
            <li> As long as you are careful, Nizoral is an amazing cure for cradle cap and minor eczema break outs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive and it&#x27;s only a 4 oz bottle, but I just add it to my shampoo, and it works great.</li>
            <li> The only reason I dont give the 5 stars is because nizoral ad is still a very srong shampoo and it has side effects (nervousness and dificulty breathing).</li>
            <li> Luckly I discovered a shampoo that works like nizoral for hair loss but can be used frequently</li>
            <li> It appears that McNeil has stopped producing this product and what is being sold is old stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying to find out how much Ketoconazole is in this product so I can compare it to Nitzoral (which is 1% non-prescription).</li>
            <li> Symptoms completely gone after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an old remedy.</li>
            <li> Made it soft but fuzzy.</li>
            <li> After using this one time, my dandruff was nearly gone.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that really worked.  </li>
            <li> Also reduces redness/flaking near my side burns.</li>
            <li> Be sure to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]].</li>
            <li> Can not always find this locally and REALLY need it.  </li>
            <li> She loves the Nizoral shampoo so far.  </li>
            <li> This completely got rid of my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance on Amazon havong it and was plesantly surprised that they did.  </li>
            <li> I was just surprised at that price, the condition of the packaging.</li>
            <li> After just one treatment I am back to normal life again!</li>
            <li> I had recently started to get a dry scalp along with itching and flaking and was looking for something that could give me a quick solve.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient, ketoconazole, has been shown to block DHT and, hence, reduce male pattern hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Since the substance is less jelly-like than the regular products, be careful when using, it comes out of the bottle very easily.</li>
            <li> I used to have very minimal dandruff but after using this for around 5 times, my entire head is full of dandruff.</li>
            <li> It makes my other half wash his hair more often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried different dandruff shampoos that would temporarily work and because my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> Older children get a similar case, but is actually dandruff!)  </li>
            <li> The price is high, but one bottle will fix your problem versus long time use of head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it available for at least two years now.</li>
            <li> The only problem now is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to get it anywhere locally</li>
            <li> Used Selsum Blue, Head &amp; Shoulder, natural shampoos with tea tree oil...</li>
            <li> The Kroger near me is almost always low or out of stock</li>
            <li> Was getting really worried hoping it wasn&#x27;t folliculitis, but I read several articles and posts from people with similar skin issues and several swore on this product.</li>
            <li> So far, it does control flaking, scaling and itching very well, and I also have less dandruff than before.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is more expensive because of its active ingredient Ketoconazole, but believe me; the price is worth getting rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Two to three such applications is enough to completely eradicate my TV and keep it gone for 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair with a tiny bit of regular shampoo and rinse it out quickly, then I find I only need a little of the nizoral, and I leave it in my hair for 3 - 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many other options, but plain and simple, it works, period.</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money trying everything else first.  </li>
            <li> Coal tar shampoos like Neutragena T-Gel or others such as Head &amp; Shoulders are just so much money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have loosely coiled &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; hair and wear it naturally.</li>
            <li> Still not restocked in NYC in 2014 and the real reason is the FDA learned that this product although helps control dandruff flakes of the scalp and face, and relieves the itch factor also at the same time helps promote less hair loss in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the past five years, Nizoral has only been available via a \\&quot;black</li>
            <li> She said she normally pays less that $15 for 4oz.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every product at my local drug store, and have even tried all natural one with tea tree and other things in it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After using it about twice per week after a few weeks my neck is back to normal and no itchiness/inflammation or any breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of my dry, itchy, flaky scalp &amp; this is the only thing that finally got rid of it.</li>
            <li> it works well and causes no apparent harm.</li>
            <li> However, the box that the actual bottle of shampoo came in was really crushed &amp; there was scotch tape holding the box together in several different places.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to give an opinion.  </li>
            <li> the product and the first 2 time&#x27;s I only noticed a little less dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sellers have been asking for mind-boggling amounts of money for bottles of the original, \\&quot;gold-standard,\\&quot; Belgium-made-formula - taking advantage of buyers upset over the horrific red tape issues involving manufacturing standards associated with its makers, McNeil, Inc. in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania - and with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  </li>
            <li> (the eczema makes my skin/scalp extra dry and flaky).  </li>
            <li> Only thing that tackles the dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but a little bit expensive!</li>
            <li> You may experience slight irritation the first few times you use it, but your skin will adjust.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said they called the 800 number on back of the bottle and was told that the product is in short supply due to manufacturing issue</li>
            <li> My experience is you have to alternate shampoos with different active ingredients to keep your scalp in check.  </li>
            <li> It itches, leaves your hair greasy, makes it hard to use any type of hair product and is very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I found I can get it for $9.00 $20.00 way to much money fill your pockets with someone else hard earn</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend dowsing the ends of your hair in this stuff if you have long hair like me.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time also because it doesn&#x27;t have to be used often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was just one of a long list of products I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of my dandruff problem.  </li>
            <li> I have also used the prescription strength (2%) version and found that it gave me a strange flushing reaction that I did not get from the 1%, although both products controlled my scalp infection.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use my skin remained red, although scalp scaling decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I tried other dandruff shampoos but this is the only thing that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff my entire life and have always tried to control it with all other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> This created endless shortages and massive \\&quot;hoarding behavior\\&quot; throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money trying other products, I finally found Nizoral and will never buy another product.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering with Seborrheic dermatitis for 15 years and have had mixed results with other brands using different active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I Had severe flaking for years and tried almost every dry scalp/dandruff product out there.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t dry it out like some others do.</li>
            <li> However, I experienced the worst side effect possible.</li>
            <li> During the winter time, my scalp gets dry, flakey, &amp; itchy.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel (coal tar) and salicylic acid are WAY TOO HARSH and should only be used as a last resort, or to treat scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try because the American (blue bottle) version was not available for a time.</li>
            <li> active ingredient in Nizoral is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying my problems have been cured by a single use.  </li>
            <li> The doctors may be right, that the underlying fungal infection is \\&quot;incurable \\&quot;, but this is close enough for me.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that got rid of my dry scalp!!!!</li>
            <li> Hence, you use less, likely evening out the cost/oz issue.   </li>
            <li> It means no more daily checking at eBay or at other sites to buy this product at a cost equal to dinner at a five-star Parisian restaurant.  </li>
            <li> If it makes your scalp dry - it has not in my case - use it every other time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> but give it a shot if you avoid black shirts due to your scalp condition (or the skin between your eyebrows, which for me, at last, no longer flakes).  </li>
            <li> I am going back to head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner which gives short term relief at least.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a problem with a fungal problem on my scalp that the doctor said can periodically come back.</li>
            <li> but, for whatever reason, every store&#x27;s shelves were empty.  </li>
            <li> Every person is different but this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I want to say that I am both an ACNE and DANDRUFF survivor and let me tell you it&#x27;s ROUGH.</li>
            <li> Others might be curious.</li>
            <li> When I noticed that my scalp was pink and my hair was thinning, and I was considering Rogaine, I found Nizoral shampoo.</li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer pink and irritated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that, or it&#x27;s just not as noticible, because my scalp isn&#x27;t pink anymore.</li>
            <li> Doctor after doctor has told me there&#x27;s not much help for it.</li>
            <li> I even tried the pink Nizoral and still got flakes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months with absolutely no reduction in dandruff flakes.</li>
            <li> etiology or cause of dandruff, considered the mildest form of seborrhea dermatitis, is not certain.</li>
            <li> This effect is very different from suggestions that other dandruff shampoos reduce hair loss by removing dead skin cells or improving blood flow to the scalp.</li>
            <li> dandruff was so bad you could see a visible line of dry skin around my hair line on my forehead - super embarrassing!</li>
            <li> If it does not work for you, probably that means your dandruff is caused by other factors (see a doctor).  </li>
            <li> I usually buy several bottles at the drug store and had just run out of my supply (lasted about 4 months).  </li>
            <li> No more big dandruff flakes!</li>
            <li> Stopped my extremely itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Also, it relieves the itchiness of the scalp due to dryness caused by Minoxidil solution.</li>
            <li> It works when other shampoos do not.</li>
            <li> I used it every other shampoo for about 2 weeks &amp; then realized I no longer needed to use it</li>
            <li> I gave him the other one and</li>
            <li> have tried other products like Regenepure DR</li>
            <li> it was due to change in manufacturing location.</li>
            <li> Had to switch from this to Regene due to the SLS in the product, which I didn&#x27;t realize it had.  </li>
            <li> USE IT EVERY OTHER DAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause that burning sensation on my scalp that other brands cause.  </li>
            <li> I tried every other over-the-counter product there was, but it was always a catch 22; if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair daily, it would itch like crazy, but the daily washing only further dried my scalp.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient is selenium sulfide which decreases yeast levels on the scalp.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hair starts getting dry, buy a conditioner that heavily moisturizes.ay.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hair starts getting dry, buy a conditioner that heavily moisturizes.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this product cleared up my scalp from scaling and itching within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Check with a doctor first, as chlorhexidine can be very irritating to skin and eyes, etc.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores as its pricey....</li>
            <li> and I just use a small amount, so it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have an occasional dandruff problem which is usually cured in a few days with Scalpicin.</li>
            <li> Icky as it is, dandruff is caused by different kinds of infections/inflammations caused by varying fungi and yeasts.</li>
            <li> For 3-4 months I could not find any locally so I was forced to buy online at a substantial markup.</li>
            <li> Finally I tried Nizoral at the recommendation of my friend and my dandruff problems are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> Then relocated to US and tried some other heavily advertized solutions, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> My pediatrician suggested this Nizoral shampoo to get rid of my baby&#x27;s cradle cap (the common yellow, greasy, patchy, waxy crust little ones get.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling bad dandruff chronically and was using various &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; shampoos from Head &amp; Shoulders, Neutrogena and Pantene, but this one really did the trick</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened, a product that was less than $10 and now around $80</li>
            <li> I hate scented products since I&#x27;m sensitive, but I really like the non-medicated smell.</li>
            <li> Less yeast ---&gt; less irritated skin ---&gt; less dandruff.</li>
            <li> Studies have proven Ketoconazole also provides slight increases in hair density and growth.</li>
            <li> She had previously been using a coal tar shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought two because it was significantly less than purchasing in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For at least 15 years before discovering nizoral, I had been dealing with an itchy, dry, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> Both coal tar and salicylic acid made my hair extremely rough, tough, and dry.</li>
            <li> It also took care of her baby acne on her chubby little cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not just a little case of dandruff either.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but</li>
            <li> It was my entire head, very thick, and could be see by everyone even if they weren&#x27;t looking closely</li>
            <li> It cost just a few cents.</li>
            <li> Yikes, maybe I am missing something</li>
            <li> it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> Ketoconazole is a synthetic anti-fungal ingredient that kills fungi and yeasts by destroying their cell membranes.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use my dandruff was virtually gone.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday -</li>
            <li> I have tired everything out there and Nizoral is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times though, now I just use it once a week, and I have had ZERO dandruff.</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I fork over an exorbitant amount for a small bottle -- which still lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually with stronger mix, it can be used less often.    </li>
            <li> Im absolutely not paying these kinds of ridiculous prices for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> smell bad, really gentle with my hair!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also very silky/creamy and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> My dandruff and itching have not completely disappeared yet, however, they have significantly decreased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything else on the market, letting my hair soak in apple cider viniger, even putting raw eggs in there</li>
            <li> My scalp stinks like 4 day old hair (yuck)!</li>
            <li> I tried every shampoo and rinse, with very little or no effect.</li>
            <li> but it works without excessive drying.</li>
            <li> BUT NO MORE.</li>
            <li> usual</li>
            <li> I have used Nizoral OTC twice a week for 15 plus years and it controls dandruff well - if your dandruff is caused by a fungal agent this usually works.  </li>
            <li> No more pain to your wallet,</li>
            <li> no more paying through your nose to get Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use small amounts and getting satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> During the Colder months I usually get dandruff</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders would make it worse and all of the other brands</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s hard to find, so I ordered from amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist &amp; was hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Anyway, persistent dandruff sucks so</li>
            <li> Just leave it on your scalp for at least 10 minutes while you shower.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product as a facial cleanser when my allergies get really crazy.</li>
            <li> I even tried cutting my hair short and using lotion.</li>
            <li> At least it did nothing to help me.  </li>
            <li> What does this mean to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flake no more!  </li>
            <li> Bottle is very small</li>
            <li> Literally right after I wash my hair, it stinks!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> It was $8 in the Philippines, $40 is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I did not have anything bad in terms of flaking or itching, but it definitely did the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from bad dandruff all my life and nizoral was the only thing that ever worked.</li>
            <li> As if having dandruff wasn&#x27;t bad enough.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money to stop a very annoying problem.</li>
            <li> shampoo is expense - very expensive - and it&#x27;s getting harder</li>
            <li> but I hate that there is Blue #40 or some shizz like that.</li>
            <li> but it just dries up your face and makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not proud to have dandruff.</li>
            <li> Zinc pyrithione (Head &amp; Shoulders) is nearly useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> a bit expensive</li>
            <li> But I went off of the reviews, having found Tgel, Selson, etc all to fail at stopping the snowstorm off my scalp.  </li>
            <li> father is white with terrible dandruff (on going not just seasonal).</li>
            <li> Unable to buy in store at this time.</li>
            <li> However, the price for a 4oz bottle is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I got really dry scalp when I was overseas, the water was terrible.  </li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s hard not to feel CRAZY as in ugly :(.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is being crazy and my scalp is being crazy</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dandruff.</li>
            <li> The price is absurd!</li>
            <li> , once again, its IMPOSSIBLE to find online, expect here and thE bay.</li>
            <li> My neighbor, who has a bad dandruff problem,  swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> My family has a history of bad uncontrollable dandruff,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not working :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad skin condition in my scalp</li>
            <li> During that time my dandruff got so awful</li>
            <li> Literally used it twice and 6 months of terrible, snowstorm-</li>
            <li> My daughter and husband had terrible dandruff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product that works. Be sure to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> My doctor wrote me a prescription for the generic shampoo and, with my insurance prescription coverage, it cost me about a dime. I&#x27;m not kidding. It cost just a few cents. This is great stuff, but, unless you&#x27;re unable to get a prescription, don&#x27;t buy the name brand.</li>
            <li> Nizoral ad shampoo is a great shampoo. It works very well for dandruff and great for hair loss. The positive reviews it has for hair loss are true. People who sufer hair loss must use nizoral ad. It normalises the scalp. The only reason I dont give the 5 stars is because nizoral ad is still a very srong shampoo and it has side effects (nervousness and dificulty breathing). I have also read that keto causes sexual side effects. This is way I use it every 10 days and have no problem. Luckly I discovered a shampoo that works like nizoral for hair loss but can be used frequently and it is Triplus shampoo.Triplus shampoo works wonders, even better than nizoral without side effects because it is 100% natural. You can purchase here in amazon. It normalizes the scalp, works great for dandruff and a must for hair loss. It truly works for hair loss amazing. I recomend Triplus shampoo the most, it really works.</li>
            <li> I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff. Here are the results:    I tried both Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% (OTC) &amp; Nizoral/Ketoconazole 2% (Prescription). Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%). The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair. The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis (it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    Neutrogena T-Gel (coal tar) and salicylic acid are WAY TOO HARSH and should only be used as a last resort, or to treat scalp psoriasis. You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually). Both coal tar and salicylic acid made my hair extremely rough, tough, and dry. All the conditioner in the world made no difference. I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    Zinc pyrithione (Head &amp; Shoulders) is nearly useless. It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    RECOMMENDATION: I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced. I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole but it works without excessive drying. On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li> I got really dry scalp when I was overseas, the water was terrible.  This shampoo really helped keep it all in check while I was there.  It doesn&#x27;t stink like the tar based shampoos, smells pretty normal.</li>
            <li> Only ant dandruff shampoo that has worked. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried other dandruff shampoos but this is the only thing that worked for me.  My scalp was so itchy and I had dandruff.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a shampoo that might or might not work so I wasted my money trying everything else first.  The first time I used this shampoo, the itching was gone and the second time using the shampoo, the dandruff was gone as well.  Now I only have to use this once and a while, maybe monthly if that, and I just use a small amount, so it has lasted a long time.  Well worth the money to stop a very annoying problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but a little bit expensive!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a problem with a fungal problem on my scalp that the doctor said can periodically come back. After having this problem I wanted to see if there was a cream with ketaconazole in it that I could get over the counter in case the problem came back and a Pharmecist showed me the Nizoral A-D 1% shampoo that I could get over the counter. Since then I have been using it all the time and think it works great. The only problem now is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to get it anywhere locally so it looks like I am going to have to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems using this shampoo (hair loss, discoloration etc.)  My dandruff and itching have not completely disappeared yet, however, they have significantly decreased.  I do also alternate with the apple cidar vinegar treatment 3 x week.</li>
            <li> Flaking, scaling and itching. These symptoms have been gone in 3-5 days. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff my entire life and have always tried to control it with all other products on the market.  About 1.5 years ago I did more research to see what other products are offered.  I noticed some positive reviews for Nizoral and decided to scour the stores for it but, for whatever reason, every store&#x27;s shelves were empty.  Anyway, I finally got my hands on some through Amazon and gave it a try.  After 2-3 uses my lifelong dandruff is gone, for the most part.  I, for some reason, sometimes get some dandruff if I happen to drink beer 2-3 nights in-a-row, but one use of Nizoral keeps dandruff at bay for months.  If you have dandruff I recommend you give it a try.  I&#x27;m still on the same bottle after 1.5 years and I have not even used a quarter of the bottle.</li>
            <li> So, I sent it back and was charged a re-stock fee.&lt;br /&gt;The info on the web site did not ID the product as being from New Zealand.</li>
            <li> I fought dandruff for years with no solution in sight. Itching and flaking. BUT NO MORE. Through a recommendation by a friend I was turned on to Nizoral. I ordered the 2% about a year ago and use it only once per week. I don&#x27;t know how but I ordered without a prescription. It seems a prescription is needed for the 2% now. I am ready to reorder and will try the 1%. Many of the reviews I have read say the same results are obtained from either. But if you have suffered with dandruff and can&#x27;t get rid of it, try this. May you be as lucky as the rest of us.</li>
            <li> Here you can get the 4-oz bottle for $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7-oz bottle is selling at a Walmart for about $15.  I just picked up one on  May 13, 2012, in Rosemead, California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled \\&quot;Nizoral AD\\&quot; five minutes ago.  I got over a dozen hits, stores selling the 7-oz bottle for between $15 to $18.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times through the last 15 years to treat my tinea versicolor.  While in the shower, I simply \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; my skin in the affected areas.  Use more than you think you need to create a rich, thick lather, then let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes while you shave your legs or just soak in the shower.  Then simply rinse it off.  Two to three such applications is enough to completely eradicate my TV and keep it gone for 3-4 years.  No kidding!  When it eventually comes back, I perform this routine again and am TV free for another 3-4 years.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works this quickly and effectively.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> It seems to work.  I haven&#x27;t had an outbread since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I use it only twice a week.</li>
            <li> Great product that can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is the US version of the product and that it may be expired by the time you get it.  Mine was expired on the day that I received it (09/2011).  It appears that McNeil has stopped producing this product and what is being sold is old stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great, it is just that McNeil has apparently stopped making it and so beware that you may be purchasing very old stock.</li>
            <li> Nitzoral has worked great for me for a couple of years now, but with the shortage I looked for another alternative, and I think I found one. It&#x27;s called RegenePure DR. It says on their website that it has Ketoconazole in it&#x27;s ingredients, so I think I&#x27;m going to try it. Plus a 9oz bottle is only $25 compared to over $50 for a 7oz bottle from some of the jerks selling it on Amazon. I&#x27;m currently trying to find out how much Ketoconazole is in this product so I can compare it to Nitzoral (which is 1% non-prescription). When I get my bottle of RegenePure DR, I&#x27;ll update this review to say how well it works. I&#x27;m still hoping Nitzoral is made again because I&#x27;ve really enjoyed their product. Here is RegenePure&#x27;s website.    [....]</li>
            <li> In just 3 days of using this amazing product my dandruff is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, really gentle with my hair!</li>
            <li> I been suffering with dandruff for years. Nothing seemed to work for me. Bought tar soap to selsium blue Etc. But this stuff is amazing. Took about two weeks before it too really work. Now I only use once a week.</li>
            <li> Surprised this stuff does not get more hype.  I Had severe flaking for years and tried almost every dry scalp/dandruff product out there.  This is the only thing that worked and it works like a charm.  Noticeable difference after first application.  Symptoms completely gone after a couple of days.  This stuff is this shizzle.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Dandruff Shampoo that would help out for the last 10 years. Head &amp; Shoulders would make it worse and all of the other brands the same.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to see this shampoo on another site and heard good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;As usual I was skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the product and the first 2 time&#x27;s I only noticed a little less dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stay with it as the directions said two to three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2-3 weeks and I&#x27;m now Dandruff free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is that this stuff works and I will be ordering more as soon as this bottle runs out.....it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for this shampoo and don&#x27;t seem to know why it is no longer on the stores, but anyway, I shop at Amazon all the time and was able to find it.  It is a good product and received packaging in good conditon.</li>
            <li> I have used Nizoral OTC twice a week for 15 plus years and it controls dandruff well - if your dandruff is caused by a fungal agent this usually works.  If it does not work for you, probably that means your dandruff is caused by other factors (see a doctor).  I usually buy several bottles at the drug store and had just run out of my supply (lasted about 4 months).  All the stores are out of supply and don&#x27;t know when they will get it in - J&amp;J has messed up yet again.  I just ordered the 2% version from a UK pharmacy thru amazon.  2 100ML bottles (about 7 oz total) for $24 with free shipping. Reviewers say it is good stuff.  Once I try it, I will update this review.  Usually with stronger mix, it can be used less often.    I also have a dog and though I am not going to try this on myself (not yet anyway), there are numerous ketaconazole shampoos available at reasonable cost for dogs.  They usually also contain an anti bacterial agent (chlorhexidine)and are effective on various canine skin conditions including fungal ones. Check with a doctor first, as chlorhexidine can be very irritating to skin and eyes, etc. The bottle labels clearly state it is for animal use only - but your doctor may know if it is safe for human use.</li>
            <li> Nizoral A-D Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything else. Firt time used Nizoral about 10 or more years ago in Europe. Then relocated to US and tried some other heavily advertized solutions, none of them worked. I was happy to find that Nizoral is available at Amazon and immediately ordered a bottle. After just one treatment I am back to normal life again!</li>
            <li> I used to have very minimal dandruff but after using this for around 5 times, my entire head is full of dandruff. Also, it didn&#x27;t control itching as stated, my scalp itched more than before I used it.</li>
            <li> Very effective on fungal infection and a little goes a long way. It smells really nice too...didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0000Y3CRY Nizoral A-D Shampoo - 4 oz]]  Most of my dandruff and itching concerns seem to have come about after discontinuing long-term antibiotic therapy.  The result has left me battling scalp issues for weeks.  The product arrived on a day when I seemed to be experiencing a lot of itching and discomfort.  I had been using Head and Shoulders and while that helped immediately after use, the benefits were very short-lived.  After one use of Nizoral 1%, I noticed immediate improvement.  I&#x27;m not saying my problems have been cured by a single use.  In fact, I expect to have to use it again at least once to twice more in the very near term to keep the situation in check.  However, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I had recently started to get a dry scalp along with itching and flaking and was looking for something that could give me a quick solve. I did some research and found Nizoral- it had AMAZING reviews so I made the purchase. Just after a 3 or 4 uses I notice a huge difference. I did not have anything bad in terms of flaking or itching, but it definitely did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great part is that I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. I use it about 2 times a week and it keeps any itching or flaking at bay. The price is high, but one bottle will fix your problem versus long time use of head and shoulders. It also works great with conditioner, and I could not really notice a difference between using this and my regular shampoo. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My one star is more for the price from this seller. Go to walmart and spend about 1/3 of this price. Yikes, maybe I am missing something but this is gouging customers.</li>
            <li> My experience is you have to alternate shampoos with different active ingredients to keep your scalp in check.  That said, this stuff works great and is the only shampoo I know of with this particular active ingredient so it&#x27;s different than selson, head and shoulders, etc.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any difference in the amount of dandruff at all. I went through the entire bottle used as directed and there was 0 change. Every person is different but this was a waste of money for me. Luckily, Selsun Blue (the medicated one) worked in ONE treatment.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad skin condition in my scalp and if I do not use Nizoral it moves to my face, I have found that this product works great. One of the reasons that I had to use Amazon is that there is a supply problem right now from the factory being moved and I can not find Nizoral in any store. I looked there is none out there except Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used both the prescription strength and OTC recently for a skin problem.  It works.    Upon doing additional research I found that it may help re-grow  hair on the familiar male pattern baldness area.   After about a month on the prescription strength I have noticed  a difference in this area as well.  Following the directions I leave it on  for about 5 minutes before rinsing off.  Using it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much all the anti dandruff shampoo and Nizoral is the only one that works.I can&#x27;t live without Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from bad dandruff all my life and nizoral was the only thing that ever worked. Then they stopped making it. I haven&#x27;t seen it available for at least two years now. During that time my dandruff got so awful it was even in my eyebrows. I researched and tried so many things. One thing worked : Listerine. The old, original yellow formula. Out of desperation I tried it and after two days noticed a difference. Within a week my dandruff was gone. Google it, it&#x27;s an old remedy. Anyway, persistent dandruff sucks so I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> My pediatrician suggested this Nizoral shampoo to get rid of my baby&#x27;s cradle cap (the common yellow, greasy, patchy, waxy crust little ones get.  It may be fungal or overactive oil glands.  Older children get a similar case, but is actually dandruff!)  This blue pearly shampoo is gentle enough for such young and tender skin, and it worked beautifully!  It also took care of her baby acne on her chubby little cheeks.  I didn&#x27;t scrub it on to her, but gently swiped the bubbles from her head onto her face.  I just made sure to keep it from her eyes, since it is not truly meant for babies. After the first bout with Nizoral, her cradle cap was almost gone.  It took only one more dose to get it cleared up.  Same with her cheeks!  I also used it for myself when my seasonal allegry of eczema got in my hair line.  I would usually only get affected on my eyebrows&#x27; area (the eczema makes my skin/scalp extra dry and flaky).  I never had dandruff before, but remembered the Nizoral.  I used it two different times in the shower, and my scalp healed right up, making the eczema disappear.  This shampoo also leaves your hair super soft and silky.    As long as you are careful, Nizoral is an amazing cure for cradle cap and minor eczema break outs.</li>
            <li> * During the past five years, Nizoral has only been available via a \\&quot;black market\\&quot; of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sellers have been asking for mind-boggling amounts of money for bottles of the original, \\&quot;gold-standard,\\&quot; Belgium-made-formula - taking advantage of buyers upset over the horrific red tape issues involving manufacturing standards associated with its makers, McNeil, Inc. in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania - and with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This created endless shortages and massive \\&quot;hoarding behavior\\&quot; throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* These issues have now been resolved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What does this mean to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It means no more daily checking at eBay or at other sites to buy this product at a cost equal to dinner at a five-star Parisian restaurant.  No more pain to your wallet, no more paying through your nose to get Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Just check Amazon and/or Drugstore online and watch prices drop to under $16 for a hefty 7-ounce bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The reasons Nizoral 1% ketoconazole - is still preferred EVEN over the always available (by prescription only) 2% generic ketoconazole - are legion.  Its blue-silver-colored creamy 1% formula is silkier to the touch, lightly scented and soaks the scalp in ways the red-orange or other syrupy alternative formulas cannot match.  For thousands of people, it&#x27;s been the only thing that WORKS to treat scalp issues, which in turn created buyer desperation when it disappeared from store shelves, causing \\&quot;after-market\\&quot; prices to shoot to the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hence breathe a sigh of relief and shop around!  If you see a bottle of Nizoral at a retail store this week, don&#x27;t worry about \\&quot;stocking up\\&quot; as if you were at a Costco or a Sam&#x27;s Club preparing for the Armageddon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has proven very effective in reducing fungal infection that generates dandruff.</li>
            <li> Somewhat effective on my stubborn bodybuilders acne on my shoulders and back, effective on the scalp, too.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great seller.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far but I hate that there is Blue #40 or some shizz like that. I don&#x27;t need blue shampoo. Other than that, product seems to work good. I don&#x27;t recommend dowsing the ends of your hair in this stuff if you have long hair like me. Made it soft but fuzzy. Overall it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened, a product that was less than $10 and now around $80 but it is a bit like extortion or price gouging to me. Seem to be cheaper products from 3rd world countries out there but I have enough problems with my scalp to take chances. Use small amounts and getting satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> I just found the OTC nizoral and have seen great results after the first shampoo,I have thick natural aa hair and have not had any flaking or scaling, so far so good.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended it. It works perfectly. The best A-D Shampoo compared to HS and Herbal Shampoos. It is bit costly but a good one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works better than any other dandruff shampoo on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the trick after one week. Wish it were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great smell and rich lather.</li>
            <li> I heard so much hype about this stuff I had to try it! I brought this years ago from Walmart. Im an African American woman just so you know. it dried my hair out. I tried so many other things.(wasting money). A friend told me dont put it on your hair just massage it in your scalp let it sit for a few minutes and rinse use a good conditioner . my scalp loves it. No more big dandruff flakes!</li>
            <li> Took some time (3-4 weeks) but my dandruff is pretty much done. I&#x27;ve tried everything else on the market, letting my hair soak in apple cider viniger, even putting raw eggs in there; whatever suggestions the internet had I probably did it). Used Selsum Blue, Head &amp; Shoulder, natural shampoos with tea tree oil... Nizoral was the only one that showed results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dandruff was so bad you could see a visible line of dry skin around my hair line on my forehead - super embarrassing! But using this stuff 2-3 times a week really helped. So glad!</li>
            <li> This item ($22.99 / 4oz) is sold at CVS for $18.99 / 7oz. SAME STRENGTH.........!!! You have to be careful. I love Amazon but some things just don&#x27;t make any sense at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple weeks ago and have used it twice. This stuff is miraculous. I have had prescriptions from dermatologist that didn&#x27;t work, and have tried every possible over the counter product. After using this one time, my dandruff was nearly gone. Not just a little case of dandruff either. It was my entire head, very thick, and could be see by everyone even if they weren&#x27;t looking closely</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job fr me.</li>
            <li> I hate scented products since I&#x27;m sensitive, but I really like the non-medicated smell. The product is creamy and I do not feel the need to scratch my heat after shampooing with Nizoral. Great travel size!</li>
            <li> It works for dandraft more than i thought it would be&lt;br /&gt;I dont have much to say but i like it</li>
            <li> Good shampoo if you have dandruff, it really works good.  Just leave it on your scalp for at least 10 minutes while you shower.</li>
            <li> It works, keeps your shoulder clean. a bit expensive but it works</li>
            <li> Works for me. I have moderate dandruff, this product definitely worked on my scalp and also has pleasant smell not like some medicated dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li> Helps keep my hair from coming out more. It don&#x27;t dry it out like some others do.Time will tell for sure.</li>
            <li> Tried many over the counter anti-dandruff shampoos.  This is the only one that really worked.  Smells pretty good too and not medicinal like some others.</li>
            <li> Stopped my extremely itchy scalp.  Also reduces redness/flaking near my side burns.</li>
            <li> It stopped the flaking. This is what it said it would do. I could tell the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for two weeks and it seems to be working fine. It cleared out the scalp pretty well and hopefully in the coming weeks it will get even better. If it makes your scalp dry - it has not in my case - use it every other time you wash your hair. Some people do it every day and I definitely do not recommend doing that, with this shampoo or with something else.    The shampoo scent itself is bearable. Its not as pleasing as the scent of shampoos like Pantene but for a medical product it is all fine. The only thing I did not like is the price, and of course, even the 7 oz. bottle is pretty small. The shampoo itself can make a lot of foam. Since the substance is less jelly-like than the regular products, be careful when using, it comes out of the bottle very easily.</li>
            <li> As of August 2013, Nizoral is once again available through mainstream outlets. The main ingredient, ketoconazole, has been shown to block DHT and, hence, reduce male pattern hair loss.  I wrote to the company to get their opinion and they generically refuse to comment saying the product is not FDA approved for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have access to a journal database via a medical library, you can locate many research studies demonstrating the DHT blocking capabilities of ketoconazole.  This effect is very different from suggestions that other dandruff shampoos reduce hair loss by removing dead skin cells or improving blood flow to the scalp.</li>
            <li> NOTE: I just got this product and have not tried it yet - I will update when I try it! BUT! I want to say that I am both an ACNE and DANDRUFF survivor and let me tell you it&#x27;s ROUGH. Since my skin is being crazy and my scalp is being crazy well it&#x27;s hard not to feel CRAZY as in ugly :(. However! I go to a kick a$$ acne clinic and my esthetician actually said that some dandruff shampoo&#x27;s can be used to treat a skin condition similar to acne that I have on my face. This means that not only is this product okay for hair (it sounds like it - guess I&#x27;ll see) but she actually suggested I use this on my forehead for my skin condition AND it&#x27;s also won&#x27;t break me out. If you deal with acne you KNOW what a big deal that is. So if you have acne/dandruff and are wondering if this product is for you I would say yes b/c my esthetician is very smart and has helped me get my skin under control. Look for an update soon. Good luck consumers!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product as a facial cleanser when my allergies get really crazy. It is a great product, but hard to find! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week. In tandem with Rogaine, I can see that my hair grows faster then when using Rogaine alone. Also, it relieves the itchiness of the scalp due to dryness caused by Minoxidil solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, then suddenly it went off the market.  I found it here and will buy it regularly if they keep it stocked.  Makes my scalp feel well cared for.  No flakes or itching.  Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This review reflects my ongoing problem with dandruff/seborrhea dermatitis and the help of a friend who is a dermatology student at UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine. It is so stressful to have dandruff. It itches, leaves your hair greasy, makes it hard to use any type of hair product and is very embarrassing. I had problems for 2 years. I felt like some shampoos I tried helped reduce dandruff, but I couldn&#x27;t really get rid of it. Finally I tried Nizoral at the recommendation of my friend and my dandruff problems are a thing of the past! Hopefully this review will help people who have problems with dandruff. Also, quick advice I wish I&#x27;d known before. Seborrhea dermatitis does not cause hair loss, but scratching your scalp can cause hair loss. Please don&#x27;t scratch. It aggravates the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always wanted to know the causes of dandruff. Others might be curious. If you are, read the paragraph below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The etiology or cause of dandruff, considered the mildest form of seborrhea dermatitis, is not certain. It is thought Pityrosporum ovale, a lipophilic yeast of the Malassezia genus is involved with the development of dandruff, as well as overproduction of sebum (skin oil). Basically your skin is irritated by the presence of yeast on your scalp and over production of skin oils, which results in dandruff. Anti-fungal shampoos alleviate dandruff by reducing yeast on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several anti-fungal shampoos on the market. I&#x27;ll look at three I used and explain their differences with the most effective shampoo first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000Y3CRY Nizoral A-D Shampoo - 4 oz]] 10/10. Nizoral is pretty close to the magical medicine I was looking for to treat my dandruff. Seriously, this stuff works wonders. Be sure to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes. At the beginning my derm friend said 5-7 minutes. You may experience slight irritation the first few times you use it, but your skin will adjust. How is Nizoral different/more effective? Nizoral has an active ingredient unique to this shampoo called Ketoconazole. Derm friend said the makers of this shampoo treat dandruff as a yeast growth problem. Ketoconazole is a synthetic anti-fungal ingredient that kills fungi and yeasts by destroying their cell membranes. Less yeast ---&gt; less irritated skin ---&gt; less dandruff. Studies have proven Ketoconazole also provides slight increases in hair density and growth. This shampoo is more expensive because of its active ingredient Ketoconazole, but believe me; the price is worth getting rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002UD5IY8 Head &amp; Shoulders Hair Endurance for Men Pyrithione Zinc Dandruff Shampoo plus Conditioner, 23.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] 7/10. This shampoo helped reduce my dandruff, but I still had occasional flakes. If I didn&#x27;t use Head &amp; Shoulders for a wash, my hair would start to itch and I&#x27;d get flakes again. This shampoo uses zinc pyrithione which heals the scalp and reduces sebum production to normal levels. I think this shampoo is adequate for mild dandruff, but my case was too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001UGL84U Selsun Blue Medicated Maximum Strength Dandruff Shampoo, 11 Ounce]] 5/10. This shampoo worked okay for me. Active ingredient is selenium sulfide which decreases yeast levels on the scalp. After a few days of use my skin remained red, although scalp scaling decreased significantly. After a few weeks of use my dandruff was virtually gone. However, I experienced the worst side effect possible. My hair started falling out more than the usual rate. I discontinued use and my dandruff returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a cocktail of [[ASIN:B0000Y3CRY Nizoral A-D Shampoo - 4 oz]] and [[ASIN:B002UD5IY8 Head &amp; Shoulders Hair Endurance for Men Pyrithione Zinc Dandruff Shampoo plus Conditioner, 23.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] may be the best route. I personally use the two shampoos mentioned above and [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]]. Make sure you wash daily or every other day. If you&#x27;re hair starts getting dry, buy a conditioner that heavily moisturizes.ay. If you&#x27;re hair starts getting dry, buy a conditioner that heavily moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is my fault that I got ripped off.  My wife normally does all the shopping so I have no idea what items cost.  When I ordered the Nizoral it was because my wife had searched the grocery stores and pharmacies but could not find the product.  So I ordered it.  It wasn&#x27;t until it arrived that my wife questioned the purchase.  She said she normally pays less that $15 for 4oz.  Therefore, I belive I was ripped off because i paid $32.99 for 4oz. Next time I will let my wife opine on the price or stop shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I dont use this product for dandruff so I can&#x27;t comment in terms of that, but it is the only one that helps relieve my scalp itching and I have tried everything that is labeled for itchy scalp. I use it once a every week and my scalp never bothers me. (I swear I have the itchiest scalp out there.) If I don&#x27;t use this my scalp NEVER stops itching.</li>
            <li> Its really effective on dandruff even with just 2 weeks of use. I also like its fragrance.</li>
            <li> Can not always find this locally and REALLY need it.  So happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has severe psoriasis on her scalp.  She had previously been using a coal tar shampoo.  She loves the Nizoral shampoo so far.  She uses it every 3 days and says it has relieved the itching!  We looked for this product at Wal Mart and found it to be cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist a number of years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it since.  Hard to find in local stores as its pricey....but well worth the money for me.  I buy the smaller 4 oz bottles for my travel kit and the larger 7 oz bottles for the house.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is better that anything on the market. It is strong and it doesn&#x27;t dry out you hair. It works throughout the day and leaves your scalp moisturized. I recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a great anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great as a weekly shampoo for someone who has a small amount of flaking or everyday for more severe flaking. This is the best dandruff shampoo our family has ever used.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon. But I went off of the reviews, having found Tgel, Selson, etc all to fail at stopping the snowstorm off my scalp.  In two wks, for the first time in 15yrs, flakes were no longer falling. Further, I can use only a tab (sz of a fingernail), and it suds up far, far better than Tgel. Hence, you use less, likely evening out the cost/oz issue.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is just icing, as the effectiveness alone would have me spend 2x as much for this stuff. YMMV, but give it a shot if you avoid black shirts due to your scalp condition (or the skin between your eyebrows, which for me, at last, no longer flakes).  Cheers.</li>
            <li> I had tried many other products for dandruff, Head &amp; Shoulders,T-Gel..etc. &lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that has worked for me. &lt;br /&gt;No more embarrassing flakes! &lt;br /&gt;If regular dandruff shampoos arent working..Try this one! &lt;br /&gt;The cost is a little higher, but think of the cost of seeing a skin doc.. Or getting a prescription!It s worth spending 10-15$! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I suffer from dandRuff and have a hard time finding a good shampoo this didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> This works well. I had a prescription ketoconazole shampoo that worked well but this seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but does not keep my scalp from itching which I thought it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> this is the best shampoo for dry scalp, dandruff or other skin issues with the scalp... it&#x27;s also very silky/creamy and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> Works just as everyone says it does.  If you have psoriasis, eczema this shampoo keeps the flakes at bay.  Has even been diluted with water and used as a face wash.  Great product. I will never be without it again.  Lasts a long time also because it doesn&#x27;t have to be used often.</li>
            <li> Although when I walked into Wal-Greens they did not have this product in stock.  The manager said he would order me a 7oz bottle and will arrive in 2 days.  Total price $15.95</li>
            <li> My scalp isn&#x27;t itching do I&#x27;m happy with that.  Bottle is very small so i assume to use it sparingly.  Bottle says to use only 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. it works well and causes no apparent harm. It is unscented, and cleans hair well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dandruff. It works when other shampoos do not. It normally works within the first use, especially for itching.</li>
            <li> is a good shampoo, so far it does what it says it does, I use with rogane and they work perfect together</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of my dry, itchy, flaky scalp &amp; this is the only thing that finally got rid of it. I am a licensed Cosmetologist, so I have access to many products. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it! I used it every other shampoo for about 2 weeks &amp; then realized I no longer needed to use it cause all of my scalp problems were gone :). Cannot recommend this enough!</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i recieved the correct item , it was exactly what i wanted,the price was great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try because the American (blue bottle) version was not available for a time. It smells like the anti-itch animal shampoo we used for our dog and was very very watery.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the blue bottle US version of Nizoral. It is a thicker consistency and while it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful, it smells much better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was just one of a long list of products I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of my dandruff problem.  This didn&#x27;t work either.  For the record, I finally tried some dandruff shampoo from a dollar store, and put a filter on my shower head.  My problem is 90% gone.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that got rid of my dry scalp!!!!</li>
            <li> Only thing that tackles the dry scalp. Doesn&#x27;t get the love it deserves!!!</li>
            <li> I found I can get it for $9.00 $20.00 way to much money fill your pockets with someone else hard earn money.desw</li>
            <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
            <li> This just dries out your hair even more! Your better off just putting vaseline on your scalp. Its just like acne products. They say they will cure acne but it just dries up your face and makes it worse. Same thing with this!</li>
            <li> to the point where it hurt. As if having dandruff wasn&#x27;t bad enough.  I have an occasional dandruff problem which is usually cured in a few days with Scalpicin. Didn&#x27;t work this time. My neighbor, who has a bad dandruff problem,  swears by this stuff. She says it&#x27;s hard to find, so I ordered from amazon. I got the problem to go away in about three days with store brand coal tar shampoo. Nizoral may work for you, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> this really works! until it stops working.    what really helped my dry scalp eventually and permanently was using sulfate/paraben free shampoo and condish, tea tree lavender, rosemary and lemon essential oils, and supplementing with borage and vitamin e and omegas. go organic, it is the best.</li>
            <li> For at least 15 years before discovering nizoral, I had been dealing with an itchy, dry, flaky scalp. I tried every other over-the-counter product there was, but it was always a catch 22; if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair daily, it would itch like crazy, but the daily washing only further dried my scalp. When I noticed that my scalp was pink and my hair was thinning, and I was considering Rogaine, I found Nizoral shampoo. I read that as an anti-fungal it acts as an antiinflammatory, I was intrigued. Literally, one washing was all it took. No more itchy scalp. The label says wash hair every 3-4 days, which meant that I was prepared for itching, but it never came. It&#x27;s been 8 weeks with no dandruff and no itching. My scalp is no longer pink and irritated. My hair even appears to be thickening again, perhaps because I am not scratching all the time. It&#x27;s that, or it&#x27;s just not as noticible, because my scalp isn&#x27;t pink anymore. I cannot recommend Nizoral strongly enough.</li>
            <li> I feel like the reviews made this out to be a truely miracle shampoo..&lt;br /&gt;But in all honestly, I find much better results with Coal Tar products that can be purchased at your neighborhood superstore.</li>
            <li> Very good product but wanted it in larger size, 12 oz&lt;br /&gt;Use it for many years...&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates dandruff quite well</li>
            <li> I have been battling seborrheic dermatitis for over forty years. Doctor after doctor has told me there&#x27;s not much help for it. Hydrocirtisone creams and sprays would keep the red, flaky patches on various spots on my face and ears at bay for a couple of days per application, but what about the rest of my head? I tried every shampoo and rinse, with very little or no effect. I got Nizoral 2% about two months ago, used at most 1/4 tsp. four times, separated by a week, and after the third time, it was ALL GONE. I haven&#x27;t used it for a month, and there&#x27;s no trace of redness or flakes. The doctors may be right, that the underlying fungal infection is \\&quot;incurable \\&quot;, but this is close enough for me. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because on the very first use the shampoo was soothing to my scalp and not to mention the fragrance was a pleasant one unlike medicine.  I also received relief to my itchy scalp, so I was very satisfied.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this shampoo for my son.  When it was no longer stocked in the stores, we had tried Neutrogena and Head and Shoulders, but those products didn&#x27;t work as effectively as Nizoral.  I was glad to see it available again, at least online.  Wish it was cheaper, but this product seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> Do not pay this price for this product. Call Johnson and Johnson and ask them why they are letting this happen! Overseas the product is still available for one fourth the price they are asking! The one star is for the price not the product the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li> This is great for scalp issues such as seborreic dermatitis, etc. It is the best shampoo I have found, after years of trying differnt products.</li>
            <li> Flake no more!  Literally used it twice and 6 months of terrible, snowstorm- like dandruff gone.  Hair feels clean but not stripped. I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t even care about the implications of that an antifungal worked when other antidandruff stuff didnt work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after trying so many different anti-dandruff shampoos over the years. This worked surprisingly quick after just a couple of shampoos. I have been battling bad dandruff chronically and was using various &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; shampoos from Head &amp; Shoulders, Neutrogena and Pantene, but this one really did the trick and I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday - just use it every 3 days until it goes away and then only as needed. I wanted to try this for the first time and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much before I knew if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that my dandruff has completely disappeared and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch much at all now. Try it - it might work for you, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter and husband had terrible dandruff. This is the only thing that works for them.</li>
            <li> During the winter time, my scalp gets dry, flakey, &amp; itchy.  I have tried different dandruff shampoos that would temporarily work and because my hair is pretty long I end up going through the bottle within 2 weeks. Not only that some of the dandruff shampoos would sometimes burn my scalp...not a favorable feeling.  Nizoral really does work.  I noticed a difference with the 2nd use.  Major plus, this shampoo lathers very well so I don&#x27;t have to squirt a load each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried an array of different shampoo&#x27;s for my re-occurring dandruff. This Nizoral didn&#x27;t seem to help much, but it was better than Selsun.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is recommended as an adjunct to minimizing hair loss.  We tried the shampoo as part of a protocol but discontinued its use after several months when no difference in hair loss was observed.  No need to use a chemically-based shampoo if the results were not demonstrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 10 years ago whenever I havd dandruff issue.&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly reliable.  Smell is fine too.  Recommended for people with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Nizoral over the counter is not as effective as prescription strength, but it still helps when alternated with Neutrogena T/Gel.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to get this for a rash I had under my armpit and I used it as directed, but it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have tired everything out there and Nizoral is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked for me. It&#x27;s a bit expensive and it&#x27;s only a 4 oz bottle, but I just add it to my shampoo, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo takes care of my dandruff. I wish that it stayed in stock more, but I think that they produce it in limited runs. The Kroger near me is almost always low or out of stock so that is why I have to order it online. The smell is decent but I wish it had a slightly better aroma.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for years.  I can&#x27;t find it in a lot of stores.  It has&lt;br /&gt;been discontinued.  It is getting reviews of being harmful.  people losing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;I felt the price was higher than I am use to paying!!  But I needed it.</li>
            <li> I had tried salicylic, coal tar, and selenium sulfide. I even tried cutting my hair short and using lotion. Then when I was in the Philippines I went to a dermatologist, she suggested using this twice a week and salicylic for the rest of the week. It was gone after the first treatment using Nizoral. I recently ran out however and came here to buy more. It was $8 in the Philippines, $40 is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It works like magic, Plus guys you should know that Ketaconazol has ANTI-ANDROGENIC EFFECT, which is great if it is use topically to decrease hair fall,</li>
            <li> the shampoo works well.  i used it for my infant&#x27;s cradle cap and it made the condition better with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product at my local drug store, and have even tried all natural one with tea tree and other things in it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that works for me.  What else can I say.  It is expensive, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much.  I wash my hair with a tiny bit of regular shampoo and rinse it out quickly, then I find I only need a little of the nizoral, and I leave it in my hair for 3 - 5 minutes.  I have read that all the regular dandruff shampoos should be left on for about 5 minutes as they need time to work, so I do the same with this.&lt;br /&gt;I have also read that this might help prevent hair loss and my help with hair growth.  Well no luck here in that department, it probably is a myth or only works under certain conditions but would love to hear if that has grown hair for others.</li>
            <li> Still not restocked in NYC in 2014 and the real reason is the FDA learned that this product although helps control dandruff flakes of the scalp and face, and relieves the itch factor also at the same time helps promote less hair loss in men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder the FDA had manufacturer&#x27;s stop producing this item so it can no longer be restocked in the stores for consumers to walk in and purchase again, as they did before.</li>
            <li> If you have a fungal infection of the scalp, this is a very effective product to keep it under control.  I have also used the prescription strength (2%) version and found that it gave me a strange flushing reaction that I did not get from the 1%, although both products controlled my scalp infection.  The product does not need to be used every day, 2 or 3 times a week is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to find this product available on line--saves making an appointment with the doctor and then a trip to the pharmacy, when I know exactly what I need anyway.  However, I am dismayed to discover that the price jumped 5x in the 4 months between my last two purchases.  What&#x27;s going on with that?</li>
            <li> I tried many anti-dandruff products.  This completely got rid of my dandruff.  It took a couple of weeks. So pleased.</li>
            <li> Used this daily for a week.  Did not find this product effective. At least it did nothing to help me.  Maybe it will work for u.  I am going back to head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner which gives short term relief at least.</li>
            <li> este champu es bien bueno,el precio es muy costoso,ojala le bajaran el costo para poder seguir comprandolo pues es muy pequeno el frasco para el precio tan alto.</li>
            <li> I have used other dandruff shampoos and I like this best of all.It makes my hair look very nice, too.</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;m not allergic to and that consistently and reliably works. I wish I could find it in stores. In the mean time, I fork over an exorbitant amount for a small bottle -- which still lasts me a long time. I don&#x27;t need to use it every shampoo, fortunately, after the first few times, and it keeps the itching under control. I&#x27;m not proud to have dandruff. But this stuff works!</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money trying other products, I finally found Nizoral and will never buy another product.  It smells nice, makes a nice lather and really does stop flaking.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if this will help with a smelly scalp? Literally right after I wash my hair, it stinks!! I&#x27;ve been using the neutrogena TSal shampoo and it&#x27;s not working :( I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a dermatologist and I need help. My scalp stinks like 4 day old hair (yuck)! Please help.</li>
            <li> I have loosely coiled &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; hair and wear it naturally. During the Colder months I usually get dandruff so I switch up my shampoo. I bought two because it was significantly less than purchasing in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father is white with terrible dandruff (on going not just seasonal). I gave him the other one and the next day he was like...Smell my hair. His hair even looked better. He had been using Selsum and Head and shoulder with no luck and had never heard of this. but now is a fan.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff since middle school (when I first started having acne and oily skin). I have used all kinds of products like Head and Shoulders, T-gel, Selsun blue, tea tree oil shampoos and dermatologist prescribed shampoos with sulfur. This product has changed my life for the better and I no longer have to worry about flakes, itching and scabbing. I can confidently wear my hair in any style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products like Regenepure DR and it&#x27;s just not the same. I even tried the pink Nizoral and still got flakes. This is the only thing that works for me!</li>
            <li> I was having troublr locating this shampoo locally. I took a chance on Amazon havong it and was plesantly surprised that they did.  I have been using this product for several years and have been and still quite pleased that it really does control my dandruff.  The delivery of the product was about 4 days earlier than promised.  As usual, I had another satisfying experience with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and it has made a difference in my hair.  A+</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner, that was not the issue. However, the box that the actual bottle of shampoo came in was really crushed &amp; there was scotch tape holding the box together in several different places. I contacted CS to be sure this item was indeed \\&quot;new\\&quot; since that is what I thought I was buying. Plus, it was pricey for a bottle of shampoo. I never got any response. I was just surprised at that price, the condition of the packaging. I still don&#x27;t know if what I bought was new or used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! i&#x27;ve used it before, however it has been discontinued from my local pharmacy store. I am glad i found it here. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> After trying head and shoulders, denorex, T-Gel, tea tree oil, and virtually every other type of scalp treatment available in the drug store without any success, I was ready to schedule an appointment with the dermatologist to discover what was causing my dandruff.  Instead, I decided to try Nizoral, and it cleared up my dandruff within two days.  It smells great, lathers well, and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair like some of the coal tar treatments do. By far one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Unable to buy in store at this time. Price is way too high for one bottle.  I thought it was for a number of bottles, but the number referred to the name of the source.  It is, however, the best solution to my scalp problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months with absolutely no reduction in dandruff flakes.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist &amp; was hard to find in the store. Glad to have it. Use it regularly!</li>
            <li> Have used Nizoral for years.  Works great for me, was Dr. recommended.  Would like the 7oz botl next time if still available</li>
            <li> My family has a history of bad uncontrollable dandruff, even the strongest head and shoulders shampoo doesn&#x27;t do any justice. I came across this product while reading an article online and decided to give it a try, I however did not buy this on amazon. The price is absurd! I got the very same product at rite aid (I think it is also sold at Walgreen and Walmart has it for $10) for about 15 bucks. This shampoo is amazing. After the first use my dandruff problem is reduced by 90%. By the end of the week I am flake free. It is not meant to use regularly so I do advise getting a shampoo with tea tree oil to keep the flakes away. I use this product every time I notice the flakes coming back, I use it for a week every 3-4 months or so.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with Seborrheic dermatitis for 15 years and have had mixed results with other brands using different active ingredients. The active ingredient in this product cleared up my scalp from scaling and itching within 3 days. I know results can vary with individuals, but so far I am very impressed. Use as directed about twice a week does the job. I think a good practice of changing products every few months as I researched would be wise, but I am really enjoying the present time of a clear non-itching scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why I need to add a comment just to rate this sale. It was fine. They sent the product that I purchased. no problems</li>
            <li> Everyone who has dandruff has a different type. Icky as it is, dandruff is caused by different kinds of infections/inflammations caused by varying fungi and yeasts. (Ew. I know. Hang on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in Nizoral is the only one that works for me. Coal tar shampoos like Neutragena T-Gel or others such as Head &amp; Shoulders are just so much money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is expense - very expensive - and it&#x27;s getting harder to obtain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution to both problems was to visit my dermatologist and get a prescription. My health savings account should cover the cost if my regular insurance doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this exact product in a 7.0z bottle for around $20.  Now they&#x27;re priced at $100 for 4 oz.  This is obvious price fixing.  Avoid this product at this price.</li>
            <li> Was having some acne breakout on my neckline on the beck of my neck. Was getting really worried hoping it wasn&#x27;t folliculitis, but I read several articles and posts from people with similar skin issues and several swore on this product. After using it about twice per week after a few weeks my neck is back to normal and no itchiness/inflammation or any breakouts at all. very happy.</li>
            <li> Ive used every brand of anti-fungal/dandruff shampoo there is and this is the only product that worked for me. I have used Nizoral for several years and have been very pleased with the results. About 2yrs ago it became very scarce and I read it was due to change in manufacturing location. For 3-4 months I could not find any locally so I was forced to buy online at a substantial markup. I was glad when it was finally available again and I loaded up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, once again, its IMPOSSIBLE to find online, expect here and thE bay. I bought (2) 4oz bottles from drugstore.com about 2-3mo ago at a cost of $25 shipped (thats $25 for 2 bottles). Now a 4oz bottle here on Amazon is $100?!?!?! Im absolutely not paying these kinds of ridiculous prices for this shampoo. Another reviewer said they called the 800 number on back of the bottle and was told that the product is in short supply due to manufacturing issue and/or relocation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up making an appointment at a dermatologist, was given an RX for the 2% Ketoconazole shampoo, and my co-pay was $6 for a 4oz bottle. Doesnt smell nearly as good as Nizoral, but works the same. I just shampoo with the prescription stuff, leave in for 5min, rinse, then shampoo with a regular bottle of shampoo. Whoever manufactures Nizoral needs to get the stuff back to market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, just like everyone else on here. Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, you name it. Nizoral is seriously incredible. I don&#x27;t have to use it every time I shower, either. At first I used it 4-5 showers in a row, and I saw a difference after the first time I used it. After using it a few times though, now I just use it once a week, and I have had ZERO dandruff. Like I said, miracle product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Had to switch from this to Regene due to the SLS in the product, which I didn&#x27;t realize it had.  SLS strips hair of moisture and I need all I can get.  Since I was losing my hair didn&#x27;t want to do anything to hinder it&#x27;s progress.  So I didn&#x27;t use this long enough to give an opinion.  The Regene has the same ingredient (Keto...) to stop hair loss but without the SLS (Sodium Laureth Sulfate).</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST A-D SHAMPOOS OUT THERE. USE IT EVERY OTHER DAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND IT WILL MOST LIKELY GET RID OF THE FLAKES AND DRY SCALP.</li>
            <li> Good product, great service</li>
            <li> Great stuff for your hair - makes it soft and improves your scalp. Would recommend it to everyone that has itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 Stars because:&lt;br /&gt;A. It works&lt;br /&gt;B. smells great&lt;br /&gt;C. Fast shipment and great value for money&lt;br /&gt;D. It makes my other half wash his hair more often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, there&#x27;s a reason this product gets high reviews, and that is because nothing else compares!</li>
            <li> As advertised, No complaints.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and i can say it definitely works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of over-the-counter dandruff shampoos, and Nizoral is the only one that works for me.  I get significant itching and flaking twice a year when the weather changes, and Nizoral has the problem totally solved within 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> Great transaction A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> I used this for couple of weeks and could see the difference.I used many dandruff shampoos in the past and this one could be rated as the best of the lot.As I am in to just my third week, I have to use it 3 times a week to get the dandruff away.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good product</li>
            <li> I work as intend.  However, the price for a 4oz bottle is way too expensive.  Go for the 7oz bottle if I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product mainly to control scaling and itching.  I used to constantly scratch my head, and I have lost quite a lot of hair as a result . So far, it does control flaking, scaling and itching very well, and I also have less dandruff than before.  I have tried many normal off-the-shelf shampoos, and this one is by far doing a much better job.</li>
            <li> i did get any benefit from it still i suffer from dandruff, so i can&#x27;t say its good so i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> No, it didn&#x27;t make me fabulously rich nor irresistibly attractive.  It didn&#x27;t bring back my pet squirrel that tragically died when I was a child.  It didn&#x27;t bring world peace or energy independence to the U.S.  But it did what so many other anti-dandruff products couldn&#x27;t ... I no longer suffer from itchy scalp nor do I get dandruff.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t cause that burning sensation on my scalp that other brands cause.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than many other options, but plain and simple, it works, period.</li>
