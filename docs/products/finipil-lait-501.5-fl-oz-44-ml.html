            <li>always keep a tube available</li>

            <li>A cool burn slightly at first but heals my skin within a day.</li>
            <li>Works good to keep irritation from shaving down.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely a miracle lotion!</li>
            <li>clears up blemishes fast!</li>

            <li>Thank you exactly what I was looking for</li>

            <li>My waxer suggested I use this product to help alleviate a chronic ingrown hair issues I was having, this works great, a little bit goes a long way and it is cool to the touch, I highly suggest for any areas you wax or shave!</li>

            <li>keeps hair from growing back quickly.  </li>

            <li>I share my race only because sometimes certain products don&#x27;t work on AA skin as well.</li>
            <li>I use a little on my face at night and after years of trying everything this is clearing my face completely up and leaves it super soft!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for the rest of my body: legs, stomach and such.</li>
            <li>I am experiencing menopause after having a complete hysterectomy.</li>

            <li> Arrived as I expected.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and does not cause irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slightly strange smell, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger very long and is usually unnoticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I hate ingrowns, especially after a bikini wax, and this product keeps my skin smooth and significantly less irritated.</li>
            <li> my hair is SO slow to grow back</li>
            <li> The tingly sensation described in other reviews lasts a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It typically goes away after 10min or so.  </li>
            <li> I use a little bit (a small amount of this product goes a long way) once a day, usually after showering on the area that has been waxed.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, I think I should&#x27;ve went for the little packets.</li>
            <li> My waxer introduced me to this stuff a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american and it helps keep all those ugly bumps away.</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s helping reduce the usual post wax issues I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> It works miracles and I used it everyday!</li>
            <li> Since we moved to a small town, I don&#x27;t have a lot of options for waxing anymire.</li>
            <li> I have also used on small pimples and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, my skin had no signs of redness or bumps after just a few min!</li>
            <li> Thick cream</li>
            <li> I decided to try something else, and, after getting those horrible little bumps and crazy itching, I found finipil here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so bad</li>
            <li> So I absolutely hate getting waxed and getting any ingrown hairs or bumps.  </li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs were terrible!!!!</li>
            <li> I break out terribly after waxing or threading.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product was recommended by a friend. I find it&#x27;s helping reduce the usual post wax issues I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I use it after underarm epilation and it keeps me from getting ingrown hairs and infection.</li>
            <li> The best cream for after the Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Even better than Tend Skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! Long time sufferer of in grown hairs and other bumps and cysts and using this cream daily has helped tremendously. If you get waxed downstairs, this is the best thing to use!</li>
            <li> Main advantage is its anesthetic properties.  Thick cream</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver. A cool burn slightly at first but heals my skin within a day. Soothing and conditioning. Love it!! Will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. it is great for so many thing. always keep a tube available</li>
            <li> so helpful for ingrowns, blemishes, etc</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! I suggest every women who gets waxed or shave to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works excellent especially for preventing in-grown hairs! It works miracles and I used it everyday! Defiantly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> worked somewhat.  would not buy again</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the only thing that made my at home waxing experience pleasant. It is soothing and cooling, and it definitely prevents ingrown hairs. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and does not cause irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> the product feels great post epilation but the tube is small and not completely full</li>
            <li> My waxer suggested I use this product to help alleviate a chronic ingrown hair issues I was having, this works great, a little bit goes a long way and it is cool to the touch, I highly suggest for any areas you wax or shave!</li>
            <li> I use this after toner and before moisturizer on my face each night to keep breakouts at bay. I also use it on my feet during the summer before wearing sandals to prevent foot fungus and stinky shoes. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Great for after waxing, gets rid of redness and no ingrown hairs.  Ive also found its great on acne! I use a little on my face at night and after years of trying everything this is clearing my face completely up and leaves it super soft!! This is absolutely a miracle lotion!</li>
            <li> My waxer introduced me to this stuff a few years ago. Since we moved to a small town, I don&#x27;t have a lot of options for waxing anymire. I&#x27;ve found a girl who does well and I like her, but nowhere in town sells this ointment. I decided to try something else, and, after getting those horrible little bumps and crazy itching, I found finipil here on amazon.  I will never stray again.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on here than at the beauty salon. I didn&#x27;t think it was THAT much cheaper until it arrived. The bottleis easily twice the size I used to get.</li>
            <li> So I absolutely hate getting waxed and getting any ingrown hairs or bumps.  This stuff is the answer! First it gives an amazing soothing feeling after a wax and calms the irritated skin right away! Secondly, it keeps the skin fresh and protected from bacteria one can be prone to after a waxing.  Since the pores are much more susceptible to infection this serves the purpose of being an antibacterial cream also.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Very cooling and softening.</li>
            <li> clears up blemishes fast!</li>
            <li> Good to use after eyebrow, etc. waxing to prevent infection. After putting it on, the skin has a cool sensation. I have also used on small pimples and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, I think I should&#x27;ve went for the little packets. They were just too pricey. This product smells so bad and I have been told to use it on my bikini area after waxing. I can&#x27;t stand the smell so I just stopped using it. Doesn&#x27;t really work for the rest of my body: legs, stomach and such.</li>
            <li> Works awesome to prevent ingrowns. I&#x27;m african american and it helps keep all those ugly bumps away. I share my race only because sometimes certain products don&#x27;t work on AA skin as well. But this product is the BOMB!</li>
            <li> This stuff has a bit of a strange smell, but it is effective especially after waxing. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better price either. My salon charges like $30 for this stuff!</li>
            <li> Arrived as I expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome product after body waxing or shaving. Was introduced to me by an aesthetician in MD 2 years ago and I have been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing menopause after having a complete hysterectomy. The ingrown hairs were terrible!!!! I used this product and I was thrilled. There is a cooling sensation, but it dissipates quickly. I would highly recommend this product!! Bb</li>
            <li> It gives a chilled sensation and makes your face feel tingly clean! I use it every night after the shower and I&#x27;ve seen great results!</li>
            <li> I use finipil after I get a bikini wax. Keeps ingrowns to a minimum. I apply after every shower. Love it!!</li>
            <li> After I got my first bikini wax, my esthetician recommended that I use this everyday to help with redness and ingrown hairs. I have INCREDIBLY sensitive skin... I can&#x27;t shave my legs more than a few times a week and my bikini area is always red and bumpy.  After I put it on, my skin had no signs of redness or bumps after just a few min! First time in my life! I find the cooling sensation (some people may think it&#x27;s a burning sensation) to be fine.  It typically goes away after 10min or so.  It was definitely a life saver for our island vacation..I was able to not be self conscious the entire time.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect product and does what it promises - helps to keep you bump and infected hair free!</li>
            <li> Very cooling after a wax.</li>
            <li> I found this item to have a burning effect on my skin.  Other people may be able to handle it, but if you have very sensitive skin like I do, you may want to stick to aloe vera instead.</li>
            <li> Finipil is great for acne, antiseptic, use after shaving for razor bumps or ingrowns.</li>
            <li> Thank you exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Great to use after waxing. Order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Finipil works great when used daily after a face waxing. Hair grows back much slower and thinner. My skin feels much softer,</li>
            <li> So far so good, but I want to finish the bottle before a real review!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. Know nothing about it.</li>
            <li> dosent really work that great</li>
            <li> Finipil not only reduces post hair removal breakouts and irritation, it also slows the rate at which your hair grows back. I break out terribly after waxing or threading. Finipil has definitely reduced the incidents of breakouts, but what I love more than anything is my hair is SO slow to grow back and I only use it immediately following hair removal and for 3 days, twice a day, thereafter.</li>
            <li> Love this gel - it&#x27;s cooling and helps prevent irritation after shaving!</li>
            <li> keeps hair from growing back quickly.  good antiseptic.  will purchase product again.  has a tingle to it..  liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Excellent on fresh shaved or waxed skin and to reduce and heal hemorrhoids.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love it. You actually feel an instant cooling sensation and it does prevent irritation. I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Great cooling sensation, non greasy and WORKS!! Works great under makeup!!</li>
            <li> Works good to keep irritation from shaving down.</li>
            <li> This product was actually recommended to me first by my cosmetician. I hate ingrowns, especially after a bikini wax, and this product keeps my skin smooth and significantly less irritated. I use a little bit (a small amount of this product goes a long way) once a day, usually after showering on the area that has been waxed. I&#x27;ve been using the product now for three months and am really happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slightly strange smell, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger very long and is usually unnoticeable after a few minutes. The tingly sensation described in other reviews lasts a little bit longer. Overall, it keeps my bikini wax looking better longer, and for that I am thankful.</li>
            <li> Love this product after waxing. It feels cool and it does help on ingrown hair. I would def recommend this</li>
            <li> Did not work on razor bumps.</li>
            <li> works better than my prescription - will order more in the future</li>
            <li> Love this stuff after a Brazilian wax. The cooling is so soothing for irritation, and also works as a good lube!</li>
            <li> Received promptly.  OUTSTANDING product.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Would use it more often if the price was lower.</li>
            <li> Really helps to reduce ingrown hair</li>
