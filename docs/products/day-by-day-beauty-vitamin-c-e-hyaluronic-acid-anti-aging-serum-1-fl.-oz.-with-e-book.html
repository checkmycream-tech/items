            <li>I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and loving it.</li>
            <li>I was offered a sample bottle of Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>This is a nice serum for this price range.</li>
            <li>Product supplied for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product it does a good job,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Dr. Oz Serum is much more superior in my opinion.  </li>

            <li>Nice bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for delivery, the packaging was nice, and delivery was prompt.  </li>

            <li>However, all opinions expressed are solely my own and in no way influenced.</li>

            <li>Great price, going to order more for sure.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>

            <li>My review: I was thrilled to get to review another product by Day by Day Beauty.</li>
            <li>It is effective and has worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels nice when I apply to my face.</li>
            <li>I read, that to be effective, a vitamin C serum must be between 15 and 20 percent.</li>
            <li>After using this for a week I can honestly say that my skin looks brighter and my face is smoother.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses Nicely also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 and have fairly nice skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to keep it looking fairly nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of difference with this product.</li>
            <li>It arrived two days after the order was placed by Pamela, the co-founder of Day by Day Beauty who offered this full-sized product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>, I am very excited that I have already had good results.</li>
            <li>My skin is much cleaner and more beautiful with this great vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It’s scent free, and full of wonderful ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since receiving I&#x27;ve used it by itself as well as under my normal moisturizer and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I received my product free for review purposes (all opinions expressed are those of my own and unbiased!)</li>
            <li>I received a sample, and was happy to try it, as in my opinion, a serum is THE most important part of skin care.</li>
            <li>So, I happily tried it and quickly got even happier to see that the serum isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>Great price also,  Received so quickly, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>it goes on very easily and it is not sticky</li>
            <li>He has noticed improvement with his skin feeling more hydrated and more of a brighter complexion!</li>
            <li>My skin after even just a couple days seems more supple - It&#x27;s got more life to it!</li>
            <li>Excellent Vitamin C product for my sensitive and acne-prone skin!  </li>
            <li>Best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>In our case, my wife is light skin- fair complexion while I am darker skinned</li>
            <li>it feels and smells nice, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months or more  now</li>
            <li>I just wish it came with more in the bottle, because it’s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Day by Day Beauty also has some nice videos I found which were helpful to learn more about application, ingredients, etc.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my face it feels good, making my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I liked this as it makes it more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what in it makes it so effective, but I like to think that it is some Harry Potter magic.</li>
            <li>far as the formula itself, it has no smell (which is great!)</li>
            <li>This is by the best Vitamin C serum that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Vitamin C Serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the skin on my face and neck, feels and looks better than it has in about a year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>It’s affordable, natural, and works beautifully!</li>
            <li>so I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>The greatest thing about vitamin c serums is they are natural products.</li>
            <li>The benefits are amazing, softer skin, healthier looking skin, more radiant skin.</li>
            <li>What I can review is the product came in a nice glass bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li>I am sure that this serum is as great as I think it is but the coconut oil may be helping me get better results since it is not only a wonderful oil to use for many reasons, it also helps your skin absorb things.</li>
            <li>, my drawer is full of stuff!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a super nice product at a good price point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and helps shrink pores!</li>
            <li>Love love love this serum!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many but this one seems to be the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using vitamin C serum for the first time and I must say it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with results.</li>
            <li>I recommend this serum to anyone who wants to achieve beautiful youthful skin.</li>
            <li>I look ,my face happy;)))</li>
            <li>I really like that it is beautifully packaged as well, but that is just me.</li>
            <li>Now when I put on foundation, I find I need just a very light touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>for the serum itself, it has a very light, almost water like consistency.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The serum absorbs into skin quickly and feels good all day.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice and light clean smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very nice , light and clean feel to it</li>
            <li>my face and neck loved the feeling from the very first use.  </li>
            <li>, is very important, but it does seem to boost the results of my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say I had no allergic reaction to this product which, for me, is very important, I use the serum once at night after cleansing and toning my face.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and healthy my face feels after I use it!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serums are a great way to prep the skin for moisturizer as all of the serums I’ve tried contain Hyaluronic acid, which is able to swell and hold a LOT of water, which is great for (dry) skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bottle is large for the price and it lists all of the great ingredients in the serum.</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce fine lines and is perfect for sensitive skin as it is as organic and eco friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good product as far as it&#x27;s results,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own leaves my face feeling very dry, and it gave me breakouts which are a very uncommon thing on my face to see, as I don&#x27;t suffer from acne, yet</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I found my make up applied smoother and look much better since I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely serum.</li>
            <li>It helps plump your skin up, boost collagen production, and give you that dewy look that babies tend to have, but most people lose as they age.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am pleased to have used this product (I haven&#x27;t taken a look at the e-book skin information bonus</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>Been using it along with the Hyaluronic acid and am pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this Serum.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C is too acidic for me to digest, so being able to apply it topically has been an excellent option.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>The best serum, you&#x27;ll look younger!</li>
            <li>I did :)</li>
            <li>Light weight and not greasy!</li>
            <li>love it takes away bark spots</li>
            <li>I am hooked and this is part of my beauty routine for sure.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look, and feel.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of months - morning and evening for most of the time.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more.  </li>
            <li>I watched the youtube video to make sure I was applying it correctly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s basically unscented.  </li>
            <li>It feels interesting to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I will keep using it to see if it helps even out the sun damage to my face even more, but wanted to get this out here for now.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Ole Henriksen Truth Serum for quite some time and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Has more than just cosmetic effect.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is definitely more even with fading of brown/age spots.</li>
            <li>After using the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum for 4 days, I could tell a difference, for the better, in the look and touch of my skin.</li>
            <li>I received several notes on the best uses for products I order from them.</li>
            <li>I find the price point to be one that is do able..</li>
            <li>I find no product to be magic..</li>
            <li>maybe I would call this a sleeper..:-)</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin felt better in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream that I use instead of foundation is going on more evenly, and I don&#x27;t need as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Miracles can happen, but I&#x27;ll settle for a serum that both works and seems to make everything else work better.  </li>
            <li>Once more, immediately my skin seemed hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s a winner for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will be a permanent addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be better than it was.</li>
            <li>A professed beauty product addict, I have tried many MANY creams, lotions, oils, repair, anti-aging, complexes, serums etc from the drug store brand to the $100/oz bottles.  </li>

            <li>After many years of outdoor activities and sport</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just some gal in upper michigan who was searching for the latest and greatest in skin care for aging skin.</li>
            <li>but the reviews were convincing</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin after one use and even better after each day.</li>
            <li>I love the way it glides on my face feels like silk.</li>

            <li>it is doing even better with this serum.  </li>

            <li>My skin looks more brightening, tightening &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li>My face look much better and grow too.</li>
            <li>All of the products are much more thicker-which to me indicates more moisturizer or in my opinion hyluranic acid.</li>
            <li>The serum is like water, as many serums are.</li>
            <li>but the advantage there is the more rapid absorption.</li>
            <li>I really love the non greasy face after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t what it is &#x27;meant&#x27; for, but I was pleased with the results.</li>

            <li>It hydrates and plumps my skin better than any product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed the most change on my forehead.</li>

            <li>I also love the pump top.</li>
            <li>Maybe if there was a bit more hyaluronic acid added in so the formula is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>This serum worked great and my skin soaked it up fast.  </li>

            <li>even the excellent customer service emails detailing how to use the product are the same.</li>
            <li>but I will say that somehow this product seems to work slightly better than the Oz one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Vitamin C.</li>

            <li>If they could fix the applicator, I would love this to bits.</li>
            <li>After after put it on I put a moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>I am combining it with the hylauronic acid and get even better results.  </li>
            <li>Thank you I&#x27;ll be ordering more..</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The pump applicator is also a great way to use it, versus a jar where you put your finger in it to get some out - with those I always seem to grab too much product.</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that swear they reduce wrinkles, so I took my time and researched what the Dermatalogists were reccomending and chose Day by Day.</li>

            <li>I know that vitamin C serums are great for the skin and supposed to help with anti aging, so I will continue to use this serum and see where it’s fabulous natural ingredients get me.</li>
            <li>However, the convenience of the spray outweighs the easily adjustable caveat.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it as a 5/5 because the cons are either easily avoidable or just my nitpicking.</li>
            <li>Until next time keep safe and Happy Halloween in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I got this product for free to review, but my review is totally honest and my real experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product would be good for any skin type, even my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good reviews and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>, in fact, it feels very fresh.</li>
            <li>I had incredible results using the Vitamin C serum alone and with other products.  </li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly, and has made a hugely significant difference in evening the tone, dramatically diminishing pore size, and making my skin luminous.</li>

            <li>Day By Day Beauty has created a nice natural product that glides on your skin easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it on my face; it soaks in quckly, make it easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li>Also the price for this kind of Serum is super reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The seller is great, responds quickly to questions and sends instructions on the proper way to use it</li>
            <li>I know vitamin C oxidizes quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a good shelf life, so perhaps I got an old batch of the Oz stuff</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li>It nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients.</li>
            <li>For me, I did not see any significant results, if anything I had breakouts when I used this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to write reviews, but within the short time I have used this serum I have been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I tried using my original serum for a couple of days just to see if I could tell a difference</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum provides thirsting skin with antioxidants &amp; rich, hydrating ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m willing to give it more time to achieve the results I look forward to.  </li>
            <li>My first thought was, this must be some sort of Harry Potter magical stuff.</li>
            <li>Yes, love that.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from pretty packaging, how about the consistency?</li>
            <li>I’m excited to share with you</li>
            <li>I have only used it for two days will have to post again on how effective I find it!</li>
            <li>Every morning I&#x27;m excited to look in the mirror to see the results.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this serum</li>
            <li>This is worth a try!</li>
            <li>serum is full of good for skin ingredients and they are going to give even better results in long run.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I am delighted to be a part of reviewing this product and others of a similar nature because I truly hope that when I encourage men and women to care for their skin they will take heed and seek out effective products to do just that very thing.</li>
            <li>(if you don&#x27;t know what that is--good) which tells you I am very fair skinned and subject to age spots and the like.</li>
            <li>However, they appear less noticeable even when scrutinized under very good lighting.</li>
            <li>So excited that it is that simply, yet the evidence of GREAT skin is so worth it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and it absorbed will in my skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and layers under any moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So pleased with day by day beauty&#x27;s spa-version of this old favorite.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking amazing, smooth, soft, radiant.</li>
            <li>It comes out cleanly without drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin - I was the girl who almost never had pimples...but even then I could look ahead - at my sweet gram - and see the wrinkles that go with this &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; complexion, lol.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly it absorbs into your skin and wears very well under make-up!</li>
            <li>I will break out in a rash if a product is too much for my skin and this one is absolutely fine!</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 days, my skin is much tighter...in a good way!</li>
            <li>Since its cobalt blue bottle minimizes light exposure and also pump applicator is nice and easy to pump without air exposure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this cream has the special ingredients to give them to me.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve always had large pores, I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and</li>
            <li>Keeping a realistic head was most important after all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize that I should be using a serum as I am used to having pretty much flawless complexion with little to no work.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about doing this product.</li>
            <li>The best part was that my break-out was hardly noticeable as there was no redness to it.  </li>
            <li>If you are concerned with your skin, whether it is dullness, fine lines and wrinkles or it just doesn&#x27;t look right, add some of this product into your routine and you will see results almost immediately.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and my dark splotches have faded greatly!</li>
            <li>I also really love when beauty products have a pump attached to the lid as I don&#x27;t have to worry about pouring out too much or wasting any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that we get what we pay for.</li>
            <li>OK Maybe I&#x27;m just a skeptic but some of these reviews really concerned me.</li>
            <li>All the reviews said you&#x27;ll  notice changes  in 2 weeks...not true.  </li>
            <li>Ib both our cases, it took about 10 days of regular use to achieve what we believe are good results.</li>
            <li>I find following it with a good moisturizer, as directed</li>
            <li>I can’t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure the ratings aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely did nothing for me - I used it for more than a month day and night</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and it looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The true test was when I was in the store and was thinking about buying another vitamin C serum and could not bring myself to do it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>but when I hit 40 I started to show my true age.</li>
            <li>as much and this product delivered as well and even better.</li>
            <li>Just one pump is typically good enough for me, and I rub it in my skin every morning after my shower and every night before bed.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has a gentle aloe scent (I can&#x27;t handle stinky perfume smells.</li>
            <li>They say you&#x27;ll see full results within 6 months</li>
            <li>Not a bad scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great for both of us, even on my sensitive skin which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to new products.</li>
            <li>The product is absorbed by the skin quickly and leaves it smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>It is mentioned by the company that These ingredients naturally brighten skin tone, diminish superficial fine lines and wrinkles, reverse sun damage effects, lighten acne scarring, restore healthy elasticity, clarify skin, shrink pores &amp; retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like the way it absorbs quickly and has improved the texture of my skin.</li>

            <li>After each application, the skin quickly absorbs it and stays hydrated.</li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It results in skin that is brighter and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>someone who prefers using natural products, I was thrilled that this beauty serum contains three powerful ingredients:  Hyaluronic Acid, which restores collagen and reduces wrinkles; Vitamin E, a protective antioxidant; and of course Vitamin C, an antioxidant that also helps to build collagen.  </li>
            <li>and I continue to see results, I will be a loyal customer for this product for life.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quickly and has that hydrating feeling as opposed to &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; like I get from my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is odorless and absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin, as opposed to serums that are massaged in.</li>

            <li>i will be able to use the Vitamin C as i want to, Please check back with me at a later time and i will give a great review.</li>
            <li>I have tried other serums (3 others) and I have to say this one by far is the best out of all of them.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and experience overall.</li>

            <li>No unpleasant odor or stingy when applied</li>
            <li>This is a very simple, nice clean vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now going to try their new product Hyaluronic Acid Serum to see if it is of more benefit to me.</li>
            <li>It actually felt pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly, and did not end up feeling sticky after applying it.  </li>
            <li>It also helped with dry skin but a good moisturizer is needed after it dries.</li>
            <li>After applying the serum to my face I also noticed that this product is not at all greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I could see improvements the first week!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I want her to look as good as me!</li>
            <li>From the first time that I used the product (Product junkie Skeptic!)  </li>
            <li>Not to mention, with smoother and healthier skin, my makeup looks ten times better!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I have a very oily complexion with sun spots at age 31!!</li>
            <li>Im almost done with my first bottle!</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder more of serum!</li>
            <li>Ladies younger than 50; If I had this product 20 years ago, I&#x27;d sure get a jump start on using it now!</li>
            <li>I love natural products!</li>
            <li>I saw great reviews on this new vitamin Serum, Day by Day, and decided I&#x27;d take my chances one last time.</li>
            <li>- I should note that this is more of a preference thing than an actual con since it is easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This made my skin very smooth, and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product really does improve your complexion, reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>you want a natural product, that absorbs quickly, feels great, and seems to do what it claims, look no further....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with fine lines</li>
            <li>Meaning anyone who wants to keep those fine lines at bay..</li>
            <li>I ordered this serum due to a special on amazon,I must say I was very pleased at how  quick my order arrived&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my case, I use the product mainly for some very fine facial scarring that many mistake for wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using it as a preventative measure, and it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky - these are real words for what happens.</li>
            <li>I am really going to enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>moG8HWB5TEU8RO]]I am a bit of a cosmetics junkie and have tried many brands of vitamin c serum and this is by far the most complete serum i ve tried.</li>
            <li>It feels Light, comes out very watery</li>
            <li>I notice that the pores on my nose are smaller which for me is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped visibly reduce my laugh lines .</li>
            <li>I loved being able to implement this into my daily routine with the discount I received only made it easier on my budget.</li>
            <li>and when I am done using the Vitamin C serum, after it has absorbed, I put on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use it three times so far as I am watching to make sure that  no skin reactions appear.</li>
            <li>, here’s my nightly regimen for what it’s worth.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>We both found this product as good or better than much more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I love that is natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Giving you hydrated, clear, soft, supple, and simply gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot about the benefits of Vitamin C on your skin and the combination of Hyaluronic with it, so I decided it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overnight solution, but I have used it now for about four weeks and have seen a remarkable difference with respect to wrinkles, skin tone and resiliency, and lightening of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth it</li>
            <li>Well Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I did not care for the smell of the product but it does hydrate my skin leaving it looking fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li>Day by Day Beauty was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Vitamin C Serum to review.</li>
            <li>Of the three serums I have tried this one is my favorite as far as consistency - not too runny,</li>
            <li>It is so worth</li>
            <li>This serum has helped my skin become more soft and some of my hyperpigmentation is lightening.</li>
            <li>My skin also appears brighter and I feel like I look more alive.</li>
            <li>, my skin feel so soft and lovely</li>
            <li>After years of damage by tanning beds to my face I decided to toss the UV&#x27;S and take action to nourish my skin instead of more damage.</li>
            <li>and I think that it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is safe for all skin types including sensitive skin, which I have.</li>
            <li>My face feels supple, soft and looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and I will update this review once I&#x27;ve had time to see results.</li>
            <li>I find that the liquid seems to spread further and more easily, and yet I started with the gel first</li>
            <li>While many of the various Vitamin C serums offered on Amazon get great reviews, I purchased Day by Day based on the sheer number of high marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive serums before, but this one is superior!</li>
            <li>I do note that it is of a much more user friendly consistency than the prior vitamin C product that I purchased, which was like water and dispensed with a dropper.  </li>
            <li>would encourage others to try several varieties and brands of highly rated beauty serums to see what works best for their individual skin.  </li>
            <li>I first started using the Day By Day Serum a little over a month ago and the first thing that I noticed was the pleasant light smell.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that it did leave a residue feeling on my hands, but when touching your face you should always keep your hands clean.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel like it really made a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li>While you won&#x27;t see a significant difference in a day or two, it really does improve skin texture.</li>
            <li>and I have a lot of sun damage and cannot afford a peel right now.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into skin.  </li>
            <li>The price is definitely right for the product and I will look into replenishing supply of this product when it gets low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They say that the devil is in the details, and this product gets it right in those details.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C, right?</li>
            <li>Some serums were sort of more sticky, one actually burned a bit - but this one is just right!</li>
            <li>The smell is very neutral and my skin feels clean after use.  </li>
            <li>It goes on your skin nice and smooth and it dries quickly without that heavy sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Easy pump dispenser, no messy droppers!</li>
            <li>The bottle comes with the pump which is also very helpful to dispense just the right amount!</li>
            <li>My skin is really dry and rough, this serum makes it feel and look great!  </li>
            <li>and so far so good-goes on quick and leaves it smooth~</li>
            <li>but it is less viscous and more watery than most serums I&#x27;ve used, so care is needed when pumping it onto the finger.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different products, and by far Day By Day is the best.</li>
            <li>Does make you have better skin - suggestions for use, use it twice a day at first (doesn&#x27;t take much to use, as it says on the label, follow up after its absorbed maybe 5 minutes, longer if you just got out of the shower with a good moisturizer) for the first week, once a day for the next week, then twice a week following.</li>
            <li>It was much better though it still burned slightly, barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>What is really great about this serum is that is does not interrupt your usual regimen.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Murad dark spot serum ($50.00 a bottle) and that works good too -</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to attend my 40th High School Reunion this August, to tell everyone my newest \\&quot;secret.\\&quot; AND, buy an additional bottle of Best Vitamin C Serum for my second bathroom, so I don&#x27;t miss a single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sprays out exactly the right amount of serum on each side of the cheek.</li>
            <li>maybe i am using too much as it seems to be going quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use  and no harsh scents.  </li>
            <li>I definitely notice a difference and have been told how great my skin looks recently!</li>
            <li>this is such a GREAT price - such a steal!</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to apply with no waste.  </li>
            <li>Classy bottle, pump applicator makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The serum is clear, non-fragrant and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Other than the baggy eyelids, I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin (lucky me!)</li>
            <li>I actually do have pretty great skin- only in my mid-30s-</li>
            <li>And while I was more than happy to get a faster chance to see what the contents of the little blue bottle could do, I didn&#x27;t expect all that much.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Yes, very much so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective especially with regular use.  </li>
            <li>she says it is very much like using water and oil but hopes it works</li>
            <li>It comes with a pump which I very much prefer, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling any.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin but a little enhancement never hurts.</li>
            <li>So for so good, my dark spots are turning lighter!</li>
            <li>Although it is watery (which is not enough of a problem to give this product anything lower than 5 stars), it goes on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love how it dry quick &amp; tighten the skin.</li>
            <li>- All in all this is more of a preference than an actual con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be getting a second bottle for sure...</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My age 38 ;-)</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder more of serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see after even a short period of time that I can see my skin is brighter and looks more tighter and</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, and this would be my first anti-aging product.  </li>
            <li>The lovely blue bottle is one I don&#x27;t even mind leaving out on my dressing table</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Have actually been able to feel and SEE the difference it makes.</li>
            <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what people were saying about smaller pores</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first layer, before a couple of night creams, one containing hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hold out much hope for long term wrinkle eradication, though that would be nice.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first couple of days, I did suffer from some dryness, but that’s all gone now.</li>
            <li>Younger looking for sure</li>
            <li>Label has gotten wet and since smeared and is illegible and I cannot read it, kind of like it was made on someones home computer.  </li>
            <li>My skin texture was smooth and soft after using the product.  </li>
            <li>my many years of using vitamin C serums this is the only one that has made a “visible” difference.</li>
            <li>I have seen a big improvement with the lines on my top lip, and my crows feet.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li>I was skeptical probably like you are reading this, like geez, an awesome product on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different products that tighten skin, but most do not help in this area.</li>
            <li>But, I wanted to just try the serum first to see.  </li>
            <li>I really like this C Serum!</li>
            <li>With so many skin care products to choose from, you might be tempted to go for a product offering a larger bottle and a fancy package.  </li>
            <li>Don’t be misled by packaging – this product really works!  </li>
            <li>You should give it a try ;)</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this product at first because its not a well known brand name.</li>
            <li>I took a picture when I first started using it</li>
            <li>This is my second order of the Day By Day Vitamin C Serum product, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>First I have to give the disclaimer that I got this product in order to review it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues with it either.</li>
            <li>It actually feels more smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Vitamin C product!!}</li>
            <li>Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li>After first use my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Company also sent me a 25% off coupon after my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>It will of course be better if they sold it in larger bottles!</li>
            <li>I suffered from cystic acne most of my teen years and as a result, bear the acne scars to prove it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 and have tried many facial skin products over time.</li>
            <li>I noticed first off that it wasn&#x27;t sticky or tacky at all.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more than one bottle the next time.</li>
            <li>The pump mechanism very likely helps to preserve the quality (better than the dropper bottles for example) of the liquid over time.</li>
            <li>, my skin is better than ever thought possible.  </li>
            <li>it the blue bottle that makes this better?</li>
            <li>I would love to take a bath, daily, in this serum!</li>
            <li>My first time ever buying a Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I had wrinkles around the corners of my eyes, and they&#x27;ve pretty much disappeared!  </li>
            <li>Try it out at least, its worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it really works!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is starting to look more even</li>
            <li>Have wanted to try this product, especially when the signs of aging have started to be more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I first used their Hyaluronic Acid Serum which they recommend being used with this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>thats the only reason I give it 4 starts vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li>exactly what I got!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more progress, and am definitely making this part of my routine.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a healthy glow, it doesnt leave it with a greasy feel to it, my pores seem smaller and my skin even feels tighter.</li>
            <li>The first moment I used this, I noticed my skin tighten up a bit.</li>
            <li>my face first and then apply the serum followed by my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have not seen any outstanding, noticeable results in the brief two week span.</li>
            <li>I felt/seen the difference on my skin the first day I used it</li>
            <li>Younger looking for sure</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because you cannot go any higher.  </li>
            <li>I started searching for a product online that would help my skin tone, pore size, overall appearance, etc and wasn&#x27;t sure if that product would be a cream, series of products, vitamins, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been seeing a consistent improvement over that time.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week of using this product I noticed tightening of my pores.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny as it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>This product really works on my skin!</li>
            <li>I really like Day by Day Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t know that serums contain a higher concentration than creams.</li>
            <li>when I first tried this I knew there would be no problems.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that it does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>The vitamin C serum does what it says it does and more, My skin glows and has brighten  and toned , I will definitely buy again..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a serum</li>
            <li>Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li>it is absorbed too fast on the skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget that if you are going to use this serum that you for sure apply sunscreen over it, or use it only at night.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever tried any sort of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>I will get more when I get low.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of vit. C serum and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>nothing works overnight, but over a few weeks - I started getting a lot of comments about how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Am absolutely delighted with results in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>i love love this product-so far it has faded the little sun spots i had across my nose area-goes on quick and absorbes  </li>
            <li>It is super light, thick, easily absorbed into skin, I love the way my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li>After spending many dollars on just the right cleanser, moisturizer, toner, etc...I was in search of something natural that I could put on this 60 years young face that is beginning to show some wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I liked about the product was its easy absorption – It wasn’t thick or smelly.</li>
            <li>I responded to an email I received asking how I liked the product, and I got a live human to respond to me within 30 minutes of receiving my email.  </li>
            <li>The added benefits of the ingredients is like vitamins for my skin, antioxidants that go right to the much needed aging spot.</li>
            <li>I notice that my skin feels much softer and the fine lines around my face are no where near as noticeable.</li>
            <li>Who knows, I did see some positive results when I first started using Oz</li>
            <li>However I give it a 2 star rating because in combination with Crazy Beautiful Face Creme it disappears all my fine lines and wrinkles and minimizes my pores right away.</li>
            <li>, I can’t say I’m pumped about the new pump, much preferring the original glass dropper</li>
            <li>I am always trying new skin care products most with no visible results but after trying this product for just a week I can see a definite difference in my fine lines and frown marks I am totally surprised!</li>
            <li>Although it did not improve my symptoms enough to completely endorse it, it did not irritate my skin and during that time I received amazing customer service, advice and help from the owners of the company.</li>
            <li>I have never had such quick delivery and such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes, but I do see a general smoother appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>It felt fresh on my face, was smooth, but non-greasy and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>not so fair complexion (Irish versus Italian).</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t give a complete review because I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for as long as I would have liked to (only about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li>Less lines instead of more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I have been using this product for three months now and have noticed  positive changes with my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product  after  reading  all the positive  reviews and have been using it twice a day for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>(I saw a lot of people that felt the positive reviews were from marketers I guess).</li>
            <li>Once that dries I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with SPF30.  </li>
            <li>(sp)- I thought I&#x27;d try something cheaper and these reviews were so positive.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>After receiving the Vitamin C serum and reading all the reviews I knew this product was going to add positive change to my skin.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I don&#x27;t use much in the way of creams and lotions and potions because I break out with all of them.</li>
            <li>(I find I have to shave first however) and hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li>After using the first bottle I didn&#x27;t really see any changes.  </li>
            <li>A have been gently exfoliating first, then using it (even though I know you are not supposed to exfoliate every day).&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance, and it is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands and Day by Day Beauty has, by far, made the best Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>If the sprayer could be improved with something that worked as well as the dispensers on other products I own, I&#x27;d increase the rating to 4 or 5 stars, but the packaging really does take away from ease of use.</li>
            <li>Consequently, Best Vitamin C Serum will gently tighten facial and delicate neck skin.  </li>
            <li>bottle is small but lasts a good while.  </li>
            <li>and I am not sure if it is a good characteristics.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some improvement in my skin but way too early to give a full review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and almost all natural (98%), I&#x27;d rather not put something full of chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it dries quickly, which is great in my (hurried) morning routine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this Vit C serum very long, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I have used some other high priced vitamin-c serums and haven&#x27;t been as pleased as I have been with Day By Day Beauty&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>The only thing is, the serum seems more watery than other vitamin c serums, but maybe that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li>At this point, that could only make it a true miracle oil for me!  </li>
            <li>it is well worth the price and risk of a new product..</li>
            <li>Obviously it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>super quick-this is a winner-makes your skin soft and the plus of fading my sun spots!big</li>
            <li>i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this serum seems to help any blotchiness or redness that I have experienced in the past.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t feel my age</li>
            <li>My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate.</li>
            <li>It squirts out a large amount</li>
            <li>I have acne scars and sometimes large pore issues</li>
            <li>One thing is certain, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>My biggest skin problem is oily skin, large pores, acne and inflammation.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the long term benefits of using this on a daily basis, I love that there is no scent, and that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>The pretty blue bottle with simple label was very spa like and looks nice sitting out.</li>
            <li>My under eyes are not much better yet, but I have been so tired that I am sure that until I get good sleep they can not get much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles of it because I use it on my neck as well as my face - and even down to my decollete&#x27; (upper chest area exposed more in the summer beneath tops with lower necklines) -</li>
            <li>Such as fine lines diminishing and a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>This was the first Vitamin C serum I purchased (from the reviews) and I have since purchased other Vitamin C serums, one of which I like much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen definite improvement in the texture and appearance of fine lines around my face and eyes.  </li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks of use, I can already see the fine lines around the corners of my eyes disappear.</li>
            <li>lines softened, skin plumper more youthful looking, dry, flaky skin gone, spots lightened!</li>
            <li>Key ingredients in the fight against age spots, wrinkles, and those stubborn fine lines.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, pores smaller, and fine wrinkles have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C is decent!</li>
            <li>Adovia has been a lifesaver for me, it helped with my confidence also, from having clear skin for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum every day for several weeks, and my skin has not looked so good in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this stuff makes my skin feel and, though I&#x27;ve only been using about 6 weeks, think my fine lines are improving a bit.</li>
            <li>My forehead now has a little bit worse of fine lines which is great from having kind of deep wrinkles eleven days ago.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t believe there is a very high amount of Vitamin C in this product.</li>
            <li>The serum is very easy to dispense from the bottle just press down on the pump and put some in the palm of my hand and apply it  with my fingertips to my face.</li>
            <li>I could really see a difference in my face being moisturized and</li>
            <li>This is the fastest absorbing serum I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I assume it is very informative)</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li>Really gets into the skin and leaves your face moistured</li>
            <li>I just finished using a whole bottle</li>
            <li>Expected better results than I received.  </li>
            <li>This product to me is very runny and the nozzle just makes the serum go everywhere.  </li>
            <li>so it really nourishes and hydrates my skin which makes it look healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I do notice a difference on my face and am very with the results.</li>
            <li>Day by Day features vitamin C, one of the most essential,  natural beautifiers, and it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum has done the trick to make my face not so scaly looking, because no woman wants to go out on a date and have scaly looking skin.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel so much smoother</li>
            <li>By Day is a third of the price and a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for 30 days and really did not see much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them very reliable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to what this product can do.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Regarding the packaging, I would recommend that the bottle have a &amp;#34;see-thru&amp;#34; area so that you know how much product is remaining in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But....what has really sold me on this product has been the gradual evening of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>In a couple of weeks I may be comfortable enough to upload some pictures!</li>
            <li>Before, my forehead was filled with tiny pimples or zits.</li>
            <li>and I really like how my face feels.  </li>
            <li>I have seen where it is suggested to take  phytoceramides with it for it to really work.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After applying this material for five days in a row after I shower, I am really stunned at what it does.  </li>
            <li>did not expect anything to happen, but this was a real surprise.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>It really smooths out my skin texture, and noticeably reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have found it really works for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I can feel how much smoother and softer the skin is.  </li>
            <li>My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin, isn&#x27;t oily, and absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really write reviews but for this product- I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very diligent and followed directions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to thank the supplier for the very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>but I really like how it is really working.</li>
            <li>Going back to the product, I have used it every night and there is NO DIFFERENCE in my light freckles, age spots or frown line reduction.</li>
            <li>I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>it was a relief to have a product that doesn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li>Everything from the proper packaging to ensure your product isn&#x27;t tampered with and has minimal exposure to light and oxygen, to the natural and effective ingredients to give me brighter, plumper skin with fewer lines.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the serum as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>It is not gone but it is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do use it when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Very close customer service.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I stopped the use since it was too much oil for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much of a change in my pore size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Of the serums, I much prefer the 100% hyaluronic acid..</li>
            <li>It works real well...</li>
            <li>Your pump thingy doesn&#x27;t work very well though....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but it does go on well</li>
            <li>and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I tested this theory because the company said, \\&quot;we are real people and we care\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and I really see a difference around the eyes.</li>
            <li>; at this juncture in my life and this product really spoke to me.</li>
            <li>Received fast , got for a friend</li>
            <li>A lot of vitamin serums tend to be really tacky.</li>
            <li>really like the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use more products that are not just lightly scented but as NATURAL as possible and this serum definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>Yes, I use these products for myself but to hear things from others is really validating.</li>
            <li>After almost 30 days, my skin looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference after 90 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Often, the light-feeling serums don&#x27;t really seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and after using this product, I have seen that my face does not get as oily as fast as it did when I was not using the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I use this for my whole face</li>
            <li>Since using this product as directed, I can feel a real difference in the moisture in my skin.  </li>
            <li>works fast</li>
            <li>worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I have read that Vitamins E and C can really help.</li>
            <li>It seems to smooth the skin and tighten pores with an effect similar to that of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I had to give it a try, although I have never been one to experience much of a difference between one cream or serum from another.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was a bit perplexed to the fact facial skin was just not what it used to be.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a working product</li>
            <li>They are very intune with you being and staying their customer.  </li>
            <li>but they really care how it is working for you.  </li>
            <li>My skin also looks so much brighter</li>
            <li>Not visibly but when applying liquid foundation I noticed it didn&#x27;t look caked into my pores as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin and gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;“Premium Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, &amp; Vitamin E Trio penetrate to beautify your skin fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated having these instructions.</li>
            <li>but after two days it won&#x27;t change too much.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to any woman!</li>
            <li>That, to me, was validation that the serum is really impactful</li>
            <li>It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>Both make my pores smaller, moisturize well, and smooth my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not greasy at all and it absorbs very</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this product!</li>
            <li>Received item fast.</li>
            <li>it goes fast.</li>
            <li>And you smell really god after using it.</li>
            <li>Day By Day Vitamin C serum is definitely on my list of favorite Vitamin C serums I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s many forms for disease management/prevention, but this topical surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I am only 36, but I have as many wrinkles as a 68 year old sailor.</li>
            <li>Currently this company carries two products and I hope they will produce more skin care products in the near future!23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal.</li>
            <li>, I try all of them for at least 3 weeks before I write my reviews, otherwise it just wouldn&#x27;t be fair to each company.  </li>
            <li>The bottle itself looks smaller than the picture implies, but a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, it feels so light on the skin, you can apply your normal makeup right over top of this once it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin, making it easy to fit into your morning routine, and you don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other serums and moisturizers with vitamin C and loved them, but Day by Day made my skin look ruddy and coarse.</li>
            <li>unique Vitamin C Serum is overall a gentle and non-sticky formula.</li>
            <li>It definitely nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients &amp; makes your skin looked and felt noticeably smoother and healthier over time while using this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better!</li>
            <li>thought it would make any improvement; i now have bumpy spots on my skin (no, not acne or pimples) and there is no smoothness or any of the other notable features of this product...</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but again not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to have my younger look along with me!</li>
            <li>So far I really like it, but need more time to see if it makes a long term difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad for all the other&#x27;s that reviewed this product.</li>
            <li>This serum is an essential for adding antioxidants, rich and hydrating ingredients to your skin.</li>
            <li>My wife says she likes it better than other serums she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;• 30ml is already a big size but with the spray mechanic it is easy to succumb to spraying more than needed per application – Again, this can be avoided by using a dropper or unwinding the spray cap and dabbing little amounts of the product on your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, nourished, and younger.</li>
            <li>Among the first few things he told me was: you look extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this product I noticed that my skin was more firm.</li>
            <li>It is such a power house of ingredients with true benefits and yet so gentle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve said it in previous posts, I love blue glass-but it also helps minimize exposure to the light (in case you have your bottle in a brightly-lit room).</li>
            <li>Well, what I noticed about this particular serum is that it is very watery.</li>
            <li>Its pure vitamin C, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel terrific.</li>
            <li>I have to really cup my hand when I pump it out because it will drip right off if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>I will put some on if there is a special occasion, but for daily use, I just never have.</li>
            <li>I am however highly optimistic, and this small bottle seems to be able to be used for awhile!</li>
            <li>I have been using Vitamin C cream for along time but recently found the Day By Day product and have really noticed that its use has stepped up the results tremendously.  </li>
            <li>This actually goes on easy, and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in with a full report.</li>
            <li>The rest of us wish the mirror wouldn’t repeat them over and over again (this gets old fast!).</li>
            <li>I would address this review to anyone (male or female) who wants a more even skin</li>
            <li>It is simply because those types of products need time to truly see the results and to reflect on their true benefit.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a dark bottle to protect the ingredients from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>I used the Vitamin C serum alone at first since I have sensitive skin and eye area.  </li>
            <li>I look at least 5-7 yrs younger and people actually touch my face and tell me what a beautiful completion I have!</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of water, exercise regularly and watch what I eat, but still, my skin never looks very &amp;#34;healthly!&amp;#34;  I have only been using this product a couple of weeks and have seen the most improvement of any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>also I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;m just starting to really focus on my skin since the magical age 30 is coming up just next year.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise this has smoothed the area down more than anything else.</li>
            <li>I went back to my other kind, twice as much.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine let me know about this product - she liked it a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling behind, as do a number of other popular serums out there.</li>
            <li>It does go on better when my face is slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>and I can see less visible crow&#x27;s feet and more supple and softer skin after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasted more than half a year&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My skin has changed a lot since having kids and getting older.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this and made the following observations: It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>many more expensive).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a $28 moisturizer that just was not working, in fact, my skin had started going backwards and looking older.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to any one with skin that is older with sun damage.</li>
            <li>Needless to say the best way to review skin care is simply to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is living up to its claims and since I’m so satisfied with its initial results, I’m going to start using it during the day as well before applying my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It dries near instantly leaving skin smooth immediately.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this serum, the overall tone of my skin is more even and brighter, and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>It has also helped to reduce the crater sized pores on my face and given an overall healthy younger look.</li>
            <li>I have always had decent skin but getting older, lets try some of these things.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the pump applicator.</li>
            <li>I could not believe such inexpensive products could show these types of results so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am very white and this Serum has brought more color back in to my face.</li>
            <li>Since using this serum, I&#x27;ve noticed an overall brightness to my skin and a more overall even skin tone.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth, left my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I also think my pores are smaller, and overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>i wish i could give a realistic review</li>
            <li>just too much for my very sensitive</li>
            <li>This vitamin C skin serum from Day by Day Beauty is clear and very slightly viscous, with a clean scent, primarily of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>You absorb it incredibly fast, and it&#x27;s incredibly natural!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a product in a long time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see its long term</li>
            <li>I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product but it has done nothing that it &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; to help with.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>this is a product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys for creating a serum that works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend it highly for discoloration.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes that it will improve my skin over time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had been on the market for a high quality serum and came across this one.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone, my dad even uses it now for age spots on his bald head.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High grade vitamin c serum to be used with hyalonic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So I decided to spoil myself with this lovely c + e serum, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed…</li>
            <li>my wrinkles and pores they also seem a little better</li>
            <li>But in the not-always-friendly glare of my bathroom lights, I do think that my skin looks a little more</li>
            <li>I had bought other Vitamin C Serum that was thicker and easily stayed in place,  this serum did not.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is primarily an anti-aging product, and though I am only 24 and do not have major signs of aging just yet, I did notice my skin was brighter and my freckles had faded.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it gives a nice glow and radiance whereas moisturizing cream alone can leave my skin a bit dull”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because I really like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, and it has just been a week.  </li>
            <li>So far, i haven&#x27;t  really  seen a difference.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t see much difference.  </li>
            <li>I use it as directed, on a clean, dry face.</li>
            <li>So far, this one really delivers.  </li>
            <li>I am going to keep using it and follow up with a update after a few more weeks and see what the results are then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I see in the mirror: the skin is more firm than before</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this serum for a few days now, and I think I’m in love.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use this product as much as i want to do to a small bout with psoriasis on my forehead,but as i am now useing a cream for that</li>
            <li>I have pretty deep lines under my eyes and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in those</li>
            <li>I wash my face as I normally would,</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the low price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, although I know I should</li>
            <li>This is already a combination of Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C which is what we normally apply after using a dermaroller.  </li>
            <li>Currently this company carries two products and I hope they will produce more skin care products in the near future!</li>
            <li>it said it was soap, which soap normally helps clog my pores.</li>
            <li>But this bar was not sudsy, nor did it create soap film that normally sticks to the skin if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth or sponge.</li>
            <li>The fluid is easily absorbed and you see immediate results.</li>
            <li>It does dry my face but not so much that my face becomes uncomfortable with a light mouistizer I am good to go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally learned that instead of rubbing in a serum, it should be patted into the face and then allowed to air dry before putting moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, more even toned and the wrinkles near my eyes are slightly less visible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an easy product to incorporate into your daily routine or use to start a daily routine if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
            <li>I normally use Dr. Oz serum and thought I would try a new brand</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much improvement for fine lines but that could be because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li>but this product was super easy to incorporate, especially since it dried</li>
            <li>The serum is almost of a liquid consistency which helps the product to be absorbed but also makes it a little tricky when applying it, so you need to gently press the pump to avoid wasting the serum as it is unlike most other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>So I wonder if Iam seeing a little quicker results because of the coconut oil, or this serum is really that fantastic.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on a new serum, &amp;#34;Day</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff...use after each face washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all sorts of skin products before - and am continually on the look out for new things -</li>
            <li>I feel like my face has a new glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a relatively new product by a new company</li>
            <li>Normally this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d be interested it, but I can&#x27;t ignore that parts of my face definitely show their age.</li>
            <li>I also think it&#x27;s important to tell, I truly give each product plenty of time to show some results and I&#x27;m religious with my daily routine.</li>
            <li>The only thing I like about this serum is the fact that it&#x27;s very light and water-based, not sticky or greasy or make your face shiny looking, other than that I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for even sensitive skin users.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and never broke out from this.</li>
            <li>I am very conscious about what goes on and in to my body and this formula is made up of 72% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like this product, it makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>my very sensitive skin tolerated the product with no irritation.</li>
            <li>am 60 &amp; I live in florida and stay outdoors a l am anxious to see after more time of use if this helps with my sun spots.</li>
            <li>So far, so good...two thumbs up!</li>
            <li>So the first day, I just applied it on the back of one hand to see if I would have any adverse reaction to the serum.  </li>
            <li>I was using the last drops from my first bottle when I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li>PS if this helps anyone, I am pretty European in origin (bl hair/green eyes etc).</li>
            <li>To our delight, it is working better than the much more expensive prescription!</li>
            <li>My wife and I were regular users of a variety of other products costing much more than this product.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>My skin is the exact same as 2 weeks ago when I started, no difference</li>
            <li>Maybe next month I can be exact to the changes that I see.</li>
            <li>Just in my first week so will report progress later.  </li>
            <li>WOW!    </li>
            <li>When I got the chance to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, I was pretty open to trying it,</li>
            <li>I have another bottle left (I bought 2 the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m simply amazed how fresh and young my skin looks as far as the color and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Just remember, don&#x27;t use this product at day time, UV light gonna make dark spots on your face, unless you apply sun screen after you apply this serum.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product is that it comes in a glass bottle and has a simple look which I like.</li>
            <li>I have applied the serum consistently in the mornings, once a day, and I have noticed that, although I&#x27;ve been going to bed later than usual and eating more greasy foods at all those summer BBQ parties, my skin has looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will have to say Wow!</li>
            <li>serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find this product for a lot cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li>This vitamin serum not only leaves my face vibrant, smooth, and tight but it also leaves my face more matte and less oily than the Ole Henriksen brand.  </li>
            <li>The price is really affordable for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I have tried out several vitamin C serums over the last several months, and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I went through a bottle of the 800+ positive review &#x27;Oz Naturals&#x27; vitamin C serum before purchasing this brand, only to find out they are exactly the same product.</li>
            <li>(I believe that is the maker of this product) as they have sent some emails with tips and guides to using the oil properly and other suggestions to keep your skin healthy and young.  </li>
            <li>this serum works really well; I do think the areas under my eyes responded slightly better to the other hyaluronic serum I used, but the difference is minimal.  </li>
            <li>There have been times if I do not apply some kind of hydrating product, my skin tends to feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li>I have to agree - it leaves the skin feeling super refreshed and gently tight, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It does not cause a reaction of any kind in my highly sensitive, mixed (dry &amp; oily) skin, a very pl;easant surprise after reacting strongly to other Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin, leaving it soft and supple, glowing, less fine lines and wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural product to noursish the skin and fight signs of aging!&lt;br /&gt;Update - months after first trying this product, I&#x27;m still using it daily!  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product twice, but so far I really like it!</li>
            <li>So when these little &#x27;laugh&#x27; lines came I could see them pretty darn clearly.</li>
            <li>It comes in a fairly big bottle and a little goes a long way, so it seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li>I think I like this stuff, I am on my second bottle, and believe I am seeing the positive changes.</li>
            <li>I have used many expensive serums and this one is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>One to two pumps is enough to cover my face and neck area and it absorbs into my skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used some very pricey serums that don&#x27;t live up to the promises</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and believe that I have half left.  </li>
            <li>and I still have more than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum has done a great job at making my fine lines less noticeable and I can already see a few of my Melasma spots starting to fade a little I have</li>
            <li>This comes in a bottle, with the pump separate, which is great packaging, since the product is less likely to be wasted during treatment</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not strong scented and sunk in easily with no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li>even a few fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li>It is organic and is gentle enough to be used on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been concerned about the fine lines on my face since I hit 30 a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I also have large pores on my nose from teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt softer, some of my wrinkles had significantly decreased and I began looking less like a old man and more like the sexy cougar I am.</li>
            <li>I am comfortable going out without makeup on, I just put one a little blusher.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and granddaughter have commented on the difference in skin tone, no visible dark spots and a clean, clear look.</li>
            <li>product itself is clear, and a bit watery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also clear from the Q&amp;A on this product that the owners care about what they are selling and servicing it.</li>
            <li>98% Natural and 72%</li>
            <li>/&gt;Too early to tell</li>
            <li>My cheeks especially, are much smoother and evenly colored.  </li>
            <li>She was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All the natural components were the biggest point to get this serum.</li>
            <li>I think the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for much, was the pump applicator.  </li>
            <li>I put it on the back of my hands and can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I learned to pump it directly onto my forehead and spread from there, otherwise it runs all over my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my effort to be a “natural, toxic-free” lady, I try to avoid plastics at all costs.</li>
            <li>My skin is tighter and where it was sagging along the jaw line has lifted considerably.  </li>
            <li>I am over 50 years old.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely say that using it on my neck and chest has made a real difference.  </li>
            <li>This made my skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can not always use these types of products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After only 2days my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>is 98% naturally derived and 72% organic, made with vegan hyaluronic acid and organic vitamins C and E.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am seventy years old - I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li>WOW, I&#x27;m a believer</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I saw something about Vitamin C on Dr. Oz, but I only really believed in its efficacy after using it.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and my doctor had suggested I use RetinA to combat wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have always had extremely sensitive skin that has rejected a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li>I provided 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think that it is still early to fully assess its benefits.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to keep testing the product for a longer period of time to see what my long term results are.</li>
            <li>After that I will complete another review or update this one.</li>
            <li>Natural, organic ingredients?</li>
            <li>I thought, why not try it to help lighten up my age spots that have just started appearing on my 60 year old face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every bit of the research I&#x27;ve done says you really out to be using a Vitamin C Serum daily, but it always made me peel a lot.</li>
            <li>this one by far exceeds any of them as far as reducing the size and appearance of pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 so as far as wrinkles go...</li>
            <li>After trying several varieties, I found this Vitamin C Serum by Day by Day and really like it.</li>
            <li>My old serum was 2-3x</li>
            <li>I am 75 yrs old &amp; have been trying to use a Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;for years.</li>
            <li>One thing I was surprised about is that it didn&#x27;t have any citrus fragrance to it - don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really helps with facial wrinkles</li>
            <li>I am in my early sixties.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted for a younger appearance around the eyes, and that is</li>
            <li>I have a pain problem and I have developed a habit of furrowing my brow.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin so soft and leaves your face flowing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day, often twice, for more than a month</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars so far.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>only this Vitamin C Serum has really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 yrs old</li>
            <li>You feel your skin so soft and you can see the changes immediately.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any obvious difference</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m vet surprised about how well it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get focused on all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Really helps with facial wrinkles</li>
            <li>The pump squirts far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought natural beauty products before</li>
            <li>So far, I like what the Vitamin C Serum from Day to Day Beauty has done for my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought natural beauty products before</li>
            <li>So far, I like what the Vitamin C Serum from Day to Day Beauty has done for my skin</li>
            <li>I would say that there I have used about 1/3 of it so far.</li>
            <li>I have tested out lots of serums, I am after all over 50 years old.</li>
            <li>I prefer the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and my hands felt extrememly soft.  </li>
            <li>I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  </li>
            <li>Some users complain that these serums are sticky, but that stickiness goes away in just a few minutes, leaving your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to any woman that wants to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li>My skin felt baby soft.</li>
            <li>And it’s good to know that the serum contains none of the drying chemicals that often appear in expensive</li>
            <li>so I am looking for something to soften those this helps but not as good as the really expensive products that I can not afford all the time.</li>
            <li>I try to use as many natural, paraben-free and organic skin products as possible, and I am in my late thirties and concerned about fine lines, sun spots, and other early signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;• Seems to have removed the temporary fine lines that began to take shape on my forehead due to recent stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>live in Florida, where it&#x27;s hot and humid, so you really tend to feel &#x27;heavy&#x27; or greasy products on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At a local spa a really similar looking product goes for over 90 dollars if I remember right.  </li>
            <li>Also, price is way better than what I used to pay in the past!</li>
            <li>so when I went online to see how other consumers were feeling about it, I was troubled by the fact that there were so many reviews already, and most of them 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to stay loyal to my original find and not give this the full five stars, but negative aspects are hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and since I do have pretty dry skin.. I would patches of skin around my nose and in the space between my eyebrows, well those areas have even improved dramatically.</li>
            <li>I put on the Vitamin C Serum after washing my face and it makes it feel so smooth and tight!  </li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>I was able to test this product for a very small amount...</li>
            <li>product is slightly different from most serums in that it has very little &#x27;slip&#x27;.</li>
            <li>A small amount on a clean face every day will yield a brighter skin, a reduction in fine lines and a tighter skin in just a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t dry and rough feeling and the redness in my cheeks has gone away too and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I could visibly see subtle results and it (my skin results) just kept getting better.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the small lines around my eyes and mouth have smoothed out  and the rest of my face looks smooth and soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, not only is the blue glass pretty-</li>
            <li>Not many facial serums are able to do that for me.</li>
            <li>I have to say that  this Vitamin C Serum has reduced some of the obvious signs of older skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but in case someone is in a tight spot and looking for off brand solutions, I am only writing to describe my personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this serum, and I’m definitely recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>You don’t need much, it goes a long way, and the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>You also do not need much, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>You also do not need much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What attracted me to this product is that it is from all natural and organic ingredients and comes at such a reasonable price (currently $23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal.</li>
            <li>I was back to normal.</li>
            <li>It made my skin brighter and smoother after only a few uses… I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it allows my skin to remain normal oiliness instead of overly oily throughout the day until the next washing!</li>
            <li>I’m in my 30s and have issues with large pores, age spots and dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and also really sensitive skin, so I am really weary on what I buy and what I don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li>, very dark blue to protect the contents from light, with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using a new foundation and noticed that I&#x27;ve got age lines and wrinkles that I&#x27;d not noticed before.</li>
            <li>My dark spots started to lighten right away (within 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li>It works very well on my dry spots.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve seen real results in short amount of time!</li>
            <li>I also have slight crows feet, and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;ve used a lot of products that haven&#x27;t done any thing  some that actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years!</li>
            <li>MAJOR</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more viscous than the other serum I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference in my skin with 2 weeks after using the serum.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to cover your face and it soaks in very quickly.</li>
            <li>It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable.</li>
            <li>The fine lines has faded away slowly.</li>
            <li>I hate strong fragrances and appreciate a more natural smelling skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any dramatic results, however, I imagine that you need to use it for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>I notice a slightly tingling sensation for the first5-10 seconds when I apply it, especially when it is applied close to my eyes; it quickly goes away after that</li>
            <li>I am hoping with using a smaller amount at a time, it helps to make this last a decent amount longer.</li>
            <li>I am realistic in that without the help of more expensive interventional procedures, I will probably bear these scars the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>It may seem a little pricey compared to others, but only 2-3 pumps provides full face coverage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not had any irritation, which I expected a bit since I am sensitive to high concentrations of Vit.</li>
            <li>Hence, I think I would have made it last more than 3 and half weeks if it came with a dropper like the other serums.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work very well even though I was not very consistent.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how great it worked</li>
            <li>generally tend to use the serum both in the morning at at night, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my age spots are starting to clear up</li>
            <li>As a person with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m always worried about the effects products will have - especially on my face.</li>
            <li>After spending thousands on facial skin products promising this and that, in this serum I have finally found one that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>only been usng it a week but have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product is barely thicker than water.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be erasing a lot of the deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>a 28 year old male and don&#x27;t have an explanation for why I&#x27;ve gotten sucked into this vortex of beauty potions, but I can say you&#x27;ll notice a discernible difference in the brightness of your skin when you use these serums.</li>
            <li>young and have finally found something that works.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even barely move it.</li>
            <li>Anyone can get back their natural beauty.</li>
            <li>I actually heard about this through a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>But your never to young to start a daily</li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft, but I have had the same effects using a sugar scrub and some coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>My initial thought was that even if it didn&#x27;t help with those dark spots, the way that it made my skin feel was already worth the price.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>Please do wait a few minutes for the serum to be absorbed before applying anything else.  </li>
            <li>The serum really is a game changer (better yet, a face changer).</li>
            <li>also not surprised when a product doesn’t live up to it</li>
            <li>I just received my bottle a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about half way thru my first bottle and there is a difference already...</li>
            <li>and maybe that is why I really didn&#x27;t see results like I did with the other 20% Vitamin C brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums and found them to be marginally helpful, but the Day By Day Vit C Serum, really has given me &#x27;day by day&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After considering all the above; my rating for this product was initially a 4.5/5, due to the fact that it is more likely to finish faster because of the use of the spray, and also the slight tingling effect.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell bad, it went on so light and smooth.</li>
            <li>The formula itself  is a thin clear consistency, odor free and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ultimate was a lady at church last Sunday morning who peered at me and said, \\&quot;How OLD are you?  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this serum for a short time but so far I like how well it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>In only a few days worth of use</li>
            <li>I believe since this product has given my skin some of the essential things it has been missing, it tends to show less of an aging look and instead, a more youthful look and feel.  </li>
            <li>After only 2 uses, I saw a major changed in the way that my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; initially I would put it directly on my face under moisturizer, but I found it&#x27;s better to put a few drops into the moisturizer / sunscreen and apply.</li>
            <li>It is very watery, but by the same token it is not sticky as other products I have tried</li>
            <li>I think that I am getting some topical vitamin C and when I combine it with other products my skin really soaks it up.</li>
            <li>I also have one rough spot on my face that nothing can really be done about, and it has definitely helped that not to be so obvious!  </li>
            <li>It has been a long time since my face felt so soft.</li>
            <li>and I saw these results within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>and I saw these results within the first few days.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I can feel my skin tightening, but after a few minutes it disappears and I see no difference.</li>
            <li>Most of the serums I have used in the past are usually a little thicker.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin a little tighter, not sure if it does much more than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to lighten those areas and they do work to some extent but for whatever reason, I could never get that particular area to respond.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and acne and since using this product my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I have not seen my skin so clear in so long!</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for the past 2 weeks and think it has really made a difference in keeping my skin clear and youthful.</li>
            <li>It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself needing as much foundation as I previously have had to use.</li>
            <li>From stress with things and exhaustion, I had very visible forehead wrinkles, puffy and dark eyes, and my pores had got larger.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when I purchased the products because so many have promised results, but I never see much change.</li>
            <li>My skin is so hydrated, soft, firm and so vibrant after using it only for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate.  </li>
            <li>I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate.</li>
            <li>In the dry and harsh winter condition, my face feels nourished and fresh.  </li>
            <li>, fast, not controllable like a serum usually is, so you are using alot of product per application ( not like any serum i am used to ), it is thin and watery and will drip right off your finger tip, so you need to cup yor hand and spray it into your palm and rub it in fast as it absorbs fast like water ( not spreadable or creamy in any way), it has little to no smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really scrutinize every little bump and/or pore on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I got after using the product for good two weeks is a bad breakout.  </li>

            <li> I’ve used more than my fair share over the years.</li>
            <li> I kind of expect it now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and loving it.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample bottle of Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This is a nice serum for this price range.</li>
            <li> Product supplied for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product it does a good job,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Dr. Oz Serum is much more superior in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that after using the Day By Day serum, my skin is noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for delivery, the packaging was nice, and delivery was prompt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overjoyed that I found something that works,I&#x27;m loving what I see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> serum has a nice \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> Really nice to see</li>
            <li> am impressed that this beauty product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic and is tested in cruelty-free laboratories, so you can feel comfortable using this incredible serum.  </li>
            <li> and with that kind of integrity</li>
            <li> and it feels nice too.</li>
            <li> However, all opinions expressed are solely my own and in no way influenced.</li>
            <li> but otherwise I liked how my skin looks and feels after using for about a week</li>
            <li> Great price, going to order more for sure.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> It was nice trying it out.</li>
            <li> My reviews are my honest opinion</li>

            <li> My review: I was thrilled to get to review another product by Day by Day Beauty.</li>
            <li> It is effective and has worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels nice when I apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I read, that to be effective, a vitamin C serum must be between 15 and 20 percent.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week I can honestly say that my skin looks brighter and my face is smoother.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses Nicely also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 and have fairly nice skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to keep it looking fairly nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of difference with this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived two days after the order was placed by Pamela, the co-founder of Day by Day Beauty who offered this full-sized product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> , I am very excited that I have already had good results.</li>
            <li> My skin is much cleaner and more beautiful with this great vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It’s scent free, and full of wonderful ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since receiving I&#x27;ve used it by itself as well as under my normal moisturizer and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I received my product free for review purposes (all opinions expressed are those of my own and unbiased!)</li>
            <li> I received a sample, and was happy to try it, as in my opinion, a serum is THE most important part of skin care.</li>
            <li> So, I happily tried it and quickly got even happier to see that the serum isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li> Great price also,  Received so quickly, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> it goes on very easily and it is not sticky</li>
            <li> He has noticed improvement with his skin feeling more hydrated and more of a brighter complexion!</li>
            <li> My skin after even just a couple days seems more supple - It&#x27;s got more life to it!</li>
            <li> Excellent Vitamin C product for my sensitive and acne-prone skin!  </li>
            <li> Best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> In our case, my wife is light skin- fair complexion while I am darker skinned</li>
            <li> it feels and smells nice, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months or more  now</li>
            <li> I just wish it came with more in the bottle, because it’s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Day by Day Beauty also has some nice videos I found which were helpful to learn more about application, ingredients, etc.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face it feels good, making my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I liked this as it makes it more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what in it makes it so effective, but I like to think that it is some Harry Potter magic.</li>
            <li> far as the formula itself, it has no smell (which is great!)</li>
            <li> This is by the best Vitamin C serum that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Vitamin C Serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the skin on my face and neck, feels and looks better than it has in about a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> It’s affordable, natural, and works beautifully!</li>
            <li> so I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> The greatest thing about vitamin c serums is they are natural products.</li>
            <li> The benefits are amazing, softer skin, healthier looking skin, more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> What I can review is the product came in a nice glass bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li> I am sure that this serum is as great as I think it is but the coconut oil may be helping me get better results since it is not only a wonderful oil to use for many reasons, it also helps your skin absorb things.</li>
            <li> , my drawer is full of stuff!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a super nice product at a good price point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and helps shrink pores!</li>
            <li> Love love love this serum!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many but this one seems to be the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using vitamin C serum for the first time and I must say it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with results.</li>
            <li> I recommend this serum to anyone who wants to achieve beautiful youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I look ,my face happy;)))</li>
            <li> I really like that it is beautifully packaged as well, but that is just me.</li>
            <li> Now when I put on foundation, I find I need just a very light touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> for the serum itself, it has a very light, almost water like consistency.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The serum absorbs into skin quickly and feels good all day.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice and light clean smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Very nice , light and clean feel to it</li>
            <li> my face and neck loved the feeling from the very first use.  </li>
            <li> , is very important, but it does seem to boost the results of my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say I had no allergic reaction to this product which, for me, is very important, I use the serum once at night after cleansing and toning my face.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and healthy my face feels after I use it!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serums are a great way to prep the skin for moisturizer as all of the serums I’ve tried contain Hyaluronic acid, which is able to swell and hold a LOT of water, which is great for (dry) skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bottle is large for the price and it lists all of the great ingredients in the serum.</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce fine lines and is perfect for sensitive skin as it is as organic and eco friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good product as far as it&#x27;s results,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own leaves my face feeling very dry, and it gave me breakouts which are a very uncommon thing on my face to see, as I don&#x27;t suffer from acne, yet</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I found my make up applied smoother and look much better since I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely serum.</li>
            <li> It helps plump your skin up, boost collagen production, and give you that dewy look that babies tend to have, but most people lose as they age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am pleased to have used this product (I haven&#x27;t taken a look at the e-book skin information bonus</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> Been using it along with the Hyaluronic acid and am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this Serum.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C is too acidic for me to digest, so being able to apply it topically has been an excellent option.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> The best serum, you&#x27;ll look younger!</li>
            <li> I did :)</li>
            <li> Light weight and not greasy!</li>
            <li> love it takes away bark spots</li>
            <li> I am hooked and this is part of my beauty routine for sure.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look, and feel.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of months - morning and evening for most of the time.</li>
            <li> Will be getting more.  </li>
            <li> I watched the youtube video to make sure I was applying it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s basically unscented.  </li>
            <li> It feels interesting to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I will keep using it to see if it helps even out the sun damage to my face even more, but wanted to get this out here for now.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Ole Henriksen Truth Serum for quite some time and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Has more than just cosmetic effect.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is definitely more even with fading of brown/age spots.</li>
            <li> After using the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum for 4 days, I could tell a difference, for the better, in the look and touch of my skin.</li>
            <li> I received several notes on the best uses for products I order from them.</li>
            <li> I find the price point to be one that is do able..</li>
            <li> I find no product to be magic..</li>
            <li> maybe I would call this a sleeper..:-)</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin felt better in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream that I use instead of foundation is going on more evenly, and I don&#x27;t need as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Miracles can happen, but I&#x27;ll settle for a serum that both works and seems to make everything else work better.  </li>
            <li> Once more, immediately my skin seemed hydrated.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a winner for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will be a permanent addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be better than it was.</li>
            <li> A professed beauty product addict, I have tried many MANY creams, lotions, oils, repair, anti-aging, complexes, serums etc from the drug store brand to the $100/oz bottles.  </li>
            <li> Oh how I love the idea of a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> I love Acure, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my neck and chest and the skin looks more supple and feels tighter.  </li>
            <li> After many years of outdoor activities and sport</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just some gal in upper michigan who was searching for the latest and greatest in skin care for aging skin.</li>
            <li> but the reviews were convincing</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin after one use and even better after each day.</li>
            <li> I love the way it glides on my face feels like silk.</li>
            <li> but i love the product</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there, and I have tried a lot of lotions and creams from department stores.  </li>
            <li> it is doing even better with this serum.  </li>
            <li> The best serum I personally have used had caviar extract in it, but it was 3x this cost.  </li>
            <li> I love this Serum.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product for a couple months, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I also figured I’d be okay with aging and developing wrinkles, but I woke up and realized one day I’m</li>

            <li> My skin looks more brightening, tightening &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> My face look much better and grow too.</li>
            <li> All of the products are much more thicker-which to me indicates more moisturizer or in my opinion hyluranic acid.</li>
            <li> The serum is like water, as many serums are.</li>
            <li> but the advantage there is the more rapid absorption.</li>
            <li> I really love the non greasy face after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t what it is &#x27;meant&#x27; for, but I was pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> I also use on the top of my hands and neck....  </li>
            <li> even the excellent customer service emails detailing how to use the product are the same.</li>
            <li> but I will say that somehow this product seems to work slightly better than the Oz one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The pump applicator is also a great way to use it, versus a jar where you put your finger in it to get some out - with those I always seem to grab too much product.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that swear they reduce wrinkles, so I took my time and researched what the Dermatalogists were reccomending and chose Day by Day.</li>

            <li> First, allow me to say this seller is without a doubt the most proactive in customer service!</li>
            <li> At that exact moment I remembered that my husband told me the evening before that my skin looks more \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; - which is very rare, he&#x27;s not into this kind of remarks.</li>
            <li> I know that vitamin C serums are great for the skin and supposed to help with anti aging, so I will continue to use this serum and see where it’s fabulous natural ingredients get me.</li>
            <li> However, the convenience of the spray outweighs the easily adjustable caveat.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it as a 5/5 because the cons are either easily avoidable or just my nitpicking.</li>
            <li> Until next time keep safe and Happy Halloween in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Good product, saw result fairly early.</li>
            <li> but this is good information to know if I continue to use this product in the future and need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Vitamin C serum, it makes my face smooth and feels fresh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so far i have seen good results.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C has a vital role in skin health, so it is not just good taken for immune support and health</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to review, but my review is totally honest and my real experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product would be good for any skin type, even my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good reviews and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> , in fact, it feels very fresh.</li>
            <li> I had incredible results using the Vitamin C serum alone and with other products.  </li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly, and has made a hugely significant difference in evening the tone, dramatically diminishing pore size, and making my skin luminous.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C Serum from Day by Day Beauty actually improves skin texture, reduces wrinkles and fine lines, and leaves skin looking younger and feeling more elastic.  </li>
            <li> , if my skin looks better, brighter and more even at 5X magnification, imagine what it looks like normally?</li>

            <li> It is super easy to use and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Day By Day Beauty has created a nice natural product that glides on your skin easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it on my face; it soaks in quckly, make it easy and fast to apply.</li>
            <li> Also the price for this kind of Serum is super reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The seller is great, responds quickly to questions and sends instructions on the proper way to use it</li>
            <li> I know vitamin C oxidizes quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a good shelf life, so perhaps I got an old batch of the Oz stuff</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  </li>
            <li> It nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write reviews, but within the short time I have used this serum I have been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried using my original serum for a couple of days just to see if I could tell a difference</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum provides thirsting skin with antioxidants &amp; rich, hydrating ingredients.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m willing to give it more time to achieve the results I look forward to.  </li>
            <li> My first thought was, this must be some sort of Harry Potter magical stuff.</li>
            <li> Yes, love that.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from pretty packaging, how about the consistency?</li>
            <li> I’m excited to share with you</li>
            <li> I have only used it for two days will have to post again on how effective I find it!</li>
            <li> Every morning I&#x27;m excited to look in the mirror to see the results.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this serum</li>
            <li> This is worth a try!</li>
            <li> serum is full of good for skin ingredients and they are going to give even better results in long run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I am delighted to be a part of reviewing this product and others of a similar nature because I truly hope that when I encourage men and women to care for their skin they will take heed and seek out effective products to do just that very thing.</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t know what that is--good) which tells you I am very fair skinned and subject to age spots and the like.</li>
            <li> However, they appear less noticeable even when scrutinized under very good lighting.</li>
            <li> So excited that it is that simply, yet the evidence of GREAT skin is so worth it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and it absorbed will in my skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and layers under any moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So pleased with day by day beauty&#x27;s spa-version of this old favorite.  </li>
            <li> My skin is looking amazing, smooth, soft, radiant.</li>
            <li> It comes out cleanly without drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product gives my skin a nice youthful radiant glow and makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at healing any dry skin and blemishes as well.</li>

            <li> Has made my skin more smooth and firm, it has a nice glow to it!</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin - I was the girl who almost never had pimples...but even then I could look ahead - at my sweet gram - and see the wrinkles that go with this &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; complexion, lol.  </li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs into your skin and wears very well under make-up!</li>
            <li> I will break out in a rash if a product is too much for my skin and this one is absolutely fine!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 days, my skin is much tighter...in a good way!</li>
            <li> Since its cobalt blue bottle minimizes light exposure and also pump applicator is nice and easy to pump without air exposure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this cream has the special ingredients to give them to me.</li>
            <li> As a special gift along with your purchase, you will receive Application Secrets and Pro-Tips, as well as a 100% Satisfaction, 100% money-back guarantee.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had large pores, I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and</li>
            <li> Keeping a realistic head was most important after all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that I should be using a serum as I am used to having pretty much flawless complexion with little to no work.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about doing this product.</li>
            <li> The best part was that my break-out was hardly noticeable as there was no redness to it.  </li>
            <li> If you are concerned with your skin, whether it is dullness, fine lines and wrinkles or it just doesn&#x27;t look right, add some of this product into your routine and you will see results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and my dark splotches have faded greatly!</li>
            <li> I also really love when beauty products have a pump attached to the lid as I don&#x27;t have to worry about pouring out too much or wasting any.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that we get what we pay for.</li>
            <li> OK Maybe I&#x27;m just a skeptic but some of these reviews really concerned me.</li>
            <li> All the reviews said you&#x27;ll  notice changes  in 2 weeks...not true.  </li>
            <li> Ib both our cases, it took about 10 days of regular use to achieve what we believe are good results.</li>
            <li> I find following it with a good moisturizer, as directed</li>
            <li> I can’t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure the ratings aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing for me - I used it for more than a month day and night</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and it looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> The true test was when I was in the store and was thinking about buying another vitamin C serum and could not bring myself to do it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> but when I hit 40 I started to show my true age.</li>
            <li> as much and this product delivered as well and even better.</li>
            <li> Just one pump is typically good enough for me, and I rub it in my skin every morning after my shower and every night before bed.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has a gentle aloe scent (I can&#x27;t handle stinky perfume smells.</li>
            <li> They say you&#x27;ll see full results within 6 months</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great for both of us, even on my sensitive skin which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to new products.</li>

            <li> and I continue to see results, I will be a loyal customer for this product for life.</li>

            <li> No unpleasant odor or stingy when applied</li>
            <li> This is a very simple, nice clean vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to try their new product Hyaluronic Acid Serum to see if it is of more benefit to me.</li>
            <li> It actually felt pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly, and did not end up feeling sticky after applying it.  </li>
            <li> It also helped with dry skin but a good moisturizer is needed after it dries.</li>
            <li> After applying the serum to my face I also noticed that this product is not at all greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I could see improvements the first week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I want her to look as good as me!</li>
            <li> From the first time that I used the product (Product junkie Skeptic!)  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, with smoother and healthier skin, my makeup looks ten times better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have a very oily complexion with sun spots at age 31!!</li>
            <li> Im almost done with my first bottle!</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder more of serum!</li>
            <li> Ladies younger than 50; If I had this product 20 years ago, I&#x27;d sure get a jump start on using it now!</li>
            <li> I love natural products!</li>
            <li> I saw great reviews on this new vitamin Serum, Day by Day, and decided I&#x27;d take my chances one last time.</li>
            <li> - I should note that this is more of a preference thing than an actual con since it is easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This made my skin very smooth, and soft.  </li>
            <li> This product really does improve your complexion, reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> you want a natural product, that absorbs quickly, feels great, and seems to do what it claims, look no further....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with fine lines</li>
            <li> Meaning anyone who wants to keep those fine lines at bay..</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum due to a special on amazon,I must say I was very pleased at how  quick my order arrived&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my case, I use the product mainly for some very fine facial scarring that many mistake for wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using it as a preventative measure, and it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and silky - these are real words for what happens.</li>
            <li> I am really going to enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> moG8HWB5TEU8RO]]I am a bit of a cosmetics junkie and have tried many brands of vitamin c serum and this is by far the most complete serum i ve tried.</li>
            <li> It feels Light, comes out very watery</li>
            <li> I notice that the pores on my nose are smaller which for me is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped visibly reduce my laugh lines .</li>
            <li> I loved being able to implement this into my daily routine with the discount I received only made it easier on my budget.</li>
            <li> and when I am done using the Vitamin C serum, after it has absorbed, I put on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it three times so far as I am watching to make sure that  no skin reactions appear.</li>
            <li> , here’s my nightly regimen for what it’s worth.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> We both found this product as good or better than much more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I love that is natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Giving you hydrated, clear, soft, supple, and simply gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about the benefits of Vitamin C on your skin and the combination of Hyaluronic with it, so I decided it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overnight solution, but I have used it now for about four weeks and have seen a remarkable difference with respect to wrinkles, skin tone and resiliency, and lightening of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth it</li>
            <li> Well Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the smell of the product but it does hydrate my skin leaving it looking fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li> Day by Day Beauty was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Vitamin C Serum to review.</li>
            <li> Of the three serums I have tried this one is my favorite as far as consistency - not too runny,</li>
            <li> It is so worth</li>
            <li> This serum has helped my skin become more soft and some of my hyperpigmentation is lightening.</li>
            <li> My skin also appears brighter and I feel like I look more alive.</li>
            <li> , my skin feel so soft and lovely</li>
            <li> After years of damage by tanning beds to my face I decided to toss the UV&#x27;S and take action to nourish my skin instead of more damage.</li>
            <li> and I think that it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is safe for all skin types including sensitive skin, which I have.</li>
            <li> My face feels supple, soft and looks more youthful.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and I will update this review once I&#x27;ve had time to see results.</li>
            <li> I find that the liquid seems to spread further and more easily, and yet I started with the gel first</li>
            <li> While many of the various Vitamin C serums offered on Amazon get great reviews, I purchased Day by Day based on the sheer number of high marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive serums before, but this one is superior!</li>
            <li> I do note that it is of a much more user friendly consistency than the prior vitamin C product that I purchased, which was like water and dispensed with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> would encourage others to try several varieties and brands of highly rated beauty serums to see what works best for their individual skin.  </li>
            <li> I first started using the Day By Day Serum a little over a month ago and the first thing that I noticed was the pleasant light smell.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that it did leave a residue feeling on my hands, but when touching your face you should always keep your hands clean.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like it really made a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> While you won&#x27;t see a significant difference in a day or two, it really does improve skin texture.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of sun damage and cannot afford a peel right now.</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into skin.  </li>
            <li> The price is definitely right for the product and I will look into replenishing supply of this product when it gets low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They say that the devil is in the details, and this product gets it right in those details.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C, right?</li>
            <li> Some serums were sort of more sticky, one actually burned a bit - but this one is just right!</li>
            <li> The smell is very neutral and my skin feels clean after use.  </li>
            <li> It goes on your skin nice and smooth and it dries quickly without that heavy sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Easy pump dispenser, no messy droppers!</li>
            <li> The bottle comes with the pump which is also very helpful to dispense just the right amount!</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry and rough, this serum makes it feel and look great!  </li>
            <li> and so far so good-goes on quick and leaves it smooth~</li>
            <li> but it is less viscous and more watery than most serums I&#x27;ve used, so care is needed when pumping it onto the finger.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different products, and by far Day By Day is the best.</li>
            <li> Does make you have better skin - suggestions for use, use it twice a day at first (doesn&#x27;t take much to use, as it says on the label, follow up after its absorbed maybe 5 minutes, longer if you just got out of the shower with a good moisturizer) for the first week, once a day for the next week, then twice a week following.</li>
            <li> It was much better though it still burned slightly, barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> What is really great about this serum is that is does not interrupt your usual regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Murad dark spot serum ($50.00 a bottle) and that works good too -</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to attend my 40th High School Reunion this August, to tell everyone my newest \\&quot;secret.\\&quot; AND, buy an additional bottle of Best Vitamin C Serum for my second bathroom, so I don&#x27;t miss a single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sprays out exactly the right amount of serum on each side of the cheek.</li>
            <li> maybe i am using too much as it seems to be going quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use  and no harsh scents.  </li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference and have been told how great my skin looks recently!</li>
            <li> this is such a GREAT price - such a steal!</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to apply with no waste.  </li>
            <li> Classy bottle, pump applicator makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The serum is clear, non-fragrant and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Other than the baggy eyelids, I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin (lucky me!)</li>
            <li> I actually do have pretty great skin- only in my mid-30s-</li>
            <li> And while I was more than happy to get a faster chance to see what the contents of the little blue bottle could do, I didn&#x27;t expect all that much.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> Yes, very much so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective especially with regular use.  </li>
            <li> she says it is very much like using water and oil but hopes it works</li>
            <li> It comes with a pump which I very much prefer, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin but a little enhancement never hurts.</li>
            <li> So for so good, my dark spots are turning lighter!</li>
            <li> Although it is watery (which is not enough of a problem to give this product anything lower than 5 stars), it goes on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love how it dry quick &amp; tighten the skin.</li>
            <li> - All in all this is more of a preference than an actual con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be getting a second bottle for sure...</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My age 38 ;-)</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder more of serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see after even a short period of time that I can see my skin is brighter and looks more tighter and</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, and this would be my first anti-aging product.  </li>
            <li> The lovely blue bottle is one I don&#x27;t even mind leaving out on my dressing table</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have actually been able to feel and SEE the difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Also, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what people were saying about smaller pores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first layer, before a couple of night creams, one containing hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hold out much hope for long term wrinkle eradication, though that would be nice.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first couple of days, I did suffer from some dryness, but that’s all gone now.</li>
            <li> Younger looking for sure</li>
            <li> Label has gotten wet and since smeared and is illegible and I cannot read it, kind of like it was made on someones home computer.  </li>
            <li> My skin texture was smooth and soft after using the product.  </li>
            <li> my many years of using vitamin C serums this is the only one that has made a “visible” difference.</li>
            <li> I have seen a big improvement with the lines on my top lip, and my crows feet.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> I was skeptical probably like you are reading this, like geez, an awesome product on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different products that tighten skin, but most do not help in this area.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to just try the serum first to see.  </li>
            <li> I really like this C Serum!</li>
            <li> With so many skin care products to choose from, you might be tempted to go for a product offering a larger bottle and a fancy package.  </li>
            <li> Don’t be misled by packaging – this product really works!  </li>
            <li> You should give it a try ;)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product at first because its not a well known brand name.</li>
            <li> I took a picture when I first started using it</li>
            <li> This is my second order of the Day By Day Vitamin C Serum product, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> First I have to give the disclaimer that I got this product in order to review it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues with it either.</li>
            <li> It actually feels more smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Vitamin C product!!}</li>
            <li> Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li> After first use my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Company also sent me a 25% off coupon after my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> It will of course be better if they sold it in larger bottles!</li>
            <li> I suffered from cystic acne most of my teen years and as a result, bear the acne scars to prove it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have tried many facial skin products over time.</li>
            <li> I noticed first off that it wasn&#x27;t sticky or tacky at all.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more than one bottle the next time.</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism very likely helps to preserve the quality (better than the dropper bottles for example) of the liquid over time.</li>
            <li> , my skin is better than ever thought possible.  </li>
            <li> it the blue bottle that makes this better?</li>
            <li> I would love to take a bath, daily, in this serum!</li>
            <li> My first time ever buying a Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I had wrinkles around the corners of my eyes, and they&#x27;ve pretty much disappeared!  </li>
            <li> Try it out at least, its worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it really works!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is starting to look more even</li>
            <li> Have wanted to try this product, especially when the signs of aging have started to be more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I first used their Hyaluronic Acid Serum which they recommend being used with this Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> thats the only reason I give it 4 starts vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li> exactly what I got!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more progress, and am definitely making this part of my routine.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a healthy glow, it doesnt leave it with a greasy feel to it, my pores seem smaller and my skin even feels tighter.</li>
            <li> The first moment I used this, I noticed my skin tighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> my face first and then apply the serum followed by my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have not seen any outstanding, noticeable results in the brief two week span.</li>
            <li> I felt/seen the difference on my skin the first day I used it</li>
            <li> Younger looking for sure</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because you cannot go any higher.  </li>
            <li> I started searching for a product online that would help my skin tone, pore size, overall appearance, etc and wasn&#x27;t sure if that product would be a cream, series of products, vitamins, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been seeing a consistent improvement over that time.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week of using this product I noticed tightening of my pores.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny as it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> This product really works on my skin!</li>
            <li> I really like Day by Day Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t know that serums contain a higher concentration than creams.</li>
            <li> when I first tried this I knew there would be no problems.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed is that it does not have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum does what it says it does and more, My skin glows and has brighten  and toned , I will definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a serum</li>
            <li> Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.</li>
            <li> it is absorbed too fast on the skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget that if you are going to use this serum that you for sure apply sunscreen over it, or use it only at night.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever tried any sort of Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I will get more when I get low.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of vit. C serum and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> nothing works overnight, but over a few weeks - I started getting a lot of comments about how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Am absolutely delighted with results in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> i love love this product-so far it has faded the little sun spots i had across my nose area-goes on quick and absorbes  </li>
            <li> It is super light, thick, easily absorbed into skin, I love the way my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li> After spending many dollars on just the right cleanser, moisturizer, toner, etc...I was in search of something natural that I could put on this 60 years young face that is beginning to show some wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing I liked about the product was its easy absorption – It wasn’t thick or smelly.</li>
            <li> I responded to an email I received asking how I liked the product, and I got a live human to respond to me within 30 minutes of receiving my email.  </li>
            <li> The added benefits of the ingredients is like vitamins for my skin, antioxidants that go right to the much needed aging spot.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin feels much softer and the fine lines around my face are no where near as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Who knows, I did see some positive results when I first started using Oz</li>
            <li> However I give it a 2 star rating because in combination with Crazy Beautiful Face Creme it disappears all my fine lines and wrinkles and minimizes my pores right away.</li>
            <li> , I can’t say I’m pumped about the new pump, much preferring the original glass dropper</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skin care products most with no visible results but after trying this product for just a week I can see a definite difference in my fine lines and frown marks I am totally surprised!</li>
            <li> Although it did not improve my symptoms enough to completely endorse it, it did not irritate my skin and during that time I received amazing customer service, advice and help from the owners of the company.</li>
            <li> I have never had such quick delivery and such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes, but I do see a general smoother appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li> It felt fresh on my face, was smooth, but non-greasy and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> not so fair complexion (Irish versus Italian).</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t give a complete review because I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for as long as I would have liked to (only about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Less lines instead of more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I have been using this product for three months now and have noticed  positive changes with my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product  after  reading  all the positive  reviews and have been using it twice a day for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> (I saw a lot of people that felt the positive reviews were from marketers I guess).</li>
            <li> Once that dries I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with SPF30.  </li>
            <li> (sp)- I thought I&#x27;d try something cheaper and these reviews were so positive.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the Vitamin C serum and reading all the reviews I knew this product was going to add positive change to my skin.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I don&#x27;t use much in the way of creams and lotions and potions because I break out with all of them.</li>
            <li> (I find I have to shave first however) and hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li> After using the first bottle I didn&#x27;t really see any changes.  </li>
            <li> A have been gently exfoliating first, then using it (even though I know you are not supposed to exfoliate every day).&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance, and it is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands and Day by Day Beauty has, by far, made the best Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> If the sprayer could be improved with something that worked as well as the dispensers on other products I own, I&#x27;d increase the rating to 4 or 5 stars, but the packaging really does take away from ease of use.</li>
            <li> Consequently, Best Vitamin C Serum will gently tighten facial and delicate neck skin.  </li>
            <li> bottle is small but lasts a good while.  </li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is a good characteristics.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some improvement in my skin but way too early to give a full review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and almost all natural (98%), I&#x27;d rather not put something full of chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it dries quickly, which is great in my (hurried) morning routine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this Vit C serum very long, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used some other high priced vitamin-c serums and haven&#x27;t been as pleased as I have been with Day By Day Beauty&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The only thing is, the serum seems more watery than other vitamin c serums, but maybe that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li> At this point, that could only make it a true miracle oil for me!  </li>
            <li> it is well worth the price and risk of a new product..</li>
            <li> Obviously it was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> super quick-this is a winner-makes your skin soft and the plus of fading my sun spots!big</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this serum seems to help any blotchiness or redness that I have experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t feel my age</li>
            <li> My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate.</li>
            <li> It squirts out a large amount</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and sometimes large pore issues</li>
            <li> One thing is certain, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My biggest skin problem is oily skin, large pores, acne and inflammation.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the long term benefits of using this on a daily basis, I love that there is no scent, and that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> The pretty blue bottle with simple label was very spa like and looks nice sitting out.</li>
            <li> My under eyes are not much better yet, but I have been so tired that I am sure that until I get good sleep they can not get much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles of it because I use it on my neck as well as my face - and even down to my decollete&#x27; (upper chest area exposed more in the summer beneath tops with lower necklines) -</li>
            <li> Such as fine lines diminishing and a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> This was the first Vitamin C serum I purchased (from the reviews) and I have since purchased other Vitamin C serums, one of which I like much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen definite improvement in the texture and appearance of fine lines around my face and eyes.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks of use, I can already see the fine lines around the corners of my eyes disappear.</li>
            <li> lines softened, skin plumper more youthful looking, dry, flaky skin gone, spots lightened!</li>
            <li> Key ingredients in the fight against age spots, wrinkles, and those stubborn fine lines.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, pores smaller, and fine wrinkles have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C is decent!</li>
            <li> Adovia has been a lifesaver for me, it helped with my confidence also, from having clear skin for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum every day for several weeks, and my skin has not looked so good in a very long time!  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff makes my skin feel and, though I&#x27;ve only been using about 6 weeks, think my fine lines are improving a bit.</li>
            <li> My forehead now has a little bit worse of fine lines which is great from having kind of deep wrinkles eleven days ago.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t believe there is a very high amount of Vitamin C in this product.</li>
            <li> The serum is very easy to dispense from the bottle just press down on the pump and put some in the palm of my hand and apply it  with my fingertips to my face.</li>
            <li> I could really see a difference in my face being moisturized and</li>
            <li> This is the fastest absorbing serum I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I assume it is very informative)</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li> Really gets into the skin and leaves your face moistured</li>
            <li> I just finished using a whole bottle</li>
            <li> Expected better results than I received.  </li>
            <li> This product to me is very runny and the nozzle just makes the serum go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> so it really nourishes and hydrates my skin which makes it look healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a difference on my face and am very with the results.</li>
            <li> Day by Day features vitamin C, one of the most essential,  natural beautifiers, and it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum has done the trick to make my face not so scaly looking, because no woman wants to go out on a date and have scaly looking skin.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin feel so much smoother</li>
            <li> By Day is a third of the price and a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for 30 days and really did not see much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them very reliable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to what this product can do.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Regarding the packaging, I would recommend that the bottle have a &amp;#34;see-thru&amp;#34; area so that you know how much product is remaining in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But....what has really sold me on this product has been the gradual evening of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> In a couple of weeks I may be comfortable enough to upload some pictures!</li>
            <li> Before, my forehead was filled with tiny pimples or zits.</li>
            <li> and I really like how my face feels.  </li>
            <li> I have seen where it is suggested to take  phytoceramides with it for it to really work.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After applying this material for five days in a row after I shower, I am really stunned at what it does.  </li>
            <li> did not expect anything to happen, but this was a real surprise.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> It really smooths out my skin texture, and noticeably reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have found it really works for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I can feel how much smoother and softer the skin is.  </li>
            <li> My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin, isn&#x27;t oily, and absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews but for this product- I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very diligent and followed directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to thank the supplier for the very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> but I really like how it is really working.</li>
            <li> Going back to the product, I have used it every night and there is NO DIFFERENCE in my light freckles, age spots or frown line reduction.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> it was a relief to have a product that doesn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li> Everything from the proper packaging to ensure your product isn&#x27;t tampered with and has minimal exposure to light and oxygen, to the natural and effective ingredients to give me brighter, plumper skin with fewer lines.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the serum as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> It is not gone but it is much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use it when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Very close customer service.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I stopped the use since it was too much oil for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much of a change in my pore size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Of the serums, I much prefer the 100% hyaluronic acid..</li>
            <li> It works real well...</li>
            <li> Your pump thingy doesn&#x27;t work very well though....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but it does go on well</li>
            <li> and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tested this theory because the company said, \\&quot;we are real people and we care\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I really see a difference around the eyes.</li>
            <li> ; at this juncture in my life and this product really spoke to me.</li>
            <li> Received fast , got for a friend</li>
            <li> A lot of vitamin serums tend to be really tacky.</li>
            <li> really like the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more products that are not just lightly scented but as NATURAL as possible and this serum definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use these products for myself but to hear things from others is really validating.</li>
            <li> After almost 30 days, my skin looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference after 90 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Often, the light-feeling serums don&#x27;t really seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and after using this product, I have seen that my face does not get as oily as fast as it did when I was not using the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I use this for my whole face</li>
            <li> Since using this product as directed, I can feel a real difference in the moisture in my skin.  </li>
            <li> works fast</li>
            <li> worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I have read that Vitamins E and C can really help.</li>
            <li> It seems to smooth the skin and tighten pores with an effect similar to that of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I had to give it a try, although I have never been one to experience much of a difference between one cream or serum from another.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was a bit perplexed to the fact facial skin was just not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who wants a working product</li>
            <li> They are very intune with you being and staying their customer.  </li>
            <li> but they really care how it is working for you.  </li>
            <li> My skin also looks so much brighter</li>
            <li> Not visibly but when applying liquid foundation I noticed it didn&#x27;t look caked into my pores as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin and gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;“Premium Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, &amp; Vitamin E Trio penetrate to beautify your skin fast.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated having these instructions.</li>
            <li> but after two days it won&#x27;t change too much.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to any woman!</li>
            <li> That, to me, was validation that the serum is really impactful</li>
            <li> It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> Both make my pores smaller, moisturize well, and smooth my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not greasy at all and it absorbs very</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this product!</li>
            <li> Received item fast.</li>
            <li> it goes fast.</li>
            <li> And you smell really god after using it.</li>
            <li> Day By Day Vitamin C serum is definitely on my list of favorite Vitamin C serums I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s many forms for disease management/prevention, but this topical surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I am only 36, but I have as many wrinkles as a 68 year old sailor.</li>
            <li> Currently this company carries two products and I hope they will produce more skin care products in the near future!23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal.</li>
            <li> , I try all of them for at least 3 weeks before I write my reviews, otherwise it just wouldn&#x27;t be fair to each company.  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself looks smaller than the picture implies, but a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, it feels so light on the skin, you can apply your normal makeup right over top of this once it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin, making it easy to fit into your morning routine, and you don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other serums and moisturizers with vitamin C and loved them, but Day by Day made my skin look ruddy and coarse.</li>
            <li> unique Vitamin C Serum is overall a gentle and non-sticky formula.</li>
            <li> It definitely nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients &amp; makes your skin looked and felt noticeably smoother and healthier over time while using this product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better!</li>
            <li> thought it would make any improvement; i now have bumpy spots on my skin (no, not acne or pimples) and there is no smoothness or any of the other notable features of this product...</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but again not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to have my younger look along with me!</li>
            <li> So far I really like it, but need more time to see if it makes a long term difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad for all the other&#x27;s that reviewed this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is an essential for adding antioxidants, rich and hydrating ingredients to your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife says she likes it better than other serums she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;• 30ml is already a big size but with the spray mechanic it is easy to succumb to spraying more than needed per application – Again, this can be avoided by using a dropper or unwinding the spray cap and dabbing little amounts of the product on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean, nourished, and younger.</li>
            <li> Among the first few things he told me was: you look extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this product I noticed that my skin was more firm.</li>
            <li> It is such a power house of ingredients with true benefits and yet so gentle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said it in previous posts, I love blue glass-but it also helps minimize exposure to the light (in case you have your bottle in a brightly-lit room).</li>
            <li> Well, what I noticed about this particular serum is that it is very watery.</li>
            <li> Its pure vitamin C, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel terrific.</li>
            <li> I have to really cup my hand when I pump it out because it will drip right off if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I will put some on if there is a special occasion, but for daily use, I just never have.</li>
            <li> I am however highly optimistic, and this small bottle seems to be able to be used for awhile!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C cream for along time but recently found the Day By Day product and have really noticed that its use has stepped up the results tremendously.  </li>
            <li> This actually goes on easy, and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check back in with a full report.</li>
            <li> The rest of us wish the mirror wouldn’t repeat them over and over again (this gets old fast!).</li>
            <li> I would address this review to anyone (male or female) who wants a more even skin</li>
            <li> It is simply because those types of products need time to truly see the results and to reflect on their true benefit.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a dark bottle to protect the ingredients from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> I used the Vitamin C serum alone at first since I have sensitive skin and eye area.  </li>
            <li> I look at least 5-7 yrs younger and people actually touch my face and tell me what a beautiful completion I have!</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of water, exercise regularly and watch what I eat, but still, my skin never looks very &amp;#34;healthly!&amp;#34;  I have only been using this product a couple of weeks and have seen the most improvement of any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> also I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;m just starting to really focus on my skin since the magical age 30 is coming up just next year.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise this has smoothed the area down more than anything else.</li>
            <li> I went back to my other kind, twice as much.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine let me know about this product - she liked it a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling behind, as do a number of other popular serums out there.</li>
            <li> It does go on better when my face is slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> and I can see less visible crow&#x27;s feet and more supple and softer skin after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasted more than half a year&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My skin has changed a lot since having kids and getting older.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this and made the following observations: It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> many more expensive).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a $28 moisturizer that just was not working, in fact, my skin had started going backwards and looking older.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to any one with skin that is older with sun damage.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the best way to review skin care is simply to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is living up to its claims and since I’m so satisfied with its initial results, I’m going to start using it during the day as well before applying my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It dries near instantly leaving skin smooth immediately.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this serum, the overall tone of my skin is more even and brighter, and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> It has also helped to reduce the crater sized pores on my face and given an overall healthy younger look.</li>
            <li> I have always had decent skin but getting older, lets try some of these things.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the pump applicator.</li>
            <li> I could not believe such inexpensive products could show these types of results so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am very white and this Serum has brought more color back in to my face.</li>
            <li> Since using this serum, I&#x27;ve noticed an overall brightness to my skin and a more overall even skin tone.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I also think my pores are smaller, and overall my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> i wish i could give a realistic review</li>
            <li> just too much for my very sensitive</li>
            <li> This vitamin C skin serum from Day by Day Beauty is clear and very slightly viscous, with a clean scent, primarily of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> You absorb it incredibly fast, and it&#x27;s incredibly natural!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a product in a long time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see its long term</li>
            <li> I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it has done nothing that it &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; to help with.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> this is a product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys for creating a serum that works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend it highly for discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes that it will improve my skin over time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had been on the market for a high quality serum and came across this one.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone, my dad even uses it now for age spots on his bald head.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High grade vitamin c serum to be used with hyalonic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I decided to spoil myself with this lovely c + e serum, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed…</li>
            <li> my wrinkles and pores they also seem a little better</li>
            <li> But in the not-always-friendly glare of my bathroom lights, I do think that my skin looks a little more</li>
            <li> I had bought other Vitamin C Serum that was thicker and easily stayed in place,  this serum did not.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is primarily an anti-aging product, and though I am only 24 and do not have major signs of aging just yet, I did notice my skin was brighter and my freckles had faded.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it gives a nice glow and radiance whereas moisturizing cream alone can leave my skin a bit dull”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because I really like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, and it has just been a week.  </li>
            <li> So far, i haven&#x27;t  really  seen a difference.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see much difference.  </li>
            <li> I use it as directed, on a clean, dry face.</li>
            <li> So far, this one really delivers.  </li>
            <li> I am going to keep using it and follow up with a update after a few more weeks and see what the results are then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I see in the mirror: the skin is more firm than before</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this serum for a few days now, and I think I’m in love.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this product as much as i want to do to a small bout with psoriasis on my forehead,but as i am now useing a cream for that</li>
            <li> I have pretty deep lines under my eyes and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in those</li>
            <li> I wash my face as I normally would,</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the low price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, although I know I should</li>
            <li> This is already a combination of Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C which is what we normally apply after using a dermaroller.  </li>
            <li> Currently this company carries two products and I hope they will produce more skin care products in the near future!</li>
            <li> it said it was soap, which soap normally helps clog my pores.</li>
            <li> But this bar was not sudsy, nor did it create soap film that normally sticks to the skin if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth or sponge.</li>
            <li> The fluid is easily absorbed and you see immediate results.</li>
            <li> It does dry my face but not so much that my face becomes uncomfortable with a light mouistizer I am good to go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally learned that instead of rubbing in a serum, it should be patted into the face and then allowed to air dry before putting moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, more even toned and the wrinkles near my eyes are slightly less visible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also an easy product to incorporate into your daily routine or use to start a daily routine if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
            <li> I normally use Dr. Oz serum and thought I would try a new brand</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much improvement for fine lines but that could be because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> but this product was super easy to incorporate, especially since it dried</li>
            <li> The serum is almost of a liquid consistency which helps the product to be absorbed but also makes it a little tricky when applying it, so you need to gently press the pump to avoid wasting the serum as it is unlike most other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> So I wonder if Iam seeing a little quicker results because of the coconut oil, or this serum is really that fantastic.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on a new serum, &amp;#34;Day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff...use after each face washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of skin products before - and am continually on the look out for new things -</li>
            <li> I feel like my face has a new glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively new product by a new company</li>
            <li> Normally this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d be interested it, but I can&#x27;t ignore that parts of my face definitely show their age.</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s important to tell, I truly give each product plenty of time to show some results and I&#x27;m religious with my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The only thing I like about this serum is the fact that it&#x27;s very light and water-based, not sticky or greasy or make your face shiny looking, other than that I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for even sensitive skin users.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and never broke out from this.</li>
            <li> I am very conscious about what goes on and in to my body and this formula is made up of 72% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> my very sensitive skin tolerated the product with no irritation.</li>
            <li> am 60 &amp; I live in florida and stay outdoors a l am anxious to see after more time of use if this helps with my sun spots.</li>
            <li> So far, so good...two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> So the first day, I just applied it on the back of one hand to see if I would have any adverse reaction to the serum.  </li>
            <li> I was using the last drops from my first bottle when I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li> PS if this helps anyone, I am pretty European in origin (bl hair/green eyes etc).</li>
            <li> To our delight, it is working better than the much more expensive prescription!</li>
            <li> My wife and I were regular users of a variety of other products costing much more than this product.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> My skin is the exact same as 2 weeks ago when I started, no difference</li>
            <li> Maybe next month I can be exact to the changes that I see.</li>
            <li> Just in my first week so will report progress later.  </li>
            <li> WOW!    </li>
            <li> When I got the chance to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, I was pretty open to trying it,</li>
            <li> I have another bottle left (I bought 2 the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply amazed how fresh and young my skin looks as far as the color and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, don&#x27;t use this product at day time, UV light gonna make dark spots on your face, unless you apply sun screen after you apply this serum.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is that it comes in a glass bottle and has a simple look which I like.</li>
            <li> I have applied the serum consistently in the mornings, once a day, and I have noticed that, although I&#x27;ve been going to bed later than usual and eating more greasy foods at all those summer BBQ parties, my skin has looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will have to say Wow!</li>
            <li> serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product for a lot cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li> This vitamin serum not only leaves my face vibrant, smooth, and tight but it also leaves my face more matte and less oily than the Ole Henriksen brand.  </li>
            <li> The price is really affordable for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have tried out several vitamin C serums over the last several months, and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I went through a bottle of the 800+ positive review &#x27;Oz Naturals&#x27; vitamin C serum before purchasing this brand, only to find out they are exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> (I believe that is the maker of this product) as they have sent some emails with tips and guides to using the oil properly and other suggestions to keep your skin healthy and young.  </li>
            <li> this serum works really well; I do think the areas under my eyes responded slightly better to the other hyaluronic serum I used, but the difference is minimal.  </li>
            <li> There have been times if I do not apply some kind of hydrating product, my skin tends to feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I have to agree - it leaves the skin feeling super refreshed and gently tight, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does not cause a reaction of any kind in my highly sensitive, mixed (dry &amp; oily) skin, a very pl;easant surprise after reacting strongly to other Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin, leaving it soft and supple, glowing, less fine lines and wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural product to noursish the skin and fight signs of aging!&lt;br /&gt;Update - months after first trying this product, I&#x27;m still using it daily!  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, but so far I really like it!</li>
            <li> So when these little &#x27;laugh&#x27; lines came I could see them pretty darn clearly.</li>
            <li> It comes in a fairly big bottle and a little goes a long way, so it seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li> I think I like this stuff, I am on my second bottle, and believe I am seeing the positive changes.</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive serums and this one is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> One to two pumps is enough to cover my face and neck area and it absorbs into my skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used some very pricey serums that don&#x27;t live up to the promises</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and believe that I have half left.  </li>
            <li> and I still have more than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum has done a great job at making my fine lines less noticeable and I can already see a few of my Melasma spots starting to fade a little I have</li>
            <li> This comes in a bottle, with the pump separate, which is great packaging, since the product is less likely to be wasted during treatment</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not strong scented and sunk in easily with no residue feeling.  </li>
            <li> even a few fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is organic and is gentle enough to be used on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been concerned about the fine lines on my face since I hit 30 a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I also have large pores on my nose from teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt softer, some of my wrinkles had significantly decreased and I began looking less like a old man and more like the sexy cougar I am.</li>
            <li> I am comfortable going out without makeup on, I just put one a little blusher.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughter have commented on the difference in skin tone, no visible dark spots and a clean, clear look.</li>
            <li> product itself is clear, and a bit watery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also clear from the Q&amp;A on this product that the owners care about what they are selling and servicing it.</li>
            <li> 98% Natural and 72%</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too early to tell</li>
            <li> My cheeks especially, are much smoother and evenly colored.  </li>
            <li> She was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> All the natural components were the biggest point to get this serum.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for much, was the pump applicator.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the back of my hands and can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I learned to pump it directly onto my forehead and spread from there, otherwise it runs all over my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my effort to be a “natural, toxic-free” lady, I try to avoid plastics at all costs.</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter and where it was sagging along the jaw line has lifted considerably.  </li>
            <li> I am over 50 years old.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely say that using it on my neck and chest has made a real difference.  </li>
            <li> This made my skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can not always use these types of products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After only 2days my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> is 98% naturally derived and 72% organic, made with vegan hyaluronic acid and organic vitamins C and E.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am seventy years old - I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> WOW, I&#x27;m a believer</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I saw something about Vitamin C on Dr. Oz, but I only really believed in its efficacy after using it.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and my doctor had suggested I use RetinA to combat wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive skin that has rejected a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li> I provided 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think that it is still early to fully assess its benefits.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to keep testing the product for a longer period of time to see what my long term results are.</li>
            <li> After that I will complete another review or update this one.</li>
            <li> Natural, organic ingredients?</li>
            <li> I thought, why not try it to help lighten up my age spots that have just started appearing on my 60 year old face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every bit of the research I&#x27;ve done says you really out to be using a Vitamin C Serum daily, but it always made me peel a lot.</li>
            <li> this one by far exceeds any of them as far as reducing the size and appearance of pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 so as far as wrinkles go...</li>
            <li> After trying several varieties, I found this Vitamin C Serum by Day by Day and really like it.</li>
            <li> My old serum was 2-3x</li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs old &amp; have been trying to use a Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;for years.</li>
            <li> One thing I was surprised about is that it didn&#x27;t have any citrus fragrance to it - don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Really helps with facial wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am in my early sixties.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted for a younger appearance around the eyes, and that is</li>
            <li> I have a pain problem and I have developed a habit of furrowing my brow.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin so soft and leaves your face flowing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day, often twice, for more than a month</li>
            <li>  I give it 5 stars so far.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> only this Vitamin C Serum has really worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs old</li>
            <li> You feel your skin so soft and you can see the changes immediately.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any obvious difference</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m vet surprised about how well it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get focused on all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Really helps with facial wrinkles</li>
            <li> The pump squirts far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought natural beauty products before</li>
            <li> So far, I like what the Vitamin C Serum from Day to Day Beauty has done for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought natural beauty products before</li>
            <li> So far, I like what the Vitamin C Serum from Day to Day Beauty has done for my skin</li>
            <li> I would say that there I have used about 1/3 of it so far.</li>
            <li> I have tested out lots of serums, I am after all over 50 years old.</li>
            <li> I prefer the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and my hands felt extrememly soft.  </li>
            <li> I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> Some users complain that these serums are sticky, but that stickiness goes away in just a few minutes, leaving your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any woman that wants to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> My skin felt baby soft.</li>
            <li> And it’s good to know that the serum contains none of the drying chemicals that often appear in expensive</li>
            <li> so I am looking for something to soften those this helps but not as good as the really expensive products that I can not afford all the time.</li>
            <li> I try to use as many natural, paraben-free and organic skin products as possible, and I am in my late thirties and concerned about fine lines, sun spots, and other early signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;• Seems to have removed the temporary fine lines that began to take shape on my forehead due to recent stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> live in Florida, where it&#x27;s hot and humid, so you really tend to feel &#x27;heavy&#x27; or greasy products on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At a local spa a really similar looking product goes for over 90 dollars if I remember right.  </li>
            <li> Also, price is way better than what I used to pay in the past!</li>
            <li> so when I went online to see how other consumers were feeling about it, I was troubled by the fact that there were so many reviews already, and most of them 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to stay loyal to my original find and not give this the full five stars, but negative aspects are hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and since I do have pretty dry skin.. I would patches of skin around my nose and in the space between my eyebrows, well those areas have even improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> I put on the Vitamin C Serum after washing my face and it makes it feel so smooth and tight!  </li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product for a very small amount...</li>
            <li> product is slightly different from most serums in that it has very little &#x27;slip&#x27;.</li>
            <li> A small amount on a clean face every day will yield a brighter skin, a reduction in fine lines and a tighter skin in just a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dry and rough feeling and the redness in my cheeks has gone away too and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I could visibly see subtle results and it (my skin results) just kept getting better.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the small lines around my eyes and mouth have smoothed out  and the rest of my face looks smooth and soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, not only is the blue glass pretty-</li>
            <li> Not many facial serums are able to do that for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say that  this Vitamin C Serum has reduced some of the obvious signs of older skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but in case someone is in a tight spot and looking for off brand solutions, I am only writing to describe my personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this serum, and I’m definitely recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> You don’t need much, it goes a long way, and the 1 oz.</li>
            <li> You also do not need much, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You also do not need much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What attracted me to this product is that it is from all natural and organic ingredients and comes at such a reasonable price (currently $23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal.</li>
            <li> I was back to normal.</li>
            <li> It made my skin brighter and smoother after only a few uses… I would most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it allows my skin to remain normal oiliness instead of overly oily throughout the day until the next washing!</li>
            <li> I’m in my 30s and have issues with large pores, age spots and dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and also really sensitive skin, so I am really weary on what I buy and what I don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> , very dark blue to protect the contents from light, with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using a new foundation and noticed that I&#x27;ve got age lines and wrinkles that I&#x27;d not noticed before.</li>
            <li> My dark spots started to lighten right away (within 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my dry spots.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve seen real results in short amount of time!</li>
            <li> I also have slight crows feet, and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;ve used a lot of products that haven&#x27;t done any thing  some that actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years!</li>
            <li> MAJOR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more viscous than the other serum I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference in my skin with 2 weeks after using the serum.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to cover your face and it soaks in very quickly.</li>
            <li> It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable.</li>
            <li> The fine lines has faded away slowly.</li>
            <li> I hate strong fragrances and appreciate a more natural smelling skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any dramatic results, however, I imagine that you need to use it for more than a month.  </li>
            <li> I notice a slightly tingling sensation for the first5-10 seconds when I apply it, especially when it is applied close to my eyes; it quickly goes away after that</li>
            <li> I am hoping with using a smaller amount at a time, it helps to make this last a decent amount longer.</li>
            <li> I am realistic in that without the help of more expensive interventional procedures, I will probably bear these scars the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey compared to others, but only 2-3 pumps provides full face coverage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had any irritation, which I expected a bit since I am sensitive to high concentrations of Vit.</li>
            <li> Hence, I think I would have made it last more than 3 and half weeks if it came with a dropper like the other serums.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work very well even though I was not very consistent.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how great it worked</li>
            <li> generally tend to use the serum both in the morning at at night, followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my age spots are starting to clear up</li>
            <li> As a person with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m always worried about the effects products will have - especially on my face.</li>
            <li> After spending thousands on facial skin products promising this and that, in this serum I have finally found one that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> only been usng it a week but have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product is barely thicker than water.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be erasing a lot of the deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> a 28 year old male and don&#x27;t have an explanation for why I&#x27;ve gotten sucked into this vortex of beauty potions, but I can say you&#x27;ll notice a discernible difference in the brightness of your skin when you use these serums.</li>
            <li> young and have finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even barely move it.</li>
            <li> Anyone can get back their natural beauty.</li>
            <li> I actually heard about this through a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> But your never to young to start a daily</li>
            <li> It does make your skin soft, but I have had the same effects using a sugar scrub and some coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> My initial thought was that even if it didn&#x27;t help with those dark spots, the way that it made my skin feel was already worth the price.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> Please do wait a few minutes for the serum to be absorbed before applying anything else.  </li>
            <li> The serum really is a game changer (better yet, a face changer).</li>
            <li> also not surprised when a product doesn’t live up to it</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about half way thru my first bottle and there is a difference already...</li>
            <li> and maybe that is why I really didn&#x27;t see results like I did with the other 20% Vitamin C brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums and found them to be marginally helpful, but the Day By Day Vit C Serum, really has given me &#x27;day by day&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After considering all the above; my rating for this product was initially a 4.5/5, due to the fact that it is more likely to finish faster because of the use of the spray, and also the slight tingling effect.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell bad, it went on so light and smooth.</li>
            <li> The formula itself  is a thin clear consistency, odor free and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ultimate was a lady at church last Sunday morning who peered at me and said, \\&quot;How OLD are you?  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a short time but so far I like how well it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> In only a few days worth of use</li>
            <li> I believe since this product has given my skin some of the essential things it has been missing, it tends to show less of an aging look and instead, a more youthful look and feel.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 uses, I saw a major changed in the way that my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; initially I would put it directly on my face under moisturizer, but I found it&#x27;s better to put a few drops into the moisturizer / sunscreen and apply.</li>
            <li> It is very watery, but by the same token it is not sticky as other products I have tried</li>
            <li> I think that I am getting some topical vitamin C and when I combine it with other products my skin really soaks it up.</li>
            <li> I also have one rough spot on my face that nothing can really be done about, and it has definitely helped that not to be so obvious!  </li>
            <li> It has been a long time since my face felt so soft.</li>
            <li> and I saw these results within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> and I saw these results within the first few days.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on I can feel my skin tightening, but after a few minutes it disappears and I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Most of the serums I have used in the past are usually a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin a little tighter, not sure if it does much more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to lighten those areas and they do work to some extent but for whatever reason, I could never get that particular area to respond.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and acne and since using this product my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I have not seen my skin so clear in so long!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for the past 2 weeks and think it has really made a difference in keeping my skin clear and youthful.</li>
            <li> It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself needing as much foundation as I previously have had to use.</li>
            <li> From stress with things and exhaustion, I had very visible forehead wrinkles, puffy and dark eyes, and my pores had got larger.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased the products because so many have promised results, but I never see much change.</li>
            <li> My skin is so hydrated, soft, firm and so vibrant after using it only for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate.  </li>
            <li> I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate.</li>
            <li> In the dry and harsh winter condition, my face feels nourished and fresh.  </li>
            <li> , fast, not controllable like a serum usually is, so you are using alot of product per application ( not like any serum i am used to ), it is thin and watery and will drip right off your finger tip, so you need to cup yor hand and spray it into your palm and rub it in fast as it absorbs fast like water ( not spreadable or creamy in any way), it has little to no smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really scrutinize every little bump and/or pore on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I got after using the product for good two weeks is a bad breakout.  </li>
            <li> Every serum I have used that is worth its salt is thick and not diluted.  </li>
            <li> serum has a thick consistency that your skin just absorbs right up.  </li>
            <li> always have chronically dry skin which can make even the lightest foundation look cakey if I’m not careful.</li>
            <li> Reason for only 4 stars, it was very watery, thinner than the usual serum.</li>
            <li> : we are late thirties, white, freckled, some fine wrinkles coming in over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I have found my fountain of youth, or at least pretty blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that my pores have necessarily reduced in size as others have claimed; however, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to answer that.  </li>
            <li> I discovered hyaluronic acid as a beauty product not too long ago and now consider it an essential part of my daily skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> I can comment on the fact that it has no scent or odor which I really do like because I hate putting anything near my eyes that has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the pump to dispense this product, as a different brand of serum came with a dropper with which to apply and it was very messy.</li>
            <li> Day by Day serum so far, after a month and a half of use, has helped to heal and fade damage by the sun that has occured to my facial skin.</li>
            <li> product absorbs in and is pleasant enough to use,and doesn&#x27;t have an annoying scent.  </li>
            <li> I had a dark spot that is now almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Now you&#x27;re ready for your usual day or night</li>
            <li> This product comes with a small pump, and you do not need  much.</li>
            <li> They usually do, but this time they disappeared much quicker.</li>
            <li> Or, maybe I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough!</li>
            <li> There are no direct issues with the seller, this is only a review of the product.</li>
            <li> - the only thing minor thing I don&#x27;t care for about this product.).  </li>
            <li> My skin which unfortunately has a more than a few old acne scars, is already looking brighter and the scars lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs immediately into the skin, so I don&#x27;t have to wait for 10 minutes before putting on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I just want to help the next potential victim look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I am turning 40 and as such, I will just about try everything to keep my skin looking young and tight.</li>
            <li> but it only uses a little to completely cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I used this I noticed a little change in my forehead and the color of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This will last me a very very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin.  </li>
            <li> And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin.</li>
            <li> Since I had my son two years ago, I noticed my face looked and felt dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially concerned with how dry the skin around my eyes seems to be and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, break-out prone skin, that is also prone to redness; while using this I have noticed brighter, smoother skin, and less redness.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t gone away completely but they have become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is one one that works, I had no idea it would be that dramatic, and that quick acting, so yay science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Using the serum completely by itself tends to have a slightly sticky feel, but the moisturizer takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I am now just a few months away from the big 4-0 so naturally wrinkles are a concern for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is mostly dry, a little bit combination, and above all, extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like a small amount but you only use a few sprays at a time &amp; it actually last pretty well.</li>
            <li> no product will eliminate them, but I do think the deep lines are a little less deep and the fine lines are a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have used several other Vitamin C serums and this actually has given me results.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and am constantly applying lotion.  </li>
            <li> A little amount went far and it did leave a noticeable glow afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I actually see an improvement every single day!  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t use an additional moisturizer, but my skin started feeling a little tight and dry, so the moisturizer (an aloe-based cream) helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I know that I’m supposed to wait at least a couple of weeks before seeing real results, but I already see them.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my delicate skin under the eyes, too.</li>
            <li> long ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray that comes with the product sprays in all directions making you waste a considerable amount of product.</li>
            <li> I like how it keeps my face hydrated ALL day long.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I want to hold them off as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put any moisturizer on until after this had dried completely.</li>
            <li> And when I did begin to have a few pimples show up (I told you my skin is sensitive to greasy foods)</li>
            <li> It seems to work for other people, but it certainly was not appropriate for my skin.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the bottle seems very small, I have gone a little overboard with how much I apply at a time and it is now around half way full.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump bottle, and you only need about half a pump for your entire face.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother.  </li>
            <li> So far I have seen a slight lightning of the age spots, but not much effect on the wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li> It was a slight difference, but my skin actually felt different.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not burn or irritate and no strong fragrance. .  </li>
            <li> I have never received such a service on Amazon, or any other place for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Vit C Serums for its obvious anti-aging benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use as long as they continue to make it!</li>
            <li> This product has proven to be excellent for reducing wrinkles -(those little annoying ones around the corners of my mouth and eyes!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> I also put it on the back of one hand and do nothing to the other...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only makes your skin brighter ( just like a lot of other products )</li>
            <li> I like its package, very different from other vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> This one in particular is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I have gone between extremely oily skin to extremely dry skin, especially as the weather changes.</li>
            <li> I have gone between extremely oily skin to extremely dry skin, especially as the weather changes.</li>
            <li> Goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My face will also get dry patches at times, and that is a not a self confidence booster at all.</li>
            <li> I use cleanser, rinse well, then apply the Serum on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Allow it to dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s different--usually my skin feels dry in the morning, sometimes with a greasy coating of stuff that my skin didn&#x27;t absorb.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was dry, I use moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing, has no odor, texture, or taste, I believe it to be a complete fake.</li>
            <li> At 55 years old I didn&#x27;t think any skin product would make a real difference to my skin but your serum has proved me wrong, thank you.</li>
            <li> Paired with the moisturizer, my skin isn&#x27;t dry all day.</li>
            <li> Once purchased even though it was returned because my skin felt extremely dry after 2 uses, I&#x27;ve been barraged with requests to leave a review and rating.  </li>
            <li> They made my skin either too oily or too dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I can use the RetinA every night and my face doesn&#x27;t get dry and flakey.  </li>
            <li> use the serum 2x a day -  cleanse skin - pat dry; apply one pump of serum all over face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries I apply Lumene Vitamin C+ Dry Skin Comfort Radiance Cocktail.  </li>
            <li> In dry seasons, I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;night cream&amp;#34; during the day.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed to dry it out.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to purchase this great product.(Oh, and I forgot to mention I&#x27;m one of those disgusting smokers at age 59, so if it helps me, it will help anybody.)</li>
            <li> Starting to work after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product I received was old or not (or maybe I just couldn&#x27;t get enough on due to it running off my fingers).  </li>
            <li> While everyone is high school complained about their skin</li>
            <li> The spring is too stiff and the product either doesn&#x27;t come out at all or comes out in a huge spurt all over not just my hand but everything else within a 6-inch radius, it&#x27;s wasteful and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> My crows feet are less defined and my dark spots have become considerably lighter.  </li>
            <li> I can’t wait to see if these small wrinkles near my eyes will be diminished.</li>
            <li> I can only use just on the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> only requires a small amount to use so can last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company indicates users should follow its use with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is intended for skin evenness and dark spots, I have also been lavishing it on my the tops of my forearms just to give it further trial.  </li>
            <li> only requires a small amount to use so can last a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each time only requires a small amount so the bottle can last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use such a small amount that the bottle will last a long time; results and value!</li>
            <li> It was working so well that I was not sure what its actually doing until I noticed that my skin did not succumb to the occasional dryness and break out that it usually does after two weeks of clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump sticks a little, but not an issue as far as knocking it down a star.  </li>
            <li> using Day by Day&#x27;s premium vitamin C serum for 3 and half weeks here are the following pro&#x27;s and cons</li>
            <li> Well, it took only about a week and a half for me to see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> In just a bit less than 2 weeks, my skin is showing definite improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a slight odor when you open it, but after it&#x27;s applied to the skin there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any lingering.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the second</li>
            <li> A side note, I have been using daily for a month, still have half a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet are even less noticeable, only in a couple uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite a lot of product since you should be only using a small drop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of results, I&#x27;ve seen the same results with all the ones I&#x27;ve tried: It DOES make a difference, though not a tremendous one for me.</li>
            <li> It says that only a little is needed, to apply a small amount with fingertips to face, neck, and décolletage areas avoiding direct contact with eyes.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to previous rough skin.</li>
            <li> Not a week goes by without a breakout or dry spot on my face, but after a few days I noticed an immediate change in the texture and overall feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties, and I tend to have sensitive and oily skin, so I am limited as to what I can use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my elbows because it works wonders for my rough dry elbows!</li>
            <li> I have 5X magnifying make-up mirrors in both bathrooms, as I&#x27;ve also gotten to the age of needing a little help, especially for eyeliner and mascara application.</li>
            <li> and I have only been using it for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> I gave four stars only because I had a little bit of sensitivity to the product.</li>
            <li> other thing that is occurring with the Serum is a lightening to a small brown area above my left eye.</li>
            <li> and witch hazel calm and soothe troubled skin, and it also contains MSM, which I use in a lot of my home preparations to condition and nourish skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthy and no longer painful.</li>
            <li> I am only 52, but with being ill it has really effected my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and definitely have some trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected, I have used it day and night, no difference, wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought the earth had shifted on it’s axis and expected dogs and cats to start day</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but my face feels smoother &amp; looks brighter.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would help with uneven skin tone and some acne scars and this serum has definitely helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Again, you do need to be careful when you are applying it in order to prevent wasting the serum.</li>
            <li> I had decided to look at the reviews on a few \\&quot;off brand\\&quot; non-recognized and ordered three different off brands.</li>
            <li> Nobody has asked me to write this,I just have to share with women,like myself,that have spent a ton of cash on products that don&#x27;t deliver,</li>
            <li> But after only a few days I see a difference.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks but will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin as well as allergies, so I have to be careful about products I use on my face.</li>
            <li> My sister was asked to review this on her blog Preppy Empty Nester.  </li>
            <li> While there is never really any miracle product, this has been as close as it comes for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice a day everyday over the last 3 weeks or so since I purchased it</li>
            <li> but my hands were slightly wet from shower , bottle fell on floor and broke so</li>
            <li> a thing of your distant past&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It really only takes a few seconds</li>
            <li> so I expected it to be thicker like a gel</li>
            <li> After two weeks of faithful use on the left side, I do see a slight lessening in the appearance of the dark spots, giving credence to their claim that this product lightens sun and age spots.</li>
            <li> I mean a 22 year old reviewing age cream?</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you are looking for a step up from just your plain moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to reorder today as the quantities are not large and I don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff, which at ~ $15.00 does what $200.00 creams do not.</li>
            <li> At least half of any new products I try make my skin break out or feel irritated.  </li>
            <li> One day, I e-mailed them with some questions and received a response back in less than half an hour.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been driving myself crazy, looking for natural, realistic methods to moisten my skin and restore its glow.</li>
            <li> I found a reduction in my crow&#x27;s feet and other wrinkles in a shorter time than I expected.  </li>
            <li> then your skin will go back to how bad it used to be, does anybody know if this is true?</li>
            <li> I work outside year round ,swimmer with dark discoloration along both sides of my jaw,3 age spots from years of outdoor living.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> That method is not a good one as it obviously would increase the rate of oxidization, with having to open the bottle with each use.</li>
            <li> I am a young over 50 woman and I am serious about my skin care.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Like their instructions say, a little goes a long way,</li>
            <li> I also like that the bottle has a pump because a little of this serum goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit this serum helped tame the dry spots and give my skin an overall glow in just a few applications (once every day before going to bed)</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40s and unfortunately, still have acne prone skin, large pores and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I feel my skin tone has a more even appearance, I actually have a slight &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin now and shockingly, I have only had one minor break-out since using this!  </li>
            <li> (but then again I am also using 2 other products for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like the other creme is the one doing all the work after all.:-((Day</li>
            <li> Some days I use it two times, but other days, just once.</li>
            <li> Well...kept this one and threw out the other one.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after washing my face and exfoliating every other day.  </li>
            <li> The serum seems to help the other creams fully penetrate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will buy again and have been recommending and now I may have to try their other products.</li>
            <li> There is no stinging like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I never put anything other than sunscreen on my face, so this was a challenge.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had tried a number of other products that just sucked.</li>
            <li> The other brand broke me out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past 3 months and notice a big difference in the wrinkles in my forehead.</li>
            <li> I used it on other parts of my body that needed treatment for acne.</li>
            <li> The other day my friend told me my face was glowing, so I wonder if its because I have been using this stuff.</li>
            <li> It made it easier to make my decision for this product among all the other serums out there.  </li>
            <li> I can already see improvement in a small line on my forehead area and the tiny lines I had around my eyes are now gone.  </li>
            <li> When I added the other product by Day by Day Beauty their Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that come with a vial dispenser or a cheapy pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Other ingredients include aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum is not thick and the consistency is thin and I am still waiting to see the effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> How nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to be kept posted as to any other products the Day by Day company comes out with or any other information they may have that would be helpful for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this morning and night for the past 3 weeks as a skin brightener - and it has definitely helped get rid of darker spots and blotchy skin and does seem to help reduce acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After starting again I’m not really sure why I stopped.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no strong fragrance to this serum and just has a slight medicinal scent which is likely from the Witch Hazel that it contains.</li>
            <li> This one is a little tacky but not as bad as most of them.</li>
            <li> I’m a female in her late 40’s and have been a little skeptical about trying serums, but this completely erased my fears and is starting to erase my wrinkles too!</li>
            <li> First off, this one is very thin and watery and makes a mess when you squirt it into the palm of your hand (hits the mirror, etc.).  </li>
            <li> But around the time of my 40th birthday that started to change and my facial skin started looking icky.</li>
            <li> I have  acne prone skin and a lot of dark  marks.  </li>
            <li> Seller sent an email to tell me product would be late, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> There is no distinct scent to this keeping it natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried for months to get on a RetinA regiment with no success.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that this will eventually help with under my eyes for puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Lately, as age beckons, I can see the wrinkles creeping in, regardless of my regular creams, and decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful with oil on my skin and don&#x27;t like anything heavy.  </li>
            <li> Most age spots are completely gone and the worst ones are getting lighter everyday.</li>
            <li> However, this Day by Day serum has a slight edge over that other one because it contains fewer and less objectionable</li>
            <li> I always add an extra layer (thin) of this product to any dry patches I have on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It comes in a glass bottle, though, so if you are clumsy like me you might want to consider transferring to another less fragile (but still opaque) container</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t weigh your face down.</li>
            <li> the down side</li>
            <li> and it doesn’t feel as though it weighs down your skin</li>
            <li> I have tried other products like: E-Cream, Retinol-Rich Skin Care and a Vitamin C and Green Tea Renewal Serum</li>
            <li> It comes in a 1oz bottle which seems small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The effect was very small, but it made an overall difference.</li>
            <li> I do believe there has been a slight change, after just a week, in my skin tone and how it feels.  </li>
            <li> and I can see the circles are less under my eyes.</li>
            <li> my face seems to have plumped up making lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Follow with Acure Seriously Firming Facial Serum (&amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; by my definition).</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for one month now, and the texture, tone, and surface of my skin is noticeable smoother and lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> These discolorations are less noticeable now, after just one month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my previous review that when the prescription my 83-year-old mother had for a cream to heal sun damage went from $29 to over $100, I suggested that she try the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> My lines are much less noticable.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my previous experiences, both my wife and I agree there is less of an oily feel after application.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply the serum before bed every other night and have not used any other products while using the serum and ever since then, my skin has reacted well to the product.</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, I see less puffiness and bagginess, and the wrinkles are someone minimized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The benefit of the added moisture of the serum means that less day cream is needed.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks are a lot less visible than they were.</li>
            <li> my order was place the day before their wedding and Pamela took time to email to apologize for a slight delay.</li>
            <li> but my skin is looking fresher and smoother, lines slightly reduced.  </li>
            <li> In less than two weeks, I was amazed at the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has been serious about my skin for several years.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are much less noticeable also.  </li>
            <li> But since I started using Vitamin C Serums a couple months ago, my skin has been a LOT less flaky than it</li>
            <li> This serum is lightweight and soaks into you skin quickly - it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots that seem to be a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> I  have yet to see any visible change to the few dark spots I have on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected from this product, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin from using it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the C serum for a few weeks now and is hands down a miracle.</li>
            <li> Wait a couple minutes until skin feels slightly tight.</li>
            <li> The bottle is tightly capped and a pump dispenser is included to switch too after opening.</li>
            <li> when I use the product my skin does not  feel tight or like the product was \\&quot;sitting on my face\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> My face felt so tight</li>
            <li> I use two pumps both morning and night and then put a moisturizer on once the serum has dried (in a minute or less).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been less than a few weeks).</li>
            <li> Gel is less messy and easier to apply on the face.  </li>
            <li> little lines on my forehead disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you.  </li>
            <li> Making all the little imperfections of my face go away.  </li>
            <li> However it did make my skin a little softer.  </li>
            <li> but they seem to have lightened a little.</li>
            <li> this is a  reorder after a little over a month of use.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that my lines will disappear and I am a little worried that this serum will change since that can happen</li>
            <li> The applicator looked like it would squeeze a little dollop of product onto my finger.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my face appears a little smoother and just brighter.</li>
            <li> and it burned a little</li>
            <li> After a little over a month, there is a noticeable difference in tone and texture.</li>
            <li> out freckles a little</li>
            <li> No significant improvement seen after a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> You just pump a little bit of the serum into your hands and rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> I also have a little Milia under my eyes from applying olive oil everyday about a year ago.</li>
            <li> However, just plain old hyaluronic acid serum of the 3-ingredient variety (HA, water and a preservative) also works well for me and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> However, just plain old hyaluronic acid serum of the 3-ingredient variety (HA, water and a preservative) also works well for me and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t too thick or too runny, and it doesn&#x27;t have any odd odors like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> and you waste the product.</li>
            <li> waste of money, go youtube DIY and figure out how inexpensive you can treat yourself for a fracture of what it cost here</li>
            <li> However, I never enjoy the cost.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in texture tone or clarity even after using it everyday for weeks.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a few months now and the rash she had been unsuccessfully treating with the prescription is all but gone.</li>
            <li> I received the Serum a few days after purchase.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received the Day By Day C Serum approximately a week ago and have faithfully put it to the test by using it every morning and evening after cleansing and before my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I received this as part of an advertorial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out and reviewing a few Vitamin C Serums.  </li>
            <li> few years ago I used a scrubbing tool on my neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a heavy makeup wearer.</li>
            <li> I was kinda worried about that, as I don&#x27;t like heavy type products on my face.</li>
            <li> Saw results within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I think overall the product has taken away the sort of sallow, tired appearance that my skin had previously.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Am I missing something here?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few moments, your face feels refreshed and toned.</li>
            <li> , plusI had some kind of terrible sand-like particles coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li> After a few days even a co-worker complimented that my skin looked brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gal who doesn&#x27;t like to put heavy creams or foundation on my face</li>
            <li> The company claims that this product will &amp;#34;make embarrassing wrinkles, sun spots and uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I put a few pumps in my palm, rub my palms together, then cover my face with the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer greasy, but it isn&#x27;t dried out either.</li>
            <li> I dab a few drops onto my fingertips as part of my morning routine, and then moisturize and makeup.</li>
            <li> The one con I had with this product is that due to use of the spray (it is sort of a double-edged sword) , it is hard to reduce the default amount of the product you use per push-spray.</li>
            <li> I base that on my initial impressions of this serum and also on the reviews that I read before purchasing this particular product.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that for 3 weeks and counting I have somehow avoided my usual little acne</li>
            <li> I laid out a lot using little to no sun screen (usually a sun amplifier instead)</li>
            <li> As long as this serum doesn&#x27;t change for worse</li>
            <li> They all claim to help with tough and dry skin, dullness, even elasticity, but</li>
            <li> I am always looking for serums/skincare products that help slow down the aging process.</li>
            <li> It made it brighter, less dull looking.  </li>
            <li> Glides on easily, no smell, and have noticed a small I improvement in my skins brightness.</li>
            <li> and it looks a little brighter too!</li>
            <li> You also need very little to do a sufficient job of covering the skin without being chintzy.</li>
            <li> It seems to have  helped with evening out my past acne scars with my skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> so I still don&#x27;t expect a miracle when it comes to my wrinkles, but having small pores and radiant skin after one week?</li>
            <li> No more research and trials for me.</li>
            <li> not sure what strength Vit.</li>
            <li> It’s a small bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure</li>
            <li> Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days!.</li>
            <li> I tried Vitamin C Serum by Day By Day Beauty in small hope that it might de-emphasize some of the bagginess and wrinkles around my eyes, and I do believe it is doing</li>
            <li> so not sure what ingredient is doing this.  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that the company offers a satisfaction guarantee and if you are unhappy with your results you can return your product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like that too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My procedure is to wash my face and then apply a small amount of the serum (predetermined amount by dispenser</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a small bottle (1 oz.)</li>
            <li> and then I apply my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s and  have faithfully used moisturizer everyday for decades- usually</li>
            <li> No more research and trials for me.</li>
            <li> I have paid $70 for serum like this in the past.</li>
            <li> Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days!</li>
            <li> I have a hectic schedule and my morning routine is usually hurried</li>
            <li> This came with a small pump that you replace the cap with.  </li>
            <li> At this point I am not sure if i will reorder.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and have been really bad about caring for my skin in the past)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin consistency--it doesn&#x27;t goop up like other creams and serums do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> that want a product that works as hard as we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaks out of my hand; is hard to put on my face and has produced NO results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to say unequivocally that I look &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; (I have a hard time seeing myself that way in the mirror).</li>
            <li> I just started using the product, so it&#x27;s hard to say how well it works, but I like how it feels.</li>
            <li> At this point it is hard to describe, but I do know that I like the product.  </li>
            <li> (Hard to tell because the bottle is not transparent.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles even though I am 50; so it&#x27;s hard to assess it.  </li>
            <li> It probably helps that I&#x27;m a health fanatic, like organic vegetable juicing etc</li>
            <li> But I had become desperate in my search to find something that actually worked without causing an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I give every product at least a month try</li>
            <li> And while I do not want to look 20 again, I am not thrilled about how my skin is getting thinner and so &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Honestly, no.  </li>
            <li> in my teens up through my late 30s when I started noticing sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Also Vitamin C is naturally thick in its consistency.</li>
            <li> Its a slow process.  </li>
            <li> and I have a &#x27;few&#x27; age spots at 71!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about the possibility of not wearing any base this summer!  </li>
            <li> ugh, I mean Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical and somewhat afraid to use these types of things on my skin because it&#x27;s very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was also tired of paying a small fortune for products that either irritated my skin or did nothing even after months of use.</li>
            <li> However, I saw a very small improvement if any.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has been serious about my skin for about 8 years now</li>
            <li> I have tried vitamin c skin care products in the past and have been left disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can also comment that although I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic changes in the two weeks I used the product, I did notice some small changes in the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I became frustrated and decided I&#x27;d just have to accept the changes in my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this serum has not made my eye problems worse at least.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated with my skin and the back and forth since my pregnancies.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is not good at all for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated with my skin and the back and forth since my pregnancies.</li>
            <li> If the reviews have turned you off, throw up any questions that you have and base your decision on responses directly from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not receive the extra bottle as per their offer on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I still look like a woman in her late 40&#x27;s ( no miracle there!)....</li>
            <li> Just wish the bottle was a bit bigger running out already :(</li>
            <li> I would give it a higher rating, but for the sprayer, it is really horrible.  </li>
            <li> i ordered 2 bottles but 1 came broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to work with this company to try to find solutions because I know they will stand behind their products all the way</li>
            <li> Have been using the Hyaluronic Acid System for approximately two months.  </li>
            <li> I truly recommend this product and company to anyone looking to give their skin the needed attention that my poor sun soaked skin needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that before</li>
            <li> So, even though this serum may be thin, it packs a whollop.</li>
            <li> Just the other day a girl I work with was genuinely shocked to learn my age.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dark circles under my eyes from bad allergies and sleep issues and this product seems to have helped with the darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Usually anything I try on my face makes it break out like crazy, so I am always worried to try something for my face.</li>
            <li> so manage the product without this cap have been very difficult because i don&#x27;t want to touch the liquid with my fingers ( because I don&#x27;t want to spoil the product) and neither i want to waste it.</li>
            <li> and I do mean dramatic!  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> Has the result been dramatic?  </li>
            <li> the results are dramatic.  </li>
            <li> The difference I&#x27;ve noticed is a DRAMATIC decrease in the discoloration and age spots</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference in the elasticity of my skin</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive vitamin C serum in the past and it made me break out</li>
            <li> I was thinking about leaving one star and decided to give it 2 stars only because I would call it poor instead of awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it cause break out on my skin and also irritation on my chin.</li>
            <li> I didn’t have terrible skin to begin with, but it’s definitely improved.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical, by necessity, but must admit that after a month, I am giving this serum 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the run on sentences.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - expensive and value priced.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always skeptical of how true/real they are:/</li>
            <li> It was returnable and not too expensive</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the product or incessant requests to reviews it at all</li>
            <li> how can I go wrong?</li>
            <li> And for those saying its expensive -</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic as I am a RN and have been ill for over 23 yrs.</li>
            <li> and I know they are expensive.</li>
            <li> and I know they are expensive.</li>
            <li> ...maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> serum is very thin, almost watery.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very thin and like liquid</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to have any added fragrances or artificial colorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was crazy.</li>
            <li> Like I said, &#x27;crazy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It also has a slightly unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Even with the bad weather, delivery was prompt.  </li>
            <li> and this has not had any bad side affects</li>
            <li> I have bad acne scars and using both a scrub wash and this</li>
            <li> Used twice- burn and itched so bad-</li>
            <li> try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m disappointed since i&#x27;ve read about the benefits of vitamin c.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all. :(</li>
            <li> I HATE makeup and lotions of all sorts, so</li>
            <li> whats cheaper, an $9 bottle of crap that does nothing, or a $19 bottle that works, and exceeds expectations?</li>
            <li> Which I hate because I never know if it is because the product is clearing out my skin or the product</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Day by day is the worst in consistency.</li>
            <li> but I found that after having my baby that my skin had turned for the worst.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have awful pores.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that bothers me is that when I use it in the morning my makeup looks terrible when put over it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product every morning, after washing my face but before my moisturizer and make up. I found my make up applied smoother and look much better since I have been using this serum.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was very pleased with the packaging. The pretty blue bottle with simple label was very spa like and looks nice sitting out. I also really love when beauty products have a pump attached to the lid as I don&#x27;t have to worry about pouring out too much or wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a thick consistency that your skin just absorbs right up.  It nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients. It helps to reduce fine lines and is perfect for sensitive skin as it is as organic and eco friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving I&#x27;ve used it by itself as well as under my normal moisturizer and it has worked wonderfully. I could really see a difference in my face being moisturized and little lines on my forehead disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at the ingredients you can see all the good oils and extracts that are helping your skin. I definitely recommend if you are looking for a step up from just your plain moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good C Serum at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is a lovely serum. It has no scent really, which is wonderful for my migraines. You absorb it incredibly fast, and it&#x27;s incredibly natural! 98% Natural and 72% Organically Derived is WONDERFUL! It helps plump your skin up, boost collagen production, and give you that dewy look that babies tend to have, but most people lose as they age. It&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Day by Day Beauty!</li>
            <li> This is my review of the Day by Day&#x27;s premium vitamin C serum; I also have a blog on which I share the rest of the review but in a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Day by Day&#x27;s premium vitamin C serum for 3 and half weeks here are the following pro&#x27;s and cons I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• At first I was not sure whether it was working or not but I noticed that for 3 weeks and counting I have somehow avoided my usual little acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It is non-sticky and has no lingering smell seconds after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• This is the fastest absorbing serum I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It has a nice packaged design that prevents any accidental spills (the spray and it&#x27;s plastic cap to put over it when not in use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Seems to have removed the temporary fine lines that began to take shape on my forehead due to recent stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It seems to have  helped with evening out my past acne scars with my skin tone (but then again I am also using 2 other products for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• It was working so well that I was not sure what its actually doing until I noticed that my skin did not succumb to the occasional dryness and break out that it usually does after two weeks of clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The one con I had with this product is that due to use of the spray (it is sort of a double-edged sword) , it is hard to reduce the default amount of the product you use per push-spray. Hence, I think I would have made it last more than 3 and half weeks if it came with a dropper like the other serums. However, the convenience of the spray outweighs the easily adjustable caveat. To avoid this you would have to unwind the spray head off and dab it on your skin if you choose to use a smaller amount on a specific area of the skin. - I should note that this is more of a preference thing than an actual con since it is easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• I notice a slightly tingling sensation for the first5-10 seconds when I apply it, especially when it is applied close to my eyes; it quickly goes away after that; I wear contact lenses so perhaps that has something to do with it. Either way it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• 30ml is already a big size but with the spray mechanic it is easy to succumb to spraying more than needed per application – Again, this can be avoided by using a dropper or unwinding the spray cap and dabbing little amounts of the product on your skin. - All in all this is more of a preference than an actual con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering all the above; my rating for this product was initially a 4.5/5, due to the fact that it is more likely to finish faster because of the use of the spray, and also the slight tingling effect. I also must say that this company is a family-run one and were great at communicating with their customers; their customer service is a perfect 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to have used this product (I haven&#x27;t taken a look at the e-book skin information bonus but I assume it is very informative) and I recommend it as a 5/5 because the cons are either easily avoidable or just my nitpicking. So, I recommend it with no reservations, as a matter of fact I will be looking into buying another bottle of this stuff but first I want to spend two weeks off it to see if my usual breakouts occur. Thanks for reading my review an I hope I helped you in someway in making a decision whether to try this product or not. Until next time keep safe and Happy Halloween in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sean D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure&lt;br /&gt;Only used a week now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too early to tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C repair for over 15 years and I wanted a cheaper C serum and it&#x27;s what I got; way way too runny.  Every serum I have used that is worth its salt is thick and not diluted.  I went back to my other kind, twice as much.  It&#x27;s true that we get what we pay for.</li>
            <li> never saw nor felt a difference</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> Been using it along with the Hyaluronic acid and am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients and that it is fragrance free. Nice constancy and it absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t weigh your face down. Really gets into the skin and leaves your face moistured</li>
            <li> This serum has done wonders to my face. Talk about mosturizing !! It&#x27;s helped visibly reduce my laugh lines . I love this product .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and I can tell a difference in my skin. It isn&#x27;t dry and rough feeling and the redness in my cheeks has gone away too and my skin feels soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be in a month.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am seeing improvement in my skin with the daily use( when I remember to use daily) It is super light, thick, easily absorbed into skin, I love the way my skin feels after use. I have used it as a day serum and now use both day and night. I loved being able to implement this into my daily routine with the discount I received only made it easier on my budget. It does not affect my review of the product, the shipping or the use of the product. Day by Day is truly a day to day go to! I will be budgeting this into future purchases as well. My skin never looked so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this Serum.  Even after only using it for a week, I can tell a difference in the skin tone on my face.  My cheeks especially, are much smoother and evenly colored.  Great product.  Lightweight, dries quickly.  No funky-odor.  I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for the past 2 weeks and think it has really made a difference in keeping my skin clear and youthful. Vitamin C is too acidic for me to digest, so being able to apply it topically has been an excellent option.</li>
            <li> I just finished using a whole bottle and I&#x27;m really happy with the result. This product not only made my skin brighter, but also smoother. I also noticed that my pores are smaller now. Will be getting a second bottle for sure...</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is great!  I just started having skin breakouts at 30.  I put on the Vitamin C Serum after washing my face and it makes it feel so smooth and tight!  A little bit goes a long way so I think this bottle is definitely a great value!</li>
            <li> Love love love this serum! I use two pumps both morning and night and then put a moisturizer on once the serum has dried (in a minute or less). This company has also followed up with me via email and I really appreciate the information that was sent on how to use it as well as a check in on how I liked the product. I have used many expensive serums and this one is just as good if not better. Love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> The best serum, you&#x27;ll look younger! I did :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this Vit C serum very long, but so far I love it! My skin is really dry and rough, this serum makes it feel and look great!  The way my skin is feeling this minute, I&#x27;m confident it will help with my wrinkles and years of sun damage!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Light weight and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Expected better results than I received.  For me it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product really does improve your complexion, reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  You need to use it for several months.  I have been looking for a product with all these ingredients.  Will be ordering this regularly!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum! I&#x27;ve finally learned that instead of rubbing in a serum, it should be patted into the face and then allowed to air dry before putting moisturizer on top of it. I actually do have pretty great skin- only in my mid-30s- but I have begun to notice some fine lines around my mouth and eyes. One of the best purchases ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for 6 weeks and can&#x27;t say I see a difference in my skin. I wanted to fade some darker spots, but they still look the same.</li>
            <li> I have tested Day by Day Vitamin C Serum on the sunspots on the back of my hands. After two weeks of faithful use on the left side, I do see a slight lessening in the appearance of the dark spots, giving credence to their claim that this product lightens sun and age spots. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it on my face; it soaks in quckly, make it easy and fast to apply. It does not cause a reaction of any kind in my highly sensitive, mixed (dry &amp; oily) skin, a very pl;easant surprise after reacting strongly to other Vitamin C products. So far, so good...two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this one week and have already noticed a difference in my skin. (I am also using this with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum). My pores are much smaller and my skin just looks healthier and clearer. (I have always had skin issues.) I was very skeptical when I purchased the products because so many have promised results, but I never see much change. I was also tired of paying a small fortune for products that either irritated my skin or did nothing even after months of use. I am 58 and have lived in the sun my entire life so I still don&#x27;t expect a miracle when it comes to my wrinkles, but having small pores and radiant skin after one week? I&#x27;ll take it! Since the product stated that I shouldn&#x27;t expect to see a change until about four weeks of use, what a shock to see my skin better than it has looked in years! I am also incredibly impressed with the customer service. I had a prompt follow-up email inquiring if I had received the product, tips on using it, and then a prompt reply to a question I had.</li>
            <li> I got it as a part of the gift for my wife. She is using all kind of anti-aging creams and lotions. She was pleasantly surprised. All the natural components were the biggest point to get this serum. She just started using it and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Greate product, good seller.</li>
            <li> I liked this serum. It was easy to apply and it absorbed will in my skin. Will order again.</li>
            <li> After four weeks of use, I&#x27;ve already noticed my red acne marks fading! No dryness either! Already ordered a second bottle. Only thing I would recommend is not using the squirting pump it comes with because it squirts everywhere and you waste the product. I just use the screw in cap and then dab the product with my finger all over my face, neck, and upper chest area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it dispense the liquid. I like Hyaluronic Acid Serum -2 FL OZ- BEST VEGAN Hyaluron better.</li>
            <li> Made me break out. BF used this as well and made him break out too.&lt;br /&gt;similar product by a different brand was used prior without giving breakouts</li>
            <li> love it takes away bark spots</li>
            <li> This product to me is very runny and the nozzle just makes the serum go everywhere.  Will not purchase this again because of that.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum by Day By Day is helping with reducing my fade spots as well as my wrinkles on my face. This product makes my skin feel soft and smooth. It has organic Vitamin C, E and aloe so it really nourishes and hydrates my skin which makes it look healthier and smoother. The serum is very easy to dispense from the bottle just press down on the pump and put some in the palm of my hand and apply it  with my fingertips to my face. It is non fragrant so there is no smell and it is not greasy. I have been using this at night after I shower and when I am done using the Vitamin C serum, after it has absorbed, I put on my moisturizer. I have been using this for a month and I do notice a difference on my face and am very with the results. I did receive a discount on this product so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now. I had been very happy with another vitamin C product I had been using, but do to the sale price and all the product reviews I decided to give it a try. I can say that is any better that the one I&#x27;ve been very happy with (Seduisant). However I give it a 2 star rating because in combination with Crazy Beautiful Face Creme it disappears all my fine lines and wrinkles and minimizes my pores right away. It looks like the other creme is the one doing all the work after all.:-((Day By DAY product) on it&#x27;s own leaves my face feeling very dry, and it gave me breakouts which are a very uncommon thing on my face to see, as I don&#x27;t suffer from acne, yet this cream has the special ingredients to give them to me. My age 38 ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am currently using it as a preventative measure, and it feels amazing.  I absolutely love it!  Bonus....great customer service.</li>
            <li> Consistency was like water, I returned it.  I had bought other Vitamin C Serum that was thicker and easily stayed in place,  this serum did not.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It feels good on my skin and absorbs quickly.  My face feels firmer and my complexion appears brighter.  Easy to apply and attractively packaged.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It is the perfect addition to my beauty routine. This serum has helped reduce those fine lines that appear once you approach forty and leaves your skin glowing.  I will definitely reorder more of serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have been using this product for three months now and have noticed  positive changes with my skin. Such as fine lines diminishing and a glowing complexion. I love the way my skin feels and looks! I am hooked and this is part of my beauty routine for sure.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin, did not see any sort of difference in the texture</li>
            <li> This Serum is amazing!  I love how it makes my skin look, and feel.  Thanks for such a great, trust-worthy product!</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle a few days ago and started using it right away. I can see after even a short period of time that I can see my skin is brighter and looks more tighter and even a few fine lines have disappeared. I am going to keep using it and follow up with a update after a few more weeks and see what the results are then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for today I am exicted by the results. My skin feels clean, nourished, and younger.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of months - morning and evening for most of the time. I have seen no difference what-so-ever. Using it twice a day gave me red bumps all over my forehead. I had high hopes for this product but it has done nothing that it &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; to help with. I suggest using your money to experiment with something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of this serum.  It is pretty awesome in smoothing the texture of the skin.  Like all things - nothing works overnight, but over a few weeks - I started getting a lot of comments about how good my skin looks.  Will be getting more.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> waste of money, go youtube DIY and figure out how inexpensive you can treat yourself for a fracture of what it cost here</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because I really like what I&#x27;ve seen so far, and it has just been a week.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, and this would be my first anti-aging product.  I&#x27;m always skeptical and somewhat afraid to use these types of things on my skin because it&#x27;s very sensitive.  I watched the youtube video to make sure I was applying it correctly.  So the first day, I just applied it on the back of one hand to see if I would have any adverse reaction to the serum.  No adverse reaction!  It actually felt pretty good.  I love that it&#x27;s basically unscented.  It feels interesting to the touch.  Not like water, and not like a lotion.  A nice in-between feel.  It absorbed quickly, and did not end up feeling sticky after applying it.  Being the skeptic about these products that I am, I decided to use the serum only on one hand, and one side of my face.  That way I could see if there was any difference between the two myself.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and apply it once in the morning, and again at night.  I don&#x27;t use anything else except cocoa butter that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I do believe there has been a slight change, after just a week, in my skin tone and how it feels.  It seems brighter.  I also have one rough spot on my face that nothing can really be done about, and it has definitely helped that not to be so obvious!  That was what I really liked!  I think the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for much, was the pump applicator.  I like that it helps keep the serum germ-free, but I feel there isn&#x27;t enough control over the amount that comes out.  Anyway, I will keep using it to see if it helps even out the sun damage to my face even more, but wanted to get this out here for now.  Overall, very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for almost a year .. I read about the use of this type of serum in a French beauty book. It had all the correct ingredients .. My skin looks marvelous !</li>
            <li> Since I had my son two years ago, I noticed my face looked and felt dry and coarse. I&#x27;ve been driving myself crazy, looking for natural, realistic methods to moisten my skin and restore its glow. I&#x27;ve tried numerous pills, creams, serums--you name it for a month or so at a time, and nothing happened. I became frustrated and decided I&#x27;d just have to accept the changes in my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw great reviews on this new vitamin Serum, Day by Day, and decided I&#x27;d take my chances one last time. Well, it took only about a week and a half for me to see the difference in my skin. Day by Day features vitamin C, one of the most essential,  natural beautifiers, and it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin. I like it&#x27;s thin consistency--it doesn&#x27;t goop up like other creams and serums do. I haven&#x27;t finished my bottle yet, but I already ordered my next couple bottles. I trust that this product will bring back my  pre-pregnancy face--and my confidence too!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and also really sensitive skin, so I am really weary on what I buy and what I don&#x27;t buy. My face will also get dry patches at times, and that is a not a self confidence booster at all. This Vitamin C serum has done the trick to make my face not so scaly looking, because no woman wants to go out on a date and have scaly looking skin. My skin has changed a lot since having kids and getting older. This product has restored my face to my before pregnancy face and also my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone because it is such a great product and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My Day By Day Serum has been a great addition to my daily beauty routine. I enjoy this product, it&#x27;s easy to handle and my skin is reacting well to it!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and almost instantly makes my skin appear tighter.</li>
            <li> I am now just a few months away from the big 4-0 so naturally wrinkles are a concern for me.  I certainly don&#x27;t feel my age and I don&#x27;t want to look it either.  The lovely blue bottle is one I don&#x27;t even mind leaving out on my dressing table but it is what is inside that is really beautiful.  I immediately noticed the beautiful and soothing aloe scent.  I like that because I am always a big aloe fan, both of the scent and its effect on skin. I also like that the serum has vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it I found a reduction in my crow&#x27;s feet and other wrinkles in a shorter time than I expected.  I noticed a smoothing and tightening of the around my face and neck.  Just the other day a girl I work with was genuinely shocked to learn my age.  She had thought I was around 24 or 25.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I started using this product religiously for a month.  Unfortunately, it cause break out on my skin and also irritation on my chin. I have high hopes for this product But it didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many but this one seems to be the best for me so far. I breakout easily and this serum has been very kind to my skin. Glides on easily, no smell, and have noticed a small I improvement in my skins brightness. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was waiting to finish the entire bottle to write a review, I guess the product works differently for your skin type. For me, I did not see any significant results, if anything I had breakouts when I used this product. The only thing I like about this serum is the fact that it&#x27;s very light and water-based, not sticky or greasy or make your face shiny looking, other than that I will not purchase this product again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was using the last drops from my first bottle when I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment. Among the first few things he told me was: you look extremely healthy. At that exact moment I remembered that my husband told me the evening before that my skin looks more \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; - which is very rare, he&#x27;s not into this kind of remarks. What I see in the mirror: the skin is more firm than before and there&#x27;s a glow that wasn&#x27;t there before the treatment. I ordered a bottle for my sister and I&#x27;ll definitely update my review after I hear from her.&lt;br /&gt;Update: She&#x27;s very happy with the results and decided to continue with it!</li>
            <li> Day by Day does make my skin feel tighter and I can see the circles are less under my eyes. I will definitely continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands of serums and this one is one of my favorites.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but so far it&#x27;s great.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have only been using for one week and only once in the morning.It has made my skin feel so much smoother and it looks a little brighter too! Would definately purchase again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that I should be using a serum as I am used to having pretty much flawless complexion with little to no work. But around the time of my 40th birthday that started to change and my facial skin started looking icky. Well this serum has seemed to played a part in reviving it, this in conjunction with glycolic peels.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ole Henriksen Truth Serum for quite some time and absolutely love it.  However, I never enjoy the cost.  I took a chance on a new serum, &amp;#34;Day By Day Beauty&amp;#34;, Vitamin C Serum and I was quite impressed.  This vitamin serum not only leaves my face vibrant, smooth, and tight but it also leaves my face more matte and less oily than the Ole Henriksen brand.  Day By Day is a third of the price and a fantastic product.  Thank you Day By Day Beauty, for not being a misleading brand.</li>
            <li> Am absolutely delighted with results in just a few days.  Have actually been able to feel and SEE the difference it makes. Am using on forehead, ear and neck for skin grafts from carcinoma removal. Has more than just cosmetic effect. Will recommend to others without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is great. I pump it out and apply to my washed and toned face. I feels nice on my skin and absorbs well. It works good on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It has a great feel on your skin and the price makes it a great buy.</li>
            <li> OK Maybe I&#x27;m just a skeptic but some of these reviews really concerned me. I mean a 22 year old reviewing age cream? Give me a break! I&#x27;m 56 and definitely have some trouble spots. I&#x27;ve have 3 MOHS surgeries on my face (if you don&#x27;t know what that is--good) which tells you I am very fair skinned and subject to age spots and the like. I&#x27;ve given this stuff plenty of time and I really see some nice changes. First and foremost, I don&#x27;t use much in the way of creams and lotions and potions because I break out with all of them. But I do find this stuff actually CLEARS my skin. My skin tone is definitely more even with fading of brown/age spots. I put it on the back of my hands and can really see the difference. Also, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what people were saying about smaller pores but now I think I understand. My face seems smoother. Fine lines better. I use about 5-6 pumps on face and neck. I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product  after  reading  all the positive  reviews and have been using it twice a day for about 3 weeks. So far, i haven&#x27;t  really  seen a difference. I have  acne prone skin and a lot of dark  marks.  I was expecting  this product  to  even  out and brighten my  skin  tone and skrink my pores (as was promised) but it hasnt.  All the reviews said you&#x27;ll  notice changes  in 2 weeks...not true.  But good news: it didnt make my face break  out.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a Vitamin C serum so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  A little amount went far and it did leave a noticeable glow afterwards.  I plan to continue to use on  regular basis.</li>
            <li> I am a grandmother who seeks products that will do what they say they will do. After using the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum for 4 days, I could tell a difference, for the better, in the look and touch of my skin. Now it has been for 10 days and I am elated with the results. Some days I use it two times, but other days, just once. I use cleanser, rinse well, then apply the Serum on dry skin. Allow it to dry and then apply moisturizer. Now when I put on foundation, I find I need just a very light touch. My daughter and granddaughter have commented on the difference in skin tone, no visible dark spots and a clean, clear look. It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been researching skin care products for some time. My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate. I am thrilled with this product and the customer service is INCREDIBLE. I received several notes on the best uses for products I order from them. Very happy and would recommend. I ordered something similar to this, containing the same ingredients, from a different company, to compare. Well...kept this one and threw out the other one. This one DOES NOT contain Sodium Benzoate.</li>
            <li> This was the first Vitamin C serum I purchased (from the reviews) and I have since purchased other Vitamin C serums, one of which I like much better.  First off, this one is very thin and watery and makes a mess when you squirt it into the palm of your hand (hits the mirror, etc.).  It does run off your finger when you try to apply it.  I did not feel any tightening effects when using this serum.  I&#x27;m not sure if the product I received was old or not (or maybe I just couldn&#x27;t get enough on due to it running off my fingers).  I have seen results with another serum brand that has a lot of the same ingredients, is a bit creamy,  feels like a serum &amp; has 20% vitamin C.  I used this product for 30 days and really did not see much of a difference in my skin.  I did not experience irritation or drying (like I did with a yet another Vitamin C serum brand), so that&#x27;s a plus, but I won&#x27;t purchase this one again. I think this one is only 18% Vitamin C and maybe that is why I really didn&#x27;t see results like I did with the other 20% Vitamin C brand.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star rating because it is a great way to add Vitamin C to my already established skin care regime.I have always used serums as they are transported to the lower layers of skin.I find the price point to be one that is do able..I find no product to be magic..but if used as directed a skin care product can work wonders and just be a preventative and a maintenance ingredient.that is what I find this product to do.The CS is also a plus and they offer perks to us as customers that make us buy again and again.Give it a try..it is well worth the price and risk of a new product..maybe I would call this a sleeper..:-)</li>
            <li> I have aging, sun damaged, combination skin.  I&#x27;m especially concerned with how dry the skin around my eyes seems to be and the accompanying crows feet.  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products, from drugstore, to department store, to mail order.  I was given the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review and figured I had nothing to lose by trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very thin, almost watery.  It comes in a pump bottle, and you only need about half a pump for your entire face.  I learned to pump it directly onto my forehead and spread from there, otherwise it runs all over my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the serum for almost a week.  I use it at night after washing my face and exfoliating every other day.  It&#x27;s my first layer, before a couple of night creams, one containing hyaluronic acid.  The only part of my routine that&#x27;s changed is the underlayer of the Day by Day Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy Smokes!  After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin felt better in the morning.  It&#x27;s softer, and feels moisturized.  That&#x27;s different--usually my skin feels dry in the morning, sometimes with a greasy coating of stuff that my skin didn&#x27;t absorb.  The serum seems to help the other creams fully penetrate my skin.  After five days, my skin looks great.  The BB cream that I use instead of foundation is going on more evenly, and I don&#x27;t need as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate was a lady at church last Sunday morning who peered at me and said, \\&quot;How OLD are you?  You don&#x27;t have any wrinkles around your eyes!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was probably a function of lighting and angle, because of course I rushed home, peered at myself in the bathroom mirror, and found lots of wrinkles, but I will say that compliments on my skin from comparative strangers have never happened before.  Coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for long term wrinkle eradication, though that would be nice.  Miracles can happen, but I&#x27;ll settle for a serum that both works and seems to make everything else work better.  For the price, this is great stuff!to make everything else work better.  For the price, this is great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using and my neck crepes have all but disappeared. my face seems to have plumped up making lines less noticeable. I don&#x27;t claim to look 10 years younger but people have asked if I&#x27;ve changed my makeup and several people have remarked how rested and refreshed I look.. I can honestly say I&#x27;ve used a lot of products that haven&#x27;t done any thing  some that actually made my skin worse. this is a product I would highly recommend. I&#x27;d like to mention I use amazons reviews before making my final decision on my purchases. I&#x27;ve found them very reliable</li>
            <li> No sooner did I place the order than my Day By Day Vitamin C Serum was on my doorstep.  And while I was more than happy to get a faster chance to see what the contents of the little blue bottle could do, I didn&#x27;t expect all that much.  Keeping a realistic head was most important after all. I knew Vitamin C Serum was all the rage and that celebrities used it but, what did I know? So, I happily tried it and quickly got even happier to see that the serum isn&#x27;t oily.  I&#x27;m careful with oil on my skin and don&#x27;t like anything heavy.  This serum is light as a feather.  A little dab will do you.  No need to slather to get the great effects.  A couple of pumps will cover an entire face so, the bottle will last a while.  I like that.  Once more, immediately my skin seemed hydrated.  I didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was dry, I use moisturizer.  Regardless, the serum went to the areas on my cheeks faster than any others as I saw some color arise.  It was nice.  This morning, no added oil to my skin, just a nice even glow.  This after having been up with my dog through the night.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to what this product can do.  I&#x27;ll check back in with a full report. ;)</li>
            <li> I have used some other high priced vitamin-c serums and haven&#x27;t been as pleased as I have been with Day By Day Beauty&#x27;s! This product smells wonderful, feels wonderful, and is gentle enough for my finicky and very sensitive skin! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The last thing I thought I would ever order is a beauty aid. Yet here I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> So I decided to spoil myself with this lovely c + e serum, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed….because I don&#x27;t think I could go without it now!  Like their instructions say, a little goes a long way, so that&#x27;s good.  Also the price for this kind of Serum is super reasonable.  At a local spa a really similar looking product goes for over 90 dollars if I remember right.  This one&#x27;s a winner for sure.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this serum for a few days now, and I think I’m in love. I know that I’m supposed to wait at least a couple of weeks before seeing real results, but I already see them. My skin is clearer, smoother and brighter. The first couple of days, I did suffer from some dryness, but that’s all gone now. I didn’t have terrible skin to begin with, but it’s definitely improved. I can’t wait to see if these small wrinkles near my eyes will be diminished. I have high hopes for this serum, and I’m definitely recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I try to use as many natural, paraben-free and organic skin products as possible, and I am in my late thirties and concerned about fine lines, sun spots, and other early signs of aging.  I think this product delivers great results without any unneccessary chemicals or fragrances.  My skin is mostly dry, a little bit combination, and above all, extremely sensitive.  This product did not make me break out or irritate my skin at all, which is terrific!  At least half of any new products I try make my skin break out or feel irritated.  This serum, however, feels great!  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and layers under any moisturizer.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural product to noursish the skin and fight signs of aging!&lt;br /&gt;Update - months after first trying this product, I&#x27;m still using it daily!  I love how my skin just soaks it right in and looks smoother and feels hydrated!  I recently purchased a bottle for my friend, and I got her hooked too!  And you can&#x27;t beat the reasonable price for such excellent quality!  I&#x27;ve used more expensive serums before, but this one is superior!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Helps my skin look much younger. A little goes a very long way. I layer it under my skin care regimen, after toning.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! As a person with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m always worried about the effects products will have - especially on my face. This product has had no reactions on my face at all! It has become a part of my daily beauty routine. The serum isn&#x27;t too thick or too runny, and it doesn&#x27;t have any odd odors like other products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin, making it easy to fit into your morning routine, and you don&#x27;t need to use much to cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a while. I love how smooth and healthy my face feels after I use it! The packaging is clean and reminds you of something you would buy at a spa - love it! I&#x27;m sure this will be a permanent addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Where to start. Obviously it was easy to apply.  Nothing crazy.  It was quickly absorbed into my skin, which I liked.  However, I saw a very small improvement if any.  I hoped it would be better than it was.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C by Day By Day comes in a beautiful cobalt blue glass bottle with I love. This product made my skin look and feel amazing! It definitely nourishes your skin with antioxidants and rich hydrating ingredients &amp; makes your skin looked and felt noticeably smoother and healthier over time while using this product.Day By Day Vitamin C serum is definitely on my list of favorite Vitamin C serums I have tried so far. I have been using this product for a quite awhile now &amp; can definitely notice a difference in my skin. This product met my expectations &amp; I would definitely recommend this Vitamin C serum to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using vitamin C serum for the first time and I must say it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve always had good skin but a little enhancement never hurts. I truly love this product and best of all the seller emailed me with instructions on how to get the best results. I think it&#x27;s a win, win all the way.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected, I have used it day and night, no difference, wont purchase again. It apperars to tighten your face, but no difference in looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has been serious about my skin for about 8 years now (I&#x27;m 48). A professed beauty product addict, I have tried many MANY creams, lotions, oils, repair, anti-aging, complexes, serums etc from the drug store brand to the $100/oz bottles.  I also think it&#x27;s important to tell, I truly give each product plenty of time to show some results and I&#x27;m religious with my daily routine. That said, I have felt my skin had reached its peak a couple of years ago, began to think my skin had become immune.  THIS product has shown results. I am not a scientist so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better! Younger looking for sure and I saw these results within the first few days.  I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years! Even my 23y/o daughter just told me my skin looks so good!! For the price, I would be foolish to change. Oh how I love the idea of a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product. I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate.  No more research and trials for me. I&#x27;m hooked.  I hope this review helps all ladies like me.  Thank you Day By Day, please make more products soon</li>
            <li> Seller sent an email to tell me product would be late, no big deal.  Product is not a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; if your thinking &amp;#34;syrup like&amp;#34; consistency.  It squirts out a large amount, fast, not controllable like a serum usually is, so you are using alot of product per application ( not like any serum i am used to ), it is thin and watery and will drip right off your finger tip, so you need to cup yor hand and spray it into your palm and rub it in fast as it absorbs fast like water ( not spreadable or creamy in any way), it has little to no smell.&lt;br /&gt;The Label has gotten wet and since smeared and is illegible and I cannot read it, kind of like it was made on someones home computer.  Despite the good ratings, my gut opinion is that this is over priced for whatever is inside this bottle, I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Just got it next three days! Did not use it till last week. No rash or break outs!!! I use it three times so far as I am watching to make sure that  no skin reactions appear. Then I will use it twice a day daily and will let you know next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write reviews, but within the short time I have used this serum I have been impressed with the results. I have sensitive, break-out prone skin, that is also prone to redness; while using this I have noticed brighter, smoother skin, and less redness. I love how quickly it absorbs into your skin and wears very well under make-up! I am looking forward to seeing results after long-time use - 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I like the way it absorbs quickly and has improved the texture of my skin.I have been using the product for 2 weeks and notice my skin to be brighter.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to add to your daily morning and night routine!  I could see improvements the first week!</li>
            <li> My wife tried this and made the following observations: It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  The smell is very neutral and my skin feels clean after use.  The serum also dries quickly and I was able to follow with my moisturizer without delay.  I used one pump both morning and night and followed with my daytime moisturizer and nighttime moisturizer (both Origins).  My skin texture was smooth and soft after using the product.  I  have yet to see any visible change to the few dark spots I have on my skin.  Overall I like the Vitamin C Serum and believe it improved the elasticity of my skin.  Regarding the packaging, I would recommend that the bottle have a &amp;#34;see-thru&amp;#34; area so that you know how much product is remaining in the bottle.  The wrap around label prohibits me from knowing without removal of the same.</li>
            <li> reduced crows feet within 3 days. arizona kills my skin and day by day serum revives it like a pro. i love this stuff</li>
            <li> The only women I know that don’t care to forget their lines are actresses. The rest of us wish the mirror wouldn’t repeat them over and over again (this gets old fast!). This product is for the rest of us. The working women (yes, I know even actresses work) that want a product that works as hard as we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over my many years of using vitamin C serums this is the only one that has made a “visible” difference. It took two months of diligent use nightly and then suddenly one morning I awoke to see something I hadn’t seen in years. Less lines instead of more! I thought the earth had shifted on it’s axis and expected dogs and cats to start day trading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold: a beauty product actually did what it promised. You bet I was radiant! Now instead of avoiding the mirror I’m actually liking what I’m seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I’m not a newbie to vitamin C serums (many more expensive). I’ve used more than my fair share over the years. I’m in my 50s. Do the math! I’m also not surprised when a product doesn’t live up to it’s promise. I kind of expect it now. That was, until Day by Day came along and literally made my Day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, I can’t say I’m pumped about the new pump, much preferring the original glass dropper but that’s easily changed and I’ve already done it. In my effort to be a “natural, toxic-free” lady, I try to avoid plastics at all costs. That’s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, here’s my nightly regimen for what it’s worth. Wash with Acure facial cleanser, rinse well. Layer on a coat of Day by Day Vitamin C Serum. Wait a couple minutes until skin feels slightly tight. Follow with Acure Seriously Firming Facial Serum (&amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; by my definition). Let set for 20 min or so. And last rub in the Acure night cream of my choice. And Yes! I love Acure, too. But that’s another review for yet another (you guessed it)...day. Good Day for now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about three weeks now. I love how quickly it absorbs and with out leaving my face greasy. I have seen a big improvement with the lines on my top lip, and my crows feet. I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for one month now, and the texture, tone, and surface of my skin is noticeable smoother and lines less noticeable. The product is absorbed by the skin quickly and leaves it smooth and supple. After spending thousands on facial skin products promising this and that, in this serum I have finally found one that actually does what it says it does. I am very satisfied and am about to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again. It doesn&#x27;t work and is a waste of money. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vit C serums and found them to be marginally helpful, but the Day By Day Vit C Serum, really has given me &#x27;day by day&#x27; results.  I&#x27;m a nurse and know the power of Vitamin C in it&#x27;s many forms for disease management/prevention, but this topical surprised me.  I&#x27;ve seen definite improvement in the texture and appearance of fine lines around my face and eyes.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my neck and chest and the skin looks more supple and feels tighter.  The hyaluronic acid amplifies the effects of the Vit C serum. I am skeptical, by necessity, but must admit that after a month, I am giving this serum 5 stars. I will soon be ready to reorder and will update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I would address this review to anyone (male or female) who wants a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Best Vitamin C Serum from a Day By Day Beauty about one month ago. I have to say my immediate reaction was how velvety the product felt on my skin. It does not seem to have any added fragrances or artificial colorings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But....what has really sold me on this product has been the gradual evening of my skin tone. After many years of outdoor activities and sport I have some moderate freckling and discoloration. I don&#x27;t like using the term \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; but this is probably accurate. These discolorations are less noticeable now, after just one month. I have 5X magnifying make-up mirrors in both bathrooms, as I&#x27;ve also gotten to the age of needing a little help, especially for eyeliner and mascara application. I really scrutinize every little bump and/or pore on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if my skin looks better, brighter and more even at 5X magnification, imagine what it looks like normally? I can&#x27;t wait to attend my 40th High School Reunion this August, to tell everyone my newest \\&quot;secret.\\&quot; AND, buy an additional bottle of Best Vitamin C Serum for my second bathroom, so I don&#x27;t miss a single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roberta from Chicago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you I do not work for this company and I&#x27;m just some gal in upper michigan who was searching for the latest and greatest in skin care for aging skin. (I saw a lot of people that felt the positive reviews were from marketers I guess). I&#x27;m 40 and I have a lot of sun damage and cannot afford a peel right now. I was skeptical probably like you are reading this, like geez, an awesome product on Amazon but the reviews were convincing so I gave it go. I saw a difference in my skin after one use and even better after each day. I won&#x27;t go without it. I use it in combo with Arbonne&#x27;s night cream. It probably helps that I&#x27;m a health fanatic, like organic vegetable juicing etc and I don&#x27;t drink soda, I stay hydrated, and I exercise (that all enhances anything you try to do to prevent premature aging) but this stuff works and works exceptionally well, amazing. I will buy again and have been recommending and now I may have to try their other products. It smooths out your skin, lightens it, and it just looks friggin amazing... try it you will not be disappointed. PS if this helps anyone, I am pretty European in origin (bl hair/green eyes etc). I have acne scars and sometimes large pore issues and it&#x27;s amazing how much improved (80% or more and it&#x27;s been less than a few weeks).</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum due to a special on amazon,I must say I was very pleased at how  quick my order arrived&lt;br /&gt; I love the way it glides on my face feels like silk. I am already noticing visible signs of  reduction in wrinkles and an added bonus of glowing skin.I must admit this is only my 4 th day using the product ,I really can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a few weeks.I would highly recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys for creating a serum that works.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 bottles but 1 came broken but i love the product and i have seen a big difference</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing, has no odor, texture, or taste, I believe it to be a complete fake. I saw no improvement in texture tone or clarity even after using it everyday for weeks.</li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks of use, I can already see the fine lines around the corners of my eyes disappear. In a couple of weeks I may be comfortable enough to upload some pictures!</li>
            <li> I use a retin A and this removes any flakiness from that - leaves me with smooth skin - Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now and loving it. The fine lines has faded away slowly. My only concern is, once in a while, one or two pimples shows up. Not a big deal because they went away faster now than before I used the serum.... Before, my forehead was filled with tiny pimples or zits. Now they are all gone. My face looks brighter and softer too. My daily regimen is washing my face in the morning, then apply a toner. After that, the serum and finally, I apply Oil of Olay with SPF. I only do this once a day. Sorry for the run on sentences.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample bottle of Vitamin C Serum in exchange for an honest review. I have to admit that I had a very specific problem in mind - hereditary saggy eyelids. I have tried a lot of different products that tighten skin, but most do not help in this area. Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t either. However, I found it very pleasant to use and tried it for several weeks all over my face and neck. At first, I didn&#x27;t use an additional moisturizer, but my skin started feeling a little tight and dry, so the moisturizer (an aloe-based cream) helped a lot. There is almost no scent to the serum, which is a plus. You also need very little to do a sufficient job of covering the skin without being chintzy. Other than the baggy eyelids, I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin (lucky me!) so I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic changes. I found the product very pleasant to use and will keep it handy for when I do need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my previous review that when the prescription my 83-year-old mother had for a cream to heal sun damage went from $29 to over $100, I suggested that she try the Vitamin C serum. To our delight, it is working better than the much more expensive prescription! She has been using it for a few months now and the rash she had been unsuccessfully treating with the prescription is all but gone. She has ordered another bottle and is very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I received the Serum a few days after purchase.  Even with the bad weather, delivery was prompt.  I have only been using it for a few days and I really like how my face feels.  In the dry and harsh winter condition, my face feels nourished and fresh.  I am glad I found this product and hope that it will produce good long term results.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my girlfriend. Says she likes it better than the stuff she pays much more for. I&#x27;d say its a win! Great product and a great company!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for several weeks now and is very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She feels that her face is softer and she has a younger appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is ordering more and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my face feel so soft.  maybe i am using too much as it seems to be going quickly.</li>
            <li> At 55 years old I didn&#x27;t think any skin product would make a real difference to my skin but your serum has proved me wrong, thank you.</li>
            <li> Easy transaction and i love the serum.  Making all the little imperfections of my face go away.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but my face feels smoother &amp; looks brighter. The only thing is, the serum seems more watery than other vitamin c serums, but maybe that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used so far. It&#x27;s been weeks, and I already see a difference in my skin tone. I love it. I&#x27;m reordering.</li>
            <li> I started my second bottle about a week ago.  I can tell a huge difference.  I have seen where it is suggested to take  phytoceramides with it for it to really work.  But, I wanted to just try the serum first to see.  Within 2 weeks I noticed a difference.  I had a dark spot that is now almost completely gone.  My skin looks so smooth that it looks like I am wearing a mineral powder.  My skin is tighter and where it was sagging along the jaw line has lifted considerably.  My face is plumper.  It feels younger. My lines are much less noticable.  I am comfortable going out without makeup on, I just put one a little blusher.  I use it morning and night and I exfoliate daily.  I put it all over my face, on my jawline and neck and upper chest area.  It takes about 3 pumps.  It feels like water, but trust me it is not.  It does go on better when my face is slightly damp.  I am over 50 years old.  There are so many products out there, and I have tried a lot of lotions and creams from department stores.  They hydrate, but do nothing like this does.  I still use a moisturizer over it when it dries.  It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.  So happy I found it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were regular users of a variety of other products costing much more than this product.  We both found this product as good or better than much more expensive products.  In my case, I use the product mainly for some very fine facial scarring that many mistake for wrinkles.  This serum is a perfect consistency and the spray applicator (overlooked by many other brands), makes application very easy.  Unlike my previous experiences, both my wife and I agree there is less of an oily feel after application.  Our skin feels and looks tighter (I find I have to shave first however) and hydrates the skin very well. My fine scars do not disappear.  However, they appear less noticeable even when scrutinized under very good lighting. Ib both our cases, it took about 10 days of regular use to achieve what we believe are good results. I use the product as a stand alone while my wife will use the product in conjunction with her regular routine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can definitely recommend this product.  Just keep in mind, everyone is different and your results may vary.  In our case, my wife is light skin- fair complexion while I am darker skinned not so fair complexion (Irish versus Italian).</li>
            <li> I really like this product.I have noticed that the small lines around my eyes and mouth have smoothed out  and the rest of my face looks smooth and soft I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 days, my skin is much tighter...in a good way! I am looking forward to the long term benefits of using this on a daily basis, I love that there is no scent, and that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> This comes in a bottle, with the pump separate, which is great packaging, since the product is less likely to be wasted during treatment and I don&#x27;t have to worry about figuring out how to &#x27;unlock&#x27; a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is clear, and a bit watery.  It absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what strength Vit. C it is, but it is lower than some products that I have used that turned my skin red.  This does not irritate my skin at all, so I think it is fairly low strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a $28 moisturizer that just was not working, in fact, my skin had started going backwards and looking older.  I jumped when I saw an affordable promotion on this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I quit when this came in and started using this with Aveno Positively ageless at night, which is one that i find affordable and effective.  it is doing even better with this serum.  In just a bit less than 2 weeks, my skin is showing definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product absorbs in and is pleasant enough to use,and doesn&#x27;t have an annoying scent.  It is very gentle and I&#x27;ve not had any irritation, which I expected a bit since I am sensitive to high concentrations of Vit. C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I find following it with a good moisturizer, as directed, is very important, but it does seem to boost the results of my favorite moisturizer.  The best serum I personally have used had caviar extract in it, but it was 3x this cost.  This is a nice serum for this price range.</li>
            <li> it feels and smells nice, I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months or more  now and I don&#x27;t notice a difference on my face</li>
            <li> I really like this C Serum! I love that is natural ingredients. There is no stinging like some other products I have tried. There is no scent added so it doesn&#x27;t effect my allergies. After only two days I can see a difference. My skin looks healthier , more radient and feels fantastic. It has been a long time since my face felt so soft. My fine lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging &amp; easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I am 60 &amp; I live in florida and stay outdoors a l am anxious to see after more time of use if this helps with my sun spots.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my skin.  The Vitamin C Serum brightens your and tightens you skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I like to wash my face in the shower and that&#x27;s it.  I never put anything other than sunscreen on my face, so this was a challenge.  It’s a small bottle but it only uses a little to completely cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has som sun damage in the form of tiny brown sports that get nicked when I shave.  I also have large pores on my nose from teenage acne.  My neck has plenty of scratches and nicks.  After applying this material for five days in a row after I shower, I am really stunned at what it does.  My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother.  In fact, my entire face looks smoother.  And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin.  It looks and feels invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect anything to happen, but this was a real surprise.  I already plan to order another bottle.  So I&#x27;m vain, but who doesn&#x27;t want to look their best?  It seems to be pricey but I figure this will last a month if used every day.  You don&#x27;t need much.  Product supplied for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, I have used it for 3 days and my skin feels better, smoother and glowing.  Not greasy and no breakouts, which is a great thing.  Easy to use  and no harsh scents.  Great price also,  Received so quickly, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum.  my skin drinks it in.  I am 53 and the improvement is remarkable after 2 days.  I recommend this to any one with skin that is older with sun damage.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product for a couple months, and absolutely love it. The serum works quickly and my skin feels amazing. It really smooths out my skin texture, and noticeably reduces wrinkles. I can’t say enough good things about the product. I just wish it came with more in the bottle, because it’s absolutely amazing. The price is really affordable for such a high quality product. Great skin guaranteed!</li>
            <li> I kept using this every day for a month to see if over time it would do something, but my skin is no different. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> With so many skin care products to choose from, you might be tempted to go for a product offering a larger bottle and a fancy package.  Don’t be misled by packaging – this product really works!  A small amount on a clean face every day will yield a brighter skin, a reduction in fine lines and a tighter skin in just a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the ingredients that do the trick.  Not only is there vitamin C in this serum, but there’s also hyaluronic acid that plumps the skin.  And it’s good to know that the serum contains none of the drying chemicals that often appear in expensive creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  I have found it really works for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> thought it would make any improvement; i now have bumpy spots on my skin (no, not acne or pimples) and there is no smoothness or any of the other notable features of this product...</li>
            <li> Did not fade any of my brown spots.  However it did make my skin a little softer.  Absorbs right into skin.  I gave it 4 stars on how it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s easy to apply and feels good on my skin. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Can I just say that I am impressed by this serum and by the company! One day before the serum was set to arrive; I received an email from the company explaining to me the product and how to use it for the best results. I have never received such a service on Amazon, or any other place for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is like liquid gold for my skin. I have been applying it twice a day, and my skin feels smooth and plump. I know that vitamin C serums are great for the skin and supposed to help with anti aging, so I will continue to use this serum and see where it’s fabulous natural ingredients get me.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care addict.  I&#x27;ve tried them all - expensive and value priced.  I have been using Day by Day every morning and every evening for a month now and I love it.  My crows feet are less defined and my dark spots have become considerably lighter.  It is so easy to apply and absorbs quickly!  This one is definitely a keeper!!  It&#x27;s a great price point.  I&#x27;m going to buy a couple of these bottles for my friend&#x27;s birthday - even tho I&#x27;m not sure I want her to look as good as me!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product it does a good job,&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much. My skin is happy .</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and its just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I normally use Dr. Oz serum and thought I would try a new brand…big mistake. The Dr. Oz Serum is much more superior in my opinion.  Will NOT buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> I have been using another serum but found that it made my skin feel oily so I changed my routine to only using it at night.  I received the Day By Day C Serum approximately a week ago and have faithfully put it to the test by using it every morning and evening after cleansing and before my daily moisturizer.  Although it is watery (which is not enough of a problem to give this product anything lower than 5 stars), it goes on easily and dries quickly.  About 4 pumps covers my face, neck, and chest.  I&#x27;m honestly not sure how well it&#x27;s working on my face because I have been working on it through a Dermatologist for a couple of years now, but I can definitely say that using it on my neck and chest has made a real difference.  I can feel how much smoother and softer the skin is.  The price is definitely right for the product and I will look into replenishing supply of this product when it gets low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish to add to my initial review:  I tried using my original serum for a couple of days just to see if I could tell a difference and I can honestly say that after using the Day By Day serum, my skin is noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother looking anymore! Trust me, I&#x27;m a product junky and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve seen real results in short amount of time! Bought this because of recommendation n reviews and thank god I did! Everything written is true! Glowing skin, smaller pores, lines softened, skin plumper more youthful looking, dry, flaky skin gone, spots lightened! Miracle in a bottle, give it a try n stick with it and you&#x27;ll believe!</li>
            <li> ​This wrinkle serum is the best! I’m a female in her late 40’s and have been a little skeptical about trying serums, but this completely erased my fears and is starting to erase my wrinkles too! I also figured I’d be okay with aging and developing wrinkles, but I woke up and realized one day I’m NOT. I should have known being the make-up guru that I am that wrinkles would not suit me. After the first use of this product I noticed that my skin was more firm. I can definitely feel the elasticity and life coming back into not only my face, but my neck too. This is all from using it once a day. I read the directions for use this morning and realized it’s recommended to be used twice a day and it amazed me all over again. I’m so excited to see more results. This is now part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I been trying and I get best results since I try it some of my costumers are been so happy with this serum</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes after about 3 weeks. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with the product. I will be ordering more wrinkles seem to b better and brown marks seem to be getting lighter</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel silky soft. It helped smooth some of the lines around my eyes. Would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would help with uneven skin tone and some acne scars and this serum has definitely helped my skin. My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin, isn&#x27;t oily, and absorbs really fast. You should give it a try ;)</li>
            <li> I usually apply the serum before bed every other night and have not used any other products while using the serum and ever since then, my skin has reacted well to the product. There have been times if I do not apply some kind of hydrating product, my skin tends to feel tight and dry. I have not had this problem ever since I have been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C serum bottle features a pump style applicator which helps keep air from getting in contact with the serum which is also meant to keep the quality of the product. The serum is almost of a liquid consistency which helps the product to be absorbed but also makes it a little tricky when applying it, so you need to gently press the pump to avoid wasting the serum as it is unlike most other serums I have tried. It is very watery, but by the same token it is not sticky as other products I have tried so I can actually apply the serum before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is minimalistic which is fine by me. Again, you do need to be careful when you are applying it in order to prevent wasting the serum.</li>
            <li> I believe in taking my time to review and talk about skin care products. It is simply because those types of products need time to truly see the results and to reflect on their true benefit. Truly something that cannot be done overnight. Despite what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also find that the review might change dramatically from one day to another. For example I may like the moisturizer one day but the next day may wake up with a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Needless to say the best way to review skin care is simply to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Today I am going against the code. Why? On May 13th, 2014 I received my Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum. A serum can make me go against my code? Yes, very much so. Here is why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin c serum is a triple threat made with the finest quality Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Hyaluronic Acid. Key ingredients in the fight against age spots, wrinkles, and those stubborn fine lines.  Along side those power house ingredients are also Aloe, and Jojoba Oil; which deeply hydrate and heel skin. Giving you hydrated, clear, soft, supple, and simply gorgeous skin. The best ingredients to truly benefit and target the key problems all us women and men share. It is such a power house of ingredients with true benefits and yet so gentle.  Making it a essential part of the skin care routine for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and can not always use these types of products but I have found even after daily use I have had no sensitivities what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The formula itself  is a thin clear consistency, odor free and your skin just drinks it in. My skin is so hydrated, soft, firm and so vibrant after using it only for two weeks. It has truly benefited my skin and will surely be part of my skin care regiment for years to come. I am truly a fan and I believe if you try it you will be too.</li>
            <li> i love love this product-so far it has faded the little sun spots i had across my nose area-goes on quick and absorbes  super quick-this is a winner-makes your skin soft and the plus of fading my sun spots!big big plus too is i have super sensitive skin and this has not had any bad side affects so far-been doing it mornings and nights-so good so far!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really write reviews but for this product- I had to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried all the expensive stuff and they all caused a reaction. I have very sensitive skin. I was hesitant to buy this product at first because its not a well known brand name. But I had become desperate in my search to find something that actually worked without causing an allergic reaction. I read the reviews but I&#x27;m always skeptical of how true/real they are:/ It was returnable and not too expensive so why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I took a chance on this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise- best product I&#x27;ve ever applied to my face. Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days!. I&#x27;m Indian so I tend to have the discoloration mostly around the mouth/chin area. After using this serum- I don&#x27;t even need any foundation. I still have sun spots though but they seem to have lightened a little. It also helped with dry skin but a good moisturizer is needed after it dries. TIP- I use a gel moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reaction either- its light. Absorbs quickly- No break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Didn&#x27;t see much improvement for fine lines but that could be because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. Will update in a month if I see any results for fine lines. And I also, will update if I see results for sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it highly for discoloration.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see much difference.  My skin does feel some what softer. Will use it all and then give a better review.</li>
            <li> *I received this as part of an advertorial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying out and reviewing a few Vitamin C Serums.  This was the only one with a pump.  It was a nice addition!  I knew that if it happened to get knocked over (with three kids that happens) I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not strong scented and sunk in easily with no residue feeling.  The only issue I had was that it did leave a residue feeling on my hands, but when touching your face you should always keep your hands clean. A quick wash and I was back to normal. It left my face feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am open minded and objective about products like this. I have used others with some very good results. This product did not change or improve my skin. I was very diligent and followed directions. Product did not work on any type of &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;. Nice bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was reduced by $70. How can that be?</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but again not exactly what I was looking for. I have very deep wrinkles around my mouth from years of smoking and sun damage so I am looking for something to soften those this helps but not as good as the really expensive products that I can not afford all the time.</li>
            <li> Day By Day Vitamin C Serum is used in conjunction with Vitamin-C Serum for Face.  Both of those together are working wonders.  To take one one or two steps for the night before bed or in the AM.  So excited that it is that simply, yet the evidence of GREAT skin is so worth it. Di</li>
            <li> only been usng it a week but have sensitive skin and so far so good-goes on quick and leaves it smooth~</li>
            <li> Ntz4dgs&lt;br /&gt;My sister got this serum and saw great results so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s amazing! I have sensitive skin and I have had zero problems with it. I use it morning and night. I took a picture when I first started using it and I took another this week. It&#x27;s been about a month. My skin is so much smoother and my dark splotches have faded greatly! I am one happy customer! Just did the buy 4 get 1 free deal! Try it. You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this product as much as i want to do to a small bout with psoriasis on my forehead,but as i am now useing a cream for that i will be able to use the Vitamin C as i want to, Please check back with me at a later time and i will give a great review. Thank You .</li>
            <li> I like this serum as it is light, not greasy and does not have any scent. My skin didn&#x27;t have any untoward reaction to this wonder serum and I can see less visible crow&#x27;s feet and more supple and softer skin after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this beauty serum as it is packed with potent Vitamin C that helps prevent signs of ageing, improves skin&#x27;s complexion and gives your skin a youthful radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to thank the supplier for the very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Feels like water, not at all sticky.  Quickly absorbs.  Overall, it is a good product.  Will probably purchase again.  Waiting to see how effective it is first.  Will update this review at a later date, if possible.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of the Day By Day Vitamin C Serum product, and I absolutely love it. I have tried several different products, and by far Day By Day is the best. I am in my late thirties, and I tend to have sensitive and oily skin, so I am limited as to what I can use on my skin. However, I have not had any issues with this product whatsoever. It hydrates my skin, leaving it soft and supple, glowing, less fine lines and wrinkles, etc. I cannot say enough good things about this product. You will not be disappointed! I can&#x27;t wait to see what they come up with next... Thank you Day By Day for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Is working so well I reordered to ensure the benefits continue. Wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to previous rough skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum for the last 2 months and I Love it!!! I use it every day twice a day. I have noticed the change on my skin. My skin looks more brightening, tightening &amp; smoother. Awesome product! :)</li>
            <li> A friend of mine let me know about this product - she liked it a lot because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling behind, as do a number of other popular serums out there. I have to agree - it leaves the skin feeling super refreshed and gently tight, I really like it. Day by Day Beauty also has some nice videos I found which were helpful to learn more about application, ingredients, etc. Would totally recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I have been only using this for a short while but I really like how it is really working. It is a must to your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I use this day and night.  My face look much better and grow too. I will keep using this one.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Day by Day Vitamin C Serum to review.  When I put it on my face it feels good, making my skin feel smooth.  I like the fact that it has a pump, instead of a dropper, so there is no chance of bacteria getting into the serum.  There are a lot of great ingredients, but there three ingredients that I would rather not use, which are Carbomer, Phenoxy- ethanol and Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (Botanical Hyaluronic Acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Carbomer, Arginine, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phenoxy- ethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola Extract), Organic Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Plant Extract), Organic Pelagonium Gravoleons (Geranium Extract), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see visible results! Or, maybe I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough! Maybe in another week or so, I could possibly see visible results!</li>
            <li> Good product, saw result fairly early.</li>
            <li> As for delivery, the packaging was nice, and delivery was prompt.  The bottle itself looks smaller than the picture implies, but a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, it feels so light on the skin, you can apply your normal makeup right over top of this once it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a natural product, that absorbs quickly, feels great, and seems to do what it claims, look no further....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Brenda R.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff...use after each face washing. Has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> First I have to give the disclaimer that I got this product in order to review it. I was given no monetary compensation and this opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for about a week now.  So far my skin feels great.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues with it either. There was a slight odor when you open it, but after it&#x27;s applied to the skin there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any lingering. Its refreshing and wonderful to use.  I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes yet, but like I said it&#x27;s only been about a week.  I am however highly optimistic, and this small bottle seems to be able to be used for awhile!</li>
            <li> There are no direct issues with the seller, this is only a review of the product. I was thinking about leaving one star and decided to give it 2 stars only because I would call it poor instead of awful. I have used OBAJI and NEOCUTIS. I lost my job and couldn&#x27;t afford $80-$120 per oz of product. Believe me when I say those products actually worked. I had decided to look at the reviews on a few \\&quot;off brand\\&quot; non-recognized and ordered three different off brands. Day by day is the worst in consistency. This product is barely thicker than water. All of the products are much more thicker-which to me indicates more moisturizer or in my opinion hyluranic acid. Also Vitamin C is naturally thick in its consistency. Just do a google search to verify what I am saying on product thickness. Going back to the product, I have used it every night and there is NO DIFFERENCE in my light freckles, age spots or frown line reduction. My skin is the exact same as 2 weeks ago when I started, no difference everyone, no difference. I don&#x27;t write many reviews but in case someone is in a tight spot and looking for off brand solutions, I am only writing to describe my personal experience with this product. I would NOT recommend this to anyone and I would caution on wasting $20 for water because that is essentially what it is. Remember there is no federal regulation describing amounts and companies can claim whatever they want about their product. This product leaks out of my hand; is hard to put on my face and has produced NO results. I wish that a cheap product would work but unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t and I just want to help the next potential victim look somewhere else. By the way, out to the cheap products makeupartistschoice was what has worked best, but still not comparable to obaji or neocutis</li>
            <li> Normally this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d be interested it, but I can&#x27;t ignore that parts of my face definitely show their age. I tried Vitamin C Serum by Day By Day Beauty in small hope that it might de-emphasize some of the bagginess and wrinkles around my eyes, and I do believe it is doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally tend to use the serum both in the morning at at night, followed by a moisturizer. After an hour or so, I see less puffiness and bagginess, and the wrinkles are someone minimized. Paired with the moisturizer, my skin isn&#x27;t dry all day. It actually feels more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to say unequivocally that I look &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; (I have a hard time seeing myself that way in the mirror). But I do see changes, and I feel good about using the serum on my face as a cleansing routine long ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Retailer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have purchased.  After using the first bottle I didn&#x27;t really see any changes.  I am half way through the second and I am seeing some change.  NOT drastic, and as I said it&#x27;s pricy!  I might go for a third just to see if it&#x27;s the product that is improving my look or the 25lbs I just lost.  Lol</li>
            <li> I have had zero breakouts since I started using this product and my skin is smooth and radiant. I have gotten several compliments on my skin recently, including from a facialist!  A little bit goes a long way and it dries quickly, which is great in my (hurried) morning routine. Great customer service and website, too.</li>
            <li> While many of the various Vitamin C serums offered on Amazon get great reviews, I purchased Day by Day based on the sheer number of high marks. However, I am returning it for my money back. I really did not like this product. I&#x27;ve used other serums and moisturizers with vitamin C and loved them, but Day by Day made my skin look ruddy and coarse. I also did not like the runny consistency. It seems to work for other people, but it certainly was not appropriate for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the serum for over a month and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. I love that it comes in a dark bottle to protect the ingredients from the sun&#x27;s rays. The pump is just great. The serum is like water, as many serums are. This serum is not packed with oils to thicken it but the advantage there is the more rapid absorption. I really love the non greasy face after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes the skin feel refreshed and hydrated. I did notice my skin had a healthier glow from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an esthetician and I have very sensitive skin. I had no problem whatsoever with this product - so no breakouts, or rashes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of the added moisture of the serum means that less day cream is needed.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this to try and use on my stretch marks. I know it isn&#x27;t what it is &#x27;meant&#x27; for, but I was pleased with the results. I&#x27;m about a month into my bottle and my stretch marks are a lot less visible than they were. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or build up- I HATE makeup and lotions of all sorts, so it was a relief to have a product that doesn&#x27;t bother me so much. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Even my husband is using it daily and loves it! He has noticed improvement with his skin feeling more hydrated and more of a brighter complexion! That is saying a lot coming from a man!! My skin is glowing and looks and feels younger after using twice a day for 2 months! I highly recommend this Vitamin C product!!}</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure the ratings aren&#x27;t real.  Once purchased even though it was returned because my skin felt extremely dry after 2 uses, I&#x27;ve been barraged with requests to leave a review and rating.  I&#x27;m not impressed with the product or incessant requests to reviews it at all which is why it got 1 star.</li>
            <li> as promised , great product. came in time for my trip. was so easy to use.I am on my 2nd bottle can see great results.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about the benefits of Vitamin C on your skin and the combination of Hyaluronic with it, so I decided it was worth trying. This product has been the best stuff I’ve gotten for my skin this year and I wish I had discovered it before the winter started. I’m in my 30s and have issues with large pores, age spots and dry patches on my skin. Not a week goes by without a breakout or dry spot on my face, but after a few days I noticed an immediate change in the texture and overall feel of my skin. I have tried other products like: E-Cream, Retinol-Rich Skin Care and a Vitamin C and Green Tea Renewal Serum but they have not been as successful. They made my skin either too oily or too dry and flaky. I give every product at least a month try but I have to admit this serum helped tame the dry spots and give my skin an overall glow in just a few applications (once every day before going to bed) - Love it!. The first thing I liked about the product was its easy absorption – It wasn’t thick or smelly. After each application, the skin quickly absorbs it and stays hydrated. Yup! My skin stays hydrated for hours. This product is living up to its claims and since I’m so satisfied with its initial results, I’m going to start using it during the day as well before applying my daily moisturizer. This is my new favorite! Recommended.</li>
            <li> After only 2days my skin feels so much softer.I&#x27;ve finally found a product that delivers. The customer service is excellent,they contacted me to give me tips. I am one happy customer!!! I will definitely use them again.I haven&#x27;t been this excited about a product in a long time!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay folks,after almost 2 weeks I looked in the mirror this morning and can see that my wrinkles are fading!!! Soft,healthy skin and reduced wrinkles,I am overjoyed.Nobody has asked me to write this,I just have to share with women,like myself,that have spent a ton of cash on products that don&#x27;t deliver,THIS ONE DOES!!!! I&#x27;m overjoyed that I found something that works,I&#x27;m loving what I see in the mirror.Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.I am a fan and customer for life!!!!!</li>
            <li> It feels light and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I don&#x27;t see anything different yet.  Maybe it takes time.  Or my skin is too oily or both.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product, so it&#x27;s hard to say how well it works, but I like how it feels. The seller is great, responds quickly to questions and sends instructions on the proper way to use it</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be erasing a lot of the deep wrinkles. I use it once, mostly twice a day.  I&#x27;ll hope for the best I guess.</li>
            <li> this is a  reorder after a little over a month of use. the people who own this company provide an old fashioned &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; experience! my order was place the day before their wedding and Pamela took time to email to apologize for a slight delay. I thanked her for her consideration and then she sent me a picture of her wedding to Ryan. It&#x27;s a pleasure to know their are still &amp;#34;people who treat others as people&amp;#34; and not an order number! And the product is working for me and I have a &#x27;few&#x27; age spots at 71!! lol&lt;br /&gt;dave. Florida</li>
            <li> I was super excited about doing this product. This Vitamin C Serum provides thirsting skin with antioxidants &amp; rich, hydrating ingredients. It is mentioned by the company that These ingredients naturally brighten skin tone, diminish superficial fine lines and wrinkles, reverse sun damage effects, lighten acne scarring, restore healthy elasticity, clarify skin, shrink pores &amp; retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part about this serum  is that it is  safe &amp; effective for all skin types, including sensitive skin. The formula is plant-based, without parabens, alcohol, or fillers. And of course made Cruelty-Free in the USA. I love that it is cruelty-free, we need more products as such to have a good effect on our fellow animals. This is wonderful news!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application of this is easy to use I just put 3 to 4 drops on my palm and massage in circles on my face and neck. It dries near instantly leaving skin smooth immediately.  I have seen my skin become softer and clearer along with brighter. There is no distinct scent to this keeping it natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I truly love this product and I have to say that you need to get yourself some now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://daybydaybeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;Please visit there site for more information. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Absolutely did nothing for me - I used it for more than a month day and night but I did not see any improvement on my face at all.</li>
            <li> Works well, moisturizers and evens skin tone. Already have used two bottles. One bottle lasts for a month for me... Kind of expensive. But it surely does what promises.</li>
            <li> This made my skin very smooth, and soft.  I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to receive a bottle of Day By Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for free through a promotion on Tomoson. The blue glass bottle is 1 fl. oz. and comes with both a cap and a pump. I much prefer the pump to dispense this product, as a different brand of serum came with a dropper with which to apply and it was very messy. Vitamin C Serum is primarily an anti-aging product, and though I am only 24 and do not have major signs of aging just yet, I did notice my skin was brighter and my freckles had faded. I like that Day By Day&#x27;s product is 98% naturally derived and 72% organic, made with vegan hyaluronic acid and organic vitamins C and E.</li>
            <li> Love it. I used it for a week and I seen a bright difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> So for so good, my dark spots are turning lighter!</li>
            <li> (received for review) They say that the devil is in the details, and this product gets it right in those details.  Everything from the proper packaging to ensure your product isn&#x27;t tampered with and has minimal exposure to light and oxygen, to the natural and effective ingredients to give me brighter, plumper skin with fewer lines.  I&#x27;m 42, and have oily skin prone to breakouts.  This serum absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out.  Works great with any moisturizer, too.</li>
            <li> I started to use this Vitamin C Serum the very next morning after I received it, which is about a month ago.  I really like the feel of the serum as soon as I put it on. I feel a tightening sensation on the skin as the serum is rubbed into the skin.  The applicator that the bottle came with is wonderful.  It sprays out exactly the right amount of serum on each side of the cheek. So far I have seen a slight lightning of the age spots, but not much effect on the wrinkles yet.  However, I&#x27;m willing to give it more time to achieve the results I look forward to.  Additionally, the customer service of this company is incredible.  They have already sent me three e-mails since the purchase of this product to see how I am doing with the product and in each e-mail, provided more tips on skincare and how to use the product. One day, I e-mailed them with some questions and received a response back in less than half an hour.  You can&#x27;t beat customer service such as this!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try the Vitamin C Serum from Day By Day Beauty. It comes in a 1oz bottle which seems small but a little goes a long way. The bottle is tightly capped and a pump dispenser is included to switch too after opening. I liked this as it makes it more hygenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a nice \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it. It does not feel greasy at all. It absorbs quickly into the skin. After first use my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I used a scrubbing tool on my neck. Though the tool was designed for the skin, it roughed up my skin and it has never been the same. I tried a variety of lotions and creams on it including alpha hydroxy acids but nothing worked. To my surprise this has smoothed the area down more than anything else. It is not gone but it is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed a reduction in wrinkles, but I have only used it a short time, perhaps that will come in the future. I think this would be an excellent product to use after a skin procedure also when the skin can absorb it fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also clear from the Q&amp;A on this product that the owners care about what they are selling and servicing it. Really nice to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a super nice product at a good price point. I look forward to seeing more results as I use it longer.</li>
            <li> i have been using the serum regularly as per instructions and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. i&#x27;m disappointed since i&#x27;ve read about the benefits of vitamin c.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  After spending many dollars on just the right cleanser, moisturizer, toner, etc...I was in search of something natural that I could put on this 60 years young face that is beginning to show some wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I am more than satisfied with this item.  I tend to have dark circles under my eyes from bad allergies and sleep issues and this product seems to have helped with the darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for even sensitive skin users.  I will break out in a rash if a product is too much for my skin and this one is absolutely fine!</li>
            <li> This is very nice. It goes on smooth and did not leave my skin greasy. I have high hopes that it will improve my skin over time.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my face feel.  My skin feels so much softer and it looks healthy.  I am seventy years old - I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully every day since I received the product.  I saw a difference within a week.  It was a slight difference, but my skin actually felt different.  I have some dark spots that seem to be a little lighter.  My skin just feels better.  At this point it is hard to describe, but I do know that I like the product.  It is light and non-greasy.  I really enjoy that.  I apply it and within minutes I can add my favorite cream.  I am happy with your products.  Maybe next month I can be exact to the changes that I see.</li>
            <li> OMG!!  I had brown spots on my cheeks the size of a quarter result from sunbathing while on antibiotics.  It just took a month using this product and I can barely see them. WOW, I&#x27;m a believer</li>
            <li> My comments are based on very short use, as I only received the serum last weekend. I do use it when I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning and it seems to do a great job on my skin. Smooth and silky - these are real words for what happens. I like it so much, I&#x27;m going to reorder today as the quantities are not large and I don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff, which at ~ $15.00 does what $200.00 creams do not.</li>
            <li> My dark spots started to lighten right away (within 2 weeks).  My skin feels so soft but I have sensitive skin and it clogged my pores.  I can only use just on the dark spots.  Just sent an email asking if they have another product that would do the same thing without the oils in it. I can use Argon, coconut and Jojoba oil - so not sure what ingredient is doing this.  I have been using the Murad dark spot serum ($50.00 a bottle) and that works good too - but after 4 years (on and off) of using it my spots only got 50% lighter and never seemed to get any lighter.  Used this Day by Day vitamin C serum and after 3 weeks my spots are already 20% lighter.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My skin is much cleaner and more beautiful with this great vitamin C serum. Very close customer service. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this vitamin C Serum!  I plan to purchase again in the future.  It has helped my skin look more even and helped with hyperpigmentation and in spots were I have acne scarring.</li>
            <li> With all the anti-wrinkle/anti-aging products out there, I think this one outshines them all.  Best Vitamin C Serum from Day by Day Beauty actually improves skin texture, reduces wrinkles and fine lines, and leaves skin looking younger and feeling more elastic.  It results in skin that is brighter and more vibrant.  I especially like the fact that this serum is fast-acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who prefers using natural products, I was thrilled that this beauty serum contains three powerful ingredients:  Hyaluronic Acid, which restores collagen and reduces wrinkles; Vitamin E, a protective antioxidant; and of course Vitamin C, an antioxidant that also helps to build collagen.  Consequently, Best Vitamin C Serum will gently tighten facial and delicate neck skin.  It even has a refreshing aloe scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed that this beauty product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic and is tested in cruelty-free laboratories, so you can feel comfortable using this incredible serum.  It is made in the USA and comes in a decorative cobalt blue bottle.  As a special gift along with your purchase, you will receive Application Secrets and Pro-Tips, as well as a 100% Satisfaction, 100% money-back guarantee.  Definitely worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JEB, Florence, NJ</li>
            <li> I work outside year round ,swimmer with dark discoloration along both sides of my jaw,3 age spots from years of outdoor living.&lt;br /&gt;This serum works its fadinding along the jawline within 2 weeks of morning and night application.&lt;br /&gt;I also applied to age spots and watched them they have faded as well.&lt;br /&gt;On my wrinkles and pores they also seem a little better I will be ordering more .&lt;br /&gt;age52&lt;br /&gt;skin tone olive</li>
            <li> This serums is really affordable and effective.  I saw something about Vitamin C on Dr. Oz, but I only really believed in its efficacy after using it.  It&#x27;s not an overnight solution, but I have used it now for about four weeks and have seen a remarkable difference with respect to wrinkles, skin tone and resiliency, and lightening of my dark spots.  Company also sent me a 25% off coupon after my first purchase.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I also use the hyaluronic acid.  It hydrates and plumps my skin better than any product I have ever used.  I am 64 years old and my doctor had suggested I use RetinA to combat wrinkles.  I have tried for months to get on a RetinA regiment with no success.  It was so drying I could only use it once a week.  Once I started using the Day by Day vit. C and hyaluronic acid every morning  my face was so hydrated that I decided to try the RetinA again. I can use the RetinA every night and my face doesn&#x27;t get dry and flakey.  My daily regiment is vitamin C followed by hyaluronic acid.  Once that dries I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with SPF30.  In the evening I use the RetinA .</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, pores smaller, and fine wrinkles have disappeared.  This product is worth it and I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I was very excited after reading reviews to try this. I am actually only 23 but I found that after having my baby that my skin had turned for the worst. From stress with things and exhaustion, I had very visible forehead wrinkles, puffy and dark eyes, and my pores had got larger. I have only been using this Vitamin C Serum for eleven days and I have seen good results on my forehead. The first day I used this I noticed a little change in my forehead and the color of my dark circles. They both have faded. My forehead now has a little bit worse of fine lines which is great from having kind of deep wrinkles eleven days ago. I have been putting the serum on my entire face including under my eyes. I have noticed the most change on my forehead. My under eyes are not much better yet, but I have been so tired that I am sure that until I get good sleep they can not get much better. I also have a little Milia under my eyes from applying olive oil everyday about a year ago. I stopped the use since it was too much oil for under my eyes. I have noticed that this serum has not made my eye problems worse at least. Since it has only been eleven days and you are supposed to see results around three weeks, I am very excited that I have already had good results. I am hoping that this will eventually help with under my eyes for puffiness and dark circles. I have not noticed much of a change in my pore size. I am hoping that my lines will disappear and I am a little worried that this serum will change since that can happen and I heard that once you stop using treatments like this then your skin will go back to how bad it used to be, does anybody know if this is true? I use organic coconut oil for my moisturizer, they say to follow this serum with a moisturizer. I am sure that this serum is as great as I think it is but the coconut oil may be helping me get better results since it is not only a wonderful oil to use for many reasons, it also helps your skin absorb things. So I wonder if Iam seeing a little quicker results because of the coconut oil, or this serum is really that fantastic. It for sure has to be very good for what it is doing. As long as this serum doesn&#x27;t change for worse and I continue to see results, I will be a loyal customer for this product for life. I also love how they send you email tips on taking care of your skin and the best way to use this Serum. The only problem I have is that the bottle seems very small, I have gone a little overboard with how much I apply at a time and it is now around half way full. It says that only a little is needed, to apply a small amount with fingertips to face, neck, and décolletage areas avoiding direct contact with eyes. I am hoping with using a smaller amount at a time, it helps to make this last a decent amount longer. It will of course be better if they sold it in larger bottles! I will update my review with time and results. I recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> definitely a great buy.  Certainly helps even skin tone and tightens skin soothing wrinkles and sets up for more moisture</li>
            <li> I suffered from cystic acne most of my teen years and as a result, bear the acne scars to prove it.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products hoping that something would improve the texture of my skin.  I am realistic in that without the help of more expensive interventional procedures, I will probably bear these scars the rest of my life.  However, I have to say, this product has improved the overall texture of my skin. My pores do appear smaller and my skin feels softer and smoother.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the results that I&#x27;ve seen in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I&#x27;m hopeful there will be even more improvement as time goes on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have tried many facial skin products over time. I have always had extremely sensitive skin that has rejected a lot of the products I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I am now experiencing the signs of aging on my face, specifically wrinkles, age spots, and rosacea, argggghhh. I used the Day by Day for 2 1/2 months. Although it did not improve my symptoms enough to completely endorse it, it did not irritate my skin and during that time I received amazing customer service, advice and help from the owners of the company. I&#x27;m now going to try their new product Hyaluronic Acid Serum to see if it is of more benefit to me. I&#x27;ll continue to work with this company to try to find solutions because I know they will stand behind their products all the way and with that kind of integrity how can I go wrong? Thank you Day by Day!</li>
            <li> This serum &amp;#34;tightens&amp;#34; my face and feels so good under my moisturizer! I definitely notice a difference and have been told how great my skin looks recently!</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful!  I can feel a difference in my skin especially in the area of my forehead.  A deep frown line that has been with me for years is finally disappearing.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any dramatic results, however, I imagine that you need to use it for more than a month.  I was disappointed that I did not receive the extra bottle as per their offer on Amazon.  I was to receive two bottles for &amp;#34;extended results&amp;#34; and only one arrived.  Other than that, I will continue to use until the bottle is gone and hopefully will see some of the great results that others have experienced.</li>
            <li> I provided 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think that it is still early to fully assess its benefits.  I do note that it is of a much more user friendly consistency than the prior vitamin C product that I purchased, which was like water and dispensed with a dropper.  That method is not a good one as it obviously would increase the rate of oxidization, with having to open the bottle with each use. The customer service with this product is also superior.</li>
            <li> I had been on the market for a high quality serum and came across this one.  It made my skin brighter and smoother after only a few uses… I would most definitely recommend this product. It has a very nice and light clean smelling fragrance.  I have sensitive skin and this serum seems to help any blotchiness or redness that I have experienced in the past. I&#x27;m so glad I found a serum that works!</li>
            <li> I am a young over 50 woman and I am serious about my skin care.  This product is awesome!  I have tried vitamin c skin care products in the past and have been left disappointed.  But after only a few days I see a difference.  My skin is brighter and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum 2x a day -  cleanse skin - pat dry; apply one pump of serum all over face and neck.  Let it absorb and then put on moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen if you want to see results purchase this product and use it daily.  Vitamin C helps you to achieve a smoother, firmer and more youthful skin.</li>
            <li> Initially the word \\&quot;serum\\&quot; weirded me out. My first thought was, this must be some sort of Harry Potter magical stuff. However, after reading more about this product I thought I would give it a shot. I am only 36, but I have as many wrinkles as a 68 year old sailor. Sometimes, I feel like I am Benjamin Button. After only two weeks of use, my skin started to noticeably improve. My skin felt softer, some of my wrinkles had significantly decreased and I began looking less like a old man and more like the sexy cougar I am. I have been using this product for over a month now, and I love it. I had tried a number of other products that just sucked. Make this be the next thing you try and I bet it will be the last.. I don&#x27;t know what in it makes it so effective, but I like to think that it is some Harry Potter magic. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So pleased with day by day beauty&#x27;s spa-version of this old favorite.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is I wish all these serums came in bigger bottles.  Do you offer a larger size bottle as well?</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t give a complete review because I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product for as long as I would have liked to (only about 2 weeks). I can comment on the fact that it has no scent or odor which I really do like because I hate putting anything near my eyes that has a strong smell. I can also comment that although I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic changes in the two weeks I used the product, I did notice some small changes in the lines on my forehead. They haven&#x27;t gone away completely but they have become less noticeable. I have pretty deep lines under my eyes and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in those but I&#x27;m willing to keep testing the product for a longer period of time to see what my long term results are. After that I will complete another review or update this one. I do like the fact that the company offers a satisfaction guarantee and if you are unhappy with your results you can return your product. I received my product free for review purposes (all opinions expressed are those of my own and unbiased!) but this is good information to know if I continue to use this product in the future and need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Lovely serum and beautiful blue bottle!  I like how it feels on my face and it feels nice too. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this too!!I love it!!</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this vitamin c serum.  I tried another brand on amazon because well I wanted to compare it.  The other brand broke me out and I forgot to return it so I was stuck with it.  This brand never cause me any problems but did give me clearer, brighter skin,  I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with fine lines but it did change the clarity of my skin.  It made it brighter, less dull looking.  I will keep using along with my nuface micro current device.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Hyaluronic Acid System for approximately two months.  Added the Vitamin C Serum about a month ago.  Cannot believe how good my skin feels and this is coming from a woman of a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; age!  Even my husband has seen a change!  Wish I had this product many years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I didn&#x27;t see a substantial difference.</li>
            <li> This serum is safe &amp; effective for all skin types, including sensitive skin. Day By Day’s premium formula is plant-based, made without parabens, alcohol, or fillers - this is SO IMPORTANT to me and won&#x27;t buy skincare products that aren&#x27;t free of harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this serum, the overall tone of my skin is more even and brighter, and my pores are smaller. I can wear this all day without feeling greasy by the end of the day. You don’t need much, it goes a long way, and the 1 oz. bottle will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;And this is such a GREAT price - such a steal!</li>
            <li> This dries my skin out even though I apply a moisturizer over it..Of the serums, I much prefer the 100% hyaluronic acid..</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference as of yet. I have been using it since the end of October and it is 12-10-14, I will review again in another month.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Everything it said it would do. Saw results in a matter of days. Well Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My Thoughts on This Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only is the blue glass pretty-I&#x27;ve said it in previous posts, I love blue glass-but it also helps minimize exposure to the light (in case you have your bottle in a brightly-lit room). That&#x27;s a great idea. I also love the pump top. Not only does it make it easier to use, but it also minimizes contact with bacteria. Another plus since I don&#x27;t want to expose the serum or my skin to extra bacteria. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;Scented? No. Natural, organic ingredients? Yes, love that.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from pretty packaging, how about the consistency? Well, what I noticed about this particular serum is that it is very watery. I have to really cup my hand when I pump it out because it will drip right off if I&#x27;m not careful. Not sure I like that too much.&lt;br /&gt;However, on my actual face, it does work well. My skin does absorb it fine, it causes no irritation whatsoever. My skin does look clearer, brighter, and I do have smaller pores. Very good product as far as it&#x27;s results, I just which it wasn&#x27;t as watery. Maybe if there was a bit more hyaluronic acid added in so the formula is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest review. However, all opinions expressed are solely my own and in no way influenced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a heavy makeup wearer. I will put some on if there is a special occasion, but for daily use, I just never have. So when these little &#x27;laugh&#x27; lines came I could see them pretty darn clearly. (Darn I&#x27;m getting old!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I tried Day by Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum, I noticed a huge difference.  I wash my face as I normally would, I tone, then put the vitamin C serum on. I noticed first off that it wasn&#x27;t sticky or tacky at all. I was kinda worried about that, as I don&#x27;t like heavy type products on my face.</li>
            <li> This serum worked great and my skin soaked it up fast.  I plan to buy more than one bottle the next time.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I would recommend this. I do wish it came in a larger volume but otherwise I liked how my skin looks and feels after using for about a week</li>
            <li> Day by Day serum so far, after a month and a half of use, has helped to heal and fade damage by the sun that has occured to my facial skin. It has also helped to reduce the crater sized pores on my face and given an overall healthy younger look. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very excellent vitamin C serum.  It&#x27;s very effective especially with regular use.  The pump mechanism very likely helps to preserve the quality (better than the dropper bottles for example) of the liquid over time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my skin is evening out both color (spots) and feel.  I have bad acne scars and using both a scrub wash and this, my skin is better than ever thought possible.  Would highly recommend to anyone, my dad even uses it now for age spots on his bald head.  The only issue I have is with the pump, I use a dropper tip in mine.  The pump sticks a little, but not an issue as far as knocking it down a star.  Great price, going to order more for sure.  A side note, I have been using daily for a month, still have half a bottle.  I also use on the top of my hands and neck....  Tried it on scars and see an improvement there also.....</li>
            <li> I went through a bottle of the 800+ positive review &#x27;Oz Naturals&#x27; vitamin C serum before purchasing this brand, only to find out they are exactly the same product. Link to the Oz serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Serum-Contains-Complex-Hyaluronic/dp/B00GZ0WFQG/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1H3Z5S1N959NMD11CDMN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients match word for word, the marketing on the bottle is very similar and even the excellent customer service emails detailing how to use the product are the same. The only difference is the name and color of the bottle. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on here but I will say that somehow this product seems to work slightly better than the Oz one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it the blue bottle that makes this better? I know vitamin C oxidizes quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a good shelf life, so perhaps I got an old batch of the Oz stuff and it wasn&#x27;t as effective. Who knows, I did see some positive results when I first started using Oz but my skin has become even clearer, brighter, and more awesome in the month I&#x27;ve been using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 28 year old male and don&#x27;t have an explanation for why I&#x27;ve gotten sucked into this vortex of beauty potions, but I can say you&#x27;ll notice a discernible difference in the brightness of your skin when you use these serums. This one in particular is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> This serum is packed with antioxidants leaving your skin glowing, hydrated and nourished. It helped reduce fine lines on my face. It is organic and is gentle enough to be used on my sensitive skin! I am happy to recieve this item to review! I really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I would love to take a bath, daily, in this serum! I recently started using a new foundation and noticed that I&#x27;ve got age lines and wrinkles that I&#x27;d not noticed before. My skin after even just a couple days seems more supple - It&#x27;s got more life to it! I&#x27;m going on a trip to Vegas in a couple weeks &amp; I know I&#x27;ll have lots of pictures taken.  I&#x27;m excited to have my younger look along with me!</li>
            <li> No instructions on how to use...weird!</li>
            <li> My first time ever buying a Vitamin C Serum. As a matter of fact, I didn&#x27;t realize there were external uses for Vitamin C before and I consider myself to be savvy when it comes to health and nutrition. I thought, why not try it to help lighten up my age spots that have just started appearing on my 60 year old face. My goodness was I surprised at the wonderful feel of this product on my skin with my very first application of this product. My initial thought was that even if it didn&#x27;t help with those dark spots, the way that it made my skin feel was already worth the price. Not oily, and leaving no unpleasant residue, it is heavenly! The lightening of my spots will take some time. I accept that, after all, the spots have taken time to show themselves, but I have no doubts that this product will produce results. I base that on my initial impressions of this serum and also on the reviews that I read before purchasing this particular product.</li>
            <li> Starting to work after only a few days.  I am really going to enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my face</li>
            <li> No change after the entire bottle was used.</li>
            <li> This Serium is awesome!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!! Saw results within a few days of use. On par with higher priced products I&#x27;ve used in the past, such as Obagi and La Roche Posay. I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past 3 months and notice a big difference in the wrinkles in my forehead. The consistency is very thin and like liquid so i can see that may turn people off, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I recommend as an added step in your skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product has a very pleasant scent and goes on very well no mess no burning feels like the skin firms up feeling an instant lift to the skin, i like it alot this is a great way to take care of your skin.. I was able to test this product for a very small amount...</li>
            <li> Great product easy to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Vit C Serums for its obvious anti-aging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Every bit of the research I&#x27;ve done says you really out to be using a Vitamin C Serum daily, but it always made me peel a lot. My cheecks got red, irritated, pores looked larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I finally found one that does do that! The Best Vitamin C serum seems to agree with my skin, and its pretty odorless, clear liquid that spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Just in my first week so will report progress later.  The serum absorbs into skin quickly and feels good all day. I use a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;and apply my foundation, I think that my skin looks tighter after this short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum every day for several weeks, and my skin has not looked so good in a very long time!  I had wrinkles around the corners of my eyes, and they&#x27;ve pretty much disappeared!  My procedure is to wash my face and then apply a small amount of the serum (predetermined amount by dispenser - the only thing minor thing I don&#x27;t care for about this product.).  Almost by the time I&#x27;m done putting it on, the serum has soaked in, and then I moisturize.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of skin products before - and am continually on the look out for new things - but when this actually showed results I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it!  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I&#x27;m going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> It works real well...I&#x27;m about half way thru my first bottle and there is a difference already...Your pump thingy doesn&#x27;t work very well though....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara...</li>
            <li> Great product! A great buy for the value! Leaves skin feeling silky smooth. I did not care for the smell of the product but it does hydrate my skin leaving it looking fresh and revitalized. Will purchase again. I  do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin, but it does go on well and it does feel good.  I think that I am getting some topical vitamin C and when I combine it with other products my skin really soaks it up.</li>
            <li> works. Don&#x27;t know the science, don&#x27;t care. Does make you have better skin - suggestions for use, use it twice a day at first (doesn&#x27;t take much to use, as it says on the label, follow up after its absorbed maybe 5 minutes, longer if you just got out of the shower with a good moisturizer) for the first week, once a day for the next week, then twice a week following. It works. And for those saying its expensive - whats cheaper, an $9 bottle of crap that does nothing, or a $19 bottle that works, and exceeds expectations? Try it out at least, its worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Noticeable results effectively instantly - well in 30 minutes or so. Instaglow, as I called it. I have always had decent skin but getting older, lets try some of these things. This is one one that works, I had no idea it would be that dramatic, and that quick acting, so yay science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a short time but so far I like how well it feels on my skin. I am beginning to see some of my &#x27;crows feet&#x27; disappearing!</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C. I have not used it before and it is better than I expected. I am using it with phytoceramides and I can see a difference...I&#x27;m almost 70 yrs. young and have finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it, but need more time to see if it makes a long term difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Bottom line, it really works!</li>
            <li> The spray that comes with the product sprays in all directions making you waste a considerable amount of product. I tried spraying on face and then on palms but neither works well. Better to put a dropper I think.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work very well even though I was not very consistent. Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is always my product of choice when it comes to skin care. When my daughter asked me what she should use to improve her skin, off course, my answer was Vitamin C serum. I received this Vitamin C serum from Day by Day Beauty to test and since I was using another Vitamin C, I gave her this one to try and see how it performs. Here is her results in her own words, “This makes my skin feel so refreshed and smooth, is not greasy and it absorbs well. I also noticed it gives a nice glow and radiance whereas moisturizing cream alone can leave my skin a bit dull”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is full of good for skin ingredients and they are going to give even better results in long run.</li>
            <li> This is the Best Vitamin C Serum for your face! My skin is tighter &amp; looks more youthful &amp; has a glow that wasn&#x27;t there before I started using this! The texture of my skin is improved &amp; the lines around my eyes have softened. I have even been asked if I had something done!! That is the best compliment ever :-)</li>
            <li> Love this.  Plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have tried other serums (3 others) and I have to say this one by far is the best out of all of them.  The true test was when I was in the store and was thinking about buying another vitamin C serum and could not bring myself to do it.  Why?  Because I have gotten great results with Day by Day and just couldn&#x27;t bear to give up something that works.  These are the highlights and benefits I received:    1.  The customer service is unmatched! I tested this theory because the company said, \\&quot;we are real people and we care\\&quot;.  I remembered thinking, \\&quot;yeah right!\\&quot;  But it&#x27;s true.  I responded to an email I received asking how I liked the product, and I got a live human to respond to me within 30 minutes of receiving my email.  That has never happened to me before with any product!  A human?  WOW!    2.  From the first time that I used the product (Product junkie Skeptic!)  I could visibly see subtle results and it (my skin results) just kept getting better. Unbelievable.  My skin appeared and still appears brighter than before and when I use the product my skin does not  feel tight or like the product was \\&quot;sitting on my face\\&quot;.    3.  I used it on other parts of my body that needed treatment for acne. OMG!  The acne cyst started shrinking. TRUE STORY!    Overall, the product feeds the vitamin C INTO your skin and your skin responds.  It plumps up the areas where fine lines are(were..HA!) and I have noticed that underneath my eyes it looks much, much more smoother.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy two bottles when I ordered the one I&#x27;m using!!  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and it made my face feel awesome. I didn&#x27;t particularly like the pump applicator. The applicator looked like it would squeeze a little dollop of product onto my finger. Instead, it was somewhere between a spray and a squeeze thing. I ended up getting the serum on my shirt or in the sink or anywhere else except where I wanted it. If they could fix the applicator, I would love this to bits.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Fast absorbing&lt;br /&gt;Lasted more than half a year&lt;br /&gt;Easy to pump out product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like it really made a significant difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of sticky after it dries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not repurchase in the future. It was nice trying it out.</li>
            <li> I think I like this stuff, I am on my second bottle, and believe I am seeing the positive changes. My skin tone is starting to look more even and I really see a difference around the eyes. It is so gentle on my delicate skin under the eyes, too.</li>
            <li> I love how it dry quick &amp; tighten the skin. After after put it on I put a moisturizer on top. My face looks amazing. My skin looks evenly town and more smooth. Making me look younger.</li>
            <li> about to order my 3rd bottle. xoxo</li>
            <li> Used twice- burn and itched so bad- had to hurry and re- wash my face! My face felt so tight I couldn&#x27;t even barely move it. I had been using Skin Cenceutials  (sp)- I thought I&#x27;d try something cheaper and these reviews were so positive. I will stick w what I had been using!!! I think u get what u pay for</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve always had large pores, I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and this one by far exceeds any of them as far as reducing the size and appearance of pores.  I&#x27;m 54 so as far as wrinkles go...no product will eliminate them, but I do think the deep lines are a little less deep and the fine lines are a little less noticeable. I feel like my face has a new glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite proud of myself for making this purchase. I&#x27;d been thinking of what I could do to put &amp;#34;my best face forward&amp;#34; at this juncture in my life and this product really spoke to me. I like the idea of doing something each day that makes me feel really good, and takes good care of my skin and appearance. I like the results I&#x27;m getting and it feels wonderful to use it... soothing and luxurious! It may seem simple and that&#x27;s part of its charm and attraction to me. I purchased another as a Christmas gift for my sister and will recommend it to my friends. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C cream for along time but recently found the Day By Day product and have really noticed that its use has stepped up the results tremendously.  I am combining it with the hylauronic acid and get even better results.  I use it daily in the morning and/or night or both!  I am very pleased with the product as well as the hands on care from Day By Day.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a facebook special for 5 dollars!  I was shocked at how great it worked and I was getting alot of compliments.  I ran out and now I&#x27;m thinking of ordering!</li>
            <li> After trying several varieties, I found this Vitamin C Serum by Day by Day and really like it. Right after using I can feel a gentle tightness to my skin which I love. Only problem is I shared with my roommate and got her hooked too! It&#x27;s working great for both of us, even on my sensitive skin which doesn&#x27;t always respond well to new products. I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a try! My skin is noticeably smoother already.</li>
            <li> Have wanted to try this product, especially when the signs of aging have started to be more noticeable.  Looking forward to repairing my skin with this Vitamin C Serum, and feel good that I&#x27;m taking care of myself this way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just two weeks and I&#x27;m starting to not only feel a difference but I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in my skin.  It&#x27;s light and silky texture works great under my moisturizer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I only started using this one week ago. It absorbs really quickly and has that hydrating feeling as opposed to &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; like I get from my moisturizer. I cleanse, tone, use this stuff and than moisturize. The other day my friend told me my face was glowing, so I wonder if its because I have been using this stuff. I hope so..</li>
            <li> Received fast , got for a friend she says it is very much like using water and oil but hopes it works</li>
            <li> AHHHMAZING!  I&#x27;m so glad for all the other&#x27;s that reviewed this product. It made it easier to make my decision for this product among all the other serums out there.  Not to mention the excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> i din&#x27;t see any difference on my face.</li>
            <li> Day by Day Beauty was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Vitamin C Serum to review. A lot of vitamin serums tend to be really tacky. This one is a little tacky but not as bad as most of them. It also absorbs quickly. I have only been using it for a couple weeks but I can tell that some of my acne scars are starting to fade. My skin is looking amazing, smooth, soft, radiant.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd brand of Vitamin C Serum I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the consistency of this product. Of the three serums I have tried this one is my favorite as far as consistency - not too runny, not too gel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is odorless and absorbs into my skin quickly. It does not feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash my hands after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always looked younger than I actually am but when I hit 40 I started to show my true age. I have been using this product and then applying an anti-wrinkle moisturizing cream and I have noticed a difference in my skin. What is making the biggest difference I couldn&#x27;t tell you but I do know that this is a routine I will continue because something I am doing is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> Good vitamins for skin</li>
            <li> Well,  I&#x27;ve got to say that I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!  Yes, I still look like a woman in her late 40&#x27;s ( no miracle there!)....but my skin is looking fresher and smoother, lines slightly reduced.  I think overall the product has taken away the sort of sallow, tired appearance that my skin had previously.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating a wonderful and affordable product!  Wish it were available on Amazons subscribe and save items list!!!</li>
            <li> great value - will buy again!</li>
            <li> I first started using the Day By Day Serum a little over a month ago and the first thing that I noticed was the pleasant light smell. I am trying to use more products that are not just lightly scented but as NATURAL as possible and this serum definitely does the job. I used it every morning and evening after I washed my face. It goes on your skin nice and smooth and it dries quickly without that heavy sticky feeling.I have noticed that my face appears a little smoother and just brighter. I like how it keeps my face hydrated ALL day long. Not many facial serums are able to do that for me. Overall the Day By Day Vitamin C Serum is a great product if you are looking for something natural to keep your skin hydrated and looking the best that it can be.</li>
            <li> This is now the second product from Day by Day I have had the privilege to use.  I first used their Hyaluronic Acid Serum which they recommend being used with this Vitamin C Serum.  I used the Vitamin C serum alone at first since I have sensitive skin and eye area.  I had no adverse reactions and my face and neck loved the feeling from the very first use.  My acne was instantly cleared up and my pores began to diminish immediately.  I can already see improvement in a small line on my forehead area and the tiny lines I had around my eyes are now gone.  When I added the other product by Day by Day Beauty their Hyaluronic Acid Serum my results skyrocketed.  I could not believe such inexpensive products could show these types of results so quickly.  I truly recommend this product and company to anyone looking to give their skin the needed attention that my poor sun soaked skin needed.  The shipping is really fast and the packaging is awesome.  I&#x27;ve used other products that come with a vial dispenser or a cheapy pump dispenser.  You won&#x27;t get that with this product the pump dispenser is perfect.  It makes it easy to apply with no waste.  I had incredible results using the Vitamin C serum alone and with other products.  I am one satisfied customer!  The greatest part of using this product and made it the icing on the cake was the great compliments I received from my friends.  The loved the look of my face and the fact that I didn&#x27;t look greasy or oily.  My husband gave my the sweetest compliments too and told me my skin looked healthier and I was glowing!  Yes, I use these products for myself but to hear things from others is really validating.</li>
            <li> I have been using a vitamin C serum for over 10 years and decided to try this product to compare. My old serum was 2-3x as much and this product delivered as well and even better. My skin has stayed smooth and hydrated this winter. I also feel like it has helped with my fine lines. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is great! Has made my skin more smooth and firm, it has a nice glow to it! Thank you I&#x27;ll be ordering more.. Just wish the bottle was a bit bigger running out already :( thats the only reason I give it 4 starts vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs old &amp; have been trying to use a Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;for years. Everything had to be returned because the product&lt;br /&gt;was just too much for my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;But, now I have Day By Day Vitamin C Serum &amp; my&lt;br /&gt;old face LOVES it! My skin is getting clearer&lt;br /&gt;&amp; more textured.</li>

            <li> Am I missing something here?&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a month now.&lt;br /&gt;I do not see any difference...</li>
            <li> Great product! I didn&#x27;t even need moisturizer afterwards! I have very sensitive skin and never broke out from this. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> I have gone between extremely oily skin to extremely dry skin, especially as the weather changes. I was so frustrated with my skin and the back and forth since my pregnancies. I was looking and searching for something, anything that would shrink my pores and even out my skin without the chemicals. When I got the chance to review Day by Day Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, I was pretty open to trying it, if it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I received it, I washed my face and tried it immediately and it burned a little so I was hesitant to use it again. But I realized that you need to add a moisturizer after using it. So the following day, I repeated the process but added the moisturizer after. It was much better though it still burned slightly, barely noticeable. I waited for a reaction but it never came so I continued to use it. After about a week of using it, my pores were visibly shrinking, my skin was tighter (firmer) and just looked overall healthier. Yes, I said a week! After almost 30 days, my skin looks and feels much healthier and I will make this a regular part of my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> Am happy to post this review after around a month of regular use. This product is GOOD. I am a competitive swimmer (55-59 years group) and five days a week I swim an hour in chlorinated water. I use this serum once a day in the morning before going to work with a touch of organic macadamia oil as moisturizer. I have gotten many compliments for my skin. I notice the difference. Customer service is also good.</li>
            <li> I used this product 1-2 times daily and applied facial moisturizer after. Didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference after 90 days.</li>
            <li> The serum works wonders on my skin and I&#x27;m pretty happy with results. recommend!</li>
            <li> My review: I was thrilled to get to review another product by Day by Day Beauty. They have really good products and I have been so pleased with them. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now.  I have noticed it has brightened my skin tone for sure. It has shrank my pores and seems to be diminishing my lines and wrinkles. Very pleased with product and experience overall. Good job Day by Day Beauty!!!!</li>
            <li> Good but nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> All I got after using the product for good two weeks is a bad breakout.  Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I actually heard about this through a friend, and I was pleasantly surprised.  One thing I was surprised about is that it didn&#x27;t have any citrus fragrance to it - don&#x27;t know why but I was expecting that.  Vitamin C, right? :) But otherwise it was very good.  I have really sensitive skin so it&#x27;s always a plus to have a product I can use without it causing irritation.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I never thought about the day I&#x27;d need facial cream. However - they day has arrived and this product is all it claims to be. If considering buying this product, here are things to consider;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- makes my skin feel hydrated&lt;br /&gt;- only requires a small amount to use so can last a long time&lt;br /&gt;- can be used to deal with unwanted blemishes&lt;br /&gt;- Really helps with facial wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I only wish the bottle was a bit bigger but still delivers on the promise</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Day By Day Beauty Vitamin C serum!&lt;br /&gt;I live in Florida, where it&#x27;s hot and humid, so you really tend to feel &#x27;heavy&#x27; or greasy products on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product is absolutely perfect in this regard!  It&#x27;s very light and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, the light-feeling serums don&#x27;t really seem to make a difference. But this one made a noticeable difference. It left my skin smoother, firmer and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It absorbs into your skin very quickly too, so you don&#x27;t need to wait for a year and a day before you apply your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I would recommend it. I plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have heard about Vitamin C Serums before and how good they can be for the skin, but I never had much luck until I found this product. This Vitamin C serum is different from anything I have ever tried before. It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful. After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible. The best part about it is that I have told a few of my friends and even my mom about this product and now they are in love with it to! It really works just as good as you would hope it would. If you have fine lines or discoloration, this product is your saving grace. You will never know how you ever lived without it. I take this serum everywhere I go, even if I am going for a weekend trip, this serum is going with me. This product is truly amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for more gorgeous looking skin.</li>
            <li> Some serums were sort of more sticky, one actually burned a bit - but this one is just right! Gorgeous glass bottle too.  I am hiding it from my roommate because she loved this vitamin c serum a lot too.  Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> After trying this Vitamin C Serum, I have noticed a BIG difference in my skin. After only 2 uses, I saw a major changed in the way that my skin looked and felt. I am very white and this Serum has brought more color back in to my face. It also makes my skin smoother than I have ever seen it while eliminating the amount of oil that is produced on my face. I have very oily skin and after using this product, I have seen that my face does not get as oily as fast as it did when I was not using the Vitamin C Serum. Not to mention, with smoother and healthier skin, my makeup looks ten times better! I have already gotten compliments on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;As well as being majorly impressed with the Vitamin C Serum, I was also impressed with how quickly the product was delivered to my door after I ordered it. It showed up at my doorstep the day after I had placed my order! I have never had such quick delivery and such an amazing product. You better believe I will be using this Vitamin C Serum for the rest of my days!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!!!! It is effective and has worked wonders on my skin. I use it in conjuction with my derma roller. I will be purchasing this product again!!! I am in my early sixties. It has pushed my skin to another level!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used better Vitamin C products. I really don&#x27;t believe there is a very high amount of Vitamin C in this product.</li>
            <li> I love it ! My skin tone is more even and hydrated, i will buy again for me and my mother</li>
            <li> i love this product - it&#x27;s lightweight and feels wonderful on my skin.  i&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks but will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample, and was happy to try it, as in my opinion, a serum is THE most important part of skin care. No matter what you apply after, the serum is the &#x27;boost&#x27; to your moisturizer or sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is slightly different from most serums in that it has very little &#x27;slip&#x27;. It quickly absorbs into the skin, as opposed to serums that are massaged in. After a few moments, your face feels refreshed and toned. Now you&#x27;re ready for your usual day or night products.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe and witch hazel calm and soothe troubled skin, and it also contains MSM, which I use in a lot of my home preparations to condition and nourish skin and hair. It acts as an anti-inflammatory, so if morning puffiness is an issue, you&#x27;ll love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an overnight miracle. Think of it as a vitamin tonic for skin. While you won&#x27;t see a significant difference in a day or two, it really does improve skin texture. And remember, if the cream you apply AFTER using this isn&#x27;t that great, you may not see the results you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, a little goes a long way. I use an eyedropper to dispense it, and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C skin serum from Day by Day Beauty is clear and very slightly viscous, with a clean scent, primarily of witch hazel.  It is bottled in beautiful cobalt blue apothecary glass to protect it from the light, with a pump cap for easy application.  It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas.  It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mostly botanical formula is 72% organic and contains vitamins C &amp; E, as well as vegetarian hyaluronic acid. Other ingredients include aloe, jojoba oil, and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review sample was provided for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I started using the serum about three weeks ago. I have combination/sensitive skin as well as allergies, so I have to be careful about products I use on my face. I am pleased to say I had no allergic reaction to this product which, for me, is very important, I use the serum once at night after cleansing and toning my face. Since using this serum, I&#x27;ve noticed an overall brightness to my skin and a more overall even skin tone. My skin looks and feels hydrated and has a very healthy glow. Even my husband noticed a difference, and that is saying a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum itself, it has a very light, almost water like consistency. Most of the serums I have used in the past are usually a little thicker. However, it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It comes with a pump which I very much prefer, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling any. No accidents! One to two pumps is enough to cover my face and neck area and it absorbs into my skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used some very pricey serums that don&#x27;t live up to the promises, overall, I like this serum and works for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin.  I  I believe I will be s repeat customer.  I feel like I am seeing results already.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars because I really like the vegan concept and it smells quite nice. However, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all. :(</li>
            <li> Under eye puffiness, GONE! in only like 3 days. I use this for my whole face but I really wanted for a younger appearance around the eyes, and that is exactly what I got!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 3 pumps every night to make sure I get a good amount to do the job right, It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m running out, so of course I HAD to buy more. It is so worth it guys!</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a great Vitamin C serum to aid my skin. I ran across this one and I am extremely happy with it thus far. the bottle is large for the price and it lists all of the great ingredients in the serum. It also comes with a pump, making it easy to disperse from the bottle. Just one pump is typically good enough for me, and I rub it in my skin every morning after my shower and every night before bed. This serum has helped my skin become more soft and some of my hyperpigmentation is lightening. I plan to continue to use vitamin C serums as a part of my regular face routine for life, and this serum was an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Since using this product as directed, I can feel a real difference in the moisture in my skin.  After cleansing my face at night, I apply this serum.  Once it dries I apply Lumene Vitamin C+ Dry Skin Comfort Radiance Cocktail.  This is working out great.  No breakouts and I love the way my skin feels and looks.  It seems to help diminish the fine lines I was getting.  Thank you Day By Day!</li>
            <li> I never ever have any issues with breaking out but this stuff is not good at all for my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. In only a few days worth of use I can already tell a difference. My skin feels softer and looks healthier. My skin also appears brighter and I feel like I look more alive. While I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I want to hold them off as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the formula itself, it has no smell (which is great!) and it is non sticky. I use it as directed, on a clean, dry face. I don&#x27;t put any moisturizer on until after this had dried completely. The pump applicator is also a great way to use it, versus a jar where you put your finger in it to get some out - with those I always seem to grab too much product. This is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that swear they reduce wrinkles, so I took my time and researched what the Dermatalogists were reccomending and chose Day by Day. IT WORKS! IT REALLY WORKS! I was a skeptic as I am a RN and have been ill for over 23 yrs. I am only 52, but with being ill it has really effected my skin. This product is fabulous! I have lines between my eyebrows from furrowing my brow. I have a pain problem and I have developed a habit of furrowing my brow. It has erased the wrinkles! I could not believe it. I also have slight crows feet, and laugh lines. Those are now gone and my skin has a glow that it did not have before. It was ruddy looking. I have actually had people ask me what I have done. I look at least 5-7 yrs younger and people actually touch my face and tell me what a beautiful completion I have! I wear mineral make up and mostly for spf protection. I will continue to use as long as they continue to make it! I feel so much better without a ruddy older looking completion. Thank you! Day by Day!</li>
            <li> works fast and I love this product</li>
            <li> worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been concerned about the fine lines on my face since I hit 30 a few years ago. I know the benefits of vitamin c, but wanted a really top quality serum without breaking the bank!  So far, this one really delivers.  I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet are even less noticeable, only in a couple uses.  I&#x27;m looking forward to more progress, and am definitely making this part of my routine. l&#x27;m recommending to my friends!</li>
            <li> The serum not only takes away lines but also works over redness AND acne .</li>
            <li> I got and from this product. I stopped using after a week.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing vitamin c serum. I love that it comes with a spray pump. It&#x27;s actually quite a lot of product since you should be only using a small drop. Keeps your skin so soft and leaves your face flowing. You can see a difference overnight in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum! I have very dry skin and acne and since using this product my skin feels so soft! I can definitely tell the difference! It is super easy to use and works like a charm. Definitely worth the low price.</li>
            <li> Feels nice when I apply to my face. Gives you a tightening affect.  I like that its  Organic Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I apply my regular cream with it. Not a bad scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. Classy bottle, pump applicator makes it easy to use. My wife says she likes it better than other serums she&#x27;s tried. The seller has videos on YouTube that walk through the ingredients and I like that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive vitamin C serum in the past and it made me break out BUT this product is wonderful. It doesnt make me break out and I have started seeing difference just in 3 days! Also, price is way better than what I used to pay in the past! The bottle comes with the pump which is also very helpful to dispense just the right amount! Overall, must have product!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moG8HWB5TEU8RO]]I am a bit of a cosmetics junkie and have tried many brands of vitamin c serum and this is by far the most complete serum i ve tried. It gives my skin a healthy glow, it doesnt leave it with a greasy feel to it, my pores seem smaller and my skin even feels tighter. A must during winter months! I will recommend this product to whoever asks me for my opinion on serums!</li>
            <li> We know that, to date, there is no fountain of youth. And while I do not want to look 20 again, I am not thrilled about how my skin is getting thinner and so &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;. I have read that Vitamins E and C can really help. So, I took a chance on this serum.&lt;br /&gt;JACKPOT! Wow. The first moment I used this, I noticed my skin tighten up a bit. The effect was very small, but it made an overall difference. By the third day, I noticed my skin looked a bit more full, plumper and my skin was more smooth. This product comes with a small pump, and you do not need  much. In my case, I used it mostly on my neck, and on the &amp;#34;parentheses&amp;#34; around my mouth. These were the areas I wanted to target. I have to say that  this Vitamin C Serum has reduced some of the obvious signs of older skin. What is really great about this serum is that is does not interrupt your usual regimen. Just add it after cleaning, but before moisturizing. A have been gently exfoliating first, then using it (even though I know you are not supposed to exfoliate every day).&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance, and it is not greasy and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have a light vitamin C serum to counteract the harshness of where I live for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! I put it on at night before bed and wake up with silky smooth skin. Not to mention the scent is great and even calming. It is not overpowering, but has a nice light and airy fragrance that almost reminds me of being on the beach. Great product that everyone should try!</li>
            <li> My wife started using this a couple of weeks ago and she loves it.  She says it softens her skin like nothing else she&#x27;s seen!</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth, left my skin soft. Reason for only 4 stars, it was very watery, thinner than the usual serum.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this product to test.  It&#x27;s a relatively new product by a new company so when I went online to see how other consumers were feeling about it, I was troubled by the fact that there were so many reviews already, and most of them 5 stars.  Smelled fishy to me that so many reviews (214 as I write this) have appeared since November 2013.  Obviously some big time marketing has been going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, skeptical about the serum but committed to trying it, I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a month now and have to say that it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a small bottle (1 oz.), very dark blue to protect the contents from light, with a pump dispenser.  The product is described as a serum but it is less viscous and more watery than most serums I&#x27;ve used, so care is needed when pumping it onto the finger.  It can drip easily.  But that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with its effectiveness or absorbability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into the skin quickly and then I apply my usual moisturizer.  (Just using the serum isn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin hydrated.) I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day, often twice, for more than a month and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.  It seems to smooth the skin and tighten pores with an effect similar to that of [[ASIN:B00GUTLC0C #1 Luxury Hyaluronic Acid Serum - 100% Pure, Undiluted &amp; No Fillers - Ultimate Skin Rejuvenator &amp; Moisturizer HA Serum - Best Anti Wrinkle Serum with Vitamin C - Nutrient-Rich Organic Herbs For BETTER Results - Enhances Collagen Growth - Best Hyaluronic...]], another product I&#x27;ve tested recently. However, this Day by Day serum has a slight edge over that other one because it contains fewer and less objectionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small but lasts a good while.  As I said, I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and believe that I have half left.  (Hard to tell because the bottle is not transparent.)  That means I probably have another month of use.  After it&#x27;s gone I may be inclined to purchase the product again.  However, just plain old hyaluronic acid serum of the 3-ingredient variety (HA, water and a preservative) also works well for me and is less expensive.I may be inclined to purchase the product again.

            <li> My sister was asked to review this on her blog Preppy Empty Nester.  She applied it every day to one hand and her face for six weeks.  She said that she could see a remarkable difference and reviewed it on her blog.  I had to give it a try, although I have never been one to experience much of a difference between one cream or serum from another. In less than two weeks, I was amazed at the difference in my skin.  I have some discoloration from acne scars on my 52 year-old skin, and am still battling breakouts along with wrinkles (lucky me).  Since using the serum, the discoloration has faded and I have had no breakouts!  I also think my pores are smaller, and overall my skin looks better. I also appreciate that it is affordable.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Day By Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum for two weeks - morning and evening. I cleanse (wash) my face first and then apply the serum followed by my moisturizer.  Using the serum completely by itself tends to have a slightly sticky feel, but the moisturizer takes care of that. I don&#x27;t believe the serum is intended to be the sole product for skin care. The company indicates users should follow its use with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is intended for skin evenness and dark spots, I have also been lavishing it on my the tops of my forearms just to give it further trial.  I followed this with my body lotion of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just what do I think of this product? First of all, I have not seen any outstanding, noticeable results in the brief two week span. But neither have I seen any deleterious effects, either. When using the Day By Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum followed by my moisturizer, I do see a smoothness to my skin, a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that is not present with moisturizer alone.  I see this as a favorable result. I like the pump bottle, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that with continued use, the serum will prove beneficial. It does, of course, have to be taken into consideration that we take care of our skin but we do not expect to end up with the beautiful smooth and soft skin of a baby. We must consider our age and the abuse that we have subjected our skin to through the years. We must consider that we are what we eat as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I am delighted to be a part of reviewing this product and others of a similar nature because I truly hope that when I encourage men and women to care for their skin they will take heed and seek out effective products to do just that very thing. As I have said many times, &amp;#34;Cream your face!&amp;#34; That means use whatever products you have at hand and can afford to moisturize and care for your face. Skin treatment with a serum such as Day By Day Beauty Vitamin C Serum perhaps is one of choice that my readers will find beneficial to the care and upkeep of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a product in order to evaluate and write a review.ders will find beneficial to the care and upkeep of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I received a product in order to evaluate and write a review.</li>
            <li> This is a must have I felt/seen the difference on my skin the first day I used it I will definitely be ordering this product all the time...... I Love IT.....!!!!!😘</li>
            <li> I have dry skin - I was the girl who almost never had pimples...but even then I could look ahead - at my sweet gram - and see the wrinkles that go with this &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; complexion, lol.  I&#x27;m in my late 50s and  have faithfully used moisturizer everyday for decades- usually Oil of Olay or similar.  In dry seasons, I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;night cream&amp;#34; during the day.  Lately, as age beckons, I can see the wrinkles creeping in, regardless of my regular creams, and decided to try this.  Has the result been dramatic?  Honestly, no.  But in the not-always-friendly glare of my bathroom lights, I do think that my skin looks a little more like it did a year or two ago.  So I guess it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I was a bit perplexed to the fact facial skin was just not what it used to be. Age, time, and weather had started taking it&#x27;s toll and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do about it. THEN I found this Vitamin C Serum. I am a huge advocate of the healing powers of Vitamin C and I knew this was just the ticket for me. This product has proven to be excellent for reducing wrinkles -(those little annoying ones around the corners of my mouth and eyes!) and it did so shorter time than one might think. I also love that it has a gentle aloe scent (I can&#x27;t handle stinky perfume smells. This product smells lovely) and that it includes vitamin E as well. I&#x27;ve known for quite some time that Vitamin E is another amazing healing agent so the two together have been like the dream combo for my skin. I am super happy with this product and highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth. Absorbs well..</li>
            <li> Loved this vitamin c serum! Not to mention it smells superb! I have only used it for two days will have to post again on how effective I find it! So far I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Day by Day Beauty products and I am always happy with the quality of their products and most important the performance of them!  This Vitamin C Serum has done a great job at making my fine lines less noticeable and I can already see a few of my Melasma spots starting to fade a little I have and I have only been using it for a little over a week.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> Great serum! it goes on very easily and it is not sticky and then I apply the lotion after.  The serum is not thick and the consistency is thin and I am still waiting to see the effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has been serious about my skin for several years. A professed beauty product addict, I have tried many MANY creams, lotions, oils, repair, anti-aging, complexes, serums etc from the drug store brand to the $100/oz bottles. I also think it&#x27;s important to tell, I truly give each product plenty of time to show some results and I&#x27;m religious with my daily routine. That said, I have felt my skin had reached its peak a couple of years ago, began to think my skin had become immune. THIS product has shown results. I am not a scientist so I&#x27;m not sure what had changed, but my skin looks better! Younger looking for sure and I saw these results within the first few days. I&#x27;m in retail and I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my skin in the last three weeks than in the past three years! Even my 23y/o daughter just told me my skin looks so good!! For the price, I would be foolish to change. Oh how I love the idea of a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product. I also love that they are a small business, not a huge conglomerate. No more research and trials for me. I&#x27;m hooked. I hope this review helps all ladies like me. Thank you Day By Day, please make more products soon</li>
            <li>  I give it 5 stars so far. I&#x27;ve been using this product for an day and actually started seeing results in 24 hours, my skin feel so soft and lovely</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C is decent!</li>
            <li> A great product for the price. Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Vitamin C serum, it makes my face smooth and feels fresh on my skin.  This is by the best Vitamin C serum that I have tried so far. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of a few wrinkles, and help regain their youth.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. .I have had it a week and already see great results.  I also put it on the back of one hand and do nothing to the other... the results are dramatic.  I am 51 and have tried many product lines. .. costing 10x what this does and they don&#x27;t work nearly as well. ..I recommend this for anyone who wants a working product</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because you cannot go any higher.  I have been using this product for 4 weeks and actually started seeing results in 2 weeks.  The overall tone of my skin is even and brighter, my pores are smaller and almost gone.  I can wear this all day with no greasy feeling by the end of the day.  You also do not need much, it goes a long way.  I have another bottle left (I bought 2 the first time and I just ordered 2 more.  This will last me a very very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service with this company is OUTSTANDING!!!!  They are very intune with you being and staying their customer.  No pressure but they really care how it is working for you.  If you have any questions or concerns your email is answered immediatley.&lt;br /&gt;They really care about your happiness and sucess with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying anything anymore !!&lt;br /&gt;Thought It was working ... But I guess not :(&lt;br /&gt;It only makes your skin brighter ( just like a lot of other products )</li>
            <li> I started searching for a product online that would help my skin tone, pore size, overall appearance, etc and wasn&#x27;t sure if that product would be a cream, series of products, vitamins, etc.  I stumbled across this Vitamin C Serum and was impressed by the amount of positive reviews it had.  I started reading the reviews and found that this may be just what I was looking for - and it was!  While there is never really any miracle product, this has been as close as it comes for me.  I am in my mid 40s and unfortunately, still have acne prone skin, large pores and uneven skin tone.  I drink a lot of water, exercise regularly and watch what I eat, but still, my skin never looks very &amp;#34;healthly!&amp;#34;  I have only been using this product a couple of weeks and have seen the most improvement of any product I have ever tried.  I feel my skin tone has a more even appearance, I actually have a slight &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin now and shockingly, I have only had one minor break-out since using this!  The best part was that my break-out was hardly noticeable as there was no redness to it.  I believe since this product has given my skin some of the essential things it has been missing, it tends to show less of an aging look and instead, a more youthful look and feel.  I don&#x27;t know that my pores have necessarily reduced in size as others have claimed; however, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to answer that.  At this point, that could only make it a true miracle oil for me!  I love this product.  I have also been impressed with Day by Day Beauty (I believe that is the maker of this product) as they have sent some emails with tips and guides to using the oil properly and other suggestions to keep your skin healthy and young.  Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Vitamin C Serum that I have ever used. I love how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  I have used several other Vitamin C serums and this actually has given me results.  I recommend this serum to anyone who wants to achieve beautiful youthful skin.</li>
            <li> customer service is non-responsive, inferior product for the price</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz says the only combination you will see an actual difference in your skin with is Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.  This serum adds Vitamin E which is known to be healing.  I like this brand&#x27;s delivery using a pump rather than an eye dropper.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skin care products most with no visible results but after trying this product for just a week I can see a definite difference in my fine lines and frown marks I am totally surprised! I will continue to use this product there have been no side effects and I am looking forward to seeing even more results in the days to come!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 10 days now and I must say I am quite pleased. I notice that my skin feels much softer and the fine lines around my face are no where near as noticeable. My skin also looks so much brighter and since I do have pretty dry skin.. I would patches of skin around my nose and in the space between my eyebrows, well those areas have even improved dramatically. This is a winner! I know I have  tried so many products that say that they will do  all these miracle fixes. But this one comes quite close! I gave four stars only because I had a little bit of sensitivity to the product.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to see if this would work well on my skin. Usually anything I try on my face makes it break out like crazy, so I am always worried to try something for my face. This actually goes on easy, and makes my skin so soft. I haven&#x27;t had any problems, and will continue to use it to see what all changes are still to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, although I know I should as that&#x27;s an important tool I use when choosing products.  But, I had to review this product because it&#x27;s truly amazing!  I saw a difference in my face after the very first time I used it!  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day everyday over the last 3 weeks or so since I purchased it and I&#x27;ve been seeing a consistent improvement over that time.  Every morning I&#x27;m excited to look in the mirror to see the results.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I actually see an improvement every single day!  I had discoloration, including age spots, wrinkles and saggy skin.  The difference I&#x27;ve noticed is a DRAMATIC decrease in the discoloration and age spots and I do mean dramatic!  Most age spots are completely gone and the worst ones are getting lighter everyday. My wrinkles are much less noticeable also.  I&#x27;m simply amazed how fresh and young my skin looks as far as the color and wrinkles.  You would think I used sun screen my entire life or stayed out of the sun but that&#x27;s not the case.  I laid out a lot using little to no sun screen (usually a sun amplifier instead) in my teens up through my late 30s when I started noticing sun damage.  I also used a tanning bed up until my mid 20s so I had quite a bit of sun damage.  With this product, it&#x27;s like I took an eraser and erased most of the sun damage.  I&#x27;m so excited about the possibility of not wearing any base this summer!  I was just told a couple of days ago that  I look like i&#x27;m in my mid 30s but I&#x27;m 46!  I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference in the elasticity of my skin but there is some improvement.  They say you&#x27;ll see full results within 6 months so I&#x27;m confident I will continue to see improvement.  I have noticed my skin feels incredibly smooth.  I love to touch my face and feel how soft and smooth it is.  This product does everything it promises to do.  They also follow up by email with added information and helpful tips.  If you&#x27;re looking for youth in a bottle you&#x27;ve found it!  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> While everyone is high school complained about their skin I had no problem. Well now I do. I have tried a few different brands and Day by Day Beauty has, by far, made the best Vitamin C Serum. They all claim to help with tough and dry skin, dullness, even elasticity, but only this Vitamin C Serum has really worked. I recommend it to all my friends and family members. I am very conscious about what goes on and in to my body and this formula is made up of 72% organic ingredients. My skin is softer and brighter. I can feel my skin firming up and I am so glad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. so far i have seen good results. my age spots are starting to clear up and my skins texture has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this serum and it did nothing for my skin. In fact, it seemed to dry it out. Don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face.  Seems to do what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I TRIED IT &amp; DIDN&#x27;T SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. IT DIDN&#x27;T PRODUCE WHAT IT GUARANTEED. WISH I HAD RETURNED IT FOR MY MONEY BACK. IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> First, allow me to say this seller is without a doubt the most proactive in customer service! I have been using the C serum for a few weeks now and is hands down a miracle. I have never written a review but felt this one necessary. After years of damage by tanning beds to my face I decided to toss the UV&#x27;S and take action to nourish my skin instead of more damage. I have a very oily complexion with sun spots at age 31!! Within the first week of using this product I noticed tightening of my pores. Not visibly but when applying liquid foundation I noticed it didn&#x27;t look caked into my pores as much. MAJOR PLUS!!! Secondly, I use twice daily in conjunction with coconut oil as my facial moisturizer.  This has truly diminished the redness and overall tone of my skin. If you are considering adding this to your daily routine make this priority.  Well worth every penny as it doesn&#x27;t take much at all. Goes a very long way. This will continue to be my daily regime. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 6 months of use!! Thank you and I hope this review helps your decision.</li>
            <li> This product really works on my skin! I have been use more than two weeks, and 4 pumps every night. My skin just get brighter and glow. Just remember, don&#x27;t use this product at day time, UV light gonna make dark spots on your face, unless you apply sun screen after you apply this serum.</li>
            <li> i wish i could give a realistic review but my hands were slightly wet from shower , bottle fell on floor and broke so i was unable to use any more of the product.  bottles for bathroom should be made to withstand things being dropped.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of the Day by Day Vit C Serum and I am so thankful for this wonderful gift. I can honestly say the skin on my face and neck, feels and looks better than it has in about a year. It is so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for something for several months because the product that I had been using for years, suddenly did not keep my face hydrated any longer, plusI had some kind of terrible sand-like particles coming out of my pores. I would wash my face in the morning, removing all the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; that had accumulated over-night and by three o&#x27;clock my face felt like I had been to the beach and poured sand on my face again. It was crazy. I asked my doctor about it but she had no answer for me but she did refer me to the plastic surgeon  that had removed a cancer from the side of my nose about 4 years ago. He had no answer for me either and recommended I see a Dermatologist. While waiting to get into see her and after about 5 months of making &amp;#34;sand piles&amp;#34;, as I started using the Serum the &amp;#34;sand problem&amp;#34; has cleared up. Like I said, &#x27;crazy&#x27;. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that before and I hope I never do again.&lt;br /&gt;An other thing that is occurring with the Serum is a lightening to a small brown area above my left eye. I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to lighten those areas and they do work to some extent but for whatever reason, I could never get that particular area to respond. I am now seeing a gradual lightening response with the Day by Day Vit C Serum. How nice!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to be kept posted as to any other products the Day by Day company comes out with or any other information they may have that would be helpful for my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I am most grateful to my friend for giving this Serum to me.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve ever used. It does not contain smells or added color to make you think your using an orange infused treatment. Its pure vitamin C, absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel terrific. After a few days even a co-worker complimented that my skin looked brighter.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Vitamin C serum for three days but already notice a difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s softer, more even toned and the wrinkles near my eyes are slightly less visible.  I will continue to use this product under moisturizer as suggested and expect continued improvement in my face.  I also like that the bottle has a pump because a little of this serum goes a long way.  It was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, i will give it five star but they came without the dispenser cap, so manage the product without this cap have been very difficult because i don&#x27;t want to touch the liquid with my fingers ( because I don&#x27;t want to spoil the product) and neither i want to waste it.</li>
            <li> I have paid $70 for serum like this in the past. I really like Day by Day Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> Im almost done with my first bottle! And already ordered 3 more bottle of these great product! What i love about this vitamin c serum are the ff:&lt;br /&gt;-the texture is really light and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-the product has a stable vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s effective! I have a more fairer and brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;-the packaging is super hygienic!&lt;br /&gt;-great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super satisfied with my purchase!!❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I read, that to be effective, a vitamin C serum must be between 15 and 20 percent. Day by day is 18, which makes it one of the highest concentrations out there. It may seem a little pricey compared to others, but only 2-3 pumps provides full face coverage. After a little over a month, there is a noticeable difference in tone and texture. My husband told me I looked \\&quot;healthier\\&quot;. I accredit that to the brightening of my complexion and the softening of lines. I also didn&#x27;t know that serums contain a higher concentration than creams. So, even though this serum may be thin, it packs a whollop. I mustn&#x27;t forget to mention the sincere, caring attitude when or if you contact the company with any questions or concerns. I will definitely continue to purchase this great product.(Oh, and I forgot to mention I&#x27;m one of those disgusting smokers at age 59, so if it helps me, it will help anybody.)</li>
            <li> Very nice , light and clean feel to it</li>
            <li> I have tried out several vitamin C serums over the last several months, and this is my favorite so far. I received it for review. I love that this is light, unscented, not sticky or greasy. It comes in a fairly big bottle and a little goes a long way, so it seems to be a good value. I also like the pump method rather than the dropper. It comes out cleanly without drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of results, I&#x27;ve seen the same results with all the ones I&#x27;ve tried: It DOES make a difference, though not a tremendous one for me. I don&#x27;t see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes, but I do see a general smoother appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not burn or irritate and no strong fragrance. .  its packaged in a nice colored bottle to protect the serum from light.  Easy pump dispenser, no messy droppers! I love it!</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum by Day By Day Beauty is amazing! It&#x27;s very hydrating for your skin and gentle. It&#x27;s easy to use and helps shrink pores!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected from this product, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin from using it.  When I first put it on I can feel my skin tightening, but after a few minutes it disappears and I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serums are a great way to prep the skin for moisturizer as all of the serums I’ve tried contain Hyaluronic acid, which is able to swell and hold a LOT of water, which is great for (dry) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have chronically dry skin which can make even the lightest foundation look cakey if I’m not careful. But since I started using Vitamin C Serums a couple months ago, my skin has been a LOT less flaky than it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong fragrance to this serum and just has a slight medicinal scent which is likely from the Witch Hazel that it contains. I hate strong fragrances and appreciate a more natural smelling skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are looking for a great vitamin C serum look no further!</li>
            <li> I recently turned 40 I am trying to keep my face looking younger, not that I even look 40. But your never to young to start a daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Premium Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, &amp; Vitamin E Trio penetrate to beautify your skin fast. The sooner you try it, the sooner you’ll see… It’s safe &amp; effective for all skin types, including sensitive skin. Our premium formula is plant-based, without parabens, alcohol, or fillers. Of course we make everything Cruelty-Free in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used products with these ingredients , so when I first tried this I knew there would be no problems. Vitamin C has a vital role in skin health, so it is not just good taken for immune support and health it is great for skin health too. Vitamin C serums can help your skin repair itself, aides in healing scar tissue, in the growth of cells, blood vessels &amp; collagen &amp; give your skin firmness &amp; strength. The antioxidants in vitamin C is anti-aging, can prevent damage from free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall tone of my skin is even and brighter, my pores are smaller and almost gone. I can wear this all day with no greasy feeling by the end of the day. You also do not need much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one week and I really like it. The first thing that I noticed is that it does not have a fragrance. After applying the serum to my face I also noticed that this product is not at all greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly. After using this for a week I can honestly say that my skin looks brighter and my face is smoother.  Overall I am very happy with this serum and I think that it is definitely worth a try. [...]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my face since using this product. I&#x27;ve learned that one of the Only ingredients that actually works with the skin Is vitamin C though. I&#x27;m 60 yrs old so maybe beyond hope:( Don&#x27;t know if it would make a difference on someone younger that doesn&#x27;t Already have damaged skin. It feels Light, comes out very watery but I felt the &#x27;tingle&#x27; of the C doing &#x27;something&#x27;?? It dispenses Nicely also. I&#x27;ll finish This one off but don&#x27;t know if I would buy This one again or try ANOTHER one, my drawer is full of stuff!!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum!  It&#x27;s a little more viscous than the other serum I&#x27;ve used.  It has a cooling effect and works great under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before but I really like it.  My skin seems smoother and more hydrated in this winter weather.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but I will try more when this is gone.</li>
            <li> You feel your skin so soft and you can see the changes immediately. I highly recommend this product!! Try it and see it for yourself.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum does what it says it does and more, My skin glows and has brighten  and toned , I will definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle. I like it! I haven&#x27;t really noticed any obvious difference but my skin feels softer. My Mother did mention that she thought my skin looked real good. She doesn&#x27;t know about any of my skin treatments so I guess she noticed something. Maybe I was just having a good skin day. I&#x27;m 61 and have fairly nice skin. I&#x27;d like to keep it looking fairly nice. This is worth a try! I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent Vitamin C product for my sensitive and acne-prone skin!  I&#x27;ve used this morning and night for the past 3 weeks as a skin brightener - and it has definitely helped get rid of darker spots and blotchy skin and does seem to help reduce acne flare-ups.  It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles of it because I use it on my neck as well as my face - and even down to my decollete&#x27; (upper chest area exposed more in the summer beneath tops with lower necklines) - so I can use as many as 6 to 8 pumps per application rather than the recommended 2 - 3 pumps per face application. ALSO - I&#x27;VE FOUND THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST VITAMIN C SERUMS WITH AN 18% CONCENTRATION OF VITAMIN C. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Received this on time. Have started using it only for 4 days now and have already started noticing a difference. My skin which unfortunately has a more than a few old acne scars, is already looking brighter and the scars lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs immediately into the skin, so I don&#x27;t have to wait for 10 minutes before putting on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is already a combination of Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C which is what we normally apply after using a dermaroller.  The bottle is 1 fl oz, enough to last for weeks. It is thinner in consistency compared to what we prefer which is more like gel. Gel is less messy and easier to apply on the face.  Other than that, it looks and feel good on the skin as what we were using.  A moisturizer is recommended to use after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a serum and I&#x27;m vet surprised about how well it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: we are late thirties, white, freckled, some fine wrinkles coming in over the last few years. Get focused on all natural and organic. After using for about two weeks here are our impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way more moisturized&lt;br /&gt;Healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;Clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;Feels healthier&lt;br /&gt;Evened out freckles a little (noticeably)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After user is totally recommend - and I was a skeptic! If you&#x27;re looking at serum treatment I recommend this one for both the results and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was provided by the manufacturer for review.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my skin very soft.  I also noticed fine lines look better.  Very good.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of difference with this product.</li>
            <li> MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- makes my skin feel hydrated&lt;br /&gt;- only requires a small amount to use so can last a long time&lt;br /&gt;- can be used to deal with unwanted blemishes&lt;br /&gt;- Really helps with facial wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I only wish the bottle was a bit bigger but still delivers on the promise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE this product! It is the perfect addition to my beauty routine. This serum has helped reduce those fine lines that appear once you approach forty and leaves your skin glowing. I will definitely reorder more of serum! It makes me skin completely radiant and beautiful. After using this product, my skin actually glows, it is incredible.To my surprise- best product I&#x27;ve ever applied to my face. Biggest result I have seen is improvement in skin discoloration and that was just in a few days! My face was noticeably brighter. My skin tone was more even. Markings and redness had disappeared. They usually do, but this time they disappeared much quicker. My results continue to improve with use. My pores are smaller, my brown bumps are less obvious and my necks seems smoother. In fact, my entire face looks smoother. And the slight, clear, gel like material disappears in a minute or so on your skin. It looks and feels invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note: This company offers excellent customer service. It is always a bonus. They are also quick to answer questions posted about their product. If the reviews have turned you off, throw up any questions that you have and base your decision on responses directly from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you Day by day beauty for giving me exactly what you promised.I am a fan and customer for life!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR READING AND PEACE LOVE AND SUNSHINE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product is that it comes in a glass bottle and has a simple look which I like. No fancy packaging to distract from the product. It arrived two days after the order was placed by Pamela, the co-founder of Day by Day Beauty who offered this full-sized product in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump comes with it and is easy to screw on the bottle once you remove the bottle cap. The pump squirts far so you need to make sure you point it close to your fingertips. The serum is clear, non-fragrant and easy to apply. It felt fresh on my face, was smooth, but non-greasy and dried very quickly. I loved the feel of it. I&#x27;m a gal who doesn&#x27;t like to put heavy creams or foundation on my face so I immediately loved the lightweight feel of this product. I have a hectic schedule and my morning routine is usually hurried but this product was super easy to incorporate, especially since it dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company (family-owned) has excellent customer service and Pamela, the co-founder personally sends her customers a short series of emails to coach them on how to best use the product. I appreciated having these instructions. I have applied the serum consistently in the mornings, once a day, and I have noticed that, although I&#x27;ve been going to bed later than usual and eating more greasy foods at all those summer BBQ parties, my skin has looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My weakness is potato chips which I try to avoid eating because I always break out with acne when I do, but I noticed that since I&#x27;ve been using the serum, my skin hasn&#x27;t had this problem! And when I did begin to have a few pimples show up (I told you my skin is sensitive to greasy foods) the serum would help them heal quite quickly. I have been using this product for about a month now, and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What attracted me to this product is that it is from all natural and organic ingredients and comes at such a reasonable price (currently $23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal. I&#x27;ve bought natural beauty products before and I know they are expensive. I still have 2/3 of the product left so it will last another two months if I continue using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website says of the Vitamin C Serum that it can make you feel great about:&lt;br /&gt;smoother skin texture&lt;br /&gt;line/wrinkle reduction&lt;br /&gt;tighter, more elastic skin&lt;br /&gt;brighter, more even skin&lt;br /&gt;calmed inflammation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in my forties, I need all the help I can get with my skin. I also tend to get sun spots so I want to see how continued use of this product will affect that. So far, I like what the Vitamin C Serum from Day to Day Beauty has done for my skin and I will continue to use it and I will purchase the next bottle. Currently this company carries two products and I hope they will produce more skin care products in the near future!23.95 on their website) which I think is a steal.

            <li> This is a really good product, it does appear to be helping the texture of my skin.  I would give it a higher rating, but for the sprayer, it is really horrible.  The spring is too stiff and the product either doesn&#x27;t come out at all or comes out in a huge spurt all over not just my hand but everything else within a 6-inch radius, it&#x27;s wasteful and frustrating.  If the sprayer could be improved with something that worked as well as the dispensers on other products I own, I&#x27;d increase the rating to 4 or 5 stars, but the packaging really does take away from ease of use.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  No significant improvement seen after a month&#x27;s use. It also has a slightly unpleasant smell.  I  would not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> does a great job and you can feel the difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles even though I am 50; so it&#x27;s hard to assess it.  I do have discolorations though, which are one of the hardest face issues to correct.  This seems to be making some improvements - though its not a miracle worker.  Its a slow process.  I will continue to use it as it S L O W L Y  improves my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin a little tighter, not sure if it does much more than that.</li>
            <li> at the beginning I feel  it is so good and my skin looks much better than before, but after two days it won&#x27;t change too much. it is absorbed too fast on the skin and I am not sure if it is a good characteristics.</li>
            <li> I have some time vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;Because all face like and need this vitamin.&lt;br /&gt;I have then day and night. I look ,my face happy;)))</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It has restored my skin from the environmental factors I have been around. It has restored the tone, the red splotchiness all around my face, and it has restored the smoothness. I have very oily skin and it allows my skin to remain normal oiliness instead of overly oily throughout the day until the next washing! I definitely recommend this product to everyone! (Received this product from the company in order to do a review.)</li>
            <li> Okay, I am going to start of by screaming at the top of my lungs I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! That being said, the product I am talking about is Vitamin C Serum from Day by Day Beauty. This Vitamin C Serum is an exclusive spa formula created with Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and vegan Hyaluronic Acid. The company claims that this product will &amp;#34;make embarrassing wrinkles, sun spots and uneven skin tone a thing of your distant past&amp;#34;. I got this product for free to review, but my review is totally honest and my real experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using this daily, after I wash my face. I put a few pumps in my palm, rub my palms together, then cover my face with the product. It really only takes a few seconds I have noticed a huge difference in how my skin looks. I use this in the morning after I shower/before I put my makeup on, and in the evening after I was my makeup off. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or dried out. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My skin is noticeably brighter and even. My skin tone is a lot more even than it has been in years. I don&#x27;t find myself needing as much foundation as I previously have had to use. I notice that the pores on my nose are smaller which for me is amazing. I have awful pores.  My skin is softer and it feels healthier. It&#x27;s no longer greasy, but it isn&#x27;t dried out either. I&#x27;m not one for &amp;#34;miracle products&amp;#34; but this stuff is seriously awesome. I have been using the 1oz bottle for almost a month and I still have more than half a bottle left. I would say that there I have used about 1/3 of it so far.</li>
            <li> The market for these is so swamped with these miracle serums that they give away tons of them for review so their product can be the best, I try all of them for at least 3 weeks before I write my reviews, otherwise it just wouldn&#x27;t be fair to each company.  Day By Day Beauty has created a nice natural product that glides on your skin easily and smoothly. It only takes a small amount to cover your face and it soaks in very quickly. It’s scent free, and full of wonderful ingredients. This product gives my skin a nice youthful radiant glow and makes my skin so soft and smooth. This product would be good for any skin type, even my sensitive skin. I do find this product helps with my fine lines around my eyes and some of the discoloration I have. It works very well on my dry spots. I always add an extra layer (thin) of this product to any dry patches I have on my face and neck. I also use it on my elbows because it works wonders for my rough dry elbows! It’s not marketed for that, but it does help a lot! I have gone between extremely oily skin to extremely dry skin, especially as the weather changes. I work outside 6 days a week 52 weeks a year, and my skin has taken a beating because of it also I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;m just starting to really focus on my skin since the magical age 30 is coming up just next year.  I was so frustrated with my skin and the back and forth since my pregnancies. I was looking and searching for something, anything that would shrink my pores and even out my skin without the chemicals. Overall, if you are looking for a quality Vitamin C serum, Day By Day Beauty’s Vitamin C Serum is a very good choice! It’s affordable, natural, and works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I use it all the time now and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some improvement in my skin but way too early to give a full review. One thing is certain, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> this serum is truly amazing! it goes on smoothly, and has made a hugely significant difference in evening the tone, dramatically diminishing pore size, and making my skin luminous. A little goes a long way; initially I would put it directly on my face under moisturizer, but I found it&#x27;s better to put a few drops into the moisturizer / sunscreen and apply. my very sensitive skin tolerated the product with no irritation. would highly recommend this product to any woman! Ladies younger than 50; If I had this product 20 years ago, I&#x27;d sure get a jump start on using it now!</li>
            <li> I have not seen my skin so clear in so long! Their soap truly worked for my stubborn skin. I was not expecting to see any improvement being it said it was soap, which soap normally helps clog my pores. But this bar was not sudsy, nor did it create soap film that normally sticks to the skin if you don&#x27;t use a washcloth or sponge. It didn&#x27;t smell bad, it went on so light and smooth. My pores are much much smaller now, my breakouts quickly went away which is a miracle for me! My skin feels healthy and no longer painful. Adovia has been a lifesaver for me, it helped with my confidence also, from having clear skin for the first time in years! If you have stubborn acne, give this a chance. It might just help you too!</li>
            <li> DOES MAKE A DIFFRENCE ON FACE PEACH AND CREAM LOOK</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs easily, and does not have any fragrance or smell. I bought it because of it&#x27;s good reviews and natural ingredients. and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have tested out lots of serums, I am after all over 50 years old. I am always looking for serums/skincare products that help slow down the aging process. I was able to test out Vitamin C by Day by Day and I will have to say Wow! My skin loves it! The best way I have found when you apply this serum is to do it when your skin is just a little bit damp. Once you apply it I wait able a minute or so. I tend to massage this serum into my skin, mostly under my eyes and anywhere else I have fine lines I want to get rid of. Vitamin C by Day by Day is so amazing I would get another bottle! Don&#x27;t forget that if you are going to use this serum that you for sure apply sunscreen over it, or use it only at night. I use day and night because as fair as I am I have to use sunscreen. This serum is amazing for all ages. Meaning anyone who wants to keep those fine lines at bay..</li>
            <li> I am turning 40 and as such, I will just about try everything to keep my skin looking young and tight. Bright and youthful. I received my Day by Day youth serum...ugh, I mean Vitamin C Serum and it totally works!! I have found my fountain of youth, or at least pretty blue bottle. I dab a few drops onto my fingertips as part of my morning routine, and then moisturize and makeup. VOila...my fingertip of youth. The added benefits of the ingredients is like vitamins for my skin, antioxidants that go right to the much needed aging spot. Also, the scent is light and not too perfumy, perfect for my sensitive skin. I prefer the natural ingredients. This is a great product and I will be a big fan and using this serum through my 40s and onward.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever tried any sort of Vitamin C Serum so I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and have been really bad about caring for my skin in the past) that age is already starting to show. What I like most about Day By Day&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is that it&#x27;s easy to apply and leaves your face feeling smooth (read: not sticky). After just a week of using the serum, I met a friend for dinner and she immediately commented on how my skin looked different on my face. She thought I&#x27;d done my makeup differently (I hadn&#x27;t) and said it looked better than normal. That, to me, was validation that the serum is really impactful and I&#x27;m happy to keep using it so it can continue to help my skin retain a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I stopped using facial serums for my face a while ago because I don’t like to use a lot of different products on my face. After starting again I’m not really sure why I stopped. They have so many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I was reviewing the Vitamin C Serum by Day by Day Beauty. It came in a small blue bottle with a screw cap and a pump that was easily attachable. The pump applicator is great for easy application &amp; minimizes serum’s contact with air &amp; bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum was more watery than other facial serums I have tried. I liked this because it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It makes my skin feel hydrated without having to wait for it to soak in. It didn’t have much of a noticeable smell. Each time only requires a small amount so the bottle can last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is safe for all skin types including sensitive skin, which I have. Whenever I switch beauty my beauty routine I get breakouts for a while. Which I hate because I never know if it is because the product is clearing out my skin or the product doesn’t work well with my skin. The best part with this serum is I didn’t have any breakouts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a little over two weeks my skin looked noticeably more ‘glowly’. I saw the biggest difference in my pores around my nose and cheeks. They are a lot smaller.  It does a great job at healing any dry skin and blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and does an excellent job.  However, I did not use it on my face, I used it on my hands before applying lotion.  I have very dry hands and am constantly applying lotion.  I put this on my hands prior to applying lotion and it felt great.  My hands were not sticky or greasy from the product.  It seemed to make my lotion go on smoother and my hands felt extrememly soft.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this absorbed quickly, leaving no greasy or oily film on my face and arms.  I felt very refreshed especially after adding this to my face and under my eyes!  I am hoping that with using this for a prolonged amount of time, I will see even more drastic changes.  I even found that I had ZERO breakouts after using this like I normally would from trying something new!  Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> I discovered hyaluronic acid as a beauty product not too long ago and now consider it an essential part of my daily skin regimen.  This vitamin C serum also contains vitamin E and hyaluronic acid so I felt I would like it but did not imagine it would work as well as the hyaluronic acid.  I wanted to stay loyal to my original find and not give this the full five stars, but negative aspects are hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the comparisons I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this serum is indeed more a liquid than a gel.  This is neither a pro nor a con for me.  I find that the liquid seems to spread further and more easily, and yet I started with the gel first and like it immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - the pump on this serum seems easier to control than the one on my favorite hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this serum works really well; I do think the areas under my eyes responded slightly better to the other hyaluronic serum I used, but the difference is minimal.  Both make my pores smaller, moisturize well, and smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage others to try several varieties and brands of highly rated beauty serums to see what works best for their individual skin.  I can recommend this as one of the serums to give a try.  Please do wait a few minutes for the serum to be absorbed before applying anything else.  Some users complain that these serums are sticky, but that stickiness goes away in just a few minutes, leaving your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> would totally recommend. It comes in a glass bottle, though, so if you are clumsy like me you might want to consider transferring to another less fragile (but still opaque) container</li>
            <li> I like its package, very different from other vitamin C serums. Since its cobalt blue bottle minimizes light exposure and also pump applicator is nice and easy to pump without air exposure.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy at all and it absorbs very fast.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, it brightened my skin tone after two weeks, no itching or breaking out  !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see its long term results!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.ca/Best-Vitamin-Serum-Beautifies-Face/dp/B00KOC4ZU0</li>
            <li> This came with a small pump that you replace the cap with.  It says it is a serum so I expected it to be thicker like a gel but it is watery.  No unpleasant odor or stingy when applied and it dries fast.  It appears to be working fine, I will have to give it more time.  I have been using it for almost 2 weeks.  At this point I am not sure if i will reorder.</li>
            <li> This serum is lightweight and soaks into you skin quickly - it is not greasy at all. I like it!</li>
            <li> Works well. My complexion improved.</li>
            <li> High grade vitamin c serum to be used with hyalonic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent skin regiment to reduce lines, firm skin, perfect combination products.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any reductions in fine lines but where I have been acne prone these areas have cleared up with this product. I will get more when I get low. A little goes a long way. It does dry my face but not so much that my face becomes uncomfortable with a light mouistizer I am good to go</li>
            <li> I felt a huge difference. It helped with breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Here I am again with another skincare product review. I guess you can tell the aging bug has really bitten me, but I have been fortunate to try some amazing products of which this one is clearly superior. The serum is so light its like being kissed by air, it’s not at all oily and it doesn’t feel as though it weighs down your skin, in fact, it feels very fresh. The fluid is easily absorbed and you see immediate results. I really like that it is beautifully packaged as well, but that is just me. You can find this product on Amazon by clicking the picture below. I recommend it to any woman that wants to look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> great quality vitamin c serum  I highly recommend getting this product!</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference in my skin with 2 weeks after using the serum. My skin felt baby soft.</li>
            <li> Very good product,  and great service  from Amazon..</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff makes my skin feel and, though I&#x27;ve only been using about 6 weeks, think my fine lines are improving a bit. It&#x27;s affordable and almost all natural (98%), I&#x27;d rather not put something full of chemicals on my face. It sounds like a small amount but you only use a few sprays at a time &amp; it actually last pretty well. I take vitamin C &amp; E pills, why not try it for my skin??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to purchase this product, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My biggest skin problem is oily skin, large pores, acne and inflammation. To add to these problems was my inconsistency with my skin care regimen. After receiving the Vitamin C serum and reading all the reviews I knew this product was going to add positive change to my skin. I now use a cleanser, toner, my vitamin c serum, and a moisturizer in my daily routine. My face feels supple, soft and looks more youthful. The serum really is a game changer (better yet, a face changer). You use such a small amount that the bottle will last a long time; results and value! I look in the mirror a lot more now. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Received item fast. Would recommend...Buy two cause it goes fast. One last be about a month.</li>
            <li> Day by Day vitamin c serum is a great product! I received it to review through Tomoson and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s lightweight, non sticky and easy to use. The greatest thing about vitamin c serums is they are natural products. I love natural products! It&#x27;s also an easy product to incorporate into your daily routine or use to start a daily routine if you don&#x27;t already have one. You just pump a little bit of the serum into your hands and rub into your skin. Easy peasy. The benefits are amazing, softer skin, healthier looking skin, more radiant skin. And you smell really god after using it. If you are concerned with your skin, whether it is dullness, fine lines and wrinkles or it just doesn&#x27;t look right, add some of this product into your routine and you will see results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of vit. C serum and this one does not disappoint.  I am seeing age spots diminish and pores get smaller.  I am impressed with this serum.  Will purchase this serum again.</li>
            <li> Great company, great product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, but so far I really like it! I cant review on if it redces wrinkles or fades sun spots just yet but I look forward to using the product twice a day for a month or so and updating my review at that time. What I can review is the product came in a nice glass bottle with a pump top. The product smells good and doesnt leave my face sticky or greasy. It rubs in well and dries very quickly. So far I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase and I will update this review once I&#x27;ve had time to see results.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple, nice clean vitamin C Serum. It comes in a lovely bottle and a separate dropper to keep things clean. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product for a lot cheaper than other brands.  I have been using it for a while.  I haven&#x27;t seen any changes to my skin yet.  It does make your skin soft, but I have had the same effects using a sugar scrub and some coconut oil.  The one thing that bothers me is that when I use it in the morning my makeup looks terrible when put over it.  It makes my makeup ball up and not even out properly.  Hopefully over time I will love this product, but for now it&#x27;s just ok.  ...maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
