            <li>It may be a good dryer, but do not be misled by the review that states it has the ionizer.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>The diffuser is AMAZING, adding volume and curl, if you want it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing dryer for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is a amazing product I would recommend it 100%</li>
            <li>It has two attachments which come in handy.</li>
            <li>wrapping the cord around the handle won&#x27;t make my arm fall off, but it&#x27;s not as tidy as a retractable cord.    </li>
            <li>Works like most good blow dryers.</li>
            <li>She also liked the grip on the nozzle.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>Nothing astounding.</li>
            <li>She really liked that hair dryer</li>
            <li>Price is great, the blow dryer s great, this is just plain GREAT!</li>
            <li>The cool blast button also works great, setting any style nicely.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any of the tools or special features, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>This is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer- dries my hair quickly</li>
            <li>Very nice hairdryer with 3 settings for heat or cool air.</li>
            <li>it has a pretty good power after all , accessories are good , and also the selection of the heat comes in handy</li>
            <li>Very good dryer, I needed a diffuser, and this one has a large one.</li>
            <li>it is nice to be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>My old one still works perfectly and I truly hope the quality of the product has not changed.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer I chose because of how cheap it was and the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for her to use and she loves it!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AND DOESN&#x27;T SCORCH MY LOCKS!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>dryer&#x27;s heat is very warm and powerful.</li>
            <li>All in all it&#x27;s a very good, normal dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great blow dryer at a great price :)</li>
            <li>However, it performed flawlessly (problem free, powerful blow-drying, accurate and functional heat-control, infuser works like one should) until the end</li>
            <li>Before this blow dryer I had a very cheap, compound one with no attachments.</li>
            <li>great hair dryer, several temperatures, several settings for power, just what i needed and for a great price - a great product!</li>
            <li>Conair Infinity much better.</li>
            <li>I was mostly worried that the diffusor attachement would not stay on this dryer well.  </li>
            <li>I know those are better for your hair.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser extension with fingers.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has a Vidal Sasson dryer at her house and my hair always looks better after I use it.  </li>
            <li>AND HE LOVE&#x27;S IT.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li>so the dryer has gone through many airports which could have caused issues?  </li>
            <li>This is an OK hair dryer...</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I have had many hair driers throughout the years.</li>
            <li>This one is just ok.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred one with more power.</li>
            <li>It dries OK, but just OK.</li>
            <li>She said she actually enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with it from that aspect -</li>
            <li>Even without any attachments on, it adds a TON of volume, which I love.</li>
            <li>They all have to share many things.  </li>
            <li>I AM TOTALLY PLEASED with this dryer.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so pleased.</li>
            <li>The item came in a timely fashion and packed appropriately.  </li>
            <li>I am sure she will be more than pleased when she opens her gift on Xmas.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, fast, and a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it and have gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.</li>
            <li>that cost more but doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s going to explode.</li>
            <li>This dryer is OK.</li>
            <li>alot better</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I should have known better to buy a $15 hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Diffuser is just ok.</li>
            <li>noticing more and more errors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Pricing was OK for 2014.</li>
            <li>i love this blow dryer its my fav</li>

            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My favorite blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It is an ok hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice grip and light weight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all the attachments but LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it with the diffuser</li>
            <li>so I bought two more one as a backup.</li>
            <li>Love the many choices in the temperature settings.  </li>

            <li>I really love this dryer, easy to use can change to infuser easily!</li>
            <li>The item is very light and easy portable.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I first used it, great temperature and speeds.</li>
            <li>I used it every day, and I&#x27;m impressed that it lasted this long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, I used it for it&#x27;s diffuser.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>This one is powerful and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I would like but works ok</li>
            <li>The diffuser is HUGE and that was my favorite part...</li>
            <li>cheaply made but works OK</li>
            <li>The dryer was a pretty good dryer, but it just didn&#x27;t fit well for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I bought another one as a gift.</li>
            <li>Love the new hair dryer and loved the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the hair dryer a great deal yet, but it has worked fine so far.</li>
            <li>The circuit resets very quickly, though</li>
            <li>Both the attachments were easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>This dryer is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The attachments go on easily, and stay on.</li>
            <li>This dryer is easy to gold and works quite well.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy t handle.</li>
            <li>Easy grip handle and defuser.  </li>
            <li>The diffusor makes lovely curls (just as good as my old Helen of Troy), and I use it like every</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and is a reliable tool.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly</li>
            <li>well balanced and controls are easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>the attachments are easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li>I attatch and detatch it, you just push it on, easy but don&#x27;t think it will hold up.  </li>
            <li>Strong blower and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too noisy, it has strong air velocity.  </li>
            <li>its a blow dryer for your hair, air pressure doesn&#x27;t seem strong, but works.</li>
            <li>When on high, the air blows really strong - which is good.</li>
            <li>I like most the fact that you can set the temperature to cool, warm, or hot, as opposed to many dryers, where you need to hold in a button for cool air.  </li>
            <li>It blows very hot air but the device it self doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle which I loved.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>I guess it works fine?</li>
            <li>It works quick and leaves my hair with more curl definition and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better, quieter ones, but it was cheap and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and it is oober cheap and comes in quickly.</li>
            <li>I wanted a huge diffuser attachment, and that is what I got.</li>
            <li>Its also light weight.</li>
            <li>These products are the price is cheap, convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The attachments fit well and don&#x27;t fall off or pop off and go careening across the room--</li>
            <li>I am glad this hair dryer is still available, and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>It took a few days to arrive but when we received it, my wife was very impressed with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>For the price I did not expect much, But its am amazing blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Light weight, And the heat changes is definitely a huge plus.</li>
            <li>She said that would come in handy for when she blow dries her hair straight</li>
            <li>The actual functions of this blow dryer were great, but stopped working after about 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>:) Unless you;re super-picky about hair dryers, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>an now she thinks that her hair always looks fabulous</li>
            <li>one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Ater failing to find a diffuser that fit my hair dryer</li>
            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has some power</li>
            <li>This is great as a back up dryer, for me.</li>
            <li>fr a cheap hairdryer</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d get a cheap one that worked</li>
            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to those, but the dryer itself is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for her I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>The handler is made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more powerful.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can choose the speed and whether the air is hot, medium, or cool!</li>
            <li>It could have better power, but the blower is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>gift for daughter, she says it works great for her long hair</li>
            <li>and she is excitedly waiting for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I had to reorder this dryer because the first one was defective, but boy am I glad I persevered and got this.  </li>
            <li>It is not extremely heavy and has a lot of different modes on it which is also great!</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer, I always use a defuser, the ones that have binders and fit on most dryers</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t dry it to a presentable appearance without using the diffuser, and the diffuser and concentrator both pop off the dryer and fly across the room while it&#x27;s in use.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s 10 year old Conair is better!</li>
            <li>Its very light weight but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is SUPER powerful, and I love how you can adjust the heat and how powerful it is.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get very warm and takes a bit longer to dry my hair with.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this particular dryer because I needed a diffuser, it was reasonably priced, and it was a good brand.</li>
            <li>in this case that applys since I bought a CHEAP hair dryer thats exactly what I got a CHEAP CRAPPY dryer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I tried blow too much air when using the diffuser, which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>you want it to be hot,warm or cool..</li>
            <li>Good thing is that one can choose between different speed and temperature of the flow.</li>
            <li>not too much i can say about a hair dryer, besides it works as it should, and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is more than what my daughter says she wants for Xmas(2011)</li>
            <li>Light weight and powerful</li>
            <li>does blow cool air.</li>
            <li>I can get a much cheaper hair dryer with more air flow than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad hair dryer but the reason for the lower rating is it&#x27;s just not what I signed up for.  </li>
            <li>easy to style your hair with this hair dryer and heats up quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I thought this dryer sounded great.</li>
            <li>It drys quick on two speeds and two temps so you can mix it up.</li>
            <li>sure enough I don&#x27;t know the reason buy my hair is more manageable using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is not noisy and the settings supply adequate heat.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting the high fan speed to put out more volume of air.(turbo)</li>
            <li>Though the product has a good name &amp; the price is right, there is no option for a different handle.</li>
            <li>Powerful, relatively quiet and a great price all combine to make this a must buy if you want a really fast hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and the unit became very hot.</li>
            <li>It remained very hot for some time.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>I got it the same week that I ordered it,the shipping was fast,the price is decent but the product is of really great value.</li>
            <li>It has three heat settings, and a low or high setting which is great.</li>
            <li>I love my new hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and very efficient.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 8 years!</li>
            <li>So this daughter was happy when she got her Fast Dry Turbo Dryer.</li>
            <li>If you have baby fine hair, but lots of it, you know that the way-too-hot and over-powerful blowers on most dryers these days do nothing more than fry your hair and also create a tangled mess.</li>
            <li>With a little mousse, I can create a great look with just this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this because I have extra fine hair</li>
            <li>The motor would not hardly work and wouldn&#x27;t blow air anymore inspite of the fact that it still got nice and war on high.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, does a great job of drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its worth the money...</li>
            <li>simple, effective, inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I am a faithful Amazon.com customer and rarely have a reason to complain about any of the products they sell.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t even tried the hot cycle and cool</li>
            <li>it is powerful, and works well.  </li>
            <li>I just assumed they didn&#x27;t make them anymore since it was more than 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing my naturally curly hair more, and was told to use a diffuser dryer to maintain my curls without frizz.</li>
            <li>For me it was worth the money, I know it will get years of use.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as my older Vidal Sasson model but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>dryer is powerful but bulky.</li>
            <li>I wanted a powerful  dryer,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Works well, attachments are great, and it&#x27;s not super noisy!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite hair dryers on the market right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly powerful enough and gets nice an hot, makes styling my hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li>I go online and buy a Vidal Sasson turbo right away</li>
            <li>the speed and heat slider buttons are right under where your fingers go.</li>
            <li>And the price is right too.</li>
            <li>The warm cycle gets hot enough to do any job</li>
            <li>Its light weight and its really easy to adjust the different pieces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have liked this dryer when younger (and non-achy), because it has various options for heat and air flow.  </li>
            <li>It works great on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I should have paid a little more and gotten something better.</li>
            <li>particular dryer lasts a good long time too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite good, and somewhat quieter than my old Conair dryer with the same features and power.</li>
            <li>It dries her hair very quickly and she was pleasantly surprised by the diffuser being included.</li>
            <li>It not heavy and its a really good quility for a low price.</li>
            <li>controls are very large and are located exactly where my hand holds the handle,</li>
            <li>i dont any other very pleased</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little more powerful, but it is fine.</li>
            <li>It does its job well, definitely gets very hot on hot setting and mildly cool on cool setting</li>
            <li>The rubber grip on the barrel is great for those hard to reach areas on the top and back of your head.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many dryers over time, only to have them die in about a year and some even within the first month.</li>
            <li>It blows air but is no longer hot.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what you bought it for.</li>
            <li>My wife just used this today for the first time.</li>
            <li>I wish the attachments were made of higher quality material, though.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I only paid $5.00 more for it.  </li>
            <li>this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought that doesn&#x27;t make it to two months.</li>
            <li>You could put one in each bathroom and feel like you really got a deal!</li>
            <li>You can hold it there and your hand never gets hot.</li>
            <li>It is big and bulky, but most hand held dryers are.</li>
            <li>The barrel gets hot, but the rubber band around it helps protect your hand.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever hair dryer (I&#x27;m 22)...</li>
            <li>I would think a hair dryer would last more than 7 months.</li>
            <li>I turned on the hair dryer and within 30 seconds it became so hot that it was smoking</li>
            <li>I ordered this dryer because after reading the first review (Bryan Carey), I was under the impression it had an ionizer, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>&gt; - The barrel gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>My daughter grew up using an exact Vidal Sasson model that I purchased about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>If you need to take the attachments off and on, this might not be my first choice for a dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to stop every 20mins because it gets too hot and shuts off.</li>
            <li>Hot temperature weak...direction nozzel does not stay on the dryer...</li>
            <li>When I first tried this, I did not like it.</li>
            <li>It gets to hot and the attachment nozzle you use at the dryer end continously falls off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for several months and just love it.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer does EXACTLY that.</li>
            <li>IT also seems like the heat isn&#x27;t terribly hot.</li>
            <li>Ver good machine but had trouble attaching the attachments.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly think this dries my hair any faster than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve had (as it advertises), but it&#x27;s still a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I needed something quick as my present one was going out, and this filled the bill.</li>
            <li>When it gave-up the ghost, I was ecstatic to see the same model was STILL available 10 years later, and that certainly says something about how well it&#x27;s made and how popular it is amongst users.</li>
            <li>The attachment pops of easily if you&#x27;re not careful and if you have it on the hottest setting</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light but little bit bulky..and the thing i dislike the most about this item is this smell when it&#x27;s turned on..</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, so when I add some moussse, I can get great waviness :) The concentrator works good with a big round brush, and now I usually style my hair that way.   </li>
            <li>Having said that, it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as powerful as my older 1875W hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser yet, but I don&#x27;t think I really need it since I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>It clicks into place in a positive fashion too.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped really fast and was exactly what she ordered.  </li>
            <li>Works great but is a bit larger and bulkier than I expected!</li>
            <li>so I like the option to diffuse it on low with hot heat or blow it straight on high with medium heat.&lt;br /&gt; - Lasted longer than many dryers do</li>
            <li>It has a loud and high pitched sound.</li>
            <li>, it was fast and I was impressed with how fast it dryed my massive amount of thick hair.</li>
            <li>The new dryer I bought cost twice this much and doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li>Not a salon worthy or frequent use dryer.</li>
            <li>She got a lot more curl using the diffuser than just letting it air dry.</li>
            <li>but I received my own in slightly damaged condition, with some of the silver scrunched up.</li>
            <li>No complains so far, it dries my hair quickly</li>
            <li>Most of the time I just let my hair air dry because this bugged me so much.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Diffuser is way too large to handle drying with ease.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it had cold, warm, and hot settings.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an overwhelming technological challenge to manufacture a piece of plastic that snaps onto another piece of plastic and stays put under reasonable stress; it&#x27;s accomplished every day and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li>hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li>I think.this is a pretty decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have spent a little more for a more powerful one.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy, and I&#x27;ll probably replace it when and if it breaks in the future (and I&#x27;ve already been using it for a few weeks.).</li>
            <li>This could be partially the operator&#x27;s fault as I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>However, for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I blow my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>because they break so fast.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the gripper handle.</li>
            <li>And I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that it doesnt come with a comb attachment and doesnt seem to have one that you can buy separately to fit it</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much air flow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as my old dryer although both are 1875W.</li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting, someone could probably blow in to my hair with more umph!&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra few dollars and choose a better one.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>I should have gone by the product description and not relied so much on the review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a blow dryer, so i can&#x27;t tell if it really doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Drys fast</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care so much when I got it,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used the attachments so I won&#x27;t comment on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and no complains she really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about it</li>
            <li>and she says that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It it very functional and fits confortable in your luggage.</li>
            <li>and I had to get a replacement  hair dryer FAST.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>this straightens my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a product licensed by Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely horribe.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done really fast,</li>
            <li>Dries my hair faster than any other dryer I have used so far, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>its more for a personal use , not for professional use</li>
            <li>Is a very fast dryer, seems to put out more heat and faster than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend spent hours on my Amazon account looking for a new blowdryer, pretty sure she loves it.</li>
            <li>Overall for a lower end dryer with the amenities this offers, I&#x27;ve owned better, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, but wasn&#x27;t surely packaged, seemed loose enough where stuff was shaking inside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than other dryers and takes up more space.</li>
            <li>The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was the high pitched sound the blower makes.</li>
            <li>It fit snug enough that it never once popped off but loose enough in the grooves to be able to turn to get the right angle without having to remove it during drying.</li>
            <li>Pretty quiet, powerful, and I like the attachments.</li>
            <li>The  Vidal Sassoon Fast Dry Turbo Dryer  was well liked and was complimented on&lt;br /&gt;all of the different attachments.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything turbo about it except for the noise it gives off in high speed.</li>
            <li>--you have to run the unit on cool for only about five seconds.    </li>
            <li>I had one of these for a few years and loved it so when it died, I wanted to replace it with the same thing.  </li>
            <li>, that was my main reason for buying it</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer 6 to 10 years ago (can&#x27;t remember for sure) and it finally went out on me last week.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and am particular about products drying out my hair, or causing frizz.</li>
            <li>So I mainly use this dryer to get the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; out of my hair.</li>
            <li>The diffuser was easy to click on and I can dry my hair in minutes!!</li>
            <li>The noise was a bit more high pitched than her previous dryer.</li>
            <li>No different than any other dryer... works fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It usually takes about 5 minutes to dry my hair - which is great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the HIGH setting is supposed to be the turbo setting, but it doesn&#x27;t say that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>, I can have the heat on medium and the fan on high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is a very good one too, with fingers long enough to hold it off from the scalp enough to gather curls and hold them to dry and set.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it no longer blows anything other than cool air.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, but it is very loud and it took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>even when it&#x27;s on HIGH, it&#x27;s barely powerful enough to make my hair move.</li>
            <li>late.&lt;br /&gt;i needed a new hair dryer and they were out of this particular one at target.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li>I was a hair stylist for 28 years in my earlier life and have had quite a few blowers, this one is just as good as the professional ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>hot enough when I want to curl up my stubborn straight hair.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Helen of Troy Jewel Tools hair dryer for the past couple of years, and it was a good hair dryer, but it finally broke</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful when you have the extra time and want to skip out on heat damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to deliver the heat to the roots of the hair but not so powerful as to blow all hope of curl out of the hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>But this does not dry may hair very fast at all.</li>
            <li>(smells so much of plastic) and does not dry fast.</li>
            <li>What a difference in drying time, came with attachments and fits easily in the same storage area I had for my last hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser attachment and the short amount of time it takes to dry even the thickest hair.</li>
            <li>wish i still had the box, i&#x27;d send it right back.</li>
            <li>Honestly, these hair dryers are the bomb...had the EXACT same model for over 10 years (2005 to 2015, only the font used to print &amp;#34;Vidal Sasson&amp;#34; on the body is a bit different) until it finally died on us!</li>
            <li>Its not as quite as expected but overall I highly recommend this. :)</li>
            <li>I bought a new dryer 2 days ago</li>
            <li>I will be returning the new one and will be ordering another of these.</li>
            <li>and I went to Target to get a new dryer,</li>
            <li>She returned to the phone and told me that they will be sending me a new attachment for the dryer.</li>
            <li>I did receive the new attachment and it still falls off every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, curls fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li>Its extremely loud when used on high.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but it is really loud and high pitched.  </li>
            <li>First dryer to ever last me 5 years!</li>
            <li>Next time I would buy a higher wattage dryer for the Vapper, but this was an oversight on my part and no reflection at all on the mfgr.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too hot to put back on without hurting your hands.</li>
            <li>When you first look at it you might think it is cracked back</li>
            <li>I use this everyday..works well with my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>The exact same model!  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer after  three weeks is the completely fell apart !</li>
            <li>; button really does produce a cool air that will last as long as you want.</li>
            <li>the sizes are pretty much same</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with how lightweight it is, drying your hair for 15 minutes can be tiring!</li>
            <li>Just have a good round brush, heat protectant and depending on your hair other products to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>It overheats just a little bit too easily.</li>
            <li>First I had gone to my local Target to buy a new blowdryer when my old one died.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, I just went to the store and bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely loud.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair in half the time, nice wide opening for air flow.</li>
            <li>Attachments are cheap, difficult to snap on and off, crack easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too loud, as I know my mothers old hair dryer was very loud.  </li>
            <li>, I have to just balance it in the right place and hold it while I blow dry.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding a diffuser to fit my conair dryer, so I just bought this Vidal Sasson set, which was inexpensive and very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>This came today and it clearly has some defects in the plastic on the handle.  </li>
            <li>I had an old blow dyer and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li>I use it on occasion and it has a strange smell when you first turn it on.</li>
            <li>I purchased the hair dryer for my wife as a replacement to an old one that broke.</li>
            <li>This dryer is loud.</li>
            <li>I use my old one with duct tape..</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair was silky and soft after blow drying.</li>
            <li>The air still comes through almost directly which defeats the purpose of it.  </li>
            <li>and it helps to make my hair look as if it&#x27;s not limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my wife to replace her old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>I also want something ionic just to see if it helps with my natural curly frizz...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite picky about my dryers and this model (VS505) offers everything.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t take how loud this dryer is.</li>
            <li>In terms of heat 1875 with multiple settings  and the price was also very affordable  </li>
            <li>Wifes old one wore out.</li>
            <li>Most hair dryers last a few years...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as powerful as I had expected it to be, but it can pass.</li>
            <li>It does get hot and it does dry your hair eventually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite noisy when on high power, I feel like all my neighbors can hear it, but it takes me just 5 minutes to be done with my hair, which is great because I hate spending too much time in front of the mirror with the dryer.</li>
            <li>After about three minutes on high, I have to hit the cool air button to bring the temp back down and reset the circuit that prevents the unit from overheating.</li>
            <li>Only gave 4 stars because it is a bit loud when on the high setting.</li>
            <li>For those who have very thick hair, this hair dryer on high will more than likely be what you are looking for if in fact the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t actually have a high pitched whine on high power.</li>
            <li>Cold shot, warm &amp; hot setting.</li>
            <li>diffuser is great...really large and with long fingers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;anyways, after a 12 day vacation, i returned to find this on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a long time since i&#x27;ve had a hair dryer that really blows 1875, like it</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer was just not getting hot enough to style and dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I just recently had to purchase a new one because the blower went out on it</li>
            <li>if you want a fancy fast dry dryer.</li>
            <li>Fast Dry Turbo Dryer works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I could dry my hair quicker by fast walking around the bathroom.</li>
            <li>but it takes much longer to dry my hair than the conair that I have at home.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>The diffuser cup is wayyy big, and the dryer even on the lowest setting is very loud..</li>
            <li>Could get a little hotter, but I like the attachments and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>while it has 1875W like most dryers it seems a bit weak.</li>
            <li>The hot air is really hot, the cold air is adequately cool, and it&#x27;s adjustable to almost any combination of temperature and air speed/power.</li>
            <li>this one takes me 2 and a half hours(not including the frequent breaks) to dry my hair on full blast</li>
            <li>I love that it has the option of the cold shot button, I have used this to dry my lashes after applying mascara, to dry my nails and to set my hairstyle after drying it. :)</li>
            <li>This dryer has one genuinely low blower speed and a high setting that is not like standing in back of a jet engine.  </li>
            <li>the low heat setting will only work with the low blower and the high heat setting means only the high blower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than what I was used to, and was a bit clumsy to use at first, but I got used to it quite soon, and I love it now.</li>
            <li>, generally I don&#x27;t get involved with attachments, I don&#x27;t have the time or the motivation.</li>
            <li>but I have found another hair dryer that is almost the same as my old VS 750</li>
            <li>I bought this product several months ago and the blow dryer quit working;  It wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  </li>
            <li>When using the diffuser I use the low setting and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy (I have naturally curly hair).</li>
            <li>It also offers the different speeds.</li>
            <li>When she left for college she wanted to take my old one and indeed I said no.</li>
            <li>Dried my thick wavy hair fairly well, but left it somewhat frizzy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap and, while a bit slow, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got thick or long hair, you may want to get a more robust one.</li>
            <li>looks good in the pic but the actual product is roughly made, and the package has holes on it, as if it&#x27;s a product some other customer returned &gt;:/</li>
            <li>When I blow dry using this, my hair is absolutely gigantic (but if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be big like that, you can brush it out some).   </li>
            <li>so when I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use a different blow dryer.</li>
            <li>my old dryer took a total of an hour and a half on full blast to dry my hair and didn&#x27;t shut off</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do that with this dryer because the barrel gets way too hot, even with the black rubber part protecting it.  </li>
            <li>I can usually run a straighter over my hair quickly to make it look finished.  </li>
            <li>it has high heat, low heat, cold, and warm.</li>
            <li>I really need the comb that fits, and I have no use for the other items.</li>
            <li>I would say pay the extra $10 and get something a little nicer, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>I will go back to Clairol  dryer in the near future.</li>
            <li>I was actually getting dizzy with the loud roar next to my ear</li>
            <li>Original, same model, lasted at least 5 years.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just no excuse any longer.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely NO excuse for the manufacture of a dryer with attachments that won&#x27;t stay attached.</li>
            <li>Whether I use it with the diffuser to keep my curls or use it with a round brush to straighten my hair, this dryer is fast!</li>
            <li>I also thought this was new, but it clearly looked like it was in a package that had been previously opened as it had scotch tape on the box.  </li>
            <li>A little too large on the blow dryer but its Ok.</li>
            <li>It does not dry hair fast and is heavy.</li>
            <li>Not super quiet but no louder than my old one which was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>it was too large and heavy to use with one hand, especially when the defuser was attached.recommend</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this dryer and would reccommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love the 3 heat settings!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The diffuser is AMAZING, adding volume and curl, if you want it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing dryer for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is a amazing product I would recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> It has two attachments which come in handy.</li>
            <li> wrapping the cord around the handle won&#x27;t make my arm fall off, but it&#x27;s not as tidy as a retractable cord.    </li>
            <li> Works like most good blow dryers.</li>
            <li> She also liked the grip on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> Nothing astounding.</li>
            <li> She really liked that hair dryer</li>
            <li> Price is great, the blow dryer s great, this is just plain GREAT!</li>
            <li> The cool blast button also works great, setting any style nicely.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the tools or special features, but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is my new best friend!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer- dries my hair quickly</li>
            <li> Very nice hairdryer with 3 settings for heat or cool air.</li>
            <li> it has a pretty good power after all , accessories are good , and also the selection of the heat comes in handy</li>
            <li> Very good dryer, I needed a diffuser, and this one has a large one.</li>
            <li> it is nice to be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> My old one still works perfectly and I truly hope the quality of the product has not changed.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer I chose because of how cheap it was and the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for her to use and she loves it!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AND DOESN&#x27;T SCORCH MY LOCKS!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> dryer&#x27;s heat is very warm and powerful.</li>
            <li> All in all it&#x27;s a very good, normal dryer.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great blow dryer at a great price :)</li>
            <li> However, it performed flawlessly (problem free, powerful blow-drying, accurate and functional heat-control, infuser works like one should) until the end</li>
            <li> Before this blow dryer I had a very cheap, compound one with no attachments.</li>
            <li> great hair dryer, several temperatures, several settings for power, just what i needed and for a great price - a great product!</li>
            <li> Conair Infinity much better.</li>
            <li> I was mostly worried that the diffusor attachement would not stay on this dryer well.  </li>
            <li> I know those are better for your hair.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser extension with fingers.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a Vidal Sasson dryer at her house and my hair always looks better after I use it.  </li>
            <li> AND HE LOVE&#x27;S IT.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li> so the dryer has gone through many airports which could have caused issues?  </li>
            <li> This is an OK hair dryer...</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I have had many hair driers throughout the years.</li>
            <li> This one is just ok.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred one with more power.</li>
            <li> It dries OK, but just OK.</li>
            <li> She said she actually enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with it from that aspect -</li>
            <li> Even without any attachments on, it adds a TON of volume, which I love.</li>
            <li> They all have to share many things.  </li>
            <li> I AM TOTALLY PLEASED with this dryer.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so pleased.</li>
            <li> The item came in a timely fashion and packed appropriately.  </li>
            <li> I am sure she will be more than pleased when she opens her gift on Xmas.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, fast, and a great price.</li>
            <li> I love it and have gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.</li>
            <li> that cost more but doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s going to explode.</li>
            <li> This dryer is OK.</li>
            <li> alot better</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I should have known better to buy a $15 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Diffuser is just ok.</li>
            <li> noticing more and more errors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Pricing was OK for 2014.</li>
            <li> i love this blow dryer its my fav</li>
            <li> the one I use most.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It is an ok hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice grip and light weight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all the attachments but LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it with the diffuser</li>
            <li> so I bought two more one as a backup.</li>
            <li> Love the many choices in the temperature settings.  </li>
            <li> I liked the blow dryer and how its light weight.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, great control, love the buttons....</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, because it has adjustable heat and speeds, also it is lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I love it.....</li>
            <li> I really love this dryer, easy to use can change to infuser easily!</li>
            <li> The item is very light and easy portable.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I first used it, great temperature and speeds.</li>
            <li> I used it every day, and I&#x27;m impressed that it lasted this long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, I used it for it&#x27;s diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> This one is powerful and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would like but works ok</li>
            <li> The diffuser is HUGE and that was my favorite part...</li>
            <li> cheaply made but works OK</li>
            <li> The dryer was a pretty good dryer, but it just didn&#x27;t fit well for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I bought another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Love the new hair dryer and loved the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the hair dryer a great deal yet, but it has worked fine so far.</li>
            <li> The circuit resets very quickly, though</li>
            <li> Both the attachments were easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The attachments go on easily, and stay on.</li>
            <li> This dryer is easy to gold and works quite well.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy t handle.</li>
            <li> Easy grip handle and defuser.  </li>
            <li> The diffusor makes lovely curls (just as good as my old Helen of Troy), and I use it like every</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and is a reliable tool.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly</li>
            <li> well balanced and controls are easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> the attachments are easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> I attatch and detatch it, you just push it on, easy but don&#x27;t think it will hold up.  </li>
            <li> Strong blower and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too noisy, it has strong air velocity.  </li>
            <li> its a blow dryer for your hair, air pressure doesn&#x27;t seem strong, but works.</li>
            <li> When on high, the air blows really strong - which is good.</li>
            <li> I like most the fact that you can set the temperature to cool, warm, or hot, as opposed to many dryers, where you need to hold in a button for cool air.  </li>
            <li> It blows very hot air but the device it self doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle which I loved.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine?</li>
            <li> It works quick and leaves my hair with more curl definition and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better, quieter ones, but it was cheap and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and it is oober cheap and comes in quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a huge diffuser attachment, and that is what I got.</li>
            <li> Its also light weight.</li>
            <li> These products are the price is cheap, convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The attachments fit well and don&#x27;t fall off or pop off and go careening across the room--</li>
            <li> I am glad this hair dryer is still available, and at such a good price.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to arrive but when we received it, my wife was very impressed with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> For the price I did not expect much, But its am amazing blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Light weight, And the heat changes is definitely a huge plus.</li>
            <li> She said that would come in handy for when she blow dries her hair straight</li>
            <li> The actual functions of this blow dryer were great, but stopped working after about 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> :) Unless you;re super-picky about hair dryers, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> an now she thinks that her hair always looks fabulous</li>
            <li> one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Ater failing to find a diffuser that fit my hair dryer</li>
            <li> It is light weight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and has some power</li>
            <li> This is great as a back up dryer, for me.</li>
            <li> fr a cheap hairdryer</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d get a cheap one that worked</li>
            <li> It is light weight</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to those, but the dryer itself is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for her I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> The handler is made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more powerful.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can choose the speed and whether the air is hot, medium, or cool!</li>
            <li> It could have better power, but the blower is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> gift for daughter, she says it works great for her long hair</li>
            <li> and she is excitedly waiting for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to reorder this dryer because the first one was defective, but boy am I glad I persevered and got this.  </li>
            <li> It is not extremely heavy and has a lot of different modes on it which is also great!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer, I always use a defuser, the ones that have binders and fit on most dryers</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t dry it to a presentable appearance without using the diffuser, and the diffuser and concentrator both pop off the dryer and fly across the room while it&#x27;s in use.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s 10 year old Conair is better!</li>
            <li> Its very light weight but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is SUPER powerful, and I love how you can adjust the heat and how powerful it is.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get very warm and takes a bit longer to dry my hair with.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this particular dryer because I needed a diffuser, it was reasonably priced, and it was a good brand.</li>
            <li> in this case that applys since I bought a CHEAP hair dryer thats exactly what I got a CHEAP CRAPPY dryer.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I tried blow too much air when using the diffuser, which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> you want it to be hot,warm or cool..</li>
            <li> Good thing is that one can choose between different speed and temperature of the flow.</li>
            <li> not too much i can say about a hair dryer, besides it works as it should, and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is more than what my daughter says she wants for Xmas(2011)</li>
            <li> Light weight and powerful</li>
            <li> does blow cool air.</li>
            <li> I can get a much cheaper hair dryer with more air flow than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad hair dryer but the reason for the lower rating is it&#x27;s just not what I signed up for.  </li>
            <li> easy to style your hair with this hair dryer and heats up quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I thought this dryer sounded great.</li>
            <li> It drys quick on two speeds and two temps so you can mix it up.</li>
            <li> sure enough I don&#x27;t know the reason buy my hair is more manageable using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is not noisy and the settings supply adequate heat.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting the high fan speed to put out more volume of air.(turbo)</li>
            <li> Though the product has a good name &amp; the price is right, there is no option for a different handle.</li>
            <li> Powerful, relatively quiet and a great price all combine to make this a must buy if you want a really fast hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and the unit became very hot.</li>
            <li> It remained very hot for some time.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li> I got it the same week that I ordered it,the shipping was fast,the price is decent but the product is of really great value.</li>
            <li> It has three heat settings, and a low or high setting which is great.</li>
            <li> I love my new hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and very efficient.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 8 years!</li>
            <li> So this daughter was happy when she got her Fast Dry Turbo Dryer.</li>
            <li> If you have baby fine hair, but lots of it, you know that the way-too-hot and over-powerful blowers on most dryers these days do nothing more than fry your hair and also create a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> With a little mousse, I can create a great look with just this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this because I have extra fine hair</li>
            <li> The motor would not hardly work and wouldn&#x27;t blow air anymore inspite of the fact that it still got nice and war on high.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, does a great job of drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its worth the money...</li>
            <li> simple, effective, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful Amazon.com customer and rarely have a reason to complain about any of the products they sell.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t even tried the hot cycle and cool</li>
            <li> it is powerful, and works well.  </li>
            <li> I just assumed they didn&#x27;t make them anymore since it was more than 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing my naturally curly hair more, and was told to use a diffuser dryer to maintain my curls without frizz.</li>
            <li> For me it was worth the money, I know it will get years of use.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as my older Vidal Sasson model but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> dryer is powerful but bulky.</li>
            <li> I wanted a powerful  dryer,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Works well, attachments are great, and it&#x27;s not super noisy!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite hair dryers on the market right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly powerful enough and gets nice an hot, makes styling my hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li> I go online and buy a Vidal Sasson turbo right away</li>
            <li> the speed and heat slider buttons are right under where your fingers go.</li>
            <li> And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> The warm cycle gets hot enough to do any job</li>
            <li> Its light weight and its really easy to adjust the different pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have liked this dryer when younger (and non-achy), because it has various options for heat and air flow.  </li>
            <li> It works great on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I should have paid a little more and gotten something better.</li>
            <li> particular dryer lasts a good long time too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good, and somewhat quieter than my old Conair dryer with the same features and power.</li>
            <li> It dries her hair very quickly and she was pleasantly surprised by the diffuser being included.</li>
            <li> It not heavy and its a really good quility for a low price.</li>
            <li> controls are very large and are located exactly where my hand holds the handle,</li>
            <li> i dont any other very pleased</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little more powerful, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> It does its job well, definitely gets very hot on hot setting and mildly cool on cool setting</li>
            <li> The rubber grip on the barrel is great for those hard to reach areas on the top and back of your head.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many dryers over time, only to have them die in about a year and some even within the first month.</li>
            <li> It blows air but is no longer hot.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what you bought it for.</li>
            <li> My wife just used this today for the first time.</li>
            <li> I wish the attachments were made of higher quality material, though.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I only paid $5.00 more for it.  </li>
            <li> this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought that doesn&#x27;t make it to two months.</li>
            <li> You could put one in each bathroom and feel like you really got a deal!</li>
            <li> You can hold it there and your hand never gets hot.</li>
            <li> It is big and bulky, but most hand held dryers are.</li>
            <li> The barrel gets hot, but the rubber band around it helps protect your hand.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever hair dryer (I&#x27;m 22)...</li>
            <li> I would think a hair dryer would last more than 7 months.</li>
            <li> I turned on the hair dryer and within 30 seconds it became so hot that it was smoking</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer because after reading the first review (Bryan Carey), I was under the impression it had an ionizer, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> &gt; - The barrel gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> My daughter grew up using an exact Vidal Sasson model that I purchased about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you need to take the attachments off and on, this might not be my first choice for a dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to stop every 20mins because it gets too hot and shuts off.</li>
            <li> Hot temperature weak...direction nozzel does not stay on the dryer...</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I did not like it.</li>
            <li> It gets to hot and the attachment nozzle you use at the dryer end continously falls off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for several months and just love it.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer does EXACTLY that.</li>
            <li> IT also seems like the heat isn&#x27;t terribly hot.</li>
            <li> Ver good machine but had trouble attaching the attachments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly think this dries my hair any faster than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve had (as it advertises), but it&#x27;s still a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I needed something quick as my present one was going out, and this filled the bill.</li>
            <li> When it gave-up the ghost, I was ecstatic to see the same model was STILL available 10 years later, and that certainly says something about how well it&#x27;s made and how popular it is amongst users.</li>
            <li> The attachment pops of easily if you&#x27;re not careful and if you have it on the hottest setting</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light but little bit bulky..and the thing i dislike the most about this item is this smell when it&#x27;s turned on..</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so when I add some moussse, I can get great waviness :) The concentrator works good with a big round brush, and now I usually style my hair that way.   </li>
            <li> Having said that, it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as powerful as my older 1875W hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser yet, but I don&#x27;t think I really need it since I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> It clicks into place in a positive fashion too.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped really fast and was exactly what she ordered.  </li>
            <li> Works great but is a bit larger and bulkier than I expected!</li>
            <li> so I like the option to diffuse it on low with hot heat or blow it straight on high with medium heat.&lt;br /&gt; - Lasted longer than many dryers do</li>
            <li> It has a loud and high pitched sound.</li>
            <li> , it was fast and I was impressed with how fast it dryed my massive amount of thick hair.</li>
            <li> The new dryer I bought cost twice this much and doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li> Not a salon worthy or frequent use dryer.</li>
            <li> She got a lot more curl using the diffuser than just letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> but I received my own in slightly damaged condition, with some of the silver scrunched up.</li>
            <li> No complains so far, it dries my hair quickly</li>
            <li> Most of the time I just let my hair air dry because this bugged me so much.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Diffuser is way too large to handle drying with ease.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it had cold, warm, and hot settings.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an overwhelming technological challenge to manufacture a piece of plastic that snaps onto another piece of plastic and stays put under reasonable stress; it&#x27;s accomplished every day and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li> hair is short and fine.</li>
            <li> I think.this is a pretty decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have spent a little more for a more powerful one.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy, and I&#x27;ll probably replace it when and if it breaks in the future (and I&#x27;ve already been using it for a few weeks.).</li>
            <li> This could be partially the operator&#x27;s fault as I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> However, for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I blow my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> because they break so fast.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the gripper handle.</li>
            <li> And I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that it doesnt come with a comb attachment and doesnt seem to have one that you can buy separately to fit it</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much air flow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as my old dryer although both are 1875W.</li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting, someone could probably blow in to my hair with more umph!&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra few dollars and choose a better one.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I should have gone by the product description and not relied so much on the review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blow dryer, so i can&#x27;t tell if it really doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Drys fast</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care so much when I got it,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used the attachments so I won&#x27;t comment on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and no complains she really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it</li>
            <li> and she says that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It it very functional and fits confortable in your luggage.</li>
            <li> and I had to get a replacement  hair dryer FAST.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well.</li>
            <li> this straightens my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a product licensed by Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horribe.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done really fast,</li>
            <li> Dries my hair faster than any other dryer I have used so far, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> its more for a personal use , not for professional use</li>
            <li> Is a very fast dryer, seems to put out more heat and faster than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend spent hours on my Amazon account looking for a new blowdryer, pretty sure she loves it.</li>
            <li> Overall for a lower end dryer with the amenities this offers, I&#x27;ve owned better, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, but wasn&#x27;t surely packaged, seemed loose enough where stuff was shaking inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than other dryers and takes up more space.</li>
            <li> The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was the high pitched sound the blower makes.</li>
            <li> It fit snug enough that it never once popped off but loose enough in the grooves to be able to turn to get the right angle without having to remove it during drying.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet, powerful, and I like the attachments.</li>
            <li> The  Vidal Sassoon Fast Dry Turbo Dryer  was well liked and was complimented on&lt;br /&gt;all of the different attachments.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything turbo about it except for the noise it gives off in high speed.</li>
            <li> --you have to run the unit on cool for only about five seconds.    </li>
            <li> I had one of these for a few years and loved it so when it died, I wanted to replace it with the same thing.  </li>
            <li> , that was my main reason for buying it</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer 6 to 10 years ago (can&#x27;t remember for sure) and it finally went out on me last week.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and am particular about products drying out my hair, or causing frizz.</li>
            <li> So I mainly use this dryer to get the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The diffuser was easy to click on and I can dry my hair in minutes!!</li>
            <li> The noise was a bit more high pitched than her previous dryer.</li>
            <li> No different than any other dryer... works fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 5 minutes to dry my hair - which is great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the HIGH setting is supposed to be the turbo setting, but it doesn&#x27;t say that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> , I can have the heat on medium and the fan on high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is a very good one too, with fingers long enough to hold it off from the scalp enough to gather curls and hold them to dry and set.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it no longer blows anything other than cool air.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, but it is very loud and it took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> even when it&#x27;s on HIGH, it&#x27;s barely powerful enough to make my hair move.</li>
            <li> late.&lt;br /&gt;i needed a new hair dryer and they were out of this particular one at target.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li> I was a hair stylist for 28 years in my earlier life and have had quite a few blowers, this one is just as good as the professional ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> hot enough when I want to curl up my stubborn straight hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Helen of Troy Jewel Tools hair dryer for the past couple of years, and it was a good hair dryer, but it finally broke</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful when you have the extra time and want to skip out on heat damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to deliver the heat to the roots of the hair but not so powerful as to blow all hope of curl out of the hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> But this does not dry may hair very fast at all.</li>
            <li> (smells so much of plastic) and does not dry fast.</li>
            <li> What a difference in drying time, came with attachments and fits easily in the same storage area I had for my last hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser attachment and the short amount of time it takes to dry even the thickest hair.</li>
            <li> wish i still had the box, i&#x27;d send it right back.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these hair dryers are the bomb...had the EXACT same model for over 10 years (2005 to 2015, only the font used to print &amp;#34;Vidal Sasson&amp;#34; on the body is a bit different) until it finally died on us!</li>
            <li> Its not as quite as expected but overall I highly recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> I bought a new dryer 2 days ago</li>
            <li> I will be returning the new one and will be ordering another of these.</li>
            <li> and I went to Target to get a new dryer,</li>
            <li> She returned to the phone and told me that they will be sending me a new attachment for the dryer.</li>
            <li> I did receive the new attachment and it still falls off every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, curls fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li> Its extremely loud when used on high.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it is really loud and high pitched.  </li>
            <li> First dryer to ever last me 5 years!</li>
            <li> Next time I would buy a higher wattage dryer for the Vapper, but this was an oversight on my part and no reflection at all on the mfgr.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too hot to put back on without hurting your hands.</li>
            <li> When you first look at it you might think it is cracked back</li>
            <li> I use this everyday..works well with my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li> The exact same model!  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer after  three weeks is the completely fell apart !</li>
            <li> ; button really does produce a cool air that will last as long as you want.</li>
            <li> the sizes are pretty much same</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with how lightweight it is, drying your hair for 15 minutes can be tiring!</li>
            <li> Just have a good round brush, heat protectant and depending on your hair other products to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> It overheats just a little bit too easily.</li>
            <li> First I had gone to my local Target to buy a new blowdryer when my old one died.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, I just went to the store and bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely loud.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time, nice wide opening for air flow.</li>
            <li> Attachments are cheap, difficult to snap on and off, crack easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too loud, as I know my mothers old hair dryer was very loud.  </li>
            <li> , I have to just balance it in the right place and hold it while I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a diffuser to fit my conair dryer, so I just bought this Vidal Sasson set, which was inexpensive and very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This came today and it clearly has some defects in the plastic on the handle.  </li>
            <li> I had an old blow dyer and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> I use it on occasion and it has a strange smell when you first turn it on.</li>
            <li> I purchased the hair dryer for my wife as a replacement to an old one that broke.</li>
            <li> This dryer is loud.</li>
            <li> I use my old one with duct tape..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair was silky and soft after blow drying.</li>
            <li> The air still comes through almost directly which defeats the purpose of it.  </li>
            <li> and it helps to make my hair look as if it&#x27;s not limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife to replace her old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> I also want something ionic just to see if it helps with my natural curly frizz...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite picky about my dryers and this model (VS505) offers everything.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t take how loud this dryer is.</li>
            <li> In terms of heat 1875 with multiple settings  and the price was also very affordable  </li>
            <li> Wifes old one wore out.</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers last a few years...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as powerful as I had expected it to be, but it can pass.</li>
            <li> It does get hot and it does dry your hair eventually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite noisy when on high power, I feel like all my neighbors can hear it, but it takes me just 5 minutes to be done with my hair, which is great because I hate spending too much time in front of the mirror with the dryer.</li>
            <li> After about three minutes on high, I have to hit the cool air button to bring the temp back down and reset the circuit that prevents the unit from overheating.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because it is a bit loud when on the high setting.</li>
            <li> For those who have very thick hair, this hair dryer on high will more than likely be what you are looking for if in fact the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t actually have a high pitched whine on high power.</li>
            <li> Cold shot, warm &amp; hot setting.</li>
            <li> diffuser is great...really large and with long fingers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;anyways, after a 12 day vacation, i returned to find this on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a long time since i&#x27;ve had a hair dryer that really blows 1875, like it</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer was just not getting hot enough to style and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I just recently had to purchase a new one because the blower went out on it</li>
            <li> if you want a fancy fast dry dryer.</li>
            <li> Fast Dry Turbo Dryer works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I could dry my hair quicker by fast walking around the bathroom.</li>
            <li> but it takes much longer to dry my hair than the conair that I have at home.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li> The diffuser cup is wayyy big, and the dryer even on the lowest setting is very loud..</li>
            <li> Could get a little hotter, but I like the attachments and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> while it has 1875W like most dryers it seems a bit weak.</li>
            <li> The hot air is really hot, the cold air is adequately cool, and it&#x27;s adjustable to almost any combination of temperature and air speed/power.</li>
            <li> this one takes me 2 and a half hours(not including the frequent breaks) to dry my hair on full blast</li>
            <li> I love that it has the option of the cold shot button, I have used this to dry my lashes after applying mascara, to dry my nails and to set my hairstyle after drying it. :)</li>
            <li> This dryer has one genuinely low blower speed and a high setting that is not like standing in back of a jet engine.  </li>
            <li> the low heat setting will only work with the low blower and the high heat setting means only the high blower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than what I was used to, and was a bit clumsy to use at first, but I got used to it quite soon, and I love it now.</li>
            <li> , generally I don&#x27;t get involved with attachments, I don&#x27;t have the time or the motivation.</li>
            <li> but I have found another hair dryer that is almost the same as my old VS 750</li>
            <li> I bought this product several months ago and the blow dryer quit working;  It wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  </li>
            <li> When using the diffuser I use the low setting and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy (I have naturally curly hair).</li>
            <li> It also offers the different speeds.</li>
            <li> When she left for college she wanted to take my old one and indeed I said no.</li>
            <li> Dried my thick wavy hair fairly well, but left it somewhat frizzy.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap and, while a bit slow, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got thick or long hair, you may want to get a more robust one.</li>
            <li> looks good in the pic but the actual product is roughly made, and the package has holes on it, as if it&#x27;s a product some other customer returned &gt;:/</li>
            <li> When I blow dry using this, my hair is absolutely gigantic (but if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be big like that, you can brush it out some).   </li>
            <li> so when I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use a different blow dryer.</li>
            <li> my old dryer took a total of an hour and a half on full blast to dry my hair and didn&#x27;t shut off</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do that with this dryer because the barrel gets way too hot, even with the black rubber part protecting it.  </li>
            <li> I can usually run a straighter over my hair quickly to make it look finished.  </li>
            <li> it has high heat, low heat, cold, and warm.</li>
            <li> I really need the comb that fits, and I have no use for the other items.</li>
            <li> I would say pay the extra $10 and get something a little nicer, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> I will go back to Clairol  dryer in the near future.</li>
            <li> I was actually getting dizzy with the loud roar next to my ear</li>
            <li> Original, same model, lasted at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no excuse any longer.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO excuse for the manufacture of a dryer with attachments that won&#x27;t stay attached.</li>
            <li> Whether I use it with the diffuser to keep my curls or use it with a round brush to straighten my hair, this dryer is fast!</li>
            <li> I also thought this was new, but it clearly looked like it was in a package that had been previously opened as it had scotch tape on the box.  </li>
            <li> A little too large on the blow dryer but its Ok.</li>
            <li> It does not dry hair fast and is heavy.</li>
            <li> Not super quiet but no louder than my old one which was 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> it was too large and heavy to use with one hand, especially when the defuser was attached.recommend</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s not the most expensive and it did last me about a year, but I have had dryers in the past last much longer with no problems.</li>
            <li> One major complaint is that the diffuser did not stay attached at all - almost as if a defective product, but I really have no need for a diffuser so not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair, and it wasn&#x27;t near as powerful as I needed.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time with the attachments not staying on, and then recently the heating element must have burnt out because it quit producing hot air while I was in the middle of drying.</li>
            <li> The power of it isn&#x27;t very much, definitely less than my Helen of Troy, but it doesn&#x27;t take any longer to dry because it&#x27;s SOOO much lighter</li>
            <li> With a low, med, and high choice for heat (plus the cold shot), and the ability to use a low speed or high speed with each, this is a very versatile dryer.  </li>
            <li> It seriously drives me nuts, so I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a hair-dryer that works as advertised and will last a LONG while...not needing to be replaced after just a year or two of use.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the minis is that they don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER AND ITS ATTACHMENTS ARE A MUST HAVE FOR A BLACK OR MULTIRACIAL NATURALLY  CURLY GIRL!</li>
            <li> This takes quite a while to dry my hair - it is very thick so for those with thinner hair it would probably be better, but its not powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li> First hair dryer I have purchased in at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about the long and short of it.  </li>
            <li> But, hey its a blow dryer its not supposed to be quiet, its supposed to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair once or twice per week, and only for 15 mins to prevent over-drying my hair and creating heat damage.</li>
            <li> I use the diffusor for initial dry blowing and giving some volume to the hair, and then the straightening attachment for styling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with thick hair and on high heat</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s big and the nozzle isn&#x27;t sharp enough so I can&#x27;t travel with it</li>
            <li> Still have a Vidal Sassoon from fifteen years ago that has lasted through multiple other dryers that have quit on me, so hopefully this one will do the same!</li>
            <li> I know the details said its lightweight, but geez talk about real plastic, it seems if I hold it too hard in my hand</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this dryer was mostly plastic, but it&#x27;s operated well for me so far.</li>
            <li> Will see how long it lasts before dying.</li>
            <li> has lasted a really long time.....</li>
            <li> However, if you have thicker hair, it would take a long time to dry it.</li>
            <li> Have had other products with smaller diffuser that got the job done.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend a product from any other manufacturer.</li>
            <li> if you have long curly hair buy this!</li>
            <li> It does not have enough power to quickly dry my extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it to use in my hobby shop to dry glue, paint, pottery, and other materials.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hold it up for very long,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use this to actually dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be the dryer I could take to the gym to dry my hair in a hurry before work.  </li>
            <li> It takes me longer to dry my hair with this one...</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I am one of the curly hair&#x27;ed girls that need the diffuser when I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Had a hair dryer that took forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for Xmas after reading that an 1875W hair dryer would quickly dry your hair without leaving it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it takes longer to dry with this particular dryer.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but so are other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Even with this limited use, the park to the plastic on the attachments that clips to the dryer is melted and warped.</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful and it took me a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for about 2 weeks before it totally broke down on me.  </li>
            <li> I do like that it has an actual &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; switch rather than just the button you have to hold down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a high end hair dryer</li>
            <li> not a high volume air dryer</li>
            <li> (I have straight long thin hair)</li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry faster than expected as well</li>
            <li> but alas this one was too strong and not warm at all.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry any faster then my other blow dryer, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> And gets hair dry quicker than other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It looks a little bit poor quality, like the plastic parts are a little rough, but it&#x27;s very powerful, you can regulate the speed and the temperature.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer durable, and has stayed hot for these past at least 8 years.</li>
            <li> Not fast at all-</li>
            <li> There are 2 speeds and 3 heat settings like it says but no turbo button like I expected.</li>
            <li> so sometimes I use the defuser to fluff out the curls</li>
            <li> I even bought a few extra in case one breaks!</li>
            <li> and this does the trick in minimal.  </li>
            <li> but the nozzle is too wide for me</li>
            <li> I like it, but thought it would blow harder</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with dryers over the last few years</li>
            <li> It was also a lot noisier than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a big heavy piece of equipment but it does offer options.  </li>
            <li> Will probably give it to my 12 year old daughter as it will work for her but not for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just pass my shoulders and shouldn&#x27;t take 45 mins to blow dry!!</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I handle this dryer, I can&#x27;t dry my hair without the diffuser popping off a half dozen times.</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> What took hours to dry is cut in half with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer daily on my long, thick hair and it just kept on going.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy and used to take me 15-20 minutes to dry using my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is not alleviated by using the concentrator attachment which is sized so poorly, it falls right off.</li>
            <li> Other then that it works as it should.</li>
            <li> But it definitely makes my hair shiny when I use the small attachment and roller brush.</li>
            <li> I have had other turbo dryers, and this one does not compare.</li>
            <li> There is nothing turbo about it, but other than that, it does what it says on the box.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> and I use it to dry their little heads too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a thick long hair that will stay wet for days if I dont dry it.</li>
            <li> Now it will only blow cold air so it takes a LONG time to get my hair dry (and my hair is pretty thin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for at least 10 years and it finally died half way through drying the other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight but the diffuser was difficult to get to stay on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to at least 10 times now and the diffuser is alot larger than what I thought it was going to be which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I would call it an average blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me 45- 1 hour to blow dry my thick hair but it only took me 20 minutes with this holy item😂</li>
            <li> After giving this dryer a chance for a month I found that it has another down side -</li>
            <li> my drying time down from 22 minutes to 10, without the frizz.</li>
            <li> Big watts, annoying  noise, but mild blow.</li>
            <li> The tip part that hooks onto the end falls off so easily. :(</li>
            <li> It usually takes her 30 minutes to dry her hair.</li>
            <li> With a few other perks as well.</li>
            <li> Not a very strong breeze</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace my previous hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> She said it was a lot lighter than her previous dryer</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be fooled again into a $20 or less blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer bit the dust after 10 years of use.</li>
            <li> Worked well except its less than a year</li>
            <li> Even though I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s usually limp and slippy, and falls flat, and I can hardly even get it to stay in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> goes hot,, goes cold.</li>
            <li> I had to spend quite a bit of time with my straighener fixing the mess this blow dryer made of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter In law has long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it thick.</li>
            <li> i have long thick</li>
            <li> about 2 inches thick accross) and very long hair(</li>
            <li> and she dried her really long, thick hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> There not much really to say, apart from its positives are the power, however  not very good for styling.</li>
            <li> putting the attachments on are a LITTLE tricky but its nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Not sure what other blow dryers Vidal Sasson has,</li>
            <li> but still you&#x27;d expect a little longer life for a product.</li>
            <li> but it was a little too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> It was missing the little attachment.</li>
            <li> i have used it almost everyday and havent had that issue yet and had it for a month.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a heavy user...</li>
            <li> heavy plastic smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or noisy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and is priced well under $15.</li>
            <li> I have had the diffuser to come off a few times, but it was because of the angle I was holding it against my head.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they get freaked out by the loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it was not so heavy</li>
            <li> (dog chewed through the cord in quite a few spots and had to get a replacement )</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and isn&#x27;t damaging.</li>
            <li> (I tend to buy the least expensive ones, so maybe this is why they stop working so fast).</li>
            <li> its down past my butt)</li>
            <li> Now I can get the job done in about half the time!</li>
            <li> and i saw in some of the other reviews that its hard to keep the dryer on b/c</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this hair dryer to replace an older model Vidal Sassoon, however was greatly disappointed with the difusser as the fingers are not as long</li>
            <li> The cord is stiff and plasticky.</li>
            <li> It snaps in place very firmly and is just one piece, no easily breakable parts.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been much healthier and I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since getting this.   </li>
            <li> I owned dryers in the past with a slip on diffusor attachment, which eventually broke.  </li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> Not sure I would recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> No more Vidal Sasson for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will keep it since I was set on getting one with the ionizer.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to use it this past weekend.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Of course, that was past</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, by the time I actually took it out to use it, my return window had expired so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> hair is thick, heavy and curly.</li>
            <li> but.... not really sure how well the diffuser will hold up.</li>
            <li> I use the defuser everyday!</li>
            <li> The dryer isn&#x27;t very heavy</li>
            <li> the larger attachment is totally USELESS unless you have a head at least the size of a watermelon.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is a little weak.</li>
            <li> I expected something similar to the hair dryer at the salon and was disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> The dryer works well, but the diffuser hardly diffuses the hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than having a poor stream of air to dry your hair!</li>
            <li> We bought it late December</li>
            <li> I only used the diffuser once and found it to be a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than the one I had and its size makes it awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Too big &amp; awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> and it blows only cold air.</li>
            <li> Only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> It now only blows cold air.  </li>
            <li> but it would still put out heat, which is totally opposite of any of the others that have gone bad in the past.</li>
            <li> It takes me 15 minutes to blow dry my hair now, and for someone with incredibly thin, shoulder length hair, that&#x27;s an absurd amount of time.</li>
            <li> It was no better or worse than any hair dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad run.  </li>
            <li> Complete crap.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of very thick hair and this always did the job and well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair( I can wrap a pony tail 2 times around my hair</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend to someone with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I constantly turn the dryer off unintentionally while drying my hair because of the placement and it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> But they are getting tired of sharing the hair styling stuff.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed that this dryer doesn&#x27;t have a comb attachments.</li>
            <li> Between Amazon&#x27;s return policy and the poor quality of this product, I will think again before I purchase anything electrical from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair  </li>
            <li> It was broken when it arrived</li>
            <li> And the drying job was sloppy at the end.  </li>
            <li> Unable to consider since has a rubber handle-</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I think we are out of luck.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately the dryer gave out after about 5 months.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found another dryer that it fits</li>
            <li> did what i needed and it wasnt expensive...</li>
            <li> mom doesnt need to buy and expensive dryer anymore</li>
            <li> The dyer in question has lousy air velocity.  </li>
            <li> The heat is very poor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, this hair dryer stopped working after 4 and a half months!</li>
            <li> This dryer has 3 settings for heat, can blast your hair with cold air, comes with 2 attachments, and has two speed settings (low/high).</li>
            <li> I like the three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cold boost.  </li>
            <li> This is just awkward and very difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Usually me can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Broke after one use I was so mad</li>
            <li> Like a very faint fishy smell, I don&#x27;t know, my wife has made no comments about it</li>
            <li> The price paid wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> Just a bad buy.</li>
            <li> some cracks on it make it ugly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way allergic :(  </li>
            <li> but after 2 uses it just stopped working. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> that got to be annoying.</li>
            <li> but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this blow dryer 0 stars - because it is worthless.</li>
            <li> Very bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Drys quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are awful though.</li>
            <li> worst hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible heat transfer.</li>
            <li> Air flow is horrible for the price!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The tip part that hooks onto the end falls off so easily. :(</li>
            <li> Diffuser is way too large to handle drying with ease.  Have had other products with smaller diffuser that got the job done.  This is just awkward and very difficult to use.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get very warm and takes a bit longer to dry my hair with.  Will probably give it to my 12 year old daughter as it will work for her but not for my thick hair.  It&#x27;s very lightweight but the diffuser was difficult to get to stay on.  Not a salon worthy or frequent use dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a thick long hair that will stay wet for days if I dont dry it. It drys quick on two speeds and two temps so you can mix it up. It has two attachments which come in handy. Its also light weight. Its reasonably quiet. Its worth the money...</li>
            <li> Not fast at all- Conair Infinity much better.</li>
            <li> I had an old blow dyer and replaced it with this one. I love the fact that you can choose the speed and whether the air is hot, medium, or cool! I also love the attachments they work great!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my wife. I use it on occasion and it has a strange smell when you first turn it on. Like a very faint fishy smell, I don&#x27;t know, my wife has made no comments about it so maybe I just have mini strokes every time I use it! Other then that it works as it should.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself is pretty much flawless. It has sufficient settings for different needs. Drys quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are awful though.</li>
            <li> These products are the price is cheap, convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Now I like this product.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace a similar dryer that burnt out (as they all seem to do) after about five years. It&#x27;s quite good, and somewhat quieter than my old Conair dryer with the same features and power. The attachments fit well and don&#x27;t fall off or pop off and go careening across the room--always a plus!    I&#x27;ve subtracted a star because of two drawbacks:    - Every dryer this size should have a retractable cord, and this one doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s just no excuse any longer. I know--wrapping the cord around the handle won&#x27;t make my arm fall off, but it&#x27;s not as tidy as a retractable cord.    - It overheats just a little bit too easily. After about three minutes on high, I have to hit the cool air button to bring the temp back down and reset the circuit that prevents the unit from overheating. The circuit resets very quickly, though--you have to run the unit on cool for only about five seconds.    Overall, it&#x27;s a good dryer. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace my previous hair dryer.  The last dryer I had was just a diffusor for curly hair, no attachements.      I was mostly worried that the diffusor attachement would not stay on this dryer well.  I owned dryers in the past with a slip on diffusor attachment, which eventually broke.  This dryer&#x27;s attachments did not disappoint.  It snaps in place very firmly and is just one piece, no easily breakable parts.  In fact, you can just leave the attachment on.</li>
            <li> worst hair dryer ever! no power. even when it&#x27;s on HIGH, it&#x27;s barely powerful enough to make my hair move. i might as well get someone to put there mouth close to my head and blow. wish i still had the box, i&#x27;d send it right back. what a rip off. they have the nerve to use the word \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; in the name, what a joke.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer 9 years ago and it finally died. I used it every day, and I&#x27;m impressed that it lasted this long. I&#x27;ve been looking in stores for a comparable one, but haven&#x27;t found one, yet. Most of the ones I tried blow too much air when using the diffuser, which defeats the purpose. I am glad this hair dryer is still available, and at such a good price. Since I use a hair dryer every day, I will have to go to the store and buy one to use until this one arrives on Wednesday. Highly recommend this dryer. Just wish it was ion/tourmaline. I know those are better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Unable to consider since has a rubber handle- I&#x27;m way allergic :(  Though the product has a good name &amp; the price is right, there is no option for a different handle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dryer! It usually takes me 45- 1 hour to blow dry my thick hair but it only took me 20 minutes with this holy item😂&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a high end hair dryer but it gets the job done and it&#x27;s perfect for me</li>
            <li> I went to visit my mother and she had a Vidal Sasson turbo 1875 watt dryer (not this model), it was fast and I was impressed with how fast it dryed my massive amount of thick hair. I go online and buy a Vidal Sasson turbo right away but when I get it the only thing \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; about it is the word on the box. This is not faster than my current dryer at home with the same 1875 watts. There are 2 speeds and 3 heat settings like it says but no turbo button like I expected. Perhaps the HIGH setting is supposed to be the turbo setting, but it doesn&#x27;t say that and it doesn&#x27;t feel like that.  It&#x27;s not a bad hair dryer but the reason for the lower rating is it&#x27;s just not what I signed up for.  Update: After giving this dryer a chance for a month I found that it has another down side - the speed and heat slider buttons are right under where your fingers go. I constantly turn the dryer off unintentionally while drying my hair because of the placement and it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> this diffuser is perfect to me. it has high heat, low heat, cold, and warm. and i saw in some of the other reviews that its hard to keep the dryer on b/c the buttons are on the handle. that isnt a big deal to me. i have used it almost everyday and havent had that issue yet and had it for a month. i love it.</li>
            <li> First dryer to ever last me 5 years! I&#x27;ve purchased many dryers over time, only to have them die in about a year and some even within the first month. I&#x27;ve used this dryer daily on my long, thick hair and it just kept on going.  I just recently had to purchase a new one because the blower went out on it but it would still put out heat, which is totally opposite of any of the others that have gone bad in the past. I absolutely love this dryer and would reccommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. I love the diffuser extension with fingers.  With a little mousse, I can create a great look with just this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Powerful, relatively quiet and a great price all combine to make this a must buy if you want a really fast hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for a few years and loved it so when it died, I wanted to replace it with the same thing.  We bought it late December and it already died.  It blows air but is no longer hot.  We are outside of the 30 day return window and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a product guarantee so unfortunately I think we are out of luck.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was great when it worked... but after 2 uses it just stopped working. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and loves it.  She has had this dryer before, worn it out in about 4 years, and had to have another just like it.  Found this one at Amazon.com at an excellent price.  Was shipped really fast and was exactly what she ordered.  The perfect hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a Vidal Sasson dryer at her house and my hair always looks better after I use it.  So, I thought what the heck, and sure enough I don&#x27;t know the reason buy my hair is more manageable using this dryer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the hair dryer for my wife as a replacement to an old one that broke. It took a few days to arrive but when we received it, my wife was very impressed with the hair dryer. Strong blower and it produced very good heat. The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was the high pitched sound the blower makes.</li>
            <li> I still use it after I&#x27;ve had it for three years.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this hair dryer. Whenever anyone stayed for a visit they would ask to borrow it because they all knew how great it was. I had ot for 7 or 8 YEARS before it finally quit on me. I have a LOT of very thick hair and this always did the job and well. The attachments helped, allowing me to wear my hair curly or straighten it out. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a stronger fan.</li>
            <li> This is good to have, for those who get frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I would like but works ok</li>
            <li> I love the 3 heat settings! The diffuser works great!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON&#x27;S BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVE&#x27;S IT. HE SAY&#x27;S IT WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> excellent very good hair dryer</li>
            <li> Love! For the price I did not expect much, But its am amazing blow dryer. Light weight, And the heat changes is definitely a huge plus. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and according to her it is perfect!! She&#x27;s been using it for a wile and still in great conditions.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about a give to your wife, this will work.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!!</li>
            <li> No different than any other dryer... works fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you bought it for. No frills, no bells or whistles. It&#x27;s not the quietest or the hottest (temp wise)dryer around, but for the price, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too noisy, it has strong air velocity.  It&#x27;s ergonomic.  It has a button to stop the heat so you don&#x27;t have to use the slide switch to lower heat temporarily.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Works like most good blow dryers. Was impressed with the delivery time</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time, nice wide opening for air flow.</li>
            <li> This came today and it clearly has some defects in the plastic on the handle.  It looks like the plastic as cracks.  I also thought this was new, but it clearly looked like it was in a package that had been previously opened as it had scotch tape on the box.  I only gave it two stars because it worked when I plugged it in.  I hope it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, I used it for it&#x27;s diffuser. It stopped working 6 months later, but I dropped it several times, so it may have been my fault.</li>
            <li> This is a good hairdyer ive had 2 both for a couple of years and use it once to sometimes twice a day. It has three heat settings which is nice and 3 attachments including a difuser which is my best friend.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! It is not extremely heavy and has a lot of different modes on it which is also great!</li>
            <li> cheaply made but works OK</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVED this hair dryer.  The diffuser is HUGE and that was my favorite part... unfortunately the dryer gave out after about 5 months.  Now I&#x27;m a heavy user... I travel so the dryer has gone through many airports which could have caused issues?  Not sure but the dryer gave out on me, and I&#x27;m talking sparks flying!!!  The diffuser was awesome but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found another dryer that it fits so it&#x27;s no longer of any use to me.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom (but we both use it) and it works great! It has three heat settings, and a low or high setting which is great. Not to mention I have curly hair so the defusser helps out alot! It&#x27;s a great buy especailly for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> For the price paid it works well..three blowing speeds and you can choose weather you want it to be hot,warm or cool..it&#x27;s light but little bit bulky..and the thing i dislike the most about this item is this smell when it&#x27;s turned on..i hope it will dissapear as time passes</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer several years ago and it finally died yesterday. Dried my thick wavy hair fairly well, but left it somewhat frizzy. This could be partially the operator&#x27;s fault as I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to hair products. I do spray It&#x27;s a Ten conditioners in my hair prior to drying. I only used the diffuser once and found it to be a bit awkward. Also found myself turning the dryer off multiple times by accident- that got to be annoying. Am replacing this dryer with a Revlon tourmaline ionic dryer. Reviews looked good.</li>
            <li> heavy plastic smell. Sometimes doesn&#x27;t work well.   Good thing is that one can choose between different speed and temperature of the flow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer and functions. Not the best hair dryer but it does the job and dries my hair.  I&#x27;ve used better, quieter ones, but it was cheap and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered the blow dryer because it was the cheapest and would have to say it is a good blow dryer for the price and it came 5 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Whether I use it with the diffuser to keep my curls or use it with a round brush to straighten my hair, this dryer is fast!</li>
            <li> This is an OK hair dryer...didn&#x27;t dry any faster then my other blow dryer, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful hairdryer.  Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> not a high volume air dryer</li>
            <li> The cords very short but it worked well.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer, I needed a diffuser, and this one has a large one. It&#x27;s heavier than other dryers and takes up more space. But it works well. Note, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair so I don&#x27;t have to hold it up for very long, if you do, you might prefer a lighter model.</li>
            <li> Okay. I have had many hair driers throughout the years. This one is just ok. It does not have enough power to quickly dry my extremely curly hair. I would have preferred one with more power.</li>
            <li> This dryer is loud. It dries OK, but just OK. Nothing special here.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! Continues to be a great performer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend spent hours on my Amazon account looking for a new blowdryer, pretty sure she loves it.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife just used this today for the first time. It shipped very fast. She said it was a lot lighter than her previous dryer and she dried her really long, thick hair in 10 minutes. She used the diffuser attachment and her hair turned out great. She got a lot more curl using the diffuser than just letting it air dry. She used it on the low setting at medium heat. It usually takes her 30 minutes to dry her hair. She said she actually enjoyed it. The noise was a bit more high pitched than her previous dryer. But, hey its a blow dryer its not supposed to be quiet, its supposed to dry your hair. She also liked the grip on the nozzle. She said that would come in handy for when she blow dries her hair straight and she won&#x27;t have to worry about burning her hands. The concentrator attachment can be placed vertically or horizontally and she thought that was a big plus. Both the attachments were easy to put on and take off. Overall, a great blow dryer at a great price :)</li>
            <li> simple, effective, inexpensive. not too much i can say about a hair dryer, besides it works as it should, and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Is a very fast dryer, seems to put out more heat and faster than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer to dry hair.  I purchased this dryer to solely use with the Vapper I had just purchased through Amazon. I love the design, it&#x27;s an excellent dryer.  (With the Vapper, the dryer runs 15 minutes at a time, I&#x27;ve been using it alot and no problems at all.)  Next time I would buy a higher wattage dryer for the Vapper, but this was an oversight on my part and no reflection at all on the mfgr.</li>
            <li> This does the job of basic hairdrying so I am pleased with it from that aspect - but I received my own in slightly damaged condition, with some of the silver scrunched up. I think it may peel eventually. I wasnt up to the hassle of returning it, and it does do my basic tasks notwithstanding, so I have kept it.</li>
            <li> It does its job well, definitely gets very hot on hot setting and mildly cool on cool setting so that&#x27;s good. I wish the attachments were made of higher quality material, though. I exclusively use the attachments with this blow dryer because I have curly hair and a regular blast of air makes my hair poof. I blow dry my hair once or twice per week, and only for 15 mins to prevent over-drying my hair and creating heat damage. Even with this limited use, the park to the plastic on the attachments that clips to the dryer is melted and warped. It no longer clips in, I have to just balance it in the right place and hold it while I blow dry. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> This takes quite a while to dry my hair - it is very thick so for those with thinner hair it would probably be better, but its not powerful enough for me. However, for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Before this blow dryer I had a very cheap, compound one with no attachments. I have very thick and long hair, and it wasn&#x27;t near as powerful as I needed. This blow dryer is SUPER powerful, and I love how you can adjust the heat and how powerful it is. The cool blast button also works great, setting any style nicely.  The diffuser is AMAZING, adding volume and curl, if you want it. My hair is naturally wavy, so when I add some moussse, I can get great waviness :) The concentrator works good with a big round brush, and now I usually style my hair that way.   Even without any attachments on, it adds a TON of volume, which I love. Even though I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s usually limp and slippy, and falls flat, and I can hardly even get it to stay in a ponytail. When I blow dry using this, my hair is absolutely gigantic (but if you don&#x27;t want your hair to be big like that, you can brush it out some).   My hair has been much healthier and I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since getting this.   Wonderful product for the money! ;)</li>
            <li> I have 5 daughters.  They all have to share many things.  But they are getting tired of sharing the hair styling stuff.  So this daughter was happy when she got her Fast Dry Turbo Dryer.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this hair dryer to replace an older model Vidal Sassoon, however was greatly disappointed with the difusser as the fingers are not as long and I can not get the volume I need.  I use my old one with duct tape..</li>
            <li> I AM TOTALLY PLEASED with this dryer. The diffuser is a MUST for my type of hair. The dryer is lightweight yet sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really love this dryer, easy to use can change to infuser easily!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She absolutely loves it.  It dries her hair very quickly and she was pleasantly surprised by the diffuser being included. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Am been used for a week works great and I love it☺☺☺</li>
            <li> Great price ... Works great too!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a year now, use it every 2 or 3 days and am very happy with it. It&#x27;s not too heavy or noisy. I have naturally curly hair so sometimes I use the defuser to fluff out the curls and sometimes I blow my hair straight. I was a hair stylist for 28 years in my earlier life and have had quite a few blowers, this one is just as good as the professional ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This dryer is lightweight and easy to handle. It worked great for a year then stopped working. Now it will only blow cold air so it takes a LONG time to get my hair dry (and my hair is pretty thin). The attachment pops of easily if you&#x27;re not careful and if you have it on the hottest setting it&#x27;s too hot to put back on without hurting your hands. All in all it&#x27;s a very good, normal dryer. I just wished it would&#x27;ve lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. My hair was silky and soft after blow drying. Love it. Keeping it forever. Thank you..so pleased. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This is more than what my daughter says she wants for Xmas(2011) so I know she will be very happy to see the attachments as well.  The item came in a timely fashion and packed appropriately.  I am sure she will be more than pleased when she opens her gift on Xmas.</li>
            <li> Very nice hairdryer with 3 settings for heat or cool air. Easy to handle and very efficient. I am quite satisfied!</li>
            <li> looks good in the pic but the actual product is roughly made, and the package has holes on it, as if it&#x27;s a product some other customer returned &gt;:/</li>
            <li> I use this dryer to diffuse my hair and it is awesome! It works quick and leaves my hair with more curl definition and bouncy. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> There not much really to say, apart from its positives are the power, however  not very good for styling. Terrible!</li>
            <li> The actual functions of this blow dryer were great, but stopped working after about 2-3 months.  I feel that a blow dryer should last for longer than that time period and because of that, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> The dryer works well, but the diffuser hardly diffuses the hair at all.  The air still comes through almost directly which defeats the purpose of it.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> great hair dryer, several temperatures, several settings for power, just what i needed and for a great price - a great product!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!! It works great on my fine, thin hair. I even bought a few extra in case one breaks! LOVE IT! Only gave 4 stars because it is a bit loud when on the high setting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost I think 6 months and it is great.  Not too heavy, does a great job of drying my hair.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> My trusty Vidal Sasson VS750 Quiet Style hair dryer finally broke after 14 years of use.  The motor would not hardly work and wouldn&#x27;t blow air anymore inspite of the fact that it still got nice and war on high.  I thought I would try another VS product but alas this one was too strong and not warm at all.  It is possible I got a defective one but I have found another hair dryer that is almost the same as my old VS 750 and I only paid $5.00 more for it.  So thank you Vidal Sasson for all those years of good product but I have had to move on.  For those who have very thick hair, this hair dryer on high will more than likely be what you are looking for if in fact the hair dryer doesn&#x27;t actually have a high pitched whine on high power.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful Amazon.com customer and rarely have a reason to complain about any of the products they sell. I received this hair dryer six weeks ago; it died today and per Amazon policies I cannot get a refund. I used it maybe 4 - 5 times a week. Most hair dryers last a few years...this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought that doesn&#x27;t make it to two months. I would definitely recommend a product from any other manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, this hair dryer stopped working after 4 and a half months!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this dryer was mostly plastic, but it&#x27;s operated well for me so far. The price paid wasn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> This is a no-brainer. It works. It isn&#x27;t heavy and is priced well under $15. I actually bought it to use in my hobby shop to dry glue, paint, pottery, and other materials. Happy with it, and it also dries my hair when needed. :) Unless you;re super-picky about hair dryers, this is worth the price. You could put one in each bathroom and feel like you really got a deal!</li>
            <li> Good price for the quality. I liked that it had cold, warm, and hot settings. It also came with 2 attachments that I use regularly. I loved it so much, I bought another one as a gift. It doesn&#x27;t advertise for ion shine. But it definitely makes my hair shiny when I use the small attachment and roller brush.</li>
            <li> this works soooo good thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this product several months ago and the blow dryer quit working;  It wasn&#x27;t even a year old.  I bought another one because I&#x27;m so use to it, but if breaks within a year, I&#x27;m sending it back to Amazon in pieces!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy camper when I have to buy 2 in one year because they break so fast.</li>
            <li> I received this item well before time and in perfect condition.  I used to have a dryer with the volumizer attachemnt, but since it stopped working I hadn&#x27;t purchased a dryer with the attachment.  I&#x27;m glad I got this because I have extra fine hair and it helps to make my hair look as if it&#x27;s not limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Since i have curly hair, i mostly use the diffuser and it works great on my hair it doesnt frizz up during the day and its a really great price i would definetly recommend</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  THANKS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas an now she thinks that her hair always looks fabulous get one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an affordable hair dryer with a diffuser attachment for my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;This one fit the bill. It&#x27;s easy for her to use and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Love the new hair dryer and loved the price. The accessories work well.  Not super quiet but no louder than my old one which was 10 years old.  Would reccommend.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing dryer for the money.  Sturdy, fast, and a great price. I really do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has been working well for me the last couple of years. Light weight and powerful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t receive items from Amazon that disappoint me but this had a cracked handle. It works fine so I&#x27;m keeping it. The warm cycle gets hot enough to do any job so I haven&#x27;t even tried the hot cycle and cool does blow cool air. I&#x27;m hoping the handle doesn&#x27;t split apart and I get some use out of dryer.</li>
            <li> I used a diffuser when I was in my 20&#x27;s it is nice to be able to use it again. My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this to actually dry my hair.  But, i use it to heat up and apply my jamberry nail shields.  It works wonderfully for that.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too loud, as I know my mothers old hair dryer was very loud.  I think it works great!</li>
            <li> Ater failing to find a diffuser that fit my hair dryer I found this and gave it a try.  I love it and have gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I needed a diffuser for curly hair.....it is powerful, and works well.  Very happy with it, and would recommend for purchase</li>
            <li> First I had gone to my local Target to buy a new blowdryer when my old one died.  I wanted a Vidal Sasson which they did not carry.  So I found this one on Amazon and I am very happy with it.  It is light weight and I really like the gripper handle.</li>
            <li> No complains so far, it dries my hair quickly (I have straight long thin hair) hot enough when I want to curl up my stubborn straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for at least 10 years and it finally died half way through drying the other day. I loved this dryer. It dried my hair very quickly. It blows very hot air but the device it self doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle which I loved. The rubber grip on the barrel is great for those hard to reach areas on the top and back of your head. You can hold it there and your hand never gets hot. As of about a year ago I started using the concentrator and it worked perfectly every time. It fit snug enough that it never once popped off but loose enough in the grooves to be able to turn to get the right angle without having to remove it during drying. I bought a new dryer 2 days ago but It&#x27;s just not the same. I will be returning the new one and will be ordering another of these. I just assumed they didn&#x27;t make them anymore since it was more than 10 years old. And don&#x27;t let the price fool you. The new dryer I bought cost twice this much and doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite hair dryers on the market right now. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but the attachments do go flying off sometimes when I&#x27;m vigorously drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product. Its extremely loud when used on high. Not sure I would recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works well, attachments are great, and it&#x27;s not super noisy! I would rec</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife to replace her old hair dryer. Poor quality. Terrible heat transfer. Move on to a different product, otherwise you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li> It is big and bulky, but most hand held dryers are. The barrel gets hot, but the rubber band around it helps protect your hand. The attachments go on easily, and stay on. I have had the diffuser to come off a few times, but it was because of the angle I was holding it against my head. It is a little loud, but so are other hair dryers. I&#x27;ve had louder ones. When on high, the air blows really strong - which is good. When using the diffuser I use the low setting and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy (I have naturally curly hair). It usually takes about 5 minutes to dry my hair - which is great.</li>
            <li> My daughter In law has long thick hair and this does the trick in minimal.  Would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for about 2 weeks before it totally broke down on me.  I could only use the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; settings and it smelled like burning plastic.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It went in the garbage and I went to Target to get a new dryer, that cost more but doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s going to explode.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s big and the nozzle isn&#x27;t sharp enough so I can&#x27;t travel with it and at home it&#x27;s not versatile enough.</li>
            <li> This dryer is OK. It&#x27;s light and has some power but the nozzle is too wide for me and I don&#x27;t like the shape of the concentrator attachment, generally I don&#x27;t get involved with attachments, I don&#x27;t have the time or the motivation. I want the item to meet my needs &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; . This is great as a back up dryer, for me.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great. Has good heat with 3 strengths. I&#x27;ve only had this 2-3 weeks but so far it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job. I have curly hair and only have used it with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> works wonders! goes hot,, goes cold. putting the attachments on are a LITTLE tricky but its nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> the larger attachment is totally USELESS unless you have a head at least the size of a watermelon.  I do like all the settings it has, that was my main reason for buying it &amp; I looked at the attachments as a bonus......a bonus that didn&#x27;t work for me though  well, when my husband&#x27;s blow dryer quit I ordered this one for him, I told him he would like it alot better &amp; he does...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have great luck with this dryer. I also had a hard time with the attachments not staying on, and then recently the heating element must have burnt out because it quit producing hot air while I was in the middle of drying. Granted, it&#x27;s not the most expensive and it did last me about a year, but I have had dryers in the past last much longer with no problems. I would say pay the extra $10 and get something a little nicer, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. I have long hair and it thick. What took hours to dry is cut in half with this dryer. Fasst shipping</li>
            <li> This dryer is easy to gold and works quite well. The handle makes it easy t handle. It&amp;#34;s so  good, I bought 2</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. I&#x27;ve used to at least 10 times now and the diffuser is alot larger than what I thought it was going to be which is a plus for me. Gets my hair dry faster than expected as well and I never have frizz. My sisters are trying to steal it from me now.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a hair dryer that burned up.  My husband and I both use it--he cleans out his razor every day and then dries it.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever hair dryer (I&#x27;m 22)... And I really like this hair dryer. It works really well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this blow dryer is great for diffusing! My only issue with it is that it doesnt come with a comb attachment and doesnt seem to have one that you can buy separately to fit it so when I want to blow dry my hair straight, I have to use a different blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much air flow. It does get hot and it does dry your hair eventually. However, if you have thicker hair, it would take a long time to dry it. I should have paid a little more and gotten something better.</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are very large and are located exactly where my hand holds the handle, so sometimes the controls get moved just from me moving the dryer around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful as my old dryer although both are 1875W. This does not feel like a turbo dryer. But it&#x27;s cheap and, while a bit slow, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and fine. If you&#x27;ve got thick or long hair, you may want to get a more robust one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  After reading other reviews, I thought this dryer sounded great. But this does not dry may hair very fast at all. It does have a good diffuser attachment. I would call it an average blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is great for me! My hair is very low maintenance, so this hair dryer does the trick in drying it and styling my bangs. I haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser yet, but I don&#x27;t think I really need it since I have very straight hair. I&#x27;ll give it a try to create a beachy look and update my post then. But for now, it does what it needs to do, and its a very good price!</li>
            <li> It says Vidal Sasson, but you should never buy&lt;br /&gt;this if you want a fancy fast dry dryer. It looks awfully&lt;br /&gt;cheap (smells so much of plastic) and does not dry fast.</li>
            <li> I just bought this hair dryer from Amazon in May of this year. It stopped working tonight. I would think a hair dryer would last more than 7 months. Ridiculous. No more Vidal Sasson for me.</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING Turbo about this hair dryer. You definitely get what you pay for. I should have known better to buy a $15 hair dryer. So, it&#x27;s my own fault. I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, I just went to the store and bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely loud. The cord is stiff and plasticky. There&#x27;s no power to it. Even on the highest setting, someone could probably blow in to my hair with more umph!&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra few dollars and choose a better one.</li>
            <li> Great product.  When you first look at it you might think it is cracked back the lines are part of the design.  Exceeds my wife&#x27;s expectation at a great price.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these hair dryers are the bomb...had the EXACT same model for over 10 years (2005 to 2015, only the font used to print &amp;#34;Vidal Sasson&amp;#34; on the body is a bit different) until it finally died on us! However, it performed flawlessly (problem free, powerful blow-drying, accurate and functional heat-control, infuser works like one should) until the end and that was with almost daily use by 1 to 4 users in the home. When it gave-up the ghost, I was ecstatic to see the same model was STILL available 10 years later, and that certainly says something about how well it&#x27;s made and how popular it is amongst users. &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix it if it&#x27;s not broken&amp;#34; I guess applies to its ongoing design and quality. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a hair-dryer that works as advertised and will last a LONG while...not needing to be replaced after just a year or two of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Dries fast. Diffuser is just ok. Good inexpensive hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer- dries my hair quickly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bigger than the one I had and its size makes it awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in August of 2011 and I still use it almost every day without any problems. I love that it has the option of the cold shot button, I have used this to dry my lashes after applying mascara, to dry my nails and to set my hairstyle after drying it. :)</li>
            <li> I was annoyed that this dryer doesn&#x27;t have a comb attachments. I really need the comb that fits, and I have no use for the other items.</li>
            <li> I have had other turbo dryers, and this one does not compare. It is not very powerful and it took me a long time to dry my hair. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE HAD NO COMPLAINTS...&lt;br /&gt;  ON PRODUCT AND DELIVERY......ME ( HER M0M ) WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer.  I bought it for my vacation home, and everyone who uses it asks me where I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Simple answer, AMAZON prime.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer but it was a little too heavy for me.  I am almost 50 and starting to develop bursitis, in addition to symptoms of carpal tunnel.  It works well and seems to hold up well, but I have to keep switching arms because of the weight.  I&#x27;m sure I would have liked this dryer when younger (and non-achy), because it has various options for heat and air flow.  One major complaint is that the diffuser did not stay attached at all - almost as if a defective product, but I really have no need for a diffuser so not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for individuals who have achy joints I would suggest using a smaller and lighter hairdryer (such as a traveling mini hair dryer) which still produces sufficient air flow and hair-drying capacity.  The only problem I have with the minis is that they don&#x27;t last long and I have to keep rebuying them every year (I tend to buy the least expensive ones, so maybe this is why they stop working so fast).</li>
            <li> fr a cheap hairdryer this is great. I tried more expensive ones that sucked. I figured I&#x27;d get a cheap one that worked and if I need to replace it later, no big loss.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be the dryer I could take to the gym to dry my hair in a hurry before work.  It&#x27;s become the dryer that I keep at home when I have taken a shower and don&#x27;t have anywhere to be for awhile.  I wish I would have spent a little more for a more powerful one.</li>
            <li> The dryer was a Christmas gift. The item shipped in plenty of time before I needed it. My daughter loves it! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Air flow is horrible for the price! I can get a much cheaper hair dryer with more air flow than this. Also the attachments do not work well. I expected something similar to the hair dryer at the salon and was disappointed with this one. Move on to another one!</li>
            <li> gift for daughter, she says it works great for her long hair</li>
            <li> I like it, but thought it would blow harder then it does, works though!!</li>
            <li> I lo9ve love love this blow dryer, love the price too!!! I &#x27;m going to get one for my friend for Christmas!</li>
            <li> There is nothing turbo about it, but other than that, it does what it says on the box. A good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is not noisy and the settings supply adequate heat.  The dryer is somewhat cumbersome in that the cord does not retract into the appliance and does dangle when you are using it and takes up some storage room in a drawer or cabinet</li>
            <li> Dries my hair faster than any other dryer I have used so far, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The drier itself is good, the settings work as advertised. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I&#x27;m used to but it gets the job done. The diffuser itself is big. It&#x27;s really hard to use.</li>
            <li> its more for a personal use , not for professional use</li>
            <li> I turned on the hair dryer and within 30 seconds it became so hot that it was smoking and the unit became very hot. My husband is an electrician and jumped over to unplug it. When we turned it over to look in the back it was glowing red and smelled of melting plastic. It remained very hot for some time. I returned this defective unit and did not reorder.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet, powerful, and I like the attachments. Haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with dryers over the last few years so I thought I would try this brand. Still have a Vidal Sassoon from fifteen years ago that has lasted through multiple other dryers that have quit on me, so hopefully this one will do the same!</li>
            <li> this hair dryer arrived about a week late.&lt;br /&gt;i needed a new hair dryer and they were out of this particular one at target.&lt;br /&gt;amazon prime said \\&quot;want it delivered by.....\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;what a joke.  amazon used to be PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m noticing more and more errors.&lt;br /&gt;anyways, after a 12 day vacation, i returned to find this on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a long time since i&#x27;ve had a hair dryer that really blows 1875, like it says.&lt;br /&gt;but this one does.  i have long thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;cuts my drying time down from 22 minutes to 10, without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer because after reading the first review (Bryan Carey), I was under the impression it had an ionizer, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;This model does NOT have an ionizer, so his review may be of a different model. Not sure if I will keep it since I was set on getting one with the ionizer. I have not used the dryer except to plug in and see if it worked. It may be a good dryer, but do not be misled by the review that states it has the ionizer. Because the review was misleading, I rated it low simply because it was not what I wanted. I should have gone by the product description and not relied so much on the review.</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine? It&#x27;s a blow dryer, so i can&#x27;t tell if it really doesn&#x27;t do the job. As for the diffuser, it works okay i guess too.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works so for that I give it 3 stars.  It is light weight and I do count that as a plus.  Having said that, it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as powerful as my older 1875W hairdryer.  It takes me longer to dry my hair with this one...why?  Not a clue but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer 6 to 10 years ago (can&#x27;t remember for sure) and it finally went out on me last week.  We used it about three times a week.  Personally I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad run.  Still, I probably won&#x27;t be replacing it with the same model.  The dryer was a pretty good dryer, but it just didn&#x27;t fit well for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Drys fast&lt;br /&gt; - I have curly hair so I like the option to diffuse it on low with hot heat or blow it straight on high with medium heat.&lt;br /&gt; - Lasted longer than many dryers do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - The barrel gets really hot.  When I use the diffuser, I tend to hold the barrel to style my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t do that with this dryer because the barrel gets way too hot, even with the black rubber part protecting it.  Most of the time I just let my hair air dry because this bugged me so much.&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s loud.  I didn&#x27;t care so much when I got it, but since then we&#x27;ve had 3 daughters and I use it to dry their little heads too.  Unfortunately, they get freaked out by the loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s about the long and short of it.  I&#x27;m planning to replace this dryer with something that has the same features, but is quieter.  I also want something ionic just to see if it helps with my natural curly frizz...we shall see.  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday..works well with my naturally curly hair!  I would recommend this dryer to anyone!  Very Nice and I will buy another one again</li>
            <li> Very good for the price ...</li>
            <li> Bar none, this Vidal Sassoon hair dryer is the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m quite picky about my dryers and this model (VS505) offers everything. Cold shot, warm &amp; hot setting. It also offers the different speeds. I like the air flow. Nothing worse than having a poor stream of air to dry your hair! I haven&#x27;t really used the attachments so I won&#x27;t comment on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular dryer lasts a good long time too! Some brands conk out after a year or so and the Vidal Sassoon brand is one you can trust. I have a duplicate Vidal Sassoon VS505 in my closet just waiting incase my current one ever decides to peter out on me! I&#x27;ve tried others and they&#x27;re not the same!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing my naturally curly hair more, and was told to use a diffuser dryer to maintain my curls without frizz. I read the reviews on this product and decided to get it. It arrived quickly, but wasn&#x27;t surely packaged, seemed loose enough where stuff was shaking inside. Anyway, I decided to use it this past weekend. The diffuser cup is wayyy big, and the dryer even on the lowest setting is very loud..I know the details said its lightweight, but geez talk about real plastic, it seems if I hold it too hard in my hand it will break. Nevertheless I am keeping it, as it gets the job done. Will see how long it lasts before dying.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife over six months ago and no complains she really likes it a lot. I don&#x27;t know much about it but she does with all the accessories</li>
            <li> did what i needed and it wasnt expensive... good buy&lt;br /&gt;my mom doesnt need to buy and expensive dryer anymore</li>
            <li> It looks a little bit poor quality, like the plastic parts are a little rough, but it&#x27;s very powerful, you can regulate the speed and the temperature. I use the diffusor for initial dry blowing and giving some volume to the hair, and then the straightening attachment for styling.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite noisy when on high power, I feel like all my neighbors can hear it, but it takes me just 5 minutes to be done with my hair, which is great because I hate spending too much time in front of the mirror with the dryer. I guess the ionizing thing works, because I&#x27;ve never had my hair look frizzy with electricity since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than what I was used to, and was a bit clumsy to use at first, but I got used to it quite soon, and I love it now.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy and used to take me 15-20 minutes to dry using my old hair dryer. Now I can get the job done in about half the time! This dryer is HOT, I&#x27;m not sure I would use it every day but once or twice a week is all I need since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. Several heat settings to choose from and you can use a lower temp if you want. I don&#x27;t use the attachments so I can&#x27;t speak to those, but the dryer itself is fabulous. For me it was worth the money, I know it will get years of use.</li>
            <li> Too big &amp; awkward to use.  I was replacing my 1875W Vidal Sassoon dryer that I had for years, but this doesn&#x27;t have the same &amp;#34;blowing&amp;#34; power. kept it as a back up in my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I first used it, great temperature and speeds. It dried my hair so quickly. Unfortunately, it no longer blows anything other than cool air. It was also a lot noisier than I expected.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she says that it works very well.  Please keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS505 1875W Fast Dry Turbo Dryer works well.&lt;br /&gt;my guest are very pleased with its even flow and drying speeds...</li>
            <li> The  Vidal Sassoon Fast Dry Turbo Dryer  was well liked and was complimented on&lt;br /&gt;all of the different attachments. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer durable, and has stayed hot for these past at least 8 years. I have lost the attachments along the way. I wish it was not so heavy but that is a great trade off for always being able to count on my hair dryer to do it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. Just as it appears. I have curly hair and am particular about products drying out my hair, or causing frizz. This dryer does a good job. It could have better power, but the blower is pretty strong. The heat controls work as they should. Overall for a lower end dryer with the amenities this offers, I&#x27;ve owned better, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> The heat is very poor. It takes longer to dry out the hair. I am not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The air flow is a little weak. I have thick hair and it takes longer to dry with this particular dryer. I gave it to my daughter and she loves it. The diffuser is perfect for her curly hair. It arrived on time and was packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> nice lightweight, good drying time. Attachments suck and wont stay on</li>
            <li> It was missing the little attachment. Still a great hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Great and it replaced another brand I had. Especially like the Turbo Dryer for keeping the fuzzy hair at bay</li>
            <li> I returned this dryer for a different one because the power was not as described. It does not dry hair fast and is heavy.</li>
            <li> My daughter grew up using an exact Vidal Sasson model that I purchased about 10 years ago. When she left for college she wanted to take my old one and indeed I said no. This was the best hair dryer I had ever had. Fortunately for her I found it on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t beleive it! The exact same model!  I ordered it inmediately and she is excitedly waiting for it. My old one still works perfectly and I truly hope the quality of the product has not changed. (The price, of course, did go up by about $8.00!  lol)</li>
            <li> I am one of the curly hair&#x27;ed girls that need the diffuser when I dry my hair. This dryer has 3 settings for heat, can blast your hair with cold air, comes with 2 attachments, and has two speed settings (low/high). FOR $15!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this dryer for over 7 years until it finally blew out. I&#x27;m buying another one to replace the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With curly hair, I did have issues with the diffuser popping off (ha, this would send me into a RAGE) but I only use the dryer with the diffuser so I just duct taped it on. If you need to take the attachments off and on, this might not be my first choice for a dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have curly hair. So I mainly use this dryer to get the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; out of my hair.</li>
            <li> First hair dryer I have purchased in at least 15 years. What a difference in drying time, came with attachments and fits easily in the same storage area I had for my last hairdryer. Totally happy!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer after  three weeks is the completely fell apart ! Did u ever hear of the saying \\&quot; you get what u pay for\\&quot; ??&lt;br /&gt;Well in this case that applys since I bought a CHEAP hair dryer thats exactly what I got a CHEAP CRAPPY dryer.  To the trash it went!</li>
            <li> The diffuser was easy to click on and I can dry my hair in minutes!! Just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item knowing that my current hair dryer was on it&#x27;s last legs. I wish I had started using it immediately. My dryer finally went out and I started using this product. It did not last but two weeks before it burned out. Of course, that was past it&#x27;s return date. So now I am stuck paying for a product that did not work. Between Amazon&#x27;s return policy and the poor quality of this product, I will think again before I purchase anything electrical from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works really well.  I like using the diffuser.  I had a hard time finding a diffuser to fit my conair dryer, so I just bought this Vidal Sasson set, which was inexpensive and very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is my new best friend! This blow dryer&#x27;s heat is very warm and powerful. The diffuser woks great to make my curls even bouncier and the &amp;#34;cool touch&amp;#34; button really does produce a cool air that will last as long as you want. Price is great, the blow dryer s great, this is just plain GREAT!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I would take a chance on this blow dryer.  Especially for the price.  I won&#x27;t be fooled again into a $20 or less blow dryer.  It is light weight, but it is very loud and it took forever to dry my hair.  And the drying job was sloppy at the end.  I can usually run a straighter over my hair quickly to make it look finished.  I had to spend quite a bit of time with my straighener fixing the mess this blow dryer made of my hair.  It is going back.</li>
            <li> has lasted a really long time.....bought in Dec. 2012 and no problems......would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this several years ago and its held up to the test of time. Works well on my daughter&#x27;s thin hair  (15mins tops)but I have very thick hair( I can wrap a pony tail 2 times around my hair my pony tail is prob about 2 inches thick accross) and very long hair( its down past my butt) my old dryer took a total of an hour and a half on full blast to dry my hair and didn&#x27;t shut off (dog chewed through the cord in quite a few spots and had to get a replacement )this one takes me 2 and a half hours(not including the frequent breaks) to dry my hair on full blast and I have to stop every 20mins because it gets too hot and shuts off. Over all a good hair dryer but I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend to someone with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer...lite weigh ... easy to style your hair with this hair dryer and heats up quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer. I can control the speed and heat separately.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with my dryer works perfect and does its job. Comes with two attachments. And for my curly hair the diffuser works great</li>
            <li> I have ordered this item from Italy and I received it in one week choosing the standard shipment. I ordered it for an international trip. The item is very light and easy portable. It it very functional and fits confortable in your luggage. It works great.</li>
            <li> This is probably the loudest blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It seriously drives me nuts, so I rarely use it. Also, no matter how low the setting, it makes my hair crunchy, which isn&#x27;t a problem I&#x27;ve had before. I use heat protecting spray, so I don&#x27;t get why it happens. The diffuser is wonderful though, and keeps my curls perfect corkscrews!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good I&#x27;m happy with it it does it&#x27;s job it doesn&#x27;t get very hot is the only thing I have with it</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Good diffuser for curly hair, lightweight hairdryer</li>
            <li> Hot temperature weak...direction nozzel does not stay on the dryer...I will go back to Clairol  dryer in the near future.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little more powerful, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect hairdryer for travelling as it&#x27;s really light and has great functionality.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one that broke. Original, same model, lasted at least 5 years. Pricing was OK for 2014.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer, I always use a defuser, the ones that have binders and fit on most dryers break,  It is good to have one that is made for the dryer.  I like having separate settings for the heat and fan, I can have the heat on medium and the fan on high.</li>
            <li> This is a big heavy piece of equipment but it does offer options.  So it all depends on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> It has a loud and high pitched sound. Not a very strong breeze - I could dry my hair quicker by fast walking around the bathroom.</li>
            <li> it has a pretty good power after all , accessories are good , and also the selection of the heat comes in handy</li>
            <li> i love this blow dryer its my fav i dont any other very pleased</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it every day.</li>
            <li> Ver good machine but had trouble attaching the attachments. A little too large on the blow dryer but its Ok.</li>
            <li> Had a hair dryer that took forever to dry my hair. This one is powerful and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for only 6 months, use it once a day. Already, the heating unit has quit working and it blows only cold air. It takes me 15 minutes to blow dry my hair now, and for someone with incredibly thin, shoulder length hair, that&#x27;s an absurd amount of time. Complete crap.</li>
            <li> Seems sufficient enough for a hair dryer. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy, which is why I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I used to use conair hairdryer. the sizes are pretty much same but this one is not as quiet as the conair one. Also, everytime I use it, i smell something burnt. I dont know if it is the plastic part that&#x27;s melting because of heat or my hair..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the diffuser and it works well but the diffuser attachment keeps coming off.  For the price it will do.</li>
            <li> I like the three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cold boost.  Easy grip handle and defuser.  Reminds me of the hair dryers I like in the hotels when I travel.</li>
            <li> Very nice and love the diffuser!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. It isn&#x27;t as powerful as I had expected it to be, but it can pass. There really isn&#x27;t anything turbo about it except for the noise it gives off in high speed.</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER AND ITS ATTACHMENTS ARE A MUST HAVE FOR A BLACK OR MULTIRACIAL NATURALLY  CURLY GIRL! IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AND DOESN&#x27;T SCORCH MY LOCKS!</li>
            <li> It obviously does it&#x27;s job but the power of the dryer is lackluster. Not sure what other blow dryers Vidal Sasson has, but this one has definitely not met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Helen of Troy Jewel Tools hair dryer for the past couple of years, and it was a good hair dryer, but it finally broke and I had to get a replacement  hair dryer FAST. I chose this one because it had a lot of good reviews, and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase at all! The diffusor makes lovely curls (just as good as my old Helen of Troy), and I use it like every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a shrill sound, but it&#x27;s a hairdryer so, oh well. It works, that&#x27;s what matters to me. The power of it isn&#x27;t very much, definitely less than my Helen of Troy, but it doesn&#x27;t take any longer to dry because it&#x27;s SOOO much lighter and I can move it around in my hair faster (if that makes any sense). It was a great buy, and I&#x27;ll probably replace it when and if it breaks in the future (and I&#x27;ve already been using it for a few weeks.).</li>
            <li> It was broken when it arrived and so I have no idea how it ever worked. I did not try this again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t take how loud this dryer is. I was actually getting dizzy with the loud roar next to my ear</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I did not like it. I felt it was not working on my hair and my hair was still frizzy. After getting use to it I think it works very well. I&#x27;m African American with thick hair and on high heat this straightens my hair very well. I use this with straightening elixirs by John Fredia to help eliminate frizz . The attachments are tricky I just duct tape the one I use most. I recommend it I really do. Just have a good round brush, heat protectant and depending on your hair other products to eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this blow dryer 0 stars - because it is worthless. Only blows cold air. Unfortunately, by the time I actually took it out to use it, my return window had expired so I&#x27;m stuck with it. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Could get a little hotter, but I like the attachments and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! Arrived very quickly and is a reliable tool.</li>
            <li> Works great but is a bit larger and bulkier than I expected!</li>
            <li> LOVE it. works great - awesome price. speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver! I love it! Works great, great price and still works!</li>
            <li> Good, it is a recommended supplier since I realize the sending in time and is a good product of excellent quality</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. I love this brand and it is oober cheap and comes in quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular dryer because I needed a diffuser, it was reasonably priced, and it was a good brand. I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think.this is a pretty decent hair dryer. I thought the air would be stronger but it  does the Job. And gets hair dry quicker than other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> This is an average hair dryer.  It comes with two attachments, if you need them.  I like most the fact that you can set the temperature to cool, warm, or hot, as opposed to many dryers, where you need to hold in a button for cool air.  There are various speed settings as well.  It is good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing astounding. It dried my hair and isn&#x27;t damaging. I especially like the option to not use heat. It&#x27;s useful when you have the extra time and want to skip out on heat damage.</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer bit the dust after 10 years of use. This hair dryer is a great replacement. It dries my hair very quickly</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this dryer. It gets to hot and the attachment nozzle you use at the dryer end continously falls off. i called the company/manufacturer &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34;&amp;#34; about the attachment keeps falling off as they are the ones who makes this dryer for Vidal Sasson and was told that it was a discontinued item and was not covered, even though I had just bough it and it had the one year manufacturer defect warranty. I told the ciustomer service that I would be contacting Amazon Customer Service to inform them that they are pushing a product that Amazon sells with manufacturer defects and that they (Helen of Troy Company) were not honoring the product warranty. The rep of the company placed me on hold and went to speak to her supervisor. She returned to the phone and told me that they will be sending me a new attachment for the dryer. I did receive the new attachment and it still falls off every 30 seconds. DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER!!!!</li>
            <li> the dryer works good. well balanced and controls are easy to adjust. I was expecting the high fan speed to put out more volume of air.(turbo)</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser attachment and the short amount of time it takes to dry even the thickest hair. Its not as quite as expected but overall I highly recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> It is an ok hairdryer.  I needed something quick as my present one was going out, and this filled the bill.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly think this dries my hair any faster than any other blow dryer I&#x27;ve had (as it advertises), but it&#x27;s still a good hair dryer. I haven&#x27;t used any of the tools or special features, but it works great for me. I do like that it has an actual &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; switch rather than just the button you have to hold down.</li>
            <li> The switches on this dryer aren&#x27;t perfectly placed...but honestly, I don&#x27;t think they are on ANY dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser is great...really large and with long fingers.  It makes my curly hair look beautiful!  The dryer isn&#x27;t very heavy and I have no problem using it on a daily basis.  I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in December and it only lasted 4 months.  It now only blows cold air.  I will be returning this to the manufacturer for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as my older Vidal Sasson model but gets the job done. Has a nice grip and light weight.</li>
            <li> Big watts, annoying  noise, but mild blow. The handler is made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Great to travel with because someone somewhere in the group will need one.  Usually me can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Attachments are cheap, difficult to snap on and off, crack easily.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer was just not getting hot enough to style and dry my hair. I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for several months and just love it.  It&#x27;s certainly powerful enough and gets nice an hot, makes styling my hair a breeze.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> some cracks on it make it ugly</li>
            <li> I expected more from a product licensed by Vidal Sassoon. The dyer in question has lousy air velocity.  This is not alleviated by using the concentrator attachment which is sized so poorly, it falls right off. I will be returning it. My wife&#x27;s 10 year old Conair is better!</li>
            <li> But the smaller attachment keeps falling off!</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer because I needed a defuser.  I am pleasantly surprised with how lightweight it is, drying your hair for 15 minutes can be tiring! Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it quite often and it works great! It not heavy and its a really good quility for a low price. I recomment it.</li>
            <li> Broke after one use I was so mad cause I paid my money for something that didn&#x27;t even last.  Very bad</li>
            <li> For that perfect hair always!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horribe. It arrived &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; but its had cracks in the hand the outter cap was chipped. Just a bad buy. Its very light weight but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer I chose because of how cheap it was and the good reviews. Works great! I don&#x27;t use all the attachments but LOVE this hairdryer. It will serve me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sender got it to me on time and was extremely happy with the packaging!</li>
            <li> I had to reorder this dryer because the first one was defective, but boy am I glad I persevered and got this.  If you have baby fine hair, but lots of it, you know that the way-too-hot and over-powerful blowers on most dryers these days do nothing more than fry your hair and also create a tangled mess. (They also blow curl out of hair like mine.) This dryer has one genuinely low blower speed and a high setting that is not like standing in back of a jet engine.  It&#x27;s definitely powerful enough to deliver the heat to the roots of the hair but not so powerful as to blow all hope of curl out of the hair at the same time.  And the blower speeds work with all 3 heat settings -- with lots of hair dryers the low heat setting will only work with the low blower and the high heat setting means only the high blower.  With a low, med, and high choice for heat (plus the cold shot), and the ability to use a low speed or high speed with each, this is a very versatile dryer.  The diffuser is a very good one too, with fingers long enough to hold it off from the scalp enough to gather curls and hold them to dry and set.  It clicks into place in a positive fashion too.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Does everything I want! I love this hair dryer! the attachments are easy to put on and remove. Great quality product!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more powerful. Granted I have A LOT of hair but it&#x27;s just pass my shoulders and shouldn&#x27;t take 45 mins to blow dry!!</li>
            <li> its a blow dryer for your hair, air pressure doesn&#x27;t seem strong, but works. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair it will work fo ryou.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the hair dryer a great deal yet, but it has worked fine so far.</li>
            <li> I returned this item....it was too large and heavy to use with one hand, especially when the defuser was attached.recommend</li>
            <li> I got this for Xmas after reading that an 1875W hair dryer would quickly dry your hair without leaving it frizzy. This hair dryer does EXACTLY that. Definitely great for the price.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it is really loud and high pitched.  IT also seems like the heat isn&#x27;t terribly hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my work locker and while it has 1875W like most dryers it seems a bit weak. I mostly use it with the diffuser but it takes much longer to dry my hair than the conair that I have at home. I will probably end up donating this to charity and buying a conair to replace it.</li>
            <li> It was no better or worse than any hair dryer I&#x27;ve had. I do like the different attachments and the speed and heat range.</li>
            <li> dryer is powerful but bulky. the diffuser started to come off by itself after a year. it just died after 18 months of almost daily use. I paid 12.95 here but still you&#x27;d expect a little longer life for a product. will not buy again.</li>
            <li> All and more!!  Terrific...</li>
            <li> I love my new hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Had it not been for the attachments, I would have given this dryer five stars. The hot air is really hot, the cold air is adequately cool, and it&#x27;s adjustable to almost any combination of temperature and air speed/power. It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had. So why did I give it two stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, heavy and curly. I can&#x27;t dry it to a presentable appearance without using the diffuser, and the diffuser and concentrator both pop off the dryer and fly across the room while it&#x27;s in use. No matter how carefully I handle this dryer, I can&#x27;t dry my hair without the diffuser popping off a half dozen times. It isn&#x27;t an overwhelming technological challenge to manufacture a piece of plastic that snaps onto another piece of plastic and stays put under reasonable stress; it&#x27;s accomplished every day and has been for a long time. There is absolutely NO excuse for the manufacture of a dryer with attachments that won&#x27;t stay attached. I can&#x27;t recommend the dryer to anyone who expects to use the attachments.</li>
            <li> The blow Dryer did meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt; I wanted a huge diffuser attachment, and that is what I got. I wanted a powerful  dryer,&lt;br /&gt;and I got the best. In terms of heat 1875 with multiple settings  and the price was also very affordable  I could not get this in no department store. With a few other perks as well.</li>
            <li> Wifes old one wore out. She really liked that hair dryer so I bought two more one as a backup. First one lasted 8 years!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> I got it the same week that I ordered it,the shipping was fast,the price is decent but the product is of really great value.Its light weight and its really easy to adjust the different pieces.One of the best hairdryers that I&#x27;ve owned.This one gets a five star from me</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, I love it. Works great. Love the many choices in the temperature settings.  Heats up fast, curls fast and the curls last.</li>
            <li> I liked the blow dryer and how its light weight. Worked well except its less than a year and it stopped working for no reason.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, great control, love the buttons.... but.... not really sure how well the diffuser will hold up. I attatch and detatch it, you just push it on, easy but don&#x27;t think it will hold up.  We shall see!</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product I would recommend it 100% I use the defuser everyday! if you have long curly hair buy this!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, because it has adjustable heat and speeds, also it is lightweight.  And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> I love it.....it gets the job done really fast, yes I would definitely recommend to a friend! Get it if you have your eyes on it!!</li>
