            <li>I was VERY impressed!!</li>
            <li>Worked as advertised, no pain and the finished product is awesome</li>
            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>It works best leaving it on for 90min-2 hours.</li>
            <li>this is the best numbing ointment out there!  </li>
            <li>advice to you; look for the best price you can get on a 5% Lidocaine product.</li>
            <li>This works great for a bikini wax!</li>
            <li>This worked awesome for getting tattooed on my rib cage.  </li>
            <li>but it was perfectly manageable.</li>
            <li>for best results you have to wrap whatever area</li>
            <li>This was the best investment I made.</li>
            <li>I bought this item so I can get my permanent eyeliner done, it worked very good</li>
            <li>I also will say that the reviews and youtube videos I watched said it worked fully through a 3-4 hr tattoo which i find very surprising</li>
            <li>Works very good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff was incredible.</li>
            <li>But in the end I realize the pain is what makes your tattoo beautiful, but for the squeamish out there looking for an answer to the pain-free tat, don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my case I endured 5 hours of pain for my beautiful piece of artwork.  </li>
            <li>I have no pain win</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>But everything was great packaged great got here before it was suppose to</li>
            <li>If it worked for the two to three hours it claimed, it would have been great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, no complaints there.</li>
            <li>It works great..</li>
            <li>It worked great for me</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>Great for use before tattoo&#x27;s or helping take skin tags off, etc.</li>
            <li>My tattoo looks great and healed well.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great.</li>
            <li>It worked great for 1-1/2 hours before he started feeling anything.</li>
            <li>so I also purchased a bottle of Vaso-Caine numbing spray which also works great</li>
            <li>great-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to go to remove my hair..</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions though!!</li>
            <li>WORKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>So amazing !</li>
            <li>Great product, works good  </li>
            <li>but if it works for him then this is a good product</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>If you need some good skin numbing cream, this is it.</li>
            <li>Anywho... i ordered 4 because it worked so good</li>
            <li>This stuff is good</li>
            <li>but the cream is good and so on.</li>
            <li>Over all I had a great one with it :).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and used it to get a very meaningful tattoo on my foot.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was able to use my NO!NO!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than nothing!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have attempted to use this and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps i did not apply it the correct way, but whatever it is, my first try wasnt that wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I was told and heard by many people that for a full effect it is best to plop it on like cake icing and then to wrap it in saran wrap.</li>
            <li>That being said, it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I have four tattoos and honestly bought this just to see if it worked.</li>
            <li>(I had also read to keep it warm).  </li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work basedon</li>
            <li>I purchased that but refused to use it w/o having some kind of numbing agent.  </li>
            <li>After finding the correct way to use that I ended up loving it.  </li>
            <li>at your own risk but go in expecting pain.</li>
            <li>Was waxing my own bikini so its gonna hurt no matter</li>
            <li>VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>enjoy and good luck</li>
            <li>$20 bucks to ease a great deal of pain if worth it to me.</li>
            <li>so had to sit through my appointment in tremendous pain!!</li>
            <li>It was alot easier to spread so works great for large areas.</li>
            <li>and I was pain free!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;its not for sure for tatoo</li>
            <li>ok reading everyone else reviews</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know what this cream would be good for but it does not numb the area of the skin as described it</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this, wasn&#x27;t expecting a gel.</li>
            <li>purchased 4 tubes from another website and will be buying more because one tube will cover both of my lower legs with cream to spare.  </li>
            <li>My thighs however require more cream</li>
            <li>so I will be ordering more of this.  </li>
            <li>this time it was more like a gel</li>
            <li>but nothing more than before.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li>WWWWAAAAYYYY better than tattoo soothe, and cheaper too.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for hair removal and it made the process so much more bareable.  </li>
            <li>I received the white cream and it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li>Make sure you wear gloves</li>
            <li>I plan on buying it again and applying it in a more cake frosting manner to see if I will get a better/longer effect.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Straight away I could feel him touching me when he was prepping the area</li>
            <li>I love this product for when I get tattoos.</li>
            <li>The longer it sits the better.</li>
            <li>Lidocream was also more gel-like than</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know if it works or not; maybe it just works better on some.  </li>
            <li>I will definetaly buy more, &amp; recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>Be sure to compare the price per gram and any S&amp;H charges when comparing prodcuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vic</li>
            <li>Why endure more pain than you have to and spend money on more sessions?:-p  </li>
            <li>My suggestion is if you get the gel stuff... use MORE than you would the cream, wrap it, and wait ATLEAST 1.5 hrs- 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>2hrs :)</li>
            <li>I was able to continue with the session without stopping.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to use this cream which I have to tell you a trick you must make sure after you apply this cream</li>
            <li>Ladies go get a painless brazilian :)</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply the cream liberally.</li>
            <li>From there on it was wearing off but still seamed to make a difference for a couple more hours.</li>
            <li>but I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just taking pain meds.  </li>
            <li>But i gave it a try for my 4 inch detailed tattoo!</li>
            <li>its covering my grand canyon marks like a champ) - but hell-</li>
            <li>Okay so I have not used this product yet.</li>
            <li>Of course you can still feel your tattoo, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant, but this REALLY HELP!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got to be some pretty good stuff if he had not recommended it to tell you the truth I would have never purchased it</li>
            <li>but this worked out pretty good for me</li>
            <li>so I was so happy and very surprised when it did.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5% Lidocaine (only) formula is still very effective for me...just not quite as effective as the original formula was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not the first one to say this, and I dont know how this seller is still able to sell this product to customers with all of the inconsistent feedback that they are receiving from everyone!</li>
            <li>Still works fine.  </li>
            <li>It worth the money to take away some pain that everyone should be happy to live without.</li>
            <li>It works, and it works great if used properly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be back great seller a pleasure doing business with them.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions Precisely and guess what??</li>
            <li>Why would I want a free tube of something that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does?</li>
            <li>I tried the 3% available by doctor prescription</li>
            <li>(he was free handing with pen) and then finish</li>
            <li>the needle touching me right now?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another tube now, they had better send me the right one (not the gel)</li>
            <li>but it does make the pain bare able to where he was able to handle it even better.</li>
            <li>but with this I was able to sit through a whole session!</li>
            <li>If I had gotten a small tattoo this would have been the best tattoo experience of my life</li>
            <li>HAVE YOUR ARTIST CLEAN</li>
            <li>If it does what it says, cool I am in.</li>
            <li>i got a full chest tattoo today and barley felt</li>
            <li>but it did not work for my full thigh</li>
            <li>Overall good stuff</li>
            <li>You must follow the directions to get the full benefit.</li>
            <li>so glad I found a product that is much cheaper than the  lidocaine cream I was using, and that I don&#x27;t have to go to the pharmacy to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>What I did feel was not painful.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed a ton of the cream in thoroughly, then applied almost as much as a layer on top</li>
            <li>It seemed to wear of more quickly on the hip and ribs and lasted much longer in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my fist Grand Daughter guess  I better get a larger tube this time.</li>
            <li>I got only about an hour of really good numbness before it started to wear off, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it was still totally worth it.</li>
            <li>am giving this product 5 stars based on me receiving theitem quickly.</li>
            <li>I wore yoga pants, so I pulled the top up over my stomach to hold it down and keep it warm</li>
            <li>and DID NOT NUMB MY SKIN</li>
            <li>the cream does not numb the way it describes.</li>
            <li>Even at the $35-40 cost, I feel it was still worth it.  </li>
            <li>Its Worth A try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, make sure to test it elsewhere on your body before putting it anywhere sensitive.</li>
            <li>for $20 I think it was worth it</li>
            <li>is fun.</li>
            <li>So when I found it here on Amazon at a much lower price I was excited.</li>
            <li>Since this tattoo, other tattoo artist in my shop have tried it but did not have as good results</li>
            <li>It says so right in the title.</li>
            <li>it says \\&quot;30g\\&quot; right on the box.</li>
            <li>However, it is not the right choice at all...</li>
            <li>i dont know if it was because i didnt wrap it right</li>
            <li>And let me tell you right now....</li>
            <li>I put it on about an hour before, wraped it w/ suran-wrap, &amp; took it off right before we started.</li>
            <li>I was anticipating a very large tattoo on my rib cage.</li>
            <li>The reason i got this was because I had scheduled a very large chest piece that was going to be a 15 hour project.</li>
            <li>Great for small or medium size tattoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only good thing was it came early</li>
            <li>i used this and so much difference, i could feel the laser but was very reasonable, the effect last for about&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes, after that you are on your own again ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>no numb yourself for certain tattoos if you cant handle the pain.</li>
            <li>i tried it first or ilI would have been in a lot of pain .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the price is much lower than what I purchased it for a year ago, it may be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the product says CREAM all over it</li>
            <li>In fact when he first started tattooing I was questioning in my head &amp;#34;Is</li>
            <li>, it is more costly compared to the amount you receive, but it actually works during the tattoo process...</li>
            <li>I tried this product on one occasion and it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>this stuff worked get the first time i used it</li>
            <li>No weird tingly feeling, I just couldn&#x27;t feel anything on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>I did not use anything for the first session.</li>
            <li>and i was able to take the pain (sort of) except when it came to my inner arm.</li>
            <li>I had my eyebrows tatooed on,the first time was with the use of nothing</li>
            <li>First and foremost you must, must, must follow the instructions...</li>
            <li>Try to reload this page if you do not have the most current map.</li>
            <li>First things first....</li>
            <li>But it absolutely works!</li>
            <li>Man up, and take it ;)</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the directions stated...</li>
            <li>Just like the first time.</li>
            <li>When I did the bottom, using the cream (the first time I have ever used anything), I was able to go a total of about 4 and 1/2 hours.  </li>
            <li>However, when I put the cream on again between the line work and the body work, I instantly felt better.  </li>
            <li>When I first started I was using a lidocaine numbing cream I had perscribed to me for laser hair removal treatment.  </li>
            <li>It alleviates so much pain, wouldn&#x27;t want to do the injections without it!</li>
            <li>This is my first review because I couldn&#x27;t leave this product without reviewing.</li>
            <li>but I have more then enough product for what I need.</li>
            <li>: be more thorough/liberal next time).  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m pretty stoked at this point..</li>
            <li>for the first time ever my tattoo wept for 2 days.</li>
            <li>or if i got hot it would weep and be sticky again.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment got here right on the day</li>
            <li>The entire area was bright red.  </li>
            <li>The outlining part SUCKS, so I was glad to miss most of that.  </li>
            <li>i applied it 60, 45, 30 and 15 minutes before procedure, of course NOT following directions that say do not apply more than 4 times and don&#x27;t use too much - i applied quite a bit and 4 times within an hour - nothing...</li>
            <li>The artist can clean it off for you before you start, or you can do it yourself with warm water and a mild soap, though it is tough to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed and it costed a pretty penny for not doing anything.</li>
            <li>When I got full lip tattooing it felt like someone was holding a flame to my lip, but this numbed the pain completely.  </li>
            <li>Complete those small tasks, and it would be a great product.</li>
            <li>its composition is a gritty type substance in the solution, and it does not provide a surface on the skin that provides an easy glide with the needles...</li>
            <li>but everyone reacts differently to these types of products , it also stated it made it just as easy to tattoo for the artist</li>
            <li>I have a large tattoo that was done in 2 sessions.</li>
            <li>I was getting a large rib tattoo finished and did not want to endure the pain that was in store for me.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product because of its lack of consistency however I cannot deny that it can reduce a certain degree of discomfort.</li>
            <li>tattoo was farelly large</li>
            <li>but you have to use the entire tube on one tattoo which I guess is fine and</li>
            <li>i have 10 tattoos i wanted it because when the artist was doing my leg it really hurt on the bone</li>
            <li>It was very upsetting to pay so much money for an item that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It is really 50/50. ..</li>
            <li>I will try to be as detailed as possible since a lot of people are looking at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the artist was set up and ready to go, I went to the bathroom to wipe it off.  </li>
            <li>product came fast but dosnt do any thing at all.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for a numbing agent.</li>
            <li>Like a whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>So I was really sketched out to try this product</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it a lot  </li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t work very well....</li>
            <li>I am terrified of needles, so I bought this to see if it would really do what it said.</li>
            <li>So if you are terrified of needles like me but want a tattoo, get this cream it really works.</li>
            <li>Depending on the spot it can work really well.</li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>your artist is unfamiliar with this, and they use a stencil, they will want to really let the stencil set and pull it off very gradually, as it can distort it quite a bit.)</li>
            <li>best money spend for tattooing, This will numb the area for a min,  </li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It came in a metal tube which i am not fond of because after a couple of uses and trying to get it out, the tube wants to bend and crimp.</li>
            <li>but it did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>That is when it really started to swell and burn.  </li>
            <li>over do it like put a heating pad or hair dryer to it because i was reading too much penetration of the product into the blood stream</li>
            <li>She recommended Dr. Numb, I ordered it here, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>, the problem with this product for me was that I was in absolute bliss</li>
            <li>I put the whole tube on, covered and waited 1-1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>OMG!, Dr. Numb is the best.</li>
            <li>anyhow during the whole time the stencil was applied, some freehand stuff was added, I could not feel a thing,</li>
            <li>really want to thank the inventor of this product because now laser  </li>
            <li>Also, maximum numbing seemed to occur after about 90 minutes and remains for a good hour after that, then slowly fades.  </li>
            <li>So before adding the cream to cart make sure you check the other seller options.</li>
            <li>kind of works, not real good,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The latest tube I ordered a month ago is a gel with only the 5% lidocaine listed as an active ingredient and 7.22% inactive ingredients to help it penetrate better, probably the gritty sandy feeling stuff that&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li>I am a huge baby when it comes to pain, I really wanted another tattoo but was so scared, I barely felt any pain, only certain spots</li>
            <li>I rubbed it into the area to be tattooed, next I lightly lathered it on (not very thick)</li>
            <li>We were then able to go on and get about half of the shading in.</li>
            <li>Decent cream works for a bit in tattoos</li>
            <li>The technician also increased the intensity of the laser, as my hair has been particularly stubborn.  </li>
            <li>I got a whole sleeve that took 5 hours to complete!</li>
            <li>so I just put a lot on and then some tight fitting clothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>The first 30 minutes was great, the next 30 minutes was hit and miss with surprise jabs when I felt it, and usual anticipated pain the last hour.  </li>
            <li>I would highly suggest that you purchase Tattoo Soothe</li>
            <li>and it did make me bleed a little more</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product to use when getting tattoos in painful areas.</li>
            <li>Now his 26 year old brother wants some to</li>
            <li>and it didnt bleed as much as i normally do.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that I felt \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;, but this was not my first tattoo, and the pain was barely noticeable compared to the others I have gotten without using the cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i start applying the cream about an hour before in normal coats, every 10-15 minutes,did about 5 coats and&lt;br</li>
            <li>in I could feel the tattoo pain as normal.</li>
            <li>if you go beyond your normal threshold it may make the healing process a bit worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have 100+ hours of being tattooed normally</li>
            <li>doesnt work for sure please dont waste money on something like this</li>
            <li>for new earthquakes until a magnitude is determined.&lt;br /&gt;•Maps</li>
            <li>M4.5+ in the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;•Maps are updated whenever a new earthquake has been located.</li>
            <li>I confirmed this by contacting the company and they informed me that 5% Lidocaine is the maximum amount of active ingredient allowed by law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I totally recommend that you not waste your time, and save your money for something that actually worth buying.</li>
            <li>This time it does not seem even half as strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably kind of dumb to use a product that seems to be purposely withholding information like the actual INGREDIENTS, but if that&#x27;s a risk you want to take, this product is effective, and is approximately half the price of Lidocream 5%.</li>
            <li>It went in pretty deep.</li>
            <li>It left my skin red and more susceptible to pain, and yes the same thing happened to my friend.  </li>
            <li>but I was getting a pretty big tattoo</li>
            <li>I get laser hair removal on my legs and after enduring the immense pain the first time around with no numbing cream or anything-</li>
            <li>We did about 6 hours in the first session, and it lasted through the entire session.</li>
            <li>If directions are followed it definitely works but it is not an exact science.</li>
            <li>The reviews were mixed, but positive on balance.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d have to wash it every few hours with warm water/baby soap to keep it clean, few hours later</li>
            <li>really only suggest you use this for the lining, especially if your piece has bold lines.</li>
            <li>bought this for a large back peice</li>
            <li>might as well spend a little more money on something that actually works!</li>
            <li>AND no they were not listed on the tube, it clearly says \\&quot;see enclosed...\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clear gel that turns almost crystalized when you put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and yes, the stuff in my tube is a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look at reviews again yesterday and today, and completely freaked myself out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I needed something bigger for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>nor does it work fast enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to use during the tattoo process on the most common tender sites of the body...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or time.  </li>
            <li>like i said it dont work very well the next time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old</li>
            <li>It could last as much as an hour (in my case).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m workin on.21yrs old, 170 lbs.</li>
            <li>The tattoo was completely painless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste you time energy or effort in buying this product.  </li>
            <li>Like I said do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the laser at all in areas that aren&#x27;t too sensitive</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s covering sensitive stretch marks( yes ladies</li>
            <li>I used this on my second foot tattoo and it really took the edge off.</li>
            <li>the cream was a nice thick white cream-</li>
            <li>I have several other tattoos,handled each one just fine.</li>
            <li>I used this first on a huge black and gray tattoo on an upper back.</li>
            <li>The original cream did but sometime within the last year or so that changed to strictly 5% Lidocaine in a gel with some gritty stuff mixed in to help it penetrate the skin</li>
            <li>I attribute the cream wearing off to two things; 1 being a extra hour was wasted due to us not tattooing right away but more than likely(and</li>
            <li>The occlusive dressing (plastic wrap) is critical, as this makes sure the active agent only has one place to go - into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full all around front &amp; back- from upper ribs just under breasts to just an inch above my woo-hoo &amp; to boot</li>
            <li>The regular cream was (small container) more concentrated...</li>
            <li>Amazon usually only displays the cheapest eligible seller on the main page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works instantly for vulvodinia and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Really prevents you from tensing up so much and you&#x27;ll end up much less tired/exhausted afterwards.</li>
            <li>I had already sat through one almost unbearable tattoo session, I&#x27;m getting a big piece sprawling from the side of my breast all the way to the top of my leg and about a quarter of my stomach, so I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the most painful things I&#x27;ve ever had to endure.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not think it was working because i expected some sort of numbness tingly feel</li>
            <li>like you normally do when getting a tattoo that last longer than 10 min.</li>
            <li>I am heavily tattooed, head to toe and everything in between, completing a full body suit and probably about 70% done.</li>
            <li>The initial line work (first hour) was going well without too much pain, but he had to stop for over a half hour because the power went out.  </li>
            <li>I am really disappointed because I had high hopes since it has great reviews</li>
            <li>It also numbs some VERY sensitive body areas, so be extra careful if you&#x27;re doing a Brazilian; there are some locations you do NOT want to pour hot wax on, even if it doesn&#x27;t hurt at the time.</li>
            <li>Good tattoos are expensive, so to me, the cost wasn&#x27;t that much of a big deal.  </li>
            <li>Put it on thickly, making sure to cover the entire target area.  </li>
            <li>Still hurt like no other.</li>
            <li>The one major setback I have observed is bleeding.</li>
            <li>I started out putting it on thickly with a patting motion using about half the tube, then decided to go ahead and squeeze more of it on straight out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>but it did not completely numb him, just a little bit.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about the product coming in a clear gel as opposed to a white cream.</li>
            <li>I read good/bad reviews, some saying the white cream version works and some saying there is clear cream version that does not work.</li>
            <li>Definite must for all sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I only used it on the sensitive areas</li>
            <li>As a lean guy with minimal fat the chest has always been a real sore spot for me.</li>
            <li>I received the cream version with the 5% lidocaine - apparently this is the preferred version and the gel version is inferior.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you use any numbing creams/sprays just tattoo for as long as you normally would if u were not using anything.</li>
            <li>i bought this because dr numb is suppose to work good for tattoos.</li>
            <li>He recently got a new tattoo but a week later he was offered to get another one.</li>
            <li>it tattooed a sensitive area for myself and went beyond what i normally would due to numbing agents.</li>
            <li>So i tried dr numb for the first time not too long ago, my friend had a tube of it with a kind of foil outside...</li>
            <li>In addition, to further the lack of exact science claim, there is no designated time that this product is guaranteed to work for so its hard to gauge how much time one has before it effects wear off.</li>
            <li>I followed other reviewers recommendations and applied the product very generously then wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about an allergic reaction, so after the initial rub in I put a second coat that was not very thick, wrapped myself in saran wrap and left it on for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware of is that the numbness wears off after about an hour, so if you are planning to get a large area tattooed, you will only be numb for part of the process, and the product can not be re-applied over freshly tattooed skin.</li>
            <li>I am heavily tattooed and have never used any numbing products before, my first rib session is what made me want to look into this cream and like everyone I read all the reviews and watched all the youtube video responses.</li>
            <li>i do not know if that was due to the cream or if my body just randomly decided to bleed more haha.</li>
            <li>using this product I first rub some into my skin, then put a huge glob over the area i want to be numb and cover the area with saran wrap.  </li>
            <li>but I will be making another purchase to finish the bottom half of my sleeve very soon..</li>
            <li>but i was a little swollen on certain parts</li>
            <li>While getting my tattoo, I noticed that it numbs some places very well and others it has little to no effect on.</li>
            <li>Numb ,it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It numbed the area I was tattooing perfectly.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me, I felt everything that was being done BUT did not hurt at all!</li>
            <li> this is the best product i have seen in a while.</li>
            <li> Just a great product gettting a sleeve now!</li>
            <li> It has made my tattooing experiences awesome with NO PAIN!</li>
            <li> SEAL THE BEST</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I was VERY impressed!!</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, no pain and the finished product is awesome</li>
            <li> LOL!</li>
            <li> It works best leaving it on for 90min-2 hours.</li>
            <li> this is the best numbing ointment out there!  </li>
            <li> advice to you; look for the best price you can get on a 5% Lidocaine product.</li>
            <li> This works great for a bikini wax!</li>
            <li> This worked awesome for getting tattooed on my rib cage.  </li>
            <li> but it was perfectly manageable.</li>
            <li> for best results you have to wrap whatever area</li>
            <li> This was the best investment I made.</li>
            <li> I bought this item so I can get my permanent eyeliner done, it worked very good</li>
            <li> I also will say that the reviews and youtube videos I watched said it worked fully through a 3-4 hr tattoo which i find very surprising</li>
            <li> Works very good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was incredible.</li>
            <li> But in the end I realize the pain is what makes your tattoo beautiful, but for the squeamish out there looking for an answer to the pain-free tat, don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my case I endured 5 hours of pain for my beautiful piece of artwork.  </li>
            <li> I have no pain win</li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great</li>
            <li> But everything was great packaged great got here before it was suppose to</li>
            <li> If it worked for the two to three hours it claimed, it would have been great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> It works great..</li>
            <li> It worked great for me</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> Great for use before tattoo&#x27;s or helping take skin tags off, etc.</li>
            <li> My tattoo looks great and healed well.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great.</li>
            <li> It worked great for 1-1/2 hours before he started feeling anything.</li>
            <li> so I also purchased a bottle of Vaso-Caine numbing spray which also works great</li>
            <li> great-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to go to remove my hair..</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the instructions though!!</li>
            <li> WORKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> So amazing !</li>
            <li> Great product, works good  </li>
            <li> but if it works for him then this is a good product</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> If you need some good skin numbing cream, this is it.</li>
            <li> Anywho... i ordered 4 because it worked so good</li>
            <li> This stuff is good</li>
            <li> but the cream is good and so on.</li>
            <li> Over all I had a great one with it :).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it to get a very meaningful tattoo on my foot.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I was able to use my NO!NO!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have attempted to use this and it worked great!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps i did not apply it the correct way, but whatever it is, my first try wasnt that wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I was told and heard by many people that for a full effect it is best to plop it on like cake icing and then to wrap it in saran wrap.</li>
            <li> That being said, it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I have four tattoos and honestly bought this just to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> (I had also read to keep it warm).  </li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work basedon</li>
            <li> I purchased that but refused to use it w/o having some kind of numbing agent.  </li>
            <li> After finding the correct way to use that I ended up loving it.  </li>
            <li> at your own risk but go in expecting pain.</li>
            <li> Was waxing my own bikini so its gonna hurt no matter</li>
            <li> VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> enjoy and good luck</li>
            <li> $20 bucks to ease a great deal of pain if worth it to me.</li>
            <li> so had to sit through my appointment in tremendous pain!!</li>
            <li> It was alot easier to spread so works great for large areas.</li>
            <li> and I was pain free!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;its not for sure for tatoo</li>
            <li> ok reading everyone else reviews</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know what this cream would be good for but it does not numb the area of the skin as described it</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this, wasn&#x27;t expecting a gel.</li>
            <li> purchased 4 tubes from another website and will be buying more because one tube will cover both of my lower legs with cream to spare.  </li>
            <li> My thighs however require more cream</li>
            <li> so I will be ordering more of this.  </li>
            <li> this time it was more like a gel</li>
            <li> but nothing more than before.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li> WWWWAAAAYYYY better than tattoo soothe, and cheaper too.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for hair removal and it made the process so much more bareable.  </li>
            <li> I received the white cream and it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> Make sure you wear gloves</li>
            <li> I plan on buying it again and applying it in a more cake frosting manner to see if I will get a better/longer effect.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Straight away I could feel him touching me when he was prepping the area</li>
            <li> I love this product for when I get tattoos.</li>
            <li> The longer it sits the better.</li>
            <li> Lidocream was also more gel-like than</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know if it works or not; maybe it just works better on some.  </li>
            <li> I will definetaly buy more, &amp; recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Be sure to compare the price per gram and any S&amp;H charges when comparing prodcuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vic</li>
            <li> Why endure more pain than you have to and spend money on more sessions?:-p  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is if you get the gel stuff... use MORE than you would the cream, wrap it, and wait ATLEAST 1.5 hrs- 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> 2hrs :)</li>
            <li> I was able to continue with the session without stopping.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to use this cream which I have to tell you a trick you must make sure after you apply this cream</li>
            <li> Ladies go get a painless brazilian :)</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply the cream liberally.</li>
            <li> From there on it was wearing off but still seamed to make a difference for a couple more hours.</li>
            <li> but I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just taking pain meds.  </li>
            <li> But i gave it a try for my 4 inch detailed tattoo!</li>
            <li> its covering my grand canyon marks like a champ) - but hell-</li>
            <li> Okay so I have not used this product yet.</li>
            <li> Of course you can still feel your tattoo, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant, but this REALLY HELP!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got to be some pretty good stuff if he had not recommended it to tell you the truth I would have never purchased it</li>
            <li> but this worked out pretty good for me</li>
            <li> so I was so happy and very surprised when it did.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5% Lidocaine (only) formula is still very effective for me...just not quite as effective as the original formula was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not the first one to say this, and I dont know how this seller is still able to sell this product to customers with all of the inconsistent feedback that they are receiving from everyone!</li>
            <li> Still works fine.  </li>
            <li> It worth the money to take away some pain that everyone should be happy to live without.</li>
            <li> It works, and it works great if used properly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be back great seller a pleasure doing business with them.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions Precisely and guess what??</li>
            <li> Why would I want a free tube of something that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does?</li>
            <li> I tried the 3% available by doctor prescription</li>
            <li> (he was free handing with pen) and then finish</li>
            <li> the needle touching me right now?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another tube now, they had better send me the right one (not the gel)</li>
            <li> but it does make the pain bare able to where he was able to handle it even better.</li>
            <li> but with this I was able to sit through a whole session!</li>
            <li> If I had gotten a small tattoo this would have been the best tattoo experience of my life</li>
            <li> HAVE YOUR ARTIST CLEAN</li>
            <li> If it does what it says, cool I am in.</li>
            <li> i got a full chest tattoo today and barley felt</li>
            <li> but it did not work for my full thigh</li>
            <li> Overall good stuff</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions to get the full benefit.</li>
            <li> so glad I found a product that is much cheaper than the  lidocaine cream I was using, and that I don&#x27;t have to go to the pharmacy to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> What I did feel was not painful.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed a ton of the cream in thoroughly, then applied almost as much as a layer on top</li>
            <li> It seemed to wear of more quickly on the hip and ribs and lasted much longer in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my fist Grand Daughter guess  I better get a larger tube this time.</li>
            <li> I got only about an hour of really good numbness before it started to wear off, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it was still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> am giving this product 5 stars based on me receiving theitem quickly.</li>
            <li> I wore yoga pants, so I pulled the top up over my stomach to hold it down and keep it warm</li>
            <li> and DID NOT NUMB MY SKIN</li>
            <li> the cream does not numb the way it describes.</li>
            <li> Even at the $35-40 cost, I feel it was still worth it.  </li>
            <li> Its Worth A try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, make sure to test it elsewhere on your body before putting it anywhere sensitive.</li>
            <li> for $20 I think it was worth it</li>
            <li> is fun.</li>
            <li> So when I found it here on Amazon at a much lower price I was excited.</li>
            <li> Since this tattoo, other tattoo artist in my shop have tried it but did not have as good results</li>
            <li> It says so right in the title.</li>
            <li> it says \\&quot;30g\\&quot; right on the box.</li>
            <li> However, it is not the right choice at all...</li>
            <li> i dont know if it was because i didnt wrap it right</li>
            <li> And let me tell you right now....</li>
            <li> I put it on about an hour before, wraped it w/ suran-wrap, &amp; took it off right before we started.</li>
            <li> I was anticipating a very large tattoo on my rib cage.</li>
            <li> The reason i got this was because I had scheduled a very large chest piece that was going to be a 15 hour project.</li>
            <li> Great for small or medium size tattoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only good thing was it came early</li>
            <li> i used this and so much difference, i could feel the laser but was very reasonable, the effect last for about&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes, after that you are on your own again ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> no numb yourself for certain tattoos if you cant handle the pain.</li>
            <li> i tried it first or ilI would have been in a lot of pain .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the price is much lower than what I purchased it for a year ago, it may be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the product says CREAM all over it</li>
            <li> In fact when he first started tattooing I was questioning in my head &amp;#34;Is</li>
            <li> , it is more costly compared to the amount you receive, but it actually works during the tattoo process...</li>
            <li> I tried this product on one occasion and it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> this stuff worked get the first time i used it</li>
            <li> No weird tingly feeling, I just couldn&#x27;t feel anything on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> I did not use anything for the first session.</li>
            <li> and i was able to take the pain (sort of) except when it came to my inner arm.</li>
            <li> I had my eyebrows tatooed on,the first time was with the use of nothing</li>
            <li> First and foremost you must, must, must follow the instructions...</li>
            <li> Try to reload this page if you do not have the most current map.</li>
            <li> First things first....</li>
            <li> But it absolutely works!</li>
            <li> Man up, and take it ;)</li>
            <li> I did exactly as the directions stated...</li>
            <li> Just like the first time.</li>
            <li> When I did the bottom, using the cream (the first time I have ever used anything), I was able to go a total of about 4 and 1/2 hours.  </li>
            <li> However, when I put the cream on again between the line work and the body work, I instantly felt better.  </li>
            <li> When I first started I was using a lidocaine numbing cream I had perscribed to me for laser hair removal treatment.  </li>
            <li> It alleviates so much pain, wouldn&#x27;t want to do the injections without it!</li>
            <li> This is my first review because I couldn&#x27;t leave this product without reviewing.</li>
            <li> but I have more then enough product for what I need.</li>
            <li> : be more thorough/liberal next time).  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m pretty stoked at this point..</li>
            <li> for the first time ever my tattoo wept for 2 days.</li>
            <li> or if i got hot it would weep and be sticky again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment got here right on the day</li>
            <li> The entire area was bright red.  </li>
            <li> The outlining part SUCKS, so I was glad to miss most of that.  </li>
            <li> i applied it 60, 45, 30 and 15 minutes before procedure, of course NOT following directions that say do not apply more than 4 times and don&#x27;t use too much - i applied quite a bit and 4 times within an hour - nothing...</li>
            <li> The artist can clean it off for you before you start, or you can do it yourself with warm water and a mild soap, though it is tough to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed and it costed a pretty penny for not doing anything.</li>
            <li> When I got full lip tattooing it felt like someone was holding a flame to my lip, but this numbed the pain completely.  </li>
            <li> Complete those small tasks, and it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> its composition is a gritty type substance in the solution, and it does not provide a surface on the skin that provides an easy glide with the needles...</li>
            <li> but everyone reacts differently to these types of products , it also stated it made it just as easy to tattoo for the artist</li>
            <li> I have a large tattoo that was done in 2 sessions.</li>
            <li> I was getting a large rib tattoo finished and did not want to endure the pain that was in store for me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product because of its lack of consistency however I cannot deny that it can reduce a certain degree of discomfort.</li>
            <li> tattoo was farelly large</li>
            <li> but you have to use the entire tube on one tattoo which I guess is fine and</li>
            <li> i have 10 tattoos i wanted it because when the artist was doing my leg it really hurt on the bone</li>
            <li> It was very upsetting to pay so much money for an item that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It is really 50/50. ..</li>
            <li> I will try to be as detailed as possible since a lot of people are looking at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the artist was set up and ready to go, I went to the bathroom to wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> product came fast but dosnt do any thing at all.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for a numbing agent.</li>
            <li> Like a whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> So I was really sketched out to try this product</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it a lot  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t work very well....</li>
            <li> I am terrified of needles, so I bought this to see if it would really do what it said.</li>
            <li> So if you are terrified of needles like me but want a tattoo, get this cream it really works.</li>
            <li> Depending on the spot it can work really well.</li>
            <li> Really???</li>
            <li> your artist is unfamiliar with this, and they use a stencil, they will want to really let the stencil set and pull it off very gradually, as it can distort it quite a bit.)</li>
            <li> best money spend for tattooing, This will numb the area for a min,  </li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It came in a metal tube which i am not fond of because after a couple of uses and trying to get it out, the tube wants to bend and crimp.</li>
            <li> but it did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> That is when it really started to swell and burn.  </li>
            <li> over do it like put a heating pad or hair dryer to it because i was reading too much penetration of the product into the blood stream</li>
            <li> She recommended Dr. Numb, I ordered it here, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> , the problem with this product for me was that I was in absolute bliss</li>
            <li> I put the whole tube on, covered and waited 1-1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> OMG!, Dr. Numb is the best.</li>
            <li> anyhow during the whole time the stencil was applied, some freehand stuff was added, I could not feel a thing,</li>
            <li> really want to thank the inventor of this product because now laser  </li>
            <li> Also, maximum numbing seemed to occur after about 90 minutes and remains for a good hour after that, then slowly fades.  </li>
            <li> So before adding the cream to cart make sure you check the other seller options.</li>
            <li> kind of works, not real good,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The latest tube I ordered a month ago is a gel with only the 5% lidocaine listed as an active ingredient and 7.22% inactive ingredients to help it penetrate better, probably the gritty sandy feeling stuff that&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li> I am a huge baby when it comes to pain, I really wanted another tattoo but was so scared, I barely felt any pain, only certain spots</li>
            <li> I rubbed it into the area to be tattooed, next I lightly lathered it on (not very thick)</li>
            <li> We were then able to go on and get about half of the shading in.</li>
            <li> Decent cream works for a bit in tattoos</li>
            <li> The technician also increased the intensity of the laser, as my hair has been particularly stubborn.  </li>
            <li> I got a whole sleeve that took 5 hours to complete!</li>
            <li> so I just put a lot on and then some tight fitting clothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> The first 30 minutes was great, the next 30 minutes was hit and miss with surprise jabs when I felt it, and usual anticipated pain the last hour.  </li>
            <li> I would highly suggest that you purchase Tattoo Soothe</li>
            <li> and it did make me bleed a little more</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to use when getting tattoos in painful areas.</li>
            <li> Now his 26 year old brother wants some to</li>
            <li> and it didnt bleed as much as i normally do.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that I felt \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;, but this was not my first tattoo, and the pain was barely noticeable compared to the others I have gotten without using the cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i start applying the cream about an hour before in normal coats, every 10-15 minutes,did about 5 coats and&lt;br</li>
            <li> in I could feel the tattoo pain as normal.</li>
            <li> if you go beyond your normal threshold it may make the healing process a bit worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have 100+ hours of being tattooed normally</li>
            <li> doesnt work for sure please dont waste money on something like this</li>
            <li> for new earthquakes until a magnitude is determined.&lt;br /&gt;•Maps</li>
            <li> M4.5+ in the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;•Maps are updated whenever a new earthquake has been located.</li>
            <li> I confirmed this by contacting the company and they informed me that 5% Lidocaine is the maximum amount of active ingredient allowed by law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I totally recommend that you not waste your time, and save your money for something that actually worth buying.</li>
            <li> This time it does not seem even half as strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably kind of dumb to use a product that seems to be purposely withholding information like the actual INGREDIENTS, but if that&#x27;s a risk you want to take, this product is effective, and is approximately half the price of Lidocream 5%.</li>
            <li> It went in pretty deep.</li>
            <li> It left my skin red and more susceptible to pain, and yes the same thing happened to my friend.  </li>
            <li> but I was getting a pretty big tattoo</li>
            <li> I get laser hair removal on my legs and after enduring the immense pain the first time around with no numbing cream or anything-</li>
            <li> We did about 6 hours in the first session, and it lasted through the entire session.</li>
            <li> If directions are followed it definitely works but it is not an exact science.</li>
            <li> The reviews were mixed, but positive on balance.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d have to wash it every few hours with warm water/baby soap to keep it clean, few hours later</li>
            <li> really only suggest you use this for the lining, especially if your piece has bold lines.</li>
            <li> bought this for a large back peice</li>
            <li> might as well spend a little more money on something that actually works!</li>
            <li> AND no they were not listed on the tube, it clearly says \\&quot;see enclosed...\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a clear gel that turns almost crystalized when you put it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and yes, the stuff in my tube is a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look at reviews again yesterday and today, and completely freaked myself out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I needed something bigger for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> nor does it work fast enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use during the tattoo process on the most common tender sites of the body...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or time.  </li>
            <li> like i said it dont work very well the next time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old</li>
            <li> It could last as much as an hour (in my case).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m workin on.21yrs old, 170 lbs.</li>
            <li> The tattoo was completely painless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste you time energy or effort in buying this product.  </li>
            <li> Like I said do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the laser at all in areas that aren&#x27;t too sensitive</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s covering sensitive stretch marks( yes ladies</li>
            <li> I used this on my second foot tattoo and it really took the edge off.</li>
            <li> the cream was a nice thick white cream-</li>
            <li> I have several other tattoos,handled each one just fine.</li>
            <li> I used this first on a huge black and gray tattoo on an upper back.</li>
            <li> The original cream did but sometime within the last year or so that changed to strictly 5% Lidocaine in a gel with some gritty stuff mixed in to help it penetrate the skin</li>
            <li> I attribute the cream wearing off to two things; 1 being a extra hour was wasted due to us not tattooing right away but more than likely(and</li>
            <li> The occlusive dressing (plastic wrap) is critical, as this makes sure the active agent only has one place to go - into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full all around front &amp; back- from upper ribs just under breasts to just an inch above my woo-hoo &amp; to boot</li>
            <li> The regular cream was (small container) more concentrated...</li>
            <li> Amazon usually only displays the cheapest eligible seller on the main page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works instantly for vulvodinia and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Really prevents you from tensing up so much and you&#x27;ll end up much less tired/exhausted afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had already sat through one almost unbearable tattoo session, I&#x27;m getting a big piece sprawling from the side of my breast all the way to the top of my leg and about a quarter of my stomach, so I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the most painful things I&#x27;ve ever had to endure.  </li>
            <li> At first I did not think it was working because i expected some sort of numbness tingly feel</li>
            <li> like you normally do when getting a tattoo that last longer than 10 min.</li>
            <li> I am heavily tattooed, head to toe and everything in between, completing a full body suit and probably about 70% done.</li>
            <li> The initial line work (first hour) was going well without too much pain, but he had to stop for over a half hour because the power went out.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because I had high hopes since it has great reviews</li>
            <li> It also numbs some VERY sensitive body areas, so be extra careful if you&#x27;re doing a Brazilian; there are some locations you do NOT want to pour hot wax on, even if it doesn&#x27;t hurt at the time.</li>
            <li> Good tattoos are expensive, so to me, the cost wasn&#x27;t that much of a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Put it on thickly, making sure to cover the entire target area.  </li>
            <li> Still hurt like no other.</li>
            <li> The one major setback I have observed is bleeding.</li>
            <li> I started out putting it on thickly with a patting motion using about half the tube, then decided to go ahead and squeeze more of it on straight out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> but it did not completely numb him, just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about the product coming in a clear gel as opposed to a white cream.</li>
            <li> I read good/bad reviews, some saying the white cream version works and some saying there is clear cream version that does not work.</li>
            <li> Definite must for all sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I only used it on the sensitive areas</li>
            <li> As a lean guy with minimal fat the chest has always been a real sore spot for me.</li>
            <li> I received the cream version with the 5% lidocaine - apparently this is the preferred version and the gel version is inferior.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you use any numbing creams/sprays just tattoo for as long as you normally would if u were not using anything.</li>
            <li> i bought this because dr numb is suppose to work good for tattoos.</li>
            <li> He recently got a new tattoo but a week later he was offered to get another one.</li>
            <li> it tattooed a sensitive area for myself and went beyond what i normally would due to numbing agents.</li>
            <li> So i tried dr numb for the first time not too long ago, my friend had a tube of it with a kind of foil outside...</li>
            <li> In addition, to further the lack of exact science claim, there is no designated time that this product is guaranteed to work for so its hard to gauge how much time one has before it effects wear off.</li>
            <li> I followed other reviewers recommendations and applied the product very generously then wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about an allergic reaction, so after the initial rub in I put a second coat that was not very thick, wrapped myself in saran wrap and left it on for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be aware of is that the numbness wears off after about an hour, so if you are planning to get a large area tattooed, you will only be numb for part of the process, and the product can not be re-applied over freshly tattooed skin.</li>
            <li> I am heavily tattooed and have never used any numbing products before, my first rib session is what made me want to look into this cream and like everyone I read all the reviews and watched all the youtube video responses.</li>
            <li> i do not know if that was due to the cream or if my body just randomly decided to bleed more haha.</li>
            <li> using this product I first rub some into my skin, then put a huge glob over the area i want to be numb and cover the area with saran wrap.  </li>
            <li> but I will be making another purchase to finish the bottom half of my sleeve very soon..</li>
            <li> but i was a little swollen on certain parts</li>
            <li> While getting my tattoo, I noticed that it numbs some places very well and others it has little to no effect on.</li>
            <li> Numb ,it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> NO Mess easy clean up stays numb for at least four hours</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any of the &#x27;numbness&#x27; feeling that went with it, just the absence of pain.</li>
            <li> but know it WILL work if you put a decent few layers of it on and wait</li>
            <li> And anyone who has had it done will tell you the chest is very very sensitive and one of the most painful places to get a tattoo (especially around the nipples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Any way, I was getting a pretty big tattoo down my rib cage that curved over my hip and knew it was going to hurt!!!  </li>
            <li> She also said that if I take down my negative review that they would send me another tube for free.  </li>
            <li> I was told that if I apply it and leave it for 1 1/2 hr then wipe off re-apply and leave for 1/2 hour then wipe off (saran wrap after every application, it must be tight allowing no air to enter) that it would really numb me up for a good amount of time, I&#x27;m going to try that next.</li>
            <li> They send you a small tube not the whole pictured image and when you send a comment to them</li>
            <li> Does not work long enough.</li>
            <li> and then the numbing does not last long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub it in, place a THICK glob on it on your skin, cover it with saran wrap, and then wait the exact amount of time it says in the instructions.</li>
            <li> , it probably isn&#x27;t worth it.. likely save it for a small tattoo down the road or give it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I rarely bleed much at all, and it has never been an issue when I don&#x27;t numb.</li>
            <li> After hearing some negative feed back I was nervous to spend the money on this cream, but my husband really needed it to finish his sleeve.</li>
            <li> Leave on for a few minutes (cover with plastic) prior to tattoo and it COMPLETELY numbs the area...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and other reviewers advice, left it on for 1 hour prior to getting waxed.</li>
            <li> it started to sting in sensitive spots a little.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend to those who are getting small tattoos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you slather this stuff on so that it&#x27;s thick an still visibly white, do not work into the skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know uses it before getting tattooed and helps take the sting away before long tattoo sessions</li>
            <li> long drive</li>
            <li> did give it 3 stars because it did work, but just not as long as it says it would.  </li>
            <li> I used up the entire tube and spent over $20</li>
            <li> and it made it harder for mine to get the ink saturated enough to make it stay</li>
            <li> I am 36 hours deep &amp; only half way there on my tattoo-</li>
            <li> I looked at other peoples review and lots said the same thing.</li>
            <li> Be very careful of mucous membranes, as it is not meant for internal use.</li>
            <li> But this tattoo was much more painful, so I decided to give the product a try despite mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> When I did the top of my sleeve, the longest I went was 3 hours and the last hour was quite painful.  </li>
            <li> and then suddenly everything which can be worse than feeling everything straight through.</li>
            <li> It has a single beam and you&#x27;re removing hair from one follicle at a time.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with that at first because I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li> so I know what they are supposed to feel like, and normally I do not mind the pain.</li>
            <li> As most people here I was very skeptical about using this product.</li>
            <li> I put two layers of saran wrap on, mushed it around, and then taped it down with medical tape.  </li>
            <li> i just got a big tattoo on my side going down to my butt...</li>
            <li> It is basically the same effectiveness as watered down hand</li>
            <li> When I got to the shop we didn&#x27;t get down to tattooing until another hour later(3 hours since applying cream in total) because of tattoo placement etc..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone getting a small or basic tattoo that only takes 30 minutes or so OR for the outlining stage.  </li>
            <li> I felt nothing for about a half an hour, the nit totally wnet away.</li>
            <li> and i still have half left over.</li>
            <li> so it only worked for half...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it completely painless, but if you follow the instructions, it definitely takes down the ouch by at least 75-80%.</li>
            <li> the last half hour was more painful</li>
            <li> i was pretty much through... :(</li>
            <li> If your in a pinch and need it to penetrate more put a few jackets or be in a warmer room because heat activates it but dont get too crazy and</li>
            <li> I spent about $35-40 on it a year ago and it was the cream. .</li>
            <li> and a few years later I ended up purchasing another laser hair remover</li>
            <li> There was some discomfort as to be expected, but it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no difference in the pain level as the 1st session.</li>
            <li> I felt the pressure of his hands,&amp; the vibration from the needles, but absolutely no pain at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or maney, as this had next to no effect.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with the intention to use on my empty chest plate that I will be tattooing at the end of the month - I will chime in at that point with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dr. numb was very useful for me on getting my chest tattoo.</li>
            <li> but I think this is much more due to the colour going over bits that are already done so it&#x27;s twice as painful rather than anything to do with the cream,&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am doing laser in my face (i am a guy,so very coarse and thick hair), at first session almost punch the poor lady, the pain was...</li>
            <li> but my goodness a little bit went a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I used it about an hour and a half before my appointment and I reapplied it a few times over the following hour.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mind you, I use a hand held needle, no gun, so the pain is a bit worse than normal.</li>
            <li> Seller not willing to re-fund.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to drop $30 (inc. expedited shipping) on a product that wasn&#x27;t what I ordered (the gel) or didn&#x27;t work (according to other reviewers).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tattoo was 2 Skulls 2 Grenades 2 Pistols and a pair of Brass Knuckles as the center!</li>
            <li> (not sure if that makes a big difference?)</li>
            <li> if you follow the instructions, you will have absolutely no problems whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Thank you Dr. Numb! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely no numbing effect whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> I spent 39 dollars for no reason!</li>
            <li> This product does not work and is not worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I should have followed the other reviews.</li>
            <li> bam extreme pain</li>
            <li> Now one side of my chest is completed and connected to my sleeve while the other is not.</li>
            <li> i am going to follow up with one other thing here.</li>
            <li> I understand that it may work for some people, but after following the directions and recommended use I expected at least some numbing effect.</li>
            <li> So I bought Dr. Numb in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t feel as much pain for my second session.</li>
            <li> Typically though I only use it for line work, and especially in really tough places (back of my bicep, ankle/tendon, anything that would go over bones).</li>
            <li> It worked so well when he went in for finishing touches he bought another tube of dr numb and it worked just like the first time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard trying to cover the back of my thighs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hardly felt any pain during the process of my tattoo on my inner wrist.</li>
            <li> just wrap on whatever area you want tattooed and put at least and hour prior to getting tattooed..</li>
            <li> : the 30g tube looks like it will last at least two treatments.  </li>
            <li> either people hate it or love it.  </li>
            <li> i do wish they would make a bigger tube because after i put a thick layer on my arm</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get much more done in a day and not be a bloody</li>
            <li> Each time I need to go in to have my lasic work down to remove hair from my body</li>
            <li> it appears like a watered down version-</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Dr Numb here on Amazon in June 2011, and received a cream that listed the ingredients right on the tube: 5% Lidocaine 5% Prilocaine 3% Benzocaine.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would be worth it, but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My brother on the other hand layered it on 3 times b4 getting his tattoo extended from the front part of his arm all the way into his biceps and down to the begining of his forearm and said it hurt A LOT!</li>
            <li> The pain of a tattoo isnt that bad anyways, sure it sucks at times but not worth being let down with this BS.</li>
            <li> That lasted for about half an hour.  </li>
            <li> just a slight pressure</li>
            <li> Followed instructions from previous review.  </li>
            <li> It stayed this way for the hour and a half</li>
            <li> I just put a dab on a bandaid and put it on the injection site for a half hour to 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I put it on an hour and a half before my appiontment and wrapped with Saran wrap.</li>
            <li> than had I not used the cream and even then the cream may have lessened it slightly still, who knows.</li>
            <li> After that first session I was desperate, so I dropped the thirty bux hoping this worked...</li>
            <li> I spent 40 bucks on a small tube of ointment that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So the cream does work but not for long, in my case at least.</li>
            <li> normally i heal perfectly, no weeping no pain etc..</li>
            <li> but the tattoo itself is a bit painful and my tattoos are never painful.</li>
            <li> you put the saran wrap on as tight as you can do not let any air get in</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and other similar products is that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &#x27;numb&#x27; feeling.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the product was past the pull date.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of pain on the first round, we decided to give Dr Numb a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for small tattoos or if you really just need to reduce pain even for a short time as it is just that bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit concerned it may have been a reaction, but talked with the tattooist and decided to proceed.  </li>
            <li> Now every once and a while I would feel a little poke but nothing I couldn&#x27;t withstand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a little scared to buy it again</li>
            <li> he said he could tell when the product started to wear off because the skin was easier to penetrate just a little tid bit of info.</li>
            <li> I have been tattooed at different spots on my body at least 15 times, and I can still say, it is sometimes hard to predict how you are going to take it.  </li>
            <li> Dr. numb really works.</li>
            <li> Takes between 30-60 minutes to numb but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Dr. Numb does provide relief after the tattoo is done, but I would not use it anymore simply because of it&#x27;s &#x27;gritty&#x27; consistancy...</li>
            <li> I sent a email to the Dr. Numb company and several weeks later I still have not received a response.  </li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to numb any pain.  </li>
            <li> Sat in the tattoo chair for 3 hours and was basically numb the whole time, with the exception of a few spots here and there.</li>
            <li> I see a few reviews complaining about its size.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t reply, so unless you want to waste money don&#x27;t buy from here.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am a thin individual and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and don&#x27;t get suckered into this scam...</li>
            <li> PUT ON HEAVY AND WRAP WITH PLASTIC WRAP.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to use this product, it was for a piece near my neck.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of time</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer rubbing it into the skin, then a thicker layer that I just smeared and left on and wrapped myself up in plastic wrap for almost 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t waste your time when it comes to colouring that thing in.</li>
            <li> Honestly, This might have been the worst thing ive ordered.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> But I will use the cream again, I will use it to get through the outline then I will pair it with a product called Inkeeze, which only works and truly does after the skin has been broken</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The numbing spray works like the numbing cream only it has to be used on broken skin, already tattooed skin.</li>
            <li> up**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a few days since my tattoo.</li>
            <li> waste of money to buy</li>
            <li> I have had many sessions of laser hair removal and it has always been very painful to me.</li>
            <li> I did still feel pain when he was tattooing, but it seemed less than usual.  </li>
            <li> Bought one package put it on 1 hour before going to the shop, thick and covered it with Saran Wrap and took it off before I went in and my arm was completely numb didn&#x27;t feel anything for the first two hours, could see him working the gun but no pain or ting at all about hour 3</li>
            <li> When it said apply generously, i went a little overboard.</li>
            <li> With high recommendations of Dr. Numb, I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It to me was almost worse starting completely numb then feeling extreme pain in almost seonds after it wearing off after finishing a not long maybe 40 min outline, I started  to feel a stinging sensation then</li>
            <li> Usually I wouldn&#x27;t be so worried but due to the fact that it was in a sensative spot, I thought it would ease at least a fraction of the pain.</li>
            <li> did i feel a little pain !</li>
            <li> Even if it works i&#x27;d say it is only suited for those odd painful spots and not large</li>
            <li> My technician really needed to crank up the laser for me to get results but it was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> It was a small area, and I did not feel anything.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this works or not.</li>
            <li> Sex was never better</li>
            <li> ONLY thing i was disappointed about was that it only worked for about 1 hour and 30min.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it seems to work for some but not others.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I received a legit product this time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not.</li>
            <li> but I am hesitant to spend another $24 or so... :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked like it was supposed to</li>
            <li> Usually I was clenching my face &amp; squeezing my hands, this time I was smiling &amp; laughing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it makes a difference</li>
            <li> I know this is difficult to gauge, as every tattoo is different.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Dr. Numb.  </li>
            <li> The tube is also small.  </li>
            <li> Direct off Dr. Numb website-</li>
            <li> He has also used numbing cream in the past and said it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though i did touch my lip accidentally and it got little numb for like 10 minutes Going for prescription for my next treatment that has something around 25% or so...</li>
            <li> i would of taught that when you punch up tattoo numbing cream you expect to see creams that actually works to numb skin even if its a little bit</li>
            <li> only reason its 4 stars is the smell i was stupid enough not to wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I got it, I followed the other reviewers instructions on how to apply it: rub in a thin layer all over area, then spread a credit card thick layer of the cream and cover it with saran-wrap, let it sit 60-90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I came across this Dr. Numb and it&#x27;s the same as the Deep Numb but a little weaker.  </li>
            <li> and I could hardly feel anything.</li>
            <li> prior to using dr numb</li>
            <li> Dr. Numb worked instantly.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, despite the negative reviews, I figured that since I already bought it, I would go ahead and use it.  </li>
            <li> It states it can numb for several hours.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a cream called &#x27;Deep Numb&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I am getting a tattoo next month and was told that Dr. numb would take the edge off the process, so I bought a tube.</li>
            <li> Cover it in plastic wrap for t least 90 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I wish it lasted longer, but I guess that&#x27;s a crappy complaint.  </li>
            <li> I used the entire tube and put the wrap on for over an hour and became numb in that area.</li>
            <li> Ordered Dr. Numb last week to try it out when getting my 1/2 sleeve tattoo done.</li>
            <li> The second time was with Dr. Numb</li>
            <li> , I was numb when the tattoo began and it did help, although after the tattoo artist would go over the same area for the 2nd-3rd time it wore off about 90%, but believe me that 10% still helps!</li>
            <li> maybe i bought it from amazon so it SUCKS</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist put it on for at least an hour before the tattoo and wrapped it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After leaving a negative review on the Dr.</li>
            <li> Then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Currently Dr. Numb does NOT contain 5% Prilocaine or 3% Benzocaine.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t hear any complaint.</li>
            <li> this item sucks it numbs nothing it does not work even on broken skin waste of time</li>
            <li> and it only kept me completely numb</li>
            <li> you getting tattooed with plastic wrap at least 2 hours before</li>
            <li> I researched for weeks and finally decided to try Dr. numb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a thing for at least an hour into the secession.</li>
            <li> to the reviews where guys are saying the gel sucks</li>
            <li> it dont work at all a real waste of my money</li>
            <li> you have to put a thick layer on the area and cover with saran</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about putting in on so thick because being that I have never used this</li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer and wraped with plastic wrap for 1 1/2 hours, While getting my tattoo</li>
            <li> and i was marinating 2 hours previous!!!</li>
            <li> a ton of reviews tat says this stuff works, just as long as you apply it correct and follow the steps.&lt;br /&gt;Really makes me mad that the instructions were not in the box.</li>
            <li> It is not a further 2 hours since the treatment (over 3 since I applied Dr. Numb) and everything down there is still quite numb.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is a sham.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry because I just wasted that money on nothing.</li>
            <li> It made painful waxing no big deal.</li>
            <li> and I hardly felt a thing (apart from finding the areas I missed!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do the same thing, or you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weak.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used Dr. Numb cream from another supplier - a trial offer.</li>
            <li> All my tough areas are already tattooed</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting tired of doing so.  </li>
            <li> Some have complained that they got the wrong product</li>
            <li> and so you would think it would be worse.  </li>
            <li> Did I get a bootleg version of the product???  </li>
            <li> (hella frustrating).</li>
            <li> and then when the skin is broken you apply another dose to continue</li>
            <li> however ur skin must be broken for it to work.</li>
            <li> The pain that resumed was not any worse</li>
            <li> It started wearing down and hurting bad.</li>
            <li> and it will be less painful during laser hair removal</li>
            <li> this product does not work it does not numb anything just bad very very very bad</li>
            <li> I was betting the inner bycep/under arm tatted, and its a painful spot!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars just because it did numb the area but not for long :(</li>
            <li> This was just a waste of time, effort, &amp; money!!!!  </li>
            <li> It was very cold today, so I also had on my heavy coat for the hour</li>
            <li> This is the fake</li>
            <li> a rather expensive lesson I learned.</li>
            <li> boy ill tell you</li>
            <li> /&gt;The company does seem weird and although the packaging and the tube itself both refer to the \\&quot;enclosed Consumer Information</li>
            <li> Rip-OFF!</li>
            <li> WTF???</li>
            <li> Its way too expensive.</li>
            <li> but sadly it was not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this product proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> The worst areas I have been tatteooed are as follows; chest, elbows, back of the thigh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i doubt ill be using numbing agents again.</li>
            <li> I feel so bad that I have to write a negative review!</li>
            <li> It will remain 5 stars even if it helps a little during a very painful session.</li>
            <li> After getting a painful and awful tattoo 10 years ago on my back, I decided to get it covered.</li>
            <li> Since Dr. Numb failed to numb my skin with its 5% of Lanocane, whereas Bactine I get at the drug store with its 2% of Lanocane does numb my skin, I cannot recommend this product in any way.</li>
            <li> so i put it off to get dr. numb.</li>
            <li> i waited 0ne hour and thirty minutes to see if it would get numb nothing</li>
            <li> Numb is a scam not the people who sell there product but dr.numb company it self is a scam</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t numb anything at all..</li>
            <li> Numb came in a GEL not a CREAM</li>
            <li> I applied Dr. Numb as directed using a vapor barrier and keeping on skin for four hours.</li>
            <li> My skin stayed numb for about 4 hours</li>
            <li> I used Dr. Numb for a tattoo I got on my hip/side.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like going to the dentist, when they numb you all</li>
            <li> NUMB DOESN&#x27;T INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE TATTOOING PROCESS.</li>
            <li> Maybe there are some nerve points on the body where Dr. Numb works</li>
            <li> Guess what it was easier with Dr. Numb by all means buy this and use it for a tatoo.  </li>
            <li> 2 hours before i even got the shop i was already numb and when he started i didnt feel a thing until he got to the end</li>
            <li> decided to try Dr Numb.  </li>
            <li> Numb website</li>
            <li> /&gt;This keeps me numb for minimum 1.5 hours and max 3.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not some Dr. Numb agent or something.</li>
            <li> Used this to numb my nose for a peircing.&lt;br /&gt;within 30 mins I already felt the numbing effect</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to numb off the pain when I do b-wax.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would numb my underarms</li>
            <li> The area where he had rubbed in the cream it went numb after maybe 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any Dr. Numb for the outline but will definitley be using it for the coloring.</li>
            <li> My arm was numb to the touch when I went in.  </li>
            <li> I applied dr numb 1 hour before my tattoo.</li>
            <li> Numb doesn&#x27;t come with directions, However the product is  A \\&quot;must Have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After that session I did some research online and Dr. Numb kept appearing in my searches.  </li>
            <li> Once upon a time Dr. Numb did work-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Dr. Numb rookie - now I ordered DR.</li>
            <li> Numb off Amazon-</li>
            <li> I used as directed didn&#x27;t numb at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy Dr numb from Amazon</li>
            <li> and they all say dr. numb specifically will not effect the tattoo process on their end nor will it effect the end result of the tattoo in terms of healing and quality etc</li>
            <li> the stuff worked, I was totally numb.</li>
            <li> The numb effect starts wearing off after an hour.</li>
            <li> But when it is numb, you dont feel a thing.</li>
            <li> This is just an expensive tube of worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it&#x27;s a completely fake...</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> though with all the bad reviews about the gel.</li>
            <li> and it was painful.  </li>
            <li> I wanted dr numb cream!</li>
            <li> I received one of the gel tubes of dr numb that everyone else has been complaining about!</li>
            <li> Omg my husband could not believe it he couldn&#x27;t feel a thing as he got blasted on for 5 hours!</li>
            <li> this product does not make you numb!</li>
            <li> I do not recommended this to anyone waste of money !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I applied this 1hr before I did b-wax, but it still hurt like mad!</li>
            <li> So if your going to use it dont make stupid decisions like putting a heating pad on it..</li>
            <li> It was so annoying, because I knew I was taking a gamble by ordering it since everyone seemed to say that the cream works, but the gel doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Horrible ://</li>
            <li> the smell stays on your hands and its horrible.</li>
            <li> horrible product</li>
            <li> and then for me it went from bliss to the worst tattoo pain i have ever felt because there was no time to adjust to the pain.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am getting lazer hair removal done and Dr. numb really works.I have no pain win i let it set on my skin for 2.5 hours</li>
            <li> I see a few reviews complaining about its size. It is a 30 gram tube. It says so right in the title. It&#x27;s not like anyone is being tricked, even in the picture posted it says \\&quot;30g\\&quot; right on the box. It is the user&#x27;s fault for not reading. I suggest not buying something if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re buying next time.  Now that I got that over with, I&#x27;m gonna give my review. It works, and it works great if used properly. It numbed the area I was tattooing perfectly. It was a small area, and I did not feel anything. Mind you, I use a hand held needle, no gun, so the pain is a bit worse than normal. The skin wasn&#x27;t just numbed on the surface, either. It went in pretty deep. Deep enough to literally not feel anything. Just like tattooing some one else. Highly recommended.  You must use it as directed, though. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. Don&#x27;t rub it in, place a THICK glob on it on your skin, cover it with saran wrap, and then wait the exact amount of time it says in the instructions.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me, I felt everything that was being done BUT did not hurt at all! I had my tattoos done on my ankle, my ribs and shoulder blade and I was pain free! My brother on the other hand layered it on 3 times b4 getting his tattoo extended from the front part of his arm all the way into his biceps and down to the begining of his forearm and said it hurt A LOT! So different people have different experience. Over all I had a great one with it :).</li>
            <li> dosent do anything i may return it ,didnt num nothing i try 2times ,dont buy it.........................................................................&lt;br /&gt;its not for sure for tatoo its for nothing .</li>
            <li> i bought this because dr numb is suppose to work good for tattoos. prior to using dr numb i have 10 tattoos i wanted it because when the artist was doing my leg it really hurt on the bone so i put it off to get dr. numb. it dont work at all a real waste of my money it felt the same as if i had nothing on. i waited 0ne hour and thirty minutes to see if it would get numb nothing and i did it just like the videos on you tube suggested. DR. Numb is a scam not the people who sell there product but dr.numb company it self is a scam</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your time buying this.  They send you a small tube not the whole pictured image and when you send a comment to them they don&#x27;t reply, so unless you want to waste money don&#x27;t buy from here.</li>
            <li> My ears have itched for years and I have tried prescriptions that never worked.  Dr. Numb worked instantly.  I am ordering my second tube today.</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.  I followed the directions step by step.  I tried this item in 3 different occasions, two times on myself, and the third time on a friend, and the same thing happened each time.  It just doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I even contacted the company.  They were no help.  I actually believe this is a SCAM.  It just didn&#x27;t numb anything at all.. AT ALL.  It was very upsetting to pay so much money for an item that doesn&#x27;t work.  IT WAS LIKE PUTTING REGULAR LOTION ON MY ARM, NOTHING HAPPENED, IT DOES NOT WORK.  It left my skin red and more susceptible to pain, and yes the same thing happened to my friend.  So DO NOT BUY THIS.. save your cash.</li>
            <li> The Dr.Numb came in a GEL not a CREAM and DID NOT NUMB MY SKIN...so had to sit through my appointment in tremendous pain!! Seller not willing to re-fund. Horrible ://</li>
            <li> ok reading everyone else reviews i was like should i try this product, i am tell you from a person who hates pain this is the best product i have seen in a while. You do have to follow instructions but then it works! I applied it 2 hours before then sat another 45 mins waiting to get the tatt then when i started i didnt feel anything! It felt like someone was drawing on my are with a marker and it didnt bleed as much as i normally do. It lasted thru the outline and thru the coloring and shading, so i was there like 2hrs getting a tatt. Still didnt feel anything after i got home. Just a great product gettting a sleeve now! no pain all gain!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this works or not. I have four tattoos and honestly bought this just to see if it worked. CANT even test it out as the box didnt come with instructions on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I paid for next day shipping which was over 20 bucks, plus the cost of the product. If it does what it says, cool I am in. BUT I will never know I guess. I read a ton of reviews tat says this stuff works, just as long as you apply it correct and follow the steps.&lt;br /&gt;Really makes me mad that the instructions were not in the box. AND no they were not listed on the tube, it clearly says \\&quot;see enclosed...\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money. The pain of a tattoo isnt that bad anyways, sure it sucks at times but not worth being let down with this BS.</li>
            <li> Its a gel mot a cream the box is darkee the rltube is smaller thank God i tried it first or ilI would have been in a lot of pain . This is the fake I was so upset I hope I get the refund</li>
            <li> I applied Dr. Numb as directed using a vapor barrier and keeping on skin for four hours. Nothing happened. I called the manufacturer about the date codes. The code on the tube was two weeks from being out-of-date. The date code on the box was two years from being out-of-date. My response was that someone just took out-of-date tubes and put them into in-date boxes. The manufacturer said, \\&quot;the date code on the tube has no meaning.\\&quot; I said, \\&quot;then why does the FDA require a date code at all?\\&quot; The manufacturer had no response and only repeated that the date code on the tube of cream itself has no meaning. Since Dr. Numb failed to numb my skin with its 5% of Lanocane, whereas Bactine I get at the drug store with its 2% of Lanocane does numb my skin, I cannot recommend this product in any way. It is a ripoff and the manufacturer just lied to me. No attempt was made to replace the product or refund my $25.00 --- a rather expensive lesson I learned. Don&#x27;t do the same thing, or you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the cream does not numb the way it describes. I applied several times and it did not seem to do the job, I don&#x27;t know what this cream would be good for but it does not numb the area of the skin as described it would and I don&#x27;t think it even contains the % of anesthetic that is listed.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this, wasn&#x27;t expecting a gel. It says cream! I wanted dr numb cream! Anyhow, it doesn&#x27;t work. 0 out of 5 stars. But amazon is forcing me to put 1 star. -_-</li>
            <li> Love it! Everyone I know uses it before getting tattooed and helps take the sting away before long tattoo sessions</li>
            <li> I purchased the 30g cream over a year ago and finally got around to getting my tattoo done today.  I decided to look at reviews again yesterday and today, and completely freaked myself out.  It is really 50/50. ..either people hate it or love it.  I have 4 tattoos already with no numbing cream used, but had this final one and wanted to use some sort of numbing cream since it was on my side including my hip bone and a bit of my ribs. . .which I know hurts like the dickens.  Anyway, despite the negative reviews, I figured that since I already bought it, I would go ahead and use it.  I spent about $35-40 on it a year ago and it was the cream. . .not the gel.  It also included the insert with instructions as well as ingredients.  It&#x27;s expiration date isn&#x27;t until next year and the address on the package shows BC, Canada.  I will try to be as detailed as possible since a lot of people are looking at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I timed it and put the cream on 1 1/2 hours before my appointment.  I am a thin individual and the area I covered was about 10x10 with the tattoo a tad bit smaller.  I started out putting it on thickly with a patting motion using about half the tube, then decided to go ahead and squeeze more of it on straight out of the tube.  I had read to \\&quot;glob it on\\&quot; which is literally what I did.  I put two layers of saran wrap on, mushed it around, and then taped it down with medical tape.  I wore yoga pants, so I pulled the top up over my stomach to hold it down and keep it warm (I had also read to keep it warm).  It was very cold today, so I also had on my heavy coat for the hour long drive it took to get to the tattoo shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the artist was set up and ready to go, I went to the bathroom to wipe it off.  The entire area was bright red.  I was a little bit concerned it may have been a reaction, but talked with the tattooist and decided to proceed.  IF there was an issue, then we would stop and reschedule. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work basedon what I&#x27;d read, so I&#x27;d been preparing myself all day for the pain.  However, when she started, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!!  That lasted for about half an hour.  Then it started to wear off. . .quickly.  My tattoo took 2 hours.  The first 30 minutes was great, the next 30 minutes was hit and miss with surprise jabs when I felt it, and usual anticipated pain the last hour.  It seemed to wear of more quickly on the hip and ribs and lasted much longer in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it 3 stars because it did work, but just not as long as it says it would.  It states it can numb for several hours.  I would recommend this to anyone getting a small or basic tattoo that only takes 30 minutes or so OR for the outlining stage.  The outlining part SUCKS, so I was glad to miss most of that.  I felt all of the filling in and finishing touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the price is much lower than what I purchased it for a year ago, it may be worth a shot.  Even at the $35-40 cost, I feel it was still worth it.  Good tattoos are expensive, so to me, the cost wasn&#x27;t that much of a big deal.  I have about a quarter of the tube left, which I&#x27;ll probably use the next time I get a wax.</li>
            <li> product came fast but dosnt do any thing at all. I have plenty of tattoos and do plenty of tattoos and dont work on either one.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says it will do.  Takes between 30-60 minutes to numb but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I used it when I got a wax and I felt nothing. My sister uses it for tattoos. I enjoy this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy person.  I&#x27;ve said so in reviews that require hair removal.  I&#x27;ve been epilating my legs for over 10 years and I&#x27;m getting tired of doing so.  I&#x27;ve purchased waxes, gels, &amp; creams.  I even purchased a NO!NO! in &#x27;08 because I wanted to permanently remove my hair but that hurt like the dickens.  I don&#x27;t know why I can tolerate hair being ripped out of my follicle but I can&#x27;t handle tiny needle pricks against my skin.  I got rid of that and a few years later I ended up purchasing another laser hair remover that&#x27;s a pain to use.  It has a single beam and you&#x27;re removing hair from one follicle at a time.  So I lost patience with that one and ended up finding another NO!NO! for $65!  I purchased that but refused to use it w/o having some kind of numbing agent.  I purchased a cream called &#x27;Deep Numb&#x27;.  I was disappointed with that at first because I didn&#x27;t use it right and the tubes are so tiny!  After finding the correct way to use that I ended up loving it.  I was able to use my NO!NO! with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I needed something bigger for my whole body.  I came across this Dr. Numb and it&#x27;s the same as the Deep Numb but a little weaker.  My skin stayed numb for about 4 hours and I missed areas.  It&#x27;s hard trying to cover the back of my thighs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 4 tubes from another website and will be buying more because one tube will cover both of my lower legs with cream to spare.  My thighs however require more cream so I will be ordering more of this.  It definitely works with laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> what can i say about this stuff here...besides it works...boy ill tell you i just got a big tattoo on my side going down to my butt...i put this stuff on about an hour before i was going to get tatted and wrapped my self with sarrand wrap...lol...I FELT NOTHING, but the parts i missed...well thats another story, the only think i didnt like is after 3.5-4 hours, it was wearing off and i could feel alittle bit, but besides that, i will be ordering again</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for a numbing agent. I was very dissapointed and it costed a pretty penny for not doing anything.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought this item it was a cream, this time it was more like a gel and it didnt work as well.</li>
            <li> Im still searching for something that works. This is just an expensive tube of worthless. It didn&#x27;t do anything at all that I could tell.</li>
            <li> Does not work long enough. nor does it work fast enough. They should increase the strength. Complete those small tasks, and it would be a great product.</li>
            <li> I am getting a tattoo next month and was told that Dr. numb would take the edge off the process, so I bought a tube. First of all, the product says CREAM all over it and it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a clear gel that turns almost crystalized when you put it on. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or this is how they all are. I have tried it twice now so I know what to expect when I get my tattoo and it DOES NOT WORK. Don&#x27;t waste your money and don&#x27;t get suckered into this scam...</li>
            <li> Hello!  If you&#x27;re looking at this you, like me, have probably been met with a ton mixed reviews.  It took me a while to take the plunge for my rib tattoos, too scared to get them done (I have 10, so it&#x27;s not like I feel the need to earn my stripes).  So, I started looking and saw a bunch of mixed reviews on here.  I followed it up with a ton of googling and you tube searches.&lt;br /&gt;I was totally on the fence about this, even hearing the site was a scam.  Still, I got it and can say that it works.  Some have complained that they got the wrong product (it comes in gel or cream, I got gel).  While I can speak for the cream the gel worked BUT YOU HAVE TO USE IT PROPERLY.  Apply a ton.  Like a whole bottle.  Spread it on but don&#x27;t rub it in.  Cover it in plastic wrap for t least 90 minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing while it was working.  It eventually wore off in about 3 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure, I would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it to get a tattoo on my wrist and it worked on the outline but once the shading started I could feel it all!!</li>
            <li> So I was really sketched out to try this product bc it had such mixed reviews and I didn&#x27;t want to drop $30 (inc. expedited shipping) on a product that wasn&#x27;t what I ordered (the gel) or didn&#x27;t work (according to other reviewers).  I had already sat through one almost unbearable tattoo session, I&#x27;m getting a big piece sprawling from the side of my breast all the way to the top of my leg and about a quarter of my stomach, so I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the most painful things I&#x27;ve ever had to endure.  After that first session I was desperate, so I dropped the thirty bux hoping this worked... I got it, I followed the other reviewers instructions on how to apply it: rub in a thin layer all over area, then spread a credit card thick layer of the cream and cover it with saran-wrap, let it sit 60-90 minutes.  The product worked for me.  In fact when he first started tattooing I was questioning in my head &amp;#34;Is the needle touching me right now?&amp;#34;, I couldn&#x27;t feel the pain of the tattoo just the sensation of something pressing against me.  Similar to getting numbed at the dentist and you feel the dentist leaning in on you, and know it should hurt but it really doesn&#x27;t.  Well, I managed to sit through about 2 hours of tattooing, but was constantly scared he was going to hit a patch that hadn&#x27;t been numbed.  Only in the end when it started to wear off, of course I felt what the needle felt like and yeah it hurt like heck but nothing more than before.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only bc I wish it lasted longer, but I guess that&#x27;s a crappy complaint.  It is meant for temporary relief and that&#x27;s what it did.  I don&#x27;t think I could have gotten through the rest of the outline without the help of the cream.  I&#x27;m buying another tube now, they had better send me the right one (not the gel) or I&#x27;m changing my review!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I wish it came in BIGGER sizes !!!! Sex was never better NO Mess easy clean up stays numb for at least four hours</li>
            <li> My fiance, asked to purchase this because he was told it works well for tattoos, well he took it like a champ. i personally never tried it but if it works for him then this is a good product</li>
            <li> WORKS AMAZING! i got a full chest tattoo today and barley felt any pain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo was 2 Skulls 2 Grenades 2 Pistols and a pair of Brass Knuckles as the center!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use during the tattoo process on the most common tender sites of the body... However, it is not the right choice at all... its composition is a gritty type substance in the solution, and it does not provide a surface on the skin that provides an easy glide with the needles... Matter of fact it tends to &#x27;gump&#x27; up in the tip causing damage to the needle... I would highly suggest that you purchase Tattoo Soothe, it is more costly compared to the amount you receive, but it actually works during the tattoo process... Dr. Numb does provide relief after the tattoo is done, but I would not use it anymore simply because of it&#x27;s &#x27;gritty&#x27; consistancy...</li>
            <li> I received one of the gel tubes of dr numb that everyone else has been complaining about! It was so annoying, because I knew I was taking a gamble by ordering it since everyone seemed to say that the cream works, but the gel doesn&#x27;t. However, I dont think it should be such a toss up when you order a product to not know if you will receive the item that you ordered, or a different one that doesn&#x27;t work! I am not the first one to say this, and I dont know how this seller is still able to sell this product to customers with all of the inconsistent feedback that they are receiving from everyone!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to use when getting tattoos in painful areas. I especially use it on my arms. It has made my tattooing experiences awesome with NO PAIN! You should try it.</li>
            <li> Dr. numb was very useful for me on getting my chest tattoo. I used the entire tube and put the wrap on for over an hour and became numb in that area. I could not feel anything once the needle touched me. ONLY thing i was disappointed about was that it only worked for about 1 hour and 30min. It started wearing down and hurting bad. But i will def be buying this again for my next one!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on one occasion and it seemed to work pretty well. There was some discomfort as to be expected, but it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> I used Dr. Numb for a tattoo I got on my hip/side. I won&#x27;t say that I felt \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;, but this was not my first tattoo, and the pain was barely noticeable compared to the others I have gotten without using the cream. The only thing to be aware of is that the numbness wears off after about an hour, so if you are planning to get a large area tattooed, you will only be numb for part of the process, and the product can not be re-applied over freshly tattooed skin. Would definitely recommend it though, and I will be using it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son he&#x27;s 21 and has somewhere around idk 35 or 40 tat&#x27;s now anyways he&#x27;s almost run out of room but one of his friend that does them for him recommended that he get this cream. He really likes it a lot  Now his 26 year old brother wants some to and I just had my fist Grand Daughter guess  I better get a larger tube this time. But I figure if the guy that does your tat&#x27;s recommends for you to get it it&#x27;s got to be some pretty good stuff if he had not recommended it to tell you the truth I would have never purchased it but now I guess I&#x27;ll keep stocked up. But everything was great packaged great got here before it was suppose to and I do recommend it and so do my boys. Will definitely be back great seller a pleasure doing business with them. Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li> I bought this item so I can get my permanent eyeliner done, it worked very good didn&#x27;t feel pain just a slight pressure (it&#x27;s like going to the dentist, when they numb you all you feel it the pressure)  but this worked out pretty good for me you I finally got my eyeliner done, if I have to get a retouch I will purchase it again will recommend.</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE FOR TATTOO ARTIST!!!&lt;br /&gt;A FRIEND INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND INSTRUCTED ME TO BUY THIS BEFORE HAVING ANY INK DONE. VERY EASY TO USE. PUT ON HEAVY AND WRAP WITH PLASTIC WRAP. SEAL THE BEST YOU CAN AND WAIT 1 HOUR. HAVE YOUR ARTIST CLEAN AND YOU WILL FEEL NOTHING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. DR. NUMB DOESN&#x27;T INTERFERE WITH ANY OF THE TATTOOING PROCESS. AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for laser hair removal and my son has used it for his insulin pump sets.  It takes about an hour to work and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than nothing!</li>
            <li> WWWWAAAAYYYY better than tattoo soothe, and cheaper too.  Leave on for a few minutes (cover with plastic) prior to tattoo and it COMPLETELY numbs the area... I was VERY impressed!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for hair removal and it made the process so much more bareable.  Just layered on and DIDN&amp;#34;T rub it in, cover with syran wrap for about 2 hours prior to my appointment.  Definite must for all sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is a sham. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it&#x27;s a completely fake... I was anticipating a very large tattoo on my rib cage. Usually I wouldn&#x27;t be so worried but due to the fact that it was in a sensative spot, I thought it would ease at least a fraction of the pain. Nope, not at all. Still hurt like no other. But in the end I realize the pain is what makes your tattoo beautiful, but for the squeamish out there looking for an answer to the pain-free tat, don&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it came in the mail within 2 days of ordering it!!</li>
            <li> I felt nothing for about a half an hour, the nit totally wnet away. I was betting the inner bycep/under arm tatted, and its a painful spot! If it worked for the two to three hours it claimed, it would have been great.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would be worth it, but was very disappointed.  Do not waste your money or time.  The product does not work.</li>
            <li> this stuff worked get the first time i used it but when i went to use it again at a diff time it didnt work so if i buy again thats a big IF i will have to use the hole thing cause like i said it dont work very well the next time</li>
            <li> this product does not work it does not numb anything just bad very very very bad only good thing was it came early</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t believe the hype until I used it. had a 5 hour tattoo done didnt feel anything til the end couldn&#x27;t even feel when he shaved the leg!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!  Used it for tattoo removal process and felt no relief what so ever.  Had cream on for an hour before my appointment and there was no numbing feeling at all.</li>
            <li> After getting a painful and awful tattoo 10 years ago on my back, I decided to get it covered. With high recommendations of Dr. Numb, I decided to purchase it. It helped ease the pain but I assumed I wouldn&#x27;t feel nothing at all. Nevertheless, I would use it again for another tattoo.</li>
            <li> Ordered Dr. Numb last week to try it out when getting my 1/2 sleeve tattoo done. I read a lot of reviews about the product coming in a clear gel as opposed to a white cream. I received the white cream and it worked beautifully! I followed the instructions and it numbed my arm within about a 1/2 hour. No weird tingly feeling, I just couldn&#x27;t feel anything on the surface of the skin. I kept the saran wrap on for an hour as instructed. I got only about an hour of really good numbness before it started to wear off, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it was still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Well 1st of all, we didn&#x27;t keep it refrigerated... (not sure if that makes a big difference?) But it didn&#x27;t work very well.... my boyfriend used it for tattoos on his arms and the tops of his hands but it did not completely numb him, just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to use this product, it was for a piece near my neck. Worked as advertised, no pain and the finished product is awesome</li>
            <li> I have a large tattoo that was done in 2 sessions. I did not use anything for the first session. Since the 2nd session was a couple of weeks later, I decided to try this despite the reviews. I followed other reviewers recommendations and applied the product very generously then wrapped in plastic wrap. I let this sit for over 3 hours before removing and heading to the tattoo parlor. There was absolutely no difference in the pain level as the 1st session. Maybe there are some nerve points on the body where Dr. Numb works but it did not work for my full thigh tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try at your own risk but go in expecting pain.</li>
            <li> Yeah this stuff actually works it amazed me. I&#x27;ve had about 10 hours of work done on my arm and i was able to take the pain (sort of) except when it came to my inner arm. So i decided to try finishing it with this stuff on. Definitly numbed me but i was a little swollen on certain parts and it did make me bleed a little more i do not know if that was due to the cream or if my body just randomly decided to bleed more haha. Overall good stuff no numb yourself for certain tattoos if you cant handle the pain. on me however it did wear off on my shoulder i dont know if it was because i didnt wrap it right or it wore off quicker on bone i have no clue. I&#x27;ll also add the tube is 30g i believe and it was enough to cover my entire arm (i have big arms) and shoulder and i still have half left over. Its Worth A try. only reason its 4 stars is the smell i was stupid enough not to wear gloves. Make sure you wear gloves the smell stays on your hands and its horrible.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it would last longer than it did..It did work but I was getting a pretty big tattoo so it only worked for half...would highly recommend to those who are getting small tattoos.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t feel a thing! I use it when I&#x27;m stretching my ears and it works like a charm! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have attempted to use this and it worked great!  I had my eyebrows tatooed on,the first time was with the use of nothing and it was painful.  The second time was with Dr. Numb and I had no problem.  I&#x27;m 61 years old and so you would think it would be worse.  Guess what it was easier with Dr. Numb by all means buy this and use it for a tatoo.  Good Luck everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denise</li>
            <li> First and foremost you must, must, must follow the instructions... you have to put a thick layer on the area and cover with saran wrap for about 2 hours before you even get hit with the needle. I got a whole sleeve that took 5 hours to complete! 2 hours before i even got the shop i was already numb and when he started i didnt feel a thing until he got to the end but hey he was at it for 5 hours! and i was marinating 2 hours previous!!! if you follow the instructions, you will have absolutely no problems whatsoever! i dont go to the shop without this stuff! LOL! i do wish they would make a bigger tube because after i put a thick layer on my arm i was pretty much through... :( but I will be making another purchase to finish the bottom half of my sleeve very soon.. I hope that helped</li>
            <li> I give this item 5 stars.  The only difference between this and other similar products is that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &#x27;numb&#x27; feeling.  Like when your leg goes to sleep?  There wasn&#x27;t any of the &#x27;numbness&#x27; feeling that went with it, just the absence of pain.</li>
            <li> As most people here I was very skeptical about using this product. I read good/bad reviews, some saying the white cream version works and some saying there is clear cream version that does not work. I decided to buy it and decide for myself. I was getting a large rib tattoo finished and did not want to endure the pain that was in store for me. I rubbed it into the area to be tattooed, next I lightly lathered it on (not very thick) I was told and heard by many people that for a full effect it is best to plop it on like cake icing and then to wrap it in saran wrap. I was hesitant about putting in on so thick because being that I have never used this I was concerned about an allergic reaction, so after the initial rub in I put a second coat that was not very thick, wrapped myself in saran wrap and left it on for 1 1/2 hours. It did work, I was numb when the tattoo began and it did help, although after the tattoo artist would go over the same area for the 2nd-3rd time it wore off about 90%, but believe me that 10% still helps! I plan on buying it again and applying it in a more cake frosting manner to see if I will get a better/longer effect. I am heavily tattooed and have never used any numbing products before, my first rib session is what made me want to look into this cream and like everyone I read all the reviews and watched all the youtube video responses. Bottom line is...it does work. I think the trick is in the application and the applicants sensitivity to the ingredients in the cream. I was told that if I apply it and leave it for 1 1/2 hr then wipe off re-apply and leave for 1/2 hour then wipe off (saran wrap after every application, it must be tight allowing no air to enter) that it would really numb me up for a good amount of time, I&#x27;m going to try that next.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it to get a very meaningful tattoo on my foot. I followed the directions Precisely and guess what?? Nothing happened!!!! i felt all the pinches and pokes on my foot and at the end of day i couldn&#x27;t get the tattoo. maybe i bought it from amazon so it SUCKS but damn that i want this product to work regardless</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product to get a tattoo. I am terrified of needles, so I bought this to see if it would really do what it said. And let me tell you right now....IT DOES WORK!!! When he started the tattoo I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, all I felt was the pressure. Now every once and a while I would feel a little poke but nothing I couldn&#x27;t withstand. So if you are terrified of needles like me but want a tattoo, get this cream it really works. Just follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll be good to go. Thank you Dr. Numb! :)</li>
            <li> It works best leaving it on for 90min-2 hours. Depending on the spot it can work really well. It could last as much as an hour (in my case). This works well with tattoo removal or laser treatments or tattoos that can be done in 45-60 min increments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am veteran tattoo owner, I&#x27;m currently working on a sleeve cover up and&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Dr Numb.  Bought one package put it on 1 hour before going to the shop, thick and covered it with Saran Wrap and took it off before I went in and my arm was completely numb didn&#x27;t feel anything for the first two hours, could see him working the gun but no pain or ting at all about hour 3 it started to sting in sensitive spots a little.  I bought another two tubes for the rest of my sittings.</li>

            <li> The cream had no effect on my skin, it was as if I had applied nothing at all.  I understand that it may work for some people, but after following the directions and recommended use I expected at least some numbing effect.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist put it on for at least an hour before the tattoo and wrapped it...it was a waste of time I think...&lt;br /&gt;Straight away I could feel him touching me when he was prepping the area etc and when he started tattooing I could feel it just as much as my last tattoo!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money or time on this product, as the time you have to wait for it you could be halfway or finished with your tattoo...&lt;br /&gt;I got below the knee, inside of my leg tattooed for about 2 and a half/3 hours...the last half hour was more painful but I think this is much more due to the colour going over bits that are already done so it&#x27;s twice as painful rather than anything to do with the cream,&lt;br /&gt;Maybe try something different?</li>
            <li> I had mixed feelings on making this purchase but in the end I did.  First things first.... When I opened the tube I discovered this was a gel not a cream like I thought.  I did a lot of research on this and everything I saw/read was about a white cream formula.  Did I get a bootleg version of the product???  I sent a email to the Dr. Numb company and several weeks later I still have not received a response.  Did anyone else get a tube of gel??  Any way, I was getting a pretty big tattoo down my rib cage that curved over my hip and knew it was going to hurt!!!  Even though there were no instructions in the box or on the tube if you googled this product you got the gist of how to apply.  I applied a thin layer rubbing it into the skin, then a thicker layer that I just smeared and left on and wrapped myself up in plastic wrap for almost 2 hours.  I have to say I felt like a side of beef marinating.  In the end ..... the tattoo hurt like nothing else!!!  Absolutely no numbing effect whatsoever!  Not sure why it seems to work for some but not others.  In my case I endured 5 hours of pain for my beautiful piece of artwork.  I still need to go back to finish it and will try to look for something else.  This was just a waste of time, effort, &amp; money!!!!  I would give it a zero star if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After leaving a negative review on the Dr.Numb website I got an email from some customer service person letting me know that the gel version is the same as the cream formula just without the white additive.  She also said that if I take down my negative review that they would send me another tube for free.  Um, did you not hear me when I said this stuff didn&#x27;t work?  Why would I want a free tube of something that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does? Really???</li>
            <li> I love this product for when I get tattoos. Typically though I only use it for line work, and especially in really tough places (back of my bicep, ankle/tendon, anything that would go over bones). I highly recommend you slather this stuff on so that it&#x27;s thick an still visibly white, do not work into the skin. Then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit for at least 2 hours. The longer it sits the better. The artist can clean it off for you before you start, or you can do it yourself with warm water and a mild soap, though it is tough to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps me numb for minimum 1.5 hours and max 3. But it absolutely works! Really prevents you from tensing up so much and you&#x27;ll end up much less tired/exhausted afterwards. The one major setback I have observed is bleeding. I rarely bleed much at all, and it has never been an issue when I don&#x27;t numb. But this stuff made it so my artist had to tap me out at 1 hour (hella frustrating). So keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really only suggest you use this for the lining, especially if your piece has bold lines. But don&#x27;t waste your time when it comes to colouring that thing in. Man up, and take it ;) and you&#x27;ll get much more done in a day and not be a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If your artist is unfamiliar with this, and they use a stencil, they will want to really let the stencil set and pull it off very gradually, as it can distort it quite a bit.)</li>
            <li> THIS IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!! best money spend for tattooing, This will numb the area for a min,  you will not regret</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews here about gel vs. cream and whatnot I decided to take a chance and go ahead and try this.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company does seem weird and although the packaging and the tube itself both refer to the \\&quot;enclosed Consumer Information Leaflet\\&quot; there was nothing like that included in the box.  It&#x27;s probably kind of dumb to use a product that seems to be purposely withholding information like the actual INGREDIENTS, but if that&#x27;s a risk you want to take, this product is effective, and is approximately half the price of Lidocream 5%. I have tried both and they seem to be about equally effective for helping to numb the pain that goes along with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product I first rub some into my skin, then put a huge glob over the area i want to be numb and cover the area with saran wrap.  I left it like that for an hour.  I still had some pain but this stuff makes it bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes, the stuff in my tube is a clear gel.  Still works fine.  Lidocream was also more gel-like than cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this stuff works.  And I&#x27;m not some Dr. Numb agent or something.</li>
            <li> I use this for pain management during Brazilian waxing. I&#x27;ve had waxes done both with and without it. It doesn&#x27;t make it completely painless, but if you follow the instructions, it definitely takes down the ouch by at least 75-80%. From sweating and gasping with every strip to \\&quot;Oh, well, that wasn&#x27;t so bad.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not a cure all, but it definitely helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, make sure to test it elsewhere on your body before putting it anywhere sensitive. Be very careful of mucous membranes, as it is not meant for internal use. It also numbs some VERY sensitive body areas, so be extra careful if you&#x27;re doing a Brazilian; there are some locations you do NOT want to pour hot wax on, even if it doesn&#x27;t hurt at the time.</li>
            <li> Rip-OFF! I bought and used the product last year- white cream and it worked wonders. Here i go and buy another tube and its-clear gel with grit in it? WTF??? IT DOES NOT WORK NOW! Why would you change a formula that works? I&#x27;m so angry because I just wasted that money on nothing. Liars and cheats is what this company is. Frauds!</li>
            <li> I recieved the product damaged. The cream was busted open, and it was all over the package. Hope my problem gets resolved.</li>
            <li> this is the best numbing ointment out there!  Works instantly for vulvodinia and highly recommend it.  A doctor gave me a prescription for 4% lidocaine and told me that there is nothing stronger.  I spent 40 bucks on a small tube of ointment that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> my client wanted a butterfly on her inner thighs and vagina, it lasted 3 hours with 0 pain. I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> Honestly, This might have been the worst thing ive ordered. It happened to be a cream not a gel at all! I spent 39 dollars for no reason! I looked at other peoples review and lots said the same thing. And i did not listen. I totally recommend that you not waste your time, and save your money for something that actually worth buying.</li>
            <li> After hearing some negative feed back I was nervous to spend the money on this cream, but my husband really needed it to finish his sleeve. Omg my husband could not believe it he couldn&#x27;t feel a thing as he got blasted on for 5 hours! It worked so well when he went in for finishing touches he bought another tube of dr numb and it worked just like the first time!</li>
            <li> This product does not work and is not worth the money I spent. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Used this to numb my nose for a peircing.&lt;br /&gt;within 30 mins I already felt the numbing effect but I let it sit on for a total of 1hr 10 mins!&lt;br /&gt;nothing to say besides IT WORKS ! I had no plastic wrap so I just let it sit there aplied two layers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weak.  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.  Its way too expensive. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from a different seller (smaller tube to see if it worked...it did!)  So I decided to get a bigger tube and this time it came as a gel (even though the box and the tube say \\&quot;cream\\&quot;) and the gel doesn&#x27;t work at all!!  I use this for electrolysis-facial hair removal and didn&#x27;t feel a thing when I was using the cream version and now when I apply the gel I feel everything!  Not sure if I received a legit product this time.  Will not buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I feel so bad that I have to write a negative review! I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not. I get laser hair removal on my legs and after enduring the immense pain the first time around with no numbing cream or anything- I definitely did not want to go through that again! So I bought Dr. Numb in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t feel as much pain for my second session. Shipping was great, no complaints there. I did exactly as the directions stated... layer it on your skin and wrap it for two hours. Oh.my.goodness. The pain was definitely there! Just like the first time. I used up the entire tube and spent over $20 and it did absolutely nothing. I am really disappointed because I had high hopes since it has great reviews and it&#x27;s stated that it can be used for laser hair removal. *sigh* I want to give it a second chance and use it on a different area of my body but I am hesitant to spend another $24 or so... :/</li>
            <li> Read the reviews.  Ordered anyway.  There are no instructions.  Followed instructions from previous review.  Put it on, put plastic wrap over and waited.  I guess it kinda worked.  Not sure if it worked like it was supposed to or my mind just told me it worked.  Was waxing my own bikini so its gonna hurt no matter what (and it did hurt) but I think it may have taken the sting out. Giving 3 stars cause I just don&#x27;t know if it works or not; maybe it just works better on some.  So if you want to spend the money for a \\&quot;chance\\&quot; it \\&quot;might\\&quot; work, I would say go ahead...as for me I won&#x27;t purchase another tube, it just didn&#x27;t work well enough.</li>
            <li> bought this for a large back peice I&#x27;m workin on.21yrs old, 170 lbs.I have several other tattoos,handled each one just fine.But this tattoo was much more painful, so I decided to give the product a try despite mixed reviews.I put it on about an hour before, wraped it w/ suran-wrap, &amp; took it off right before we started. I didnt feel a thing. This stuff was incredible.I felt the pressure of his hands,&amp; the vibration from the needles, but absolutely no pain at all. Usually I was clenching my face &amp; squeezing my hands, this time I was smiling &amp; laughing. I recomend this to anyone who needs a skin-numbing cream for any reason. If used correctly, u wont feel a thing-guarenteed. I used about 1/4 of the tube &amp; numbed about 3/4 of my back for somewhere between 3 &amp; 4 hours. I will definetaly buy more, &amp; recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that i have a ton of tattoos so I know what they are supposed to feel like, and normally I do not mind the pain. The reason i got this was because I had scheduled a very large chest piece that was going to be a 15 hour project. And anyone who has had it done will tell you the chest is very very sensitive and one of the most painful places to get a tattoo (especially around the nipples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some people are getting creams and others gels. Personally, I got the cream. It came in a metal tube which i am not fond of because after a couple of uses and trying to get it out, the tube wants to bend and crimp. That being said, it works amazingly well. I slathered this on my chest and stuck a piece of saran wrap on it. It stayed this way for the hour and a half it took me to get to the shop. At first I did not think it was working because i expected some sort of numbness tingly feel i guess. But once i touched my chest and could not feel anything, I knew it was working. The tattoo was completely painless. We did about 6 hours in the first session, and it lasted through the entire session. I could feel the pressure of the artists hands on my chest and could feel the needlework being done, the pain was not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little scared to buy it again though with all the bad reviews about the gel. I bought mine from a different supplier on amazon who no longer sells it. I am not sure if it makes a difference but i did use A LOT of the cream on my chest. When it said apply generously, i went a little overboard.</li>
            <li> Great product, works good  just wrap on whatever area you want tattooed and put at least and hour prior to getting tattooed.. It works great..</li>
            <li> I got mirco-dermals on my lower back It worked great for me maybe it works different for different people but I didn&#x27;t feel a thing didn&#x27;t know he did them</li>
            <li> I use this for post op permanent makeup pain control.  When I got full lip tattooing it felt like someone was holding a flame to my lip, but this numbed the pain completely.  I have also used it for my eyeliner, eyebrows and concealer with similar results.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I will never get another tattoo without it. I recommend it for anyone who gets tattoos in those \\&quot;tender\\&quot; spots</li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as i thought numbed for maybe 30 min and after that i cou d still feel pain it sucked</li>
            <li> this product does not make you numb! might as well spend a little more money on something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I didnt like it and it didnt work. i used it for numerous  things and on numerous people and no one felt the change. horrible product</li>
            <li> I am using it before facial electrolysis.  Numbs it some but can still feel the needles especially under the nose.</li>
            <li> Currently Dr. Numb does NOT contain 5% Prilocaine or 3% Benzocaine. The original cream did but sometime within the last year or so that changed to strictly 5% Lidocaine in a gel with some gritty stuff mixed in to help it penetrate the skin better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Dr Numb here on Amazon in June 2011, and received a cream that listed the ingredients right on the tube: 5% Lidocaine 5% Prilocaine 3% Benzocaine. That product is no longer manufactured. I confirmed this by contacting the company and they informed me that 5% Lidocaine is the maximum amount of active ingredient allowed by law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest tube I ordered a month ago is a gel with only the 5% lidocaine listed as an active ingredient and 7.22% inactive ingredients to help it penetrate better, probably the gritty sandy feeling stuff that&#x27;s in it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5% Lidocaine (only) formula is still very effective for me...just not quite as effective as the original formula was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you; look for the best price you can get on a 5% Lidocaine product. Be sure to compare the price per gram and any S&amp;H charges when comparing prodcuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vic</li>
            <li> I found it to work well for about 45 mins to an hr. by the time it&#x27;s done working my skin was use to the pain. All tattoos hurt the cream helps take the edge off.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to numb off the pain when I do b-wax. I applied this 1hr before I did b-wax, but it still hurt like mad! Perhaps i did not apply it the correct way, but whatever it is, my first try wasnt that wonderful.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would numb my underarms and it will be less painful during laser hair removal but it did absolutely nothing... i applied it 60, 45, 30 and 15 minutes before procedure, of course NOT following directions that say do not apply more than 4 times and don&#x27;t use too much - i applied quite a bit and 4 times within an hour - nothing... though i did touch my lip accidentally and it got little numb for like 10 minutes Going for prescription for my next treatment that has something around 25% or so...</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing to numb any pain.  It is basically the same effectiveness as watered down hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Dr. Numb cream from another supplier - a trial offer. It worked great. So when I found it here on Amazon at a much lower price I was excited. This time it does not seem even half as strong. I don&#x27;t know why this is but I will probably never order it again.</li>
            <li> If you need some good skin numbing cream, this is it. Great for use before tattoo&#x27;s or helping take skin tags off, etc. Last about an hour 1/2 plus. You must follow the directions to get the full benefit.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband because he heard about it from our neighbor. He tried it out to see if it actually did what it said. And I didn&#x27;t hear any complaint. He recently got a new tattoo but a week later he was offered to get another one. He said he did what the instruction stated to do and as what was promised. The area where he had rubbed in the cream it went numb after maybe 15 to 20 minutes. It does not take away all the pain but it does make the pain bare able to where he was able to handle it even better. It worth the money to take away some pain that everyone should be happy to live without. Fast shipment got here right on the day it stated it would.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews for products but I had to for this. This works great for a bikini wax! I followed the directions and other reviewers advice, left it on for 1 hour prior to getting waxed. It made painful waxing no big deal. I will never get waxed without this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you a lie and suggest that this product didn&#x27;t work. If directions are followed it definitely works but it is not an exact science. While getting my tattoo, I noticed that it numbs some places very well and others it has little to no effect on. In fact, I found myself feeling nothing and then suddenly everything which can be worse than feeling everything straight through. In addition, to further the lack of exact science claim, there is no designated time that this product is guaranteed to work for so its hard to gauge how much time one has before it effects wear off. Dice roll if you ask me. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product because of its lack of consistency however I cannot deny that it can reduce a certain degree of discomfort. Either way, it is essentially hit or miss</li>
            <li> This worked amazingly! I tried the 3% available by doctor prescription and it didn&#x27;t help at all, but with this I was able to sit through a whole session! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people complaining about this product. I ordered some months ago. It came as a cream, not a gel. I used it on my rib tatt and I could hardly feel anything. I&#x27;m currently getting my leg tattooed from mid thigh to the mid bridge of my foot. I didn&#x27;t use any Dr. Numb for the outline but will definitley be using it for the coloring.</li>
            <li> I am a huge baby when it comes to pain, I really wanted another tattoo but was so scared, I barely felt any pain, only certain spots</li>
            <li> This worked awesome for getting tattooed on my rib cage.  I would suggest this product for anyone.  Numbing effect lasted about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> I put it on over an hour before my session started and wrapped my arm up in cling wrap.  My arm was numb to the touch when I went in.  I did still feel pain when he was tattooing, but it seemed less than usual.  I know this is difficult to gauge, as every tattoo is different.  The area being tattooed, the size and detail of the artwork, the artist and even what you have eaten before and how nervous you are can affect how a session goes. I have been tattooed at different spots on my body at least 15 times, and I can still say, it is sometimes hard to predict how you are going to take it.  When I did the top of my sleeve, the longest I went was 3 hours and the last hour was quite painful.  When I did the bottom, using the cream (the first time I have ever used anything), I was able to go a total of about 4 and 1/2 hours.  Again, the last hour sucked.  The initial line work (first hour) was going well without too much pain, but he had to stop for over a half hour because the power went out.  That is when it really started to swell and burn.  However, when I put the cream on again between the line work and the body work, I instantly felt better.  We were then able to go on and get about half of the shading in. Ultimately, I think the cream helped to withstand a longer session and reduced the swelling. My tattoo looks great and healed well.  So, no complaints.  It is not a miracle pain reliever, but it does help. Why endure more pain than you have to and spend money on more sessions?:-p  I plan on using it again.</li>
            <li> So i tried dr numb for the first time not too long ago, my friend had a tube of it with a kind of foil outside...but my goodness a little bit went a LONG way. Anywho... i ordered 4 because it worked so good and i was going to be getting my stomach tattooed. The day of my tattoo i realized it was different from my friends.. it was in a plastic tub and was a gel cream... i instantly started looking online reading about how the gel one doesnt work! I almost had a panic attack. Although I&#x27;m writing this review to ensure everyone who gets it that IT DOES WORK. The regular cream was (small container) more concentrated... this one (in a bigger container) is the same thing just not as concentrated. It was alot easier to spread so works great for large areas. As for another review I read about gritty sand stuff or something I personally did not experience that at all one bit... The stuff i got reminded me of aleo vera consistency. My suggestion is if you get the gel stuff... use MORE than you would the cream, wrap it, and wait ATLEAST 1.5 hrs- 2 hrs. If you take it off too soon than your wasting your money. If your in a pinch and need it to penetrate more put a few jackets or be in a warmer room because heat activates it but dont get too crazy and over do it like put a heating pad or hair dryer to it because i was reading too much penetration of the product into the blood stream can cause FATAL side effects. So if your going to use it dont make stupid decisions like putting a heating pad on it.. but know it WILL work if you put a decent few layers of it on and wait 1.5 hrs- 2hrs :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently began having to give myself intramuscular injections twice daily.  When I first started I was using a lidocaine numbing cream I had perscribed to me for laser hair removal treatment.  When that ran out I wanted a cheaper alternative that would still alleviate some of the pain that comes with the injections.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Dr. Numb.  Im so glad I found a product that is much cheaper than the  lidocaine cream I was using, and that I don&#x27;t have to go to the pharmacy to pick it up.  I just put a dab on a bandaid and put it on the injection site for a half hour to 45 minutes.  It alleviates so much pain, wouldn&#x27;t want to do the injections without it!</li>
            <li> this item sucks it numbs nothing it does not work even on broken skin waste of time i would of taught that when you punch up tattoo numbing cream you expect to see creams that actually works to numb skin even if its a little bit and then when the skin is broken you apply another dose to continue but this item does nothing of the sort</li>
            <li> This product worked great. I will recommended this product to anyone I know that plans to get tattooed. I put it on an hour and a half before my appiontment and wrapped with Saran wrap. I hardly felt any pain during the process of my tattoo on my inner wrist.</li>
            <li> Do not waste you time energy or effort in buying this product.  Like I said do not waste your money.  I should have followed the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have had many sessions of laser hair removal and it has always been very painful to me. I have had tattoos before - and one all the way around the ankle bone - and they did not hurt anything like the laser to me! My technician really needed to crank up the laser for me to get results but it was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t handle it. She recommended Dr. Numb, I ordered it here, and it worked great! I didn&#x27;t use it in an area where I could wrap it up with a dressing so I just put a lot on and then some tight fitting clothing. I used it about an hour and a half before my appointment and I reapplied it a few times over the following hour.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this to work so I was so happy and very surprised when it did. I didn&#x27;t feel the laser at all in areas that aren&#x27;t too sensitive but I did still feel it in areas that are - but it was perfectly manageable. I was able to continue with the session without stopping. I would recommend this for use if you are having laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> It to me was almost worse starting completely numb then feeling extreme pain in almost seonds after it wearing off after finishing a not long maybe 40 min outline, I started  to feel a stinging sensation then bam extreme pain, the problem with this product for me was that I was in absolute bliss and then there wasn&#x27;t a period of getting used to the pain like you normally do when getting a tattoo that last longer than 10 min. I had a tattoo that took a total of 2 hrs to draw on me (he was free handing with pen) and then finish and it only kept me completely numb and it was total bliss for about 35 40 min and then for me it went from bliss to the worst tattoo pain i have ever felt because there was no time to adjust to the pain. My suggestion is to use this cream which I have to tell you a trick you must make sure after you apply this cream you put the saran wrap on as tight as you can do not let any air get in or it will not work at all!!!!!!!! thats where i think people were having there problems of it not working for them. But I will use the cream again, I will use it to get through the outline then I will pair it with a product called Inkeeze, which only works and truly does after the skin has been broken ex.after the outline has been done. If I had gotten a small tattoo this would have been the best tattoo experience of my life but sadly it was not. I also will say that the reviews and youtube videos I watched said it worked fully through a 3-4 hr tattoo which i find very surprising but everyone reacts differently to these types of products , it also stated it made it just as easy to tattoo for the artist and it made it harder for mine to get the ink saturated enough to make it stay he said he could tell when the product started to wear off because the skin was easier to penetrate just a little tid bit of info. I hope this helps some people, but I will only use the product in pairing with inkeee! enjoy and good luck</li>
            <li> i am doing laser in my face (i am a guy,so very coarse and thick hair), at first session almost punch the poor lady, the pain was...WAW,&lt;br /&gt;today i used this and so much difference, i could feel the laser but was very reasonable, the effect last for about&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes, after that you are on your own again ;)&lt;br /&gt;i start applying the cream about an hour before in normal coats, every 10-15 minutes,did about 5 coats and&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s it, still have enough for next month</li>
            <li> This is my first review because I couldn&#x27;t leave this product without reviewing. I was skeptical but this product proved me wrong. Ladies go get a painless brazilian :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is good but you have to use the entire tube on one tattoo which I guess is fine and for best results you have to wrap whatever area you getting tattooed with plastic wrap at least 2 hours before and then the numbing does not last long. I gave it 4 stars just because it did numb the area but not for long :(</li>
            <li> I applied dr numb 1 hour before my tattoo. Sat in the tattoo chair for 3 hours and was basically numb the whole time, with the exception of a few spots here and there. Make sure you apply the cream liberally.</li>
            <li> Works very good.  Each time I need to go in to have my lasic work down to remove hair from my body I put it on.  Can&#x27;t feel the zap at all.  My only complaint is that the product was past the pull date.  It had expired six months earlyier.  The tube is also small.  Looks can be deceiving but I have more then enough product for what I need.</li>
            <li> Decent cream works for a bit in tattoos but then you feel the sting again I guess it does what it suppose to do</li>
            <li> I used this first on a huge black and gray tattoo on an upper back. It was our second session. After a lot of pain on the first round, we decided to give Dr Numb a shot. I put the whole tube on, covered and waited 1-1/2 hours. It worked great for 1-1/2 hours before he started feeling anything. From there on it was wearing off but still seamed to make a difference for a couple more hours. Since this tattoo, other tattoo artist in my shop have tried it but did not have as good results but I don&#x27;t know the details of how they applied it. It&#x27;s definitely with the shot</li>
            <li> kind of works, not real good, but I suppose its the maximum strength that you could get over the counter though..???</li>
            <li> I used the cream on my leg for a tattoo.....well it didn&#x27;t help one bit.  I only used it on the sensitive areas but I think I would&#x27;ve been better off just taking pain meds.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i thought it wouldnt work... But i gave it a try for my 4 inch detailed tattoo! I dd NOT feel ANYTHING for 3 hours.. Only the last shading part did i feel a little pain ! So amazing ! I will be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> OMG!, Dr. Numb is the best. I wanted to get a tattoo but didn&#x27;t want to experience the pain.  I researched for weeks and finally decided to try Dr. numb. This was the best investment I made. I applied a thick layer and wraped with plastic wrap for 1 1/2 hours, While getting my tattoo I didn&#x27;t feel a thing for at least an hour into the secession. Great for small or medium size tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;My tattoo was farelly large so I also purchased a bottle of Vaso-Caine numbing spray which also works great however ur skin must be broken for it to work. Without these two products I don&#x27;t think I could have went thru with getting a tattoo. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because Dr.Numb doesn&#x27;t come with directions, However the product is  A \\&quot;must Have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  After going through 8 sessions of laser hair removal around my genitals (something my wife wanted me to to do) without any assistance from a topical anesthetic, I finally had enough.  On the next sesssion I tried \\&quot;Lanocane\\&quot; cream from the pharmacy, applied about an hour before.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or maney, as this had next to no effect.  After that session I did some research online and Dr. Numb kept appearing in my searches.  The reviews were mixed, but positive on balance.  I also chatted online with someone from the company regarding my specific application.  The key is how it is applied.  Put it on thickly, making sure to cover the entire target area.  DO NOT rub it in!  Instead, cover it with plastic wrap.  The occlusive dressing (plastic wrap) is critical, as this makes sure the active agent only has one place to go - into the skin.  I applied about 75 minutes before my treatment and I hardly felt a thing (apart from finding the areas I missed!  Note to self: be more thorough/liberal next time).  What I did feel was not painful.  The technician also increased the intensity of the laser, as my hair has been particularly stubborn.  It is not a further 2 hours since the treatment (over 3 since I applied Dr. Numb) and everything down there is still quite numb.  Excellent product, well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the 30g tube looks like it will last at least two treatments.  Also, maximum numbing seemed to occur after about 90 minutes and remains for a good hour after that, then slowly fades.  Something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time Dr. Numb did work- I am 36 hours deep &amp; only half way there on my tattoo- It&#x27;s a full all around front &amp; back- from upper ribs just under breasts to just an inch above my woo-hoo &amp; to boot it&#x27;s covering sensitive stretch marks( yes ladies its covering my grand canyon marks like a champ) - but hell- the tubes were metal ( pain in the butt) &amp; the cream was a nice thick white cream- I ordered that $ 299. Direct off Dr. Numb website- That stuff WORKED great- I literally fell asleep- my tattoo artist is a saint she works w me- I&#x27;m not a Dr. Numb rookie - now I ordered DR. Numb off Amazon- &amp; it&#x27;s a different box- Tube &amp; it appears like a watered down version- I followed directions of course- &amp; IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL- I will try once again the DR.Numb official website- but NEVER again off AMAZON</li>
            <li> I used as directed didn&#x27;t numb at all I do not recommended this to anyone waste of money !!!!!! Don&#x27;t buy Dr numb from Amazon</li>
            <li> Okay so I have not used this product yet. I am heavily tattooed, head to toe and everything in between, completing a full body suit and probably about 70% done. Now one side of my chest is completed and connected to my sleeve while the other is not. As a lean guy with minimal fat the chest has always been a real sore spot for me. I bought this product with the intention to use on my empty chest plate that I will be tattooing at the end of the month - I will chime in at that point with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the reviews where guys are saying the gel sucks but the cream is good and so on. I received the cream version with the 5% lidocaine - apparently this is the preferred version and the gel version is inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with people receiving the gel and others the cream has to do with the seller. Even though items are fulfilled thru amazon the sellers may vary. There are several sellers that amazon deals with and fulfills orders thru. I cannot speak for others but \\&quot;HealthTime\\&quot; was the seller amazon fulfilled my order thru and I got the cream. So before adding the cream to cart make sure you check the other seller options. Amazon usually only displays the cheapest eligible seller on the main page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll follow up after my session at the end of the month as to how the cream held up. Prior to this upcoming experience I have never used any numbing agents ever. Even if it works i&#x27;d say it is only suited for those odd painful spots and not large pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note I also consulted with 3 different tattoo artists I know and they all say dr. numb specifically will not effect the tattoo process on their end nor will it effect the end result of the tattoo in terms of healing and quality etc.. That was a big concern of mine and I read mixed things online. Chris Brown also uses this stuff - heard via a radio interview and he is not paid to endorse the product either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 5 stars based on me receiving theitem quickly. It will remain 5 stars even if it helps a little during a very painful session. $20 bucks to ease a great deal of pain if worth it to me. The worst areas I have been tatteooed are as follows; chest, elbows, back of the thigh. If this cream reduced the pain by even a quarter amount I&#x27;m a happy camper. Again I will follow up shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tattooing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**follow up review** dec. 29, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so I had my appointment today. I applied the cream about 2hrs before my appointment. I rubbed a ton of the cream in thoroughly, then applied almost as much as a layer on top, saran wrapped it(btw I used about 75% of the tube). When I got to the shop we didn&#x27;t get down to tattooing until another hour later(3 hours since applying cream in total) because of tattoo placement etc.. etc.. anyhow during the whole time the stencil was applied, some freehand stuff was added, I could not feel a thing, nothing at all! the stuff worked, I was totally numb. Commence tattooing, I felt nothing once again! so i&#x27;m pretty stoked at this point.. 20-30min in I could feel the tattoo pain as normal. I attribute the cream wearing off to two things; 1 being a extra hour was wasted due to us not tattooing right away but more than likely(and my artist agreed) the wiping, as he tattooed he wipes from time to time, and it coincided with the pain progressing with the wipes. So the cream does work but not for long, in my case at least. I&#x27;d recommend it for small tattoos or if you really just need to reduce pain even for a short time as it is just that bad. The pain that resumed was not any worse than had I not used the cream and even then the cream may have lessened it slightly still, who knows. This stuff is $50 bucks here in canada, and oddly enough their office is in my city of Vancouver, yet it is $20 in the u.s. lol. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for $50 but for $20 I think it was worth it and I don&#x27;t feel like I got scammed or duped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note during the last bit of my tattoo my artist asked if I wanted some numbing spray. The numbing spray works like the numbing cream only it has to be used on broken skin, already tattooed skin. He sprayed a bit on, saran wrap for 5min and once again I felt nothing for the remainder of my tattoo! He has also used numbing cream in the past and said it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. Will I be buying numbing cream again? probably not. All my tough areas are already tattooed so I can go without it. I have a tiny bit left in the tub I may or may not use it in 3 weeks when I tattoo my back, it probably isn&#x27;t worth it.. likely save it for a small tattoo down the road or give it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**follow up**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a few days since my tattoo. i am going to follow up with one other thing here. normally i heal perfectly, no weeping no pain etc.. for the first time ever my tattoo wept for 2 days. i&#x27;d have to wash it every few hours with warm water/baby soap to keep it clean, few hours later or if i got hot it would weep and be sticky again. it isn&#x27;t weeping anymore but the tattoo itself is a bit painful and my tattoos are never painful. a tattoo artist friend said the area probably just got aggravated. it tattooed a sensitive area for myself and went beyond what i normally would due to numbing agents. so if you use any numbing creams/sprays just tattoo for as long as you normally would if u were not using anything. if you go beyond your normal threshold it may make the healing process a bit worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i doubt ill be using numbing agents again. i have 100+ hours of being tattooed normally so why bother now i figure.</li>
            <li> doesnt work for sure please dont waste money on something like this please dont get it.. waste of money to buy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims to. The numb effect starts wearing off after an hour. But when it is numb, you dont feel a thing.</li>
            <li> It works just fantastic.i do laser my chicks and front neck ,since I use Dr.numb I&#x27;m happy to go to remove my hair..&lt;br /&gt;I feel almost nothing when I use Dr.Numb ,it&#x27;s amazing how it works.&lt;br /&gt;I really want to thank the inventor of this product because now laser  is fun.</li>
            <li> I used this on my second foot tattoo and it really took the edge off. Of course you can still feel your tattoo, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant, but this REALLY HELP! Make sure to follow the instructions though!!</li>
