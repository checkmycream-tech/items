            <li>I got this for my dying sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li>She was quite pleased!  </li>
            <li>, SO I DID NOT SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES, WHEN I ASKED MY MOM</li>
            <li>IF SHE LIKED THE BUBBLE BATH</li>
            <li>IN THERE, EVERYTHING WAS NICE, BUT</li>
            <li>She liked it and use every day.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>The bottles are large and it just looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>My friend is very pleased with this fabulous basket.</li>

            <li>Full of all kinds of bath heaven!</li>
            <li>If there was one fault, I&#x27;d have to say it is that the fizzy things don&#x27;t pack a strong punch.</li>

            <li> This was nothing even close to what was pictured. It arrived all broken up. DO NOT waste your money. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this basket as part of my anniversary present for my wife. Well the shipping on it said 5-6 days or something like that so i ordered it in the appropriate time in order for it to arrive on the day or day before. This was a Friday, well much to my surprise the box shows up at my house on Monday!!    Once I gave it to my wife, she took a two hour bath and said she has never been so pleased with a bath set. It was well worth the money and i will definitely order from this company again.     If there was one fault, I&#x27;d have to say it is that the fizzy things don&#x27;t pack a strong punch. other than that, nice strong aroma but not too strong. the product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Looks great can&#x27;t wait for my wife to use it</li>
            <li> This gift basket looks exactly as it does in the picture. The bottles are large and it just looks beautiful. I can smell the lavender through the plastic wrapped basket-- very nice. I haven&#x27;t gifted it yet so  Ido not know the quality of the items, but it does look very good. I wish I got this as a gift! I know my neighbor will love it when it is given to her.</li>
            <li> bought for gift for business</li>

            <li> fast delivery, pretty, smells nice, as advertised, very nice my mom loved it, I thought the price was a little high though.....&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS A GIFT, SO I DID NOT SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES, WHEN I ASKED MY MOM IF SHE LIKED THE BUBBLE BATH, THAT THE DESCRIPTION LISTED AS THE FIRST ITEM IN THE BASKET, SHE SAID THERE WAS NO BUBBLE BATH IN THERE, EVERYTHING WAS NICE, BUT THE REASON I PICKED THIS BASKET WAS I WANTED THE BUBBLE BATH AND IT DIDN&#x27;T HAVE IT IN THERE VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for her. She liked it and use every day. I am happy with this purchased.</li>
            <li> Sent to my step mom for her birthday, she loved it! Full of all kinds of bath heaven! I recommend it for any of your family and friends who like pampering.</li>

            <li> My wife loves the items and if she is happy I&#x27;m happy. Thank you and I will purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as birthday pressie for woman with everything. Looks really attractive and smells great. We use a display item next to the tub. Great product for the price, looks nice when wrapped or ribboned  as I did. Recommend over Bat, Body works overpriced gift boxes etc.</li>
            <li> My sister absolutely loved this basket.  She says it was high quality and abundant with lavender products to pamper even the most discerning woman.</li>
            <li> the person I bought this gift for passed. I tried to return it only to find it could not be returned - the reason &amp;#34;it requires special&lt;br /&gt;transportation and handling which we cannot provide.&amp;#34; The package was left at my front door in a plain cardboard box. So much for&lt;br /&gt;special handling. I dont know about the quality of this produce since I have not opened it however because of this very lame,at best,&lt;br /&gt;excuse I will not buy from this vendor again. the only reason I gave it at least one star is because a star rating is required.</li>
            <li> Gifted my mom for her birthday. It doesn&#x27;t have many things in the basket as shown in the picture or either replaced with different items.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Got this for my Mother for Christmas. The basket is packed with things just like in the picture. The scent is really nice. She was very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  When I got it, it was exactly as pictured.  I got this for my dying sister and she loved it. Lavender is supposed to be soothing.</li>
            <li> Luxurious, calming, and generous.</li>
            <li> The service was excellent, and the gift arrived in time! My friend is very pleased with this fabulous basket. It is a great option to give it as a gift, for any occasions. Success guaranteed!</li>
            <li> My basket was semi-ok...but instead of a body massager, they gave me an object for my wrists at my keyboard to not get carpal tunnel.  It &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; like a massager, but I had no idea what it was until I googled the company on the side of it and it is for resting your hands on at the computer.  It came with a sweet pea scented rose petals instead of lavender and my &#x27;pedicure set&#x27; was already opened and looked all of $1 quality.  Very disappointed with this package as I received it as a gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a relative who was convalescing. She was quite pleased!  She loves the smell of lavender and really enjoyed pampering herself with all the goodies.</li>
            <li> very poor quality and poorly put together</li>
