If you&#x27;re looking for something big and flashy this may not be for you. It&#x27;s small and simple but very pretty and will be lovely paired with a veil. Perfect for a bride like me!</li>
            <li> This tiara is so pretty and it adjusted to my head size perfectly. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it to the One Direction concert I&#x27;m going to for my birthday in July!</li>
            <li> The picture does not do its justice! I had so many compliments and felt like a princess on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my October wedding, and was so taken aback by its beauty! It is far more delicate-looking and sparkly than the pics here show. I have a rather large cranium, but it doesn&#x27;t squeeze, and I know it&#x27;s the perfect tiara to complete my ensemble. So pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I had to return this item and I found one that was SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty but it&#x27;s very small... check the size and it doesn&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;combs on the end... just loops that are not as functional.  Keep shopping!</li>
            <li> I love the tiara. It&#x27;s very pretty. I tried it on my head and it bent out of shape. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll still work for the wedding.</li>
            <li> Wore this on my wedding day and it looked great. It was a little uncomfortable, I wish it would&#x27;ve had a shorter band but it all worked out well!</li>
            <li> So happy with this product!  The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. The way the metal is situated creates so much sparkle which really adds to what&#x27;s already going on with the stones. I&#x27;m so excited to wear this on my wedding day!!</li>
            <li> as described, no surprises</li>
            <li> Great looking, it tarnished after 6 months from so much use.</li>
            <li> The  bridal princess was well made the only down fall is my daughter has a lot of hair so since it is small and her hair swallowed up the hair piece. Unfortunely I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> I purchased the tiara for my wedding in June. I wanted to look like a princess and I believe I will. The tiara sparkles and shines. It can easily be adjusted to fit, and it was quite inexpensive. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I know it says a guy bought this but this is his fiance I bought it for my wedding day :).This tiara is stunning. I was amazed by the quality and it is a really good price for how nice it looks. There were ones at Claire&#x27;s and Icing at the mall for fifteen dollars and they weren&#x27;t half as nice. I am really glad I found this tiara. Thank you.</li>
