            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first type of razor/blades I&#x27;ve used but is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My favorite razors!  </li>
            <li>The Sensor Excel for Women fits the bill and gives a great shave smooth shave without a lot of nicks.  </li>
            <li>These are the best blades for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We go through a lot of these shavers and it&#x27;s really nice to just automatically get more every 3 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that I can buy these cartridges on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>Merchandise received intact and satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>These razor blades can&#x27;t be found in stores, but the razor is our favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand of razor cartridge for many years</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>works real good since I started using this ten years ago&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom and I love this razor and could not find replacement blades for it in stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them on Amazon because my grocery store stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li>So glad to have these</li>
            <li>Will use these till they stop manufacturing them :)</li>
            <li>My Sensor Excel is still my favorite razor after all these years.</li>
            <li>Love the razors.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do much better on ebay.</li>
            <li>These are still my favorite razors after a decade.</li>
            <li>and they replace the original!  </li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll buy them again and learn to be happy with the new blade and handle designs that are on the market.</li>
            <li>I sure couldn&#x27;t tell; they both work fine.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they are available online.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and the shape of the razor is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ahhhhh thanks for the supply of refills...too many choices to choose from NICE to see you have what I need.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is the best product I have ever used to shave my legs.</li>
            <li>I stayed with them for two reasons: the handle is super comfortable and easy to grip, and the blades are sharp with a perfect angle.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of razors and these simple blades and this large handle just seem to work the best.</li>
            <li>The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn&#x27;t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage</li>
            <li>The aloe strip on the blades leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the same great blades that I used for 25 years.</li>
            <li>It did not even come close to giving the smooth, close shave these blades do.</li>
            <li>A guy at the local flea market had a great price on Women&#x27;s Sensor Excels.</li>
            <li>They shave great and the only difference I could see  </li>
            <li>No other razor has given me as good of a shave since these were discontinued.  </li>
            <li>O was so excited to find these since stores no longer carry them.</li>
            <li>The newer products just don&#x27;t give you as nice of a shave as this old one.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself (sold separately) has a wide, sturdy grip so you have good control over the razor as you shave minimizing cuts and keep the blade close to the skin, giving a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I love my flat razor with the grippy texture, it is the best shape and form for tight control over shaving.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaving for years, i&#x27;ve tried different ones but this one is my all time favorite, the blades are just right for my skin to feel because i shave everyday during shower, perfect products should be shared!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy refills from Amazon for as long as I can, rather than the latest higher-priced razor systems that don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not been able to get a response from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The curve of the handle fits my hand just right and its so compact that it travels with me well.  </li>
            <li>The strip fell off the first blade I used.</li>
            <li>is just as ineffective as the first although it hasn&#x27;t fallen off, yet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m headed back to the flea market to see if he has any more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I am so passionate about a razor, but I really do love this so much!</li>
            <li>Some of us happen to LIKE the older products!  </li>
            <li>I have been using sensor shaver since I was in high school, when they first came out thirty years ago or so.  </li>
            <li>I just want a simple, re-fillable shaver without 20 blades and huge amounts of packaging.  </li>
            <li>To me these are no different then cheap bics.</li>
            <li>What happened to the generic razor blades that used to be available?  </li>
            <li>Amazon had a much lower cost than buying in retail store.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with them.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>Cost is reasonable too.</li>
            <li>After going to countless grocery and drugstores looking for these cartridges to fit my razor, I finally tried on-line to see if &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; supplies were available.  </li>
            <li>After wasting so much money, I missed them so much that I searched all over to find them online, and of course Amazon came through for me.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>really tics me off.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the first time I used this item</li>
            <li>Much better shave than the other womens razors.</li>
            <li>it felt good while I was shaving, but after it was not very smooth and left my skin very irritated.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor (a very wide handle) and blade, so all pluses with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the razor because of its wide handle, which makes it so easy to hold onto even with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>I just need a new razor body!  </li>
            <li>Then the new razor is reasonable to buy they just charge you an arm and a leg for the cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s wide handle is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see that I can get another handle here at Amazon, but why are the women&#x27;s handles so much more expensive than the men&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>I know this razor is an older one, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor (Gillette Venus) out of the water.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for years and it has become increasingly difficult to find blades for it, so happy to have found these.</li>
            <li>Like others I tried without success to find refills in a local store.</li>
            <li>They only have two blades, unlike newer ones with three or four, so your shave might not be quite as smooth, but these are definitely dependable and high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cartridges that last far longer than I would have expected, providing a smooth shave, but every once is while I get a fresh cartridge that may nick me every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Now I find that I have to change it out for a new one weekly.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without these blades.</li>
            <li>When I could not find these replacement blades, I tried one of the new 4 blade razors.</li>
            <li>On the women&#x27;s blade the plastic body is white and the rubber ribs and lube strip are light blue and that is IT.</li>
            <li>I love these razors and the cartridges are getting increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I have stuck with the old fashioned skinny handle though.  </li>
            <li>this razor must be 10 years old</li>
            <li>There is no other razor out there like this.  </li>
            <li>However, the moisture strip on these particular blades is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I like how this razor works and they do not get dull easily like other ones.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is hard to find an economical price at stores .</li>

            <li> They only have two blades, unlike newer ones with three or four, so your shave might not be quite as smooth, but these are definitely dependable and high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cartridges that last far longer than I would have expected, providing a smooth shave, but every once is while I get a fresh cartridge that may nick me every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Now I find that I have to change it out for a new one weekly.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these blades.</li>
            <li> When I could not find these replacement blades, I tried one of the new 4 blade razors.</li>
            <li> On the women&#x27;s blade the plastic body is white and the rubber ribs and lube strip are light blue and that is IT.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and the cartridges are getting increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have stuck with the old fashioned skinny handle though.  </li>
            <li> this razor must be 10 years old</li>
            <li> There is no other razor out there like this.  </li>
            <li> However, the moisture strip on these particular blades is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I like how this razor works and they do not get dull easily like other ones.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is hard to find an economical price at stores .</li>
            <li> One refill used to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They work well last long and does the job.</li>
            <li> Gillette customer service told me some utter nonsense about extra edge guards on this blade that might hamper getting into tight places and somebody said the lube strip was different.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see why any cartridge needs more than two blades, one for pulling the hair up and one for cutting the lifted part.</li>
            <li> but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Been using this razor too long to change now and amazon has the blades too.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for multiple uses.  </li>
            <li> The wide, flat handle of the women&#x27;s sensor razor eliminates rolling in your hand when shaving, minimizing the possibility of cuts, as well.</li>
            <li> The smooth action of the blades minimizes the risk of bad cuts.</li>
            <li> One of the stupid things in the country is when a great product comes out and then after a few years, other brands come out</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d been using the same old cartridge for much too long, and didn&#x27;t even realize how bad it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find the razors for it.  </li>
            <li> Much smoother, less irritating.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and work well with my razor.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m finding that they do not stay as sharp as they used to.</li>
            <li> The rubber grippy edge also helps lift the hair and the strip on the other side</li>
            <li> I resorted to trying other brands after I couldn&#x27;t find these in store anymore.  </li>
            <li> I found all the new brands have the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; head, which just results in the blade slipping and cutting you, and the blade not staying close to the skin</li>
            <li> Initially I was cutting myself constantly, which was never a problem with the Venus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I can find the blades a few dollars cheaper at Target or Wal-Mart than on-line.</li>
            <li> I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> the blades are hard to find since tt don&#x27;t carry them no more</li>
            <li> Hard to find this type of razor</li>
            <li> These Sensor Gillette razors are impossible to find in stores, so not sure if they are still made.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but these razors are quite expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li> And, why on EARTH is it so stinkin&#x27; expensive?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think this item was discontinued in stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was nothing wrong with the Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li> After two or three blades it is pointless &amp; the prices are outrageous.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what,</li>
            <li> I get frustrated when they discontinue items.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m buying them all!</li>
            <li> I thought I might switch to one of the newer versions (Venus), but I HATED it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but these razors are quite expensive in the stores.  Have seen them upwards of $24!!  Happy girl here!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see what all the hype is about these razors. I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor (Gillette Venus) out of the water. Big mistake. To me these are no different then cheap bics. Initially I was cutting myself constantly, which was never a problem with the Venus. Then the razor burn which was so unbearable that I had to slather my legs in aloe for relief. The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn&#x27;t even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs. So I don&#x27;t know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what, but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money! Back to Venus!</li>
            <li> Sharp and work well with my razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that I can buy these cartridges on Amazon.  They are also cheaper than the ones I buy in stores.  I have been using this razor for many years.  I had two handles, but lost one.  When I went to look for a replacement in the stores, I couldn&#x27;t find one and figured Gillette had discontinued the Sensor Excel for Women.  I thought I might switch to one of the newer versions (Venus), but I HATED it.  I just want a simple, re-fillable shaver without 20 blades and huge amounts of packaging.  The Sensor Excel for Women fits the bill and gives a great shave smooth shave without a lot of nicks.  The shaver&#x27;s wide handle is easy to use.  Glad to see that I can get another handle here at Amazon, but why are the women&#x27;s handles so much more expensive than the men&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to find cartridges for my Gillette Sensor razor for a year or more.  I love the razor because of its wide handle, which makes it so easy to hold onto even with wet hands.  I was about to give up when I checked Amazon.com.[[ASIN:B001G7PMW2 Gillette Sensor Excel Cartridges, 5-Count Packages (Pack of 2)]]  The cartridges arrived within days, and now I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Merchandise received intact and satisfied with the product. Yes, it is hard to find an economical price at stores . Therefore, I was pleased with the price given thank you again!</li>
            <li> Best razor ever.  I don&#x27;t need 3,4 or 5 blades.  2 is plenty.  Can&#x27;t find the cartridges at the store anymore so I&#x27;m glad they are available online.</li>
            <li> These razor blades can&#x27;t be found in stores, but the razor is our favorite. It is great to be able to get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> What happened to the generic razor blades that used to be available?  They&#x27;re nowhere to be found anymore.  This was the best deal I found.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades for sensitive skin. This isn&#x27;t the first type of razor/blades I&#x27;ve used but is the best I&#x27;ve used. The smooth action of the blades minimizes the risk of bad cuts. The aloe strip on the blades leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can find the blades a few dollars cheaper at Target or Wal-Mart than on-line.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because al the reviews said it was a great shave and great for snesitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and the first time I used this item it felt good while I was shaving, but after it was not very smooth and left my skin very irritated.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand and style of blade for years. Amazon had a much lower cost than buying in retail store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of razor cartridge for many years and I&#x27;ve always been happy with them. They shave very nicely and do not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for men too!</li>
            <li> I love these razors and the cartridges are getting increasingly hard to find.  The shave is close and the shape of the razor is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great, cheaper than purchasing them at Walmart and without having to find help since they are in a locked cabinet.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these razor refills anywhere but online and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m buying them all! These are the best razors for me. I get a very close shave with them. However I&#x27;m finding that they do not stay as sharp as they used to. One refill used to last me a long time. Now I find that I have to change it out for a new one weekly. I&#x27;ll still keep buying them though!</li>
            <li> These are the same great blades that I used for 25 years. I stayed with them for two reasons: the handle is super comfortable and easy to grip, and the blades are sharp with a perfect angle. However, the moisture strip on these particular blades is dry and brittle. The strip fell off the first blade I used. I&#x27;m on the second blade and the moisture strip is just as ineffective as the first although it hasn&#x27;t fallen off, yet.  My legs look like they&#x27;ve been through a paper shredder. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy them again and learn to be happy with the new blade and handle designs that are on the market.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who accidently packed his wife&#x27;s \\&quot;chick\\&quot; blade when he went on a business trip and he figured what the heck I&#x27;ll try it.  Said it was the best shave he ever had and he has stuck to \\&quot;chick\\&quot; blades ever since.  I decided to try it.  These blades are better/last longer than the ones for men.  Much smoother, less irritating.  I&#x27;ve been using them for several years now.  I have stuck with the old fashioned skinny handle though.  :)</li>
            <li> These are the best razors ever!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.  Delivered before date promised.</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount of blades. Have been using this type of blade for about 10 years. They work well last long and does the job.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor too long to change now and amazon has the blades too. I must have had my last one for maybe 20 years so they are well made.</li>
            <li> Best deal out there for these guys!  I just need a new razor body!  I have used these since 1989!  haha</li>
            <li> O was so excited to find these since stores no longer carry them. I will be a customer got life</li>
            <li> I really like the silk effects razor and Amazon is the only place I can buy blades for it.  Cost is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh thanks for the supply of refills...too many choices to choose from NICE to see you have what I need.</li>
            <li> One of the stupid things in the country is when a great product comes out and then after a few years, other brands come out and they replace the original!  Some of us happen to LIKE the older products!  The newer products just don&#x27;t give you as nice of a shave as this old one.  The stores don&#x27;t even sell this anymore.  And, why on EARTH is it so stinkin&#x27; expensive?  What are the razors made of, gold?!  Thanks for offering this product!</li>
            <li> There is no other razor out there like this.  The curve of the handle fits my hand just right and its so compact that it travels with me well.  The blades seem to last forever!.  Why this was ever discontinued is beyond me.  Thank you Amazon for still carrying the blades and the SensorExcel razor.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this product.</li>
            <li> works real good since I started using this ten years ago&lt;br /&gt;however the blades are hard to find since tt don&#x27;t carry them no more</li>
            <li> Very good, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These Sensor Gillette razors are impossible to find in stores, so not sure if they are still made.  Nevertheless, once I find a razor I like I try to continue using it.  This is the best &amp;#34;women&#x27;s razor&amp;#34; with refillable blades I&#x27;ve found, so I&#x27;m glad to have found the replacement blades.  Because they are Gillette, they always work well.</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this razor and could not find replacement blades for it in stores.  I was very happy when I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever tried,love cartriges with aloe and Vit E.  Hope they&#x27;ll never sop selling them!</li>
            <li> Very nice to be able to order things like this and have them delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these blades. I love my flat razor with the grippy texture, it is the best shape and form for tight control over shaving. I buy bunches of these at a time in fear that they may be discontinued in favor of bloated 4 and 5 bladed monstrosities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see why any cartridge needs more than two blades, one for pulling the hair up and one for cutting the lifted part. The pair is enough for leveling the surface to the skin. The rubber grippy edge also helps lift the hair and the strip on the other side help the cartridge glide across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give 4 stars is about quality control. I&#x27;ve used cartridges that last far longer than I would have expected, providing a smooth shave, but every once is while I get a fresh cartridge that may nick me every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Much better shave than the other womens razors.</li>
            <li> These razor blades I have ever used. They stay sharp for multiple uses.  I&#x27;m glad I found them on Amazon because my grocery store stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor (a very wide handle) and blade, so all pluses with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad to have these</li>
            <li> Will use these till they stop manufacturing them :)</li>
            <li> My favorite razors!  I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using sensor shaver since I was in high school, when they first came out thirty years ago or so.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find the razors for it.  I knew amazon would have them.  It&#x27;s a great razor.  I don&#x27;t think we need five blades on a cartridge.  After two or three blades it is pointless &amp; the prices are outrageous.</li>
            <li> I know this razor is an older one, but I like it.  I get frustrated when they discontinue items. Then the new razor is reasonable to buy they just charge you an arm and a leg for the cartridges.  I was very happy to find the refills for my razor at Amazon.  Amazon is a wonderful place to find the things you like when they aren&#x27;t in the stores any longer.</li>
            <li> He utilizado este producto por más de 10 años y lamentablemente en el país donde vivo ya no venden los repuestos de las navajillas, por lo que recurro a Amazon para adquirirlas.  La nueva versión de razuradora desechable para mujeres de Guillete \\&quot;Venus\\&quot; no me agrada, ya que su mango es muy delgado, comparada con la Sensor Excel for Women, que es ancho y muy práctico para manipular con las manos mojadas y que de paso ayuda para evitar cortes indeseados en la piel.  Mientras vendan los respuestos en Amazon, los seguiré comprando.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for years and it has become increasingly difficult to find blades for it, so happy to have found these.</li>
            <li> After going to countless grocery and drugstores looking for these cartridges to fit my razor, I finally tried on-line to see if &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; supplies were available.  Score!</li>
            <li> Very good. Cheaper than in the store when I ordered.</li>
            <li> We go through a lot of these shavers and it&#x27;s really nice to just automatically get more every 3 months</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaving for years, i&#x27;ve tried different ones but this one is my all time favorite, the blades are just right for my skin to feel because i shave everyday during shower, perfect products should be shared!!</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can ever find these razor blades anymore! These blades aren&#x27;t fancy, but they get the job done! My Sensor Excel is still my favorite razor after all these years. They only have two blades, unlike newer ones with three or four, so your shave might not be quite as smooth, but these are definitely dependable and high quality.</li>
            <li> When I could not find these replacement blades, I tried one of the new 4 blade razors. It did not even come close to giving the smooth, close shave these blades do. The wide, flat handle of the women&#x27;s sensor razor eliminates rolling in your hand when shaving, minimizing the possibility of cuts, as well. Hands down, this is the best product I have ever used to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> Love the razors.  Wish price was a bit lower.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think this item was discontinued in stores so I had to buy a bunch of them on online. The only razor I use since it never cut me.</li>
            <li> I wish they still sold these in store.  No other razor has given me as good of a shave since these were discontinued.  I resorted to trying other brands after I couldn&#x27;t find these in store anymore.  After wasting so much money, I missed them so much that I searched all over to find them online, and of course Amazon came through for me.  I buy them in bulk because I&#x27;m always scared Amazon will stop carrying them and I&#x27;ll be stuck having to settle for another razor, so I like to keep a year (or two&#x27;s) supply stocked.  The razor itself (sold separately) has a wide, sturdy grip so you have good control over the razor as you shave minimizing cuts and keep the blade close to the skin, giving a smooth shave.  I found all the new brands have the &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; head, which just results in the blade slipping and cutting you, and the blade not staying close to the skin so you don&#x27;t get a very close shave.  I can&#x27;t believe I am so passionate about a razor, but I really do love this so much!</li>
            <li> Hard to find this type of razor and I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon. I like how this razor works and they do not get dull easily like other ones.</li>
            <li> I am in the unenviable position of having ordered a quantity of 3 packages of cartridges and only receiving two.  Once I opened the box they arrived in, it wams a matter of me saying there were only two out of three in the box.  So far, I have not been able to get a response from Amazon.  Because of no response, I will not use Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing wrong with the Gillette blades.  Just shortchanges and out of $18.91.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with the Sensor Excel for years but Costco no longer carries them and giving Wally World $22 for a 10 pack really tics me off. I couldn&#x27;t do much better on ebay. A guy at the local flea market had a great price on Women&#x27;s Sensor Excels. I tried to find out if there was any difference before buying. Gillette customer service told me some utter nonsense about extra edge guards on this blade that might hamper getting into tight places and somebody said the lube strip was different. I took a chance and bought them. They shave great and the only difference I could see  is everything is a different color. On the men&#x27;s blade the plastic body and the rubber ribs are gray and the lube strip is white. On the women&#x27;s blade the plastic body is white and the rubber ribs and lube strip are light blue and that is IT. They are 100% interchangeable. If the chemistry of the lube strip is different I sure couldn&#x27;t tell; they both work fine. Buy which ever one you can get a good deal on. I&#x27;m headed back to the flea market to see if he has any more.</li>
            <li> goes a good job shaving under the arms</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d been using the same old cartridge for much too long, and didn&#x27;t even realize how bad it was. Like others I tried without success to find refills in a local store. I think it&#x27;s the same thing as refills for the Gillette Excel, just a different color, but you can&#x27;t get either in drugstores -- probably a case of planned obsolescence. I&#x27;ll continue to buy refills from Amazon for as long as I can, rather than the latest higher-priced razor systems that don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of razors and these simple blades and this large handle just seem to work the best. this razor must be 10 years old and I just keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> These are still my favorite razors after a decade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cartridge for almost years now.  They don&#x27;t sell this cartridge anymore on any supermarket, groceries, etc.</li>
