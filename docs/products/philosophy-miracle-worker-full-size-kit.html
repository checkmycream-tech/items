    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought the Miracle 15 day sample kit - and was SO impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>This skincare line is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>wonderful product and great price!</li>
            <li>However my skin is looking GREAT just after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>plus they were a great value.</li>
            <li>Man am I glad I did!!</li>
            <li>This kit is truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>The pads are excellent for exfoliation, but don&#x27;t use the pads more than a couple times per week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, miracle worker is fabulous and feels great on your skin!  </li>
            <li>I loved the pads--excellent results with that.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying philosophy and the kit is an excellent value!  </li>
            <li>Good price for a product that I love to use.  </li>
            <li>This kit has gotten rid of some of my sun damage spots and the moisturizer is really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and amazon offered he best price by far!</li>
            <li>After many years of trying \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products that didn&#x27;t deliver, I happened upon Help Me cream by Philosophy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brighter, clearer, more even in tone, and tighter.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>dr. Perricone and my skin was OK.  </li>
            <li>and I love it all.  </li>
            <li>While I love the miracle worker product, this kit was not as advertised on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>i wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I received this kit yesterday, and while I love all Philosophy products I have tried, the kit I received did not contain the eye concentrate.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy products are top quality</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month now and NO rash or pimples and my skin actually feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly well, but after a few months I started using prescription retinol cream, with good results on my \\&quot;expression lines\\&quot; :).</li>
            <li>The primary reason I wanted the kit was the eye cream, so</li>
            <li>The face cream makes your skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I got the Miracle pads and got this kit free with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great products for my dry skin</li>
            <li>If I had purchased these products separately, it would have been a lot more expensive, so this was a great bargain!</li>
            <li>Once I added this to my daily regimen, the results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>This kit works WONDERS in restoring a fresh and youthful complexion.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever get eye crust, even when I fall asleep with make up</li>
            <li>For me, after trying other brands from department stores and such, I find this set is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The products are good but not worth the money I invested.  </li>
            <li>It does not take a ton of steps to get such lovely results.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried this Philosophy skin care set.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been ages since I had such consistently clear skin, and the full kit is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the box was clearly used and the original packaging was ripped.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the results of the exfoliater pads as well as the other items.  </li>
            <li>Back to Philosophy - I read about the Miracle line and having had such a good experience with the Help</li>
            <li>So far the face wash I received instead of the eye cream seems like any old face wash, but I do love the moisturizer and pads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>With this moisturizer, i traded less wrinkles for more acne.</li>
            <li>I do find I used less of each item and still have the smoothest skin, with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I use this kit in combination with PCA lightener and I truly notice the difference, not only on the melisma, but in the general condition of my skin and the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it and went back to another Philosophy moisturizer and that worked fine, and my potential break out vanished.</li>
            <li>I took my daughter to the new Ulta store and saw this product.</li>
            <li>It also minimizes uneven skin tone and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and the products keeping me looking so young.  </li>
            <li>Six year old Brady does not know what to do with his Miracle Worker skin cream and Grandma</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to give a full review.</li>
            <li>I went on the purchase the full size kit sold above, and after using these products for about a month, my skin has gone from dull to, well, maybe not looking like it did when I was 30, but it has improved very, very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, with little success.  </li>
            <li>Apparently i had an allergy or something to the eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried Bare Minerals, Ultima, and even perscription cleansers and makeup to no avail.</li>
            <li>This kit is misleading usually when I get the full lot</li>
            <li>No dry skin or too oily skin.  </li>
            <li>the eye cream which was not worth much</li>
            <li>While I considered returning the kit due to the missing eye cream, I thought it may be more trouble than it was worth due to the ripped packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several high priced HQ-based products, with no noticeable effect for dark patches under my eyes / on my cheekbones.</li>

            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;m concerned about is the retinol pads - 60 of them are over 50 bucks here on Amazon - but they help so much that I&#x27;m going to keep getting them as well - my only complaint is that I think I&#x27;m allergic to something in the eye cream, but I&#x27;m still experimenting with that, as I have no problems with anything else that Philosophy makes.</li>

            <li> It may be expensive, but a little goes a long way, so the products I have will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use it occasionally, since it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I will need to order the eye concentrate separately, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> this was very disappointing to me.  </li>
            <li> disappointed !!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several high priced HQ-based products, with no noticeable effect for dark patches under my eyes / on my cheekbones. Once I added this to my daily regimen, the results have been amazing.  I use this kit in combination with PCA lightener and I truly notice the difference, not only on the melisma, but in the general condition of my skin and the fine lines and wrinkles.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After many years of trying \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products that didn&#x27;t deliver, I happened upon Help Me cream by Philosophy. It worked amazingly well, but after a few months I started using prescription retinol cream, with good results on my \\&quot;expression lines\\&quot; :). However, my skin as a whole was dull, muddy, uneven, and was flaky in different areas, and I was having to use a heavy paste-type foundation to give my skin any life at all - by covering it up!!!! Back to Philosophy - I read about the Miracle line and having had such a good experience with the Help Me cream, I knew I needed to do something radical and soon, too, as we had a family reunion coming up. I bought the Miracle 15 day sample kit - and was SO impressed with the results. I went on the purchase the full size kit sold above, and after using these products for about a month, my skin has gone from dull to, well, maybe not looking like it did when I was 30, but it has improved very, very much. It&#x27;s brighter, clearer, more even in tone, and tighter. I also purchased a Mia here on Amazon, so I&#x27;m using that along with the Philosophy products. I&#x27;m definitely convinced - I&#x27;m a Philosophy girl now! It may be expensive, but a little goes a long way, so the products I have will last a long time. The only thing that I&#x27;m concerned about is the retinol pads - 60 of them are over 50 bucks here on Amazon - but they help so much that I&#x27;m going to keep getting them as well - my only complaint is that I think I&#x27;m allergic to something in the eye cream, but I&#x27;m still experimenting with that, as I have no problems with anything else that Philosophy makes. If you are wavering on spending the money for this kit, remember that 1) this is your FACE you&#x27;re talking about, and 2) you can get a 15 day trial kit that has almost the same items in it. Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying philosophy and the kit is an excellent value!  I cannot believe the difference in my skin.  My favorite is the eye cream.  I was using dr. Perricone and my skin was OK.  However my skin is looking GREAT just after weeks of use.  I shopped around and amazon offered he best price by far!</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosphy skincare for about 5 years now and I love it all.  I am in my 30s and the products keeping me looking so young.  I have used the miracle worker moisturizer for a couple of years now and it is increadible.  I have been using the eye cream for only a few days and I can already tell a difference in the tone and firmness of my eye area.  This skincare line is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> While I love the miracle worker product, this kit was not as advertised on Amazon.  Instead of the eye cream, I received a face wash.  The primary reason I wanted the kit was the eye cream, so this was very disappointing to me.  Additionally, the box was clearly used and the original packaging was ripped.  While I considered returning the kit due to the missing eye cream, I thought it may be more trouble than it was worth due to the ripped packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, miracle worker is fabulous and feels great on your skin!  So far the face wash I received instead of the eye cream seems like any old face wash, but I do love the moisturizer and pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Follow up: seller contacted me and explained there was a miscommunication with what was included in the kit and was extremely helpful in resolving the issue.</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy for a year now.  Great products for my dry skin plus they were a great value.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and great price! I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends. You can see and feel a difference in just a couple of weeks. It is a miracle!</li>
            <li> Good price for a product that I love to use.  The face cream makes your skin feel smooth.  The pads are excellent for exfoliation, but don&#x27;t use the pads more than a couple times per week.  I got that tip at the cosmetic counter that sells Philosphy.</li>
            <li> This kit is truly amazing!  I have dry and sensitive combination skin.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products, with little success.  This kit works WONDERS in restoring a fresh and youthful complexion.  It also minimizes uneven skin tone and fine lines.  I understand why they named it &#x27;Miracle Worker&#x27; !  It&#x27;s been ages since I had such consistently clear skin, and the full kit is so easy to use!  It does not take a ton of steps to get such lovely results.  I could not be happier with this product line. !</li>
            <li> This kit has gotten rid of some of my sun damage spots and the moisturizer is really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Six year old Brady does not know what to do with his Miracle Worker skin cream and Grandma is having a blast with the GI Joe Bravo Character.  You should drug test whoever is gift wrapping the items.</li>
            <li> i wanted to love this product. I really did. I loved the pads--excellent results with that. Apparently i had an allergy or something to the eye cream. Whatever it was made my eye area peel &amp; extremely dry, itchy. The moisturizer is not for people with oily skin. In case philosophy didn&#x27;t know, people with oily skin do get wrinkles. With this moisturizer, i traded less wrinkles for more acne. But for the younger, less wrinkles promise they delivered on the pads.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. I used it for a week and noticed a few main things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Its a complicated 3 step process (I&#x27;m pretty simple and a wash and moisturize is about as involved as I&#x27;d like to get on a daily basis).&lt;br /&gt;2. It made my eyes crust over in the morning. When I stopped using it, the eye crust stopped in the AM. I rarely ever get eye crust, even when I fall asleep with make up on.&lt;br /&gt;3. I broke out in zits on my forehead and chin. I haven&#x27;t had acne like this since my 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to give a full review. I&#x27;ll still use it occasionally, since it&#x27;s so expensive. As far as a nightly regiment, it&#x27;s not for me, as I think over-use of this system caused my skin to be too heavy and I broke out. I stopped using it and went back to another Philosophy moisturizer and that worked fine, and my potential break out vanished.</li>
            <li> I received this kit yesterday, and while I love all Philosophy products I have tried, the kit I received did not contain the eye concentrate.  Instead, it contains anti-aging concentrate, which is a face lotion.  So if you are looking specifically for these 3 products (as I was), buyer beware.  Other than that, they are full-size products and I will be keeping the kit.  I will need to order the eye concentrate separately, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.  I was hoping to see my fading on an age spot that I have on my cheek but no luck.  The products are good but not worth the money I invested.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This kit is misleading usually when I get the full lot I get the antiaging serum but this was only&lt;br /&gt;With the eye cream which was not worth much&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed !!! Rip off ,</li>
            <li> I now use this set regularly having combination skin.  I do find I used less of each item and still have the smoothest skin, with a healthy glow.  No dry skin or too oily skin.  For me, after trying other brands from department stores and such, I find this set is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year, and would be hard-pressed to find another product that is comparable!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried this Philosophy skin care set.  I really liked the results of the exfoliater pads as well as the other items.  I purchased it in March and I still have the eye cream!  Philosophy products are top quality and I truly saw a difference in the way my facial skin looks.  If I had purchased these products separately, it would have been a lot more expensive, so this was a great bargain!</li>
            <li> Finally. I am 44 and my entire life I have been allergic to just about everything you put on your face. I have tried Bare Minerals, Ultima, and even perscription cleansers and makeup to no avail. I took my daughter to the new Ulta store and saw this product. After an hour of debating on weather or not to spend a whopping 80 bucks on yet another facial product that would go in the trash, my daughter talked me into it. I got the Miracle pads and got this kit free with the purchase. Man am I glad I did!! I have been using it for a month now and NO rash or pimples and my skin actually feels wonderful. I have seen a reduction in pore size but nothing yet on the wrinkles. I&#x27;m just tickled I can use this, even the moisturizer. I will definately be trying some of the other products offered. This was money well spent for me.</li>
