            <li>This one fits that bill very nicely.  </li>
            <li>And the color is perfect for most anyone.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair with honey highlights and the color blends with my brows beautifully!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Goes on amazing...</li>
            <li>The texture is really nice also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush on the end of the pencil is also a nice addition.</li>
            <li>this particular color works best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would call this a very light brown.....</li>
            <li>Favorite liner for me.  </li>
            <li>I will.order more from them.</li>
            <li>Love this brow liner.</li>
            <li>The color Blonde is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 30 years and still love it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and cost effective.</li>
            <li>The blonde is the perfect color for my brows because it is not reddish but sort of a light taupe.</li>
            <li>color is warm medium brown with golden sparkle.</li>
            <li>I loved it when I was younger and love it even more as I age</li>
            <li>Never dries out and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, stays all day.  </li>
            <li>Too crayon-like, definitely cheap and comes off in bits which smudge.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has an attached brush to feather your brow.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in stores locally anymore, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have used these for several years and was delighted to find them so accessible.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a light eyebrow liner for years, this seems to be good, but still too dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>First time I have been able to find a color that looks natural.</li>
            <li>This is just purely convenient as I don&#x27;t have to have two tools in my makeup bag to do one job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the brush gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>Most other products on the market for blonde are either to gray toned or more for light brown hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and can no longer find it at retail stores.</li>
            <li>Top pencil is completely different.  </li>
            <li>It matches me exactly.</li>
            <li>Fills in nicely, just use soft short strokes and use the brush on the cap to finish it off.</li>
            <li>The texture makes applying easy and results natural, the colors are soft, they sharpen without breaking off in the sharpener and make a sharp point, and the little brush attached to the top is handy and works to blend.  </li>
            <li>but I am very grateful for these pencils.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is easy to use short little strokes where needed to fill things in, and then go over it with the brush for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Love the blonde color because it&#x27;s not too blonde.</li>
            <li>To dark for light blondes, does not look natural.</li>
            <li>Got to me quickly, efficiently, and was just as expected.  </li>
            <li>The blond color is softer and not harsh as they would be if I used a darker color.</li>
            <li>always gives you a natural looking brow.</li>
            <li>if I was a professional makeup artist this would be in my must haves.</li>
            <li>Goes on naturally and evenly.</li>
            <li>price has gone up considerably.  </li>
            <li>The combination works great for me and my eyebrows are very thin and very blonde.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other drugstore pencils and they are too dark.</li>
            <li>The description doesn&#x27;t mention the little bit of shimmer which I am usually not a fan of in makeup products, however it is very subtle and adds nice dimension to the eyebrow!</li>
            <li>I usually order 2 at a time and they last me for more than a year, using them daily.</li>
            <li>and my eyes are not as sharp (no pun intended) and hands not as steady!  </li>
            <li>pencil is a bit too stiff for the eye, but the texture is right for the brows.</li>
            <li>Came as described, the only thing I noticed was it&#x27;s a little dry, you will need to rub it across your hand a little bit to warm it up.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is too waxy to glide over your brow which means I have to really press it down to get the desired result.  </li>
            <li>Not many offer a pencil that is the right color for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I do not like the style of blondes with dark eyebrows that I see in ads, and in the movies.  </li>
            <li> Less room.</li>

            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil ever made. Goes on amazing...always gives you a natural looking brow. The company I ordered from was great!!! They even sent me a business card...I will.order more from them. This color is probably the only one you&#x27;ll ever need even if your a brunette...It lasts forever...if I was a professional makeup artist this would be in my must haves.</li>
            <li> Love this brow liner. Can&#x27;t find it in stores locally anymore, so I&#x27;m thrilled to find it on Amazon! My very favorite brow liner. Never dries out and applies smoothly. Love the blonde color because it&#x27;s not too blonde.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  I use it with Revlon Brow Fantasy, Pencil and Gel (Dark Blonde). The combination works great for me and my eyebrows are very thin and very blonde. Long lasting! First time I have been able to find a color that looks natural. I do recommend and will buy again!</li>

I have light brown hair with honey highlights and the color blends with my brows beautifully! The little brush on the tip is a bonus.  Can&#x27;t beat it at any price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific color for years. The color works best for my skin tones and hair coloring. Most other products on the market for blonde are either to gray toned or more for light brown hair.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Goes on naturally and evenly.</li>
            <li> Perfect...just what I ordered</li>
            <li> The problem I had with this pencil is that the color is just too dark for me.  I do not like the style of blondes with dark eyebrows that I see in ads, and in the movies.  I cannot find one I like.  Also, this one is a little waxy.</li>

            <li> In my opinion this is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.  I would call this a very light brown.....with no red tones.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years......price has gone up considerably.  I remember paying under a dollar for the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not the product advertised. Completely different color and packaging.  I&#x27;ve been using Prestige Blonde brow pencil for 8 years. Picture on web showed my current product (bottom).  Top pencil is completely different.  Does this look like the pencil advertised?  Now I have to go back and return this to the UPS Store, etc.  Purpose for ordering on line was to save time and this is wasting my time - not very happy.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is too waxy to glide over your brow which means I have to really press it down to get the desired result.  This method sometimes takes off my brows due to the pressure which is a no no.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Eyebrow Pencil Just What I Wanted</li>
            <li> This pencil has some sparkle to it, which is very strange because this is a brow liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is warm medium brown with golden sparkle. It does not really fit my eyebrow color but it works well as an eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil is a bit too stiff for the eye, but the texture is right for the brows.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and cost effective.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a light eyebrow liner for years, this seems to be good, but still too dark.</li>
            <li> Came as described, the only thing I noticed was it&#x27;s a little dry, you will need to rub it across your hand a little bit to warm it up. Came before the estimated delivery date. Would recommend if your looking for a brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde.  I have skinny little eyebrows that need help.  It&#x27;s really hard to find an eyebrow pencil that you can use that isn&#x27;t too dark.  This one fits that bill very nicely.  It is easy to use short little strokes where needed to fill things in, and then go over it with the brush for a more natural look.  I used to by MAC but they&#x27;re $25 each - ouch!  I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and like everything about it.  The texture makes applying easy and results natural, the colors are soft, they sharpen without breaking off in the sharpener and make a sharp point, and the little brush attached to the top is handy and works to blend.  I loved it when I was younger and love it even more as I age and my eyes are not as sharp (no pun intended) and hands not as steady!  In the scheme of life it&#x27;s a small thing but I am very grateful for these pencils.&lt;br /&gt; Rachel, retired Image Consultant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slides smoothly and perfectly match my hair color. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Great brush and pencil together.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these brow pencils. I have very blonde brows and this particular color works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many other drugstore pencils and they are too dark. I hope they keep making these. I usually order 2 at a time and they last me for more than a year, using them daily.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow pencil I can use.  The color Blonde is perfect for me.  It matches me exactly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Too crayon-like, definitely cheap and comes off in bits which smudge. Not a good product at all. Definitely does not compare to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner for the price!! The description doesn&#x27;t mention the little bit of shimmer which I am usually not a fan of in makeup products, however it is very subtle and adds nice dimension to the eyebrow! This has to be the best brow pencil I have found for the price.

            <li> Got to me quickly, efficiently, and was just as expected.  I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find anywhere else. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when I can&#x27;t find this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brow liner for years. I have thin blond brows and this is the best pencil I have found! Fills in nicely, just use soft short strokes and use the brush on the cap to finish it off. works great with the blondest of blondes and also went I went red, looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore which is a bummer, so I order them 2 at a time and they really LAST!</li>
            <li> I have used these for several years and was delighted to find them so accessible. I like having the brush included.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and works as well as the expensive brands.  Goes on smooth and has an attached brush to feather your brow.  The blonde is the perfect color for my brows because it is not reddish but sort of a light taupe.</li>
