            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than stinky pits!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is effective and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The perfect blend of crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li>Like, a LOT more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>what more can I ask for?  </li>
            <li>The gel is ok.  </li>
            <li>Clinical strength has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Works - what more can I say...</li>
            <li>The Sport scent is still my favorite, but this one is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes just from putting a top on.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for the better part of 24 hours without need for re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating.</li>
            <li>World&#x27;s good not to much whitening!</li>
            <li>I jumped for joy when I seen it was clear!</li>
            <li>The clear gel is great because it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li>Super perfumey!</li>
            <li>(It isn&#x27;t cheap but it works).</li>
            <li>Works great last all day</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a cheap perfume smell to it too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that you can put this on at night and have perfectly odor free armpits the entire next day...even after showering!</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Light non greasy, easy to dispense just the right amount, no residue.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, provides all day protection, goes on clear and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and quick.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure it was this that caused it, but I&#x27;m very reluctant to try it again.</li>
            <li>more so I&#x27;ve been looking for a deodorant that really will hold up.</li>
            <li>This is an effective gel as far as gels go.</li>
            <li>Really makes you feel confident while wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, and I think it smells like a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I haven&#x27;t felt embarrassed wearing light colors since hitting puberty.  </li>
            <li>The gel dries quickly; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m soaking right through my hardly-worn clothes.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Secret Clinical Strength, but this gel version isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Love this clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent to be fresh and not cloying.</li>
            <li>noticed right away that I&#x27;m not sweating through my shirts (under the arms)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the gel works as well, and if you apply right after shaving your armpits, prepare for a sting.  </li>
            <li>The directions do tell you to avoid use right after shaving, but I always apply right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for keeping you dry and odorless and does not leave any marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t half as good as the orginal formula.</li>
            <li>My husband sure had fun bringing up how funny that looked for the next week though.</li>
            <li>My neice (Age 15) says she needs more protection than regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The pricing of this product is definitely a better value than my local retailers.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and prevents BO!</li>
            <li>Texas summers are insanely hot.  </li>
            <li>Better than the regular strength</li>
            <li>I tried it when it first came out and have been hooked every since.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes at all.</li>
            <li>clear gel is more pleasant to use than the white stuff if you wear dark colored</li>
            <li>which is more powerful without being harsh.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am very smelly when it comes to sweat.  </li>
            <li>absolutely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It really is a life changer for people who suffer from smelly pits</li>
            <li>and I think it causes one of my arms to sweat more than the other.</li>
            <li>Once you turn the dial (and turn it and turn it and turn it and turn it) to finally bring the gel to the surface, where you can dispense it, the gel starts around the middle of the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; (in the word &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;) and goes to the top.</li>
            <li>The gel works much better than other deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant and being clear you don&#x27;t get the big white circles on your black dresses under the arms.  </li>
            <li>I love a gel over a solid any day (thus the reason I didn&#x27;t give it only 1 star)</li>
            <li>(no white marks on my clothes) and dries quick.  </li>
            <li>With this Secret deodorant, I noticed I was still feeling wet and not smelling the best.</li>
            <li>I often work outside with my husband, a Land Surveyor, and it&#x27;s so very hot and humid here in the southeast.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to figure out how to get the gel up to the top to use, but it was easy to use after that.</li>
            <li>My thyroid has been a little wacky since having my youngest son and I tend to sweat</li>
            <li>With Dove&#x27;s, I can run, exercise, etc. and stay clean and dry.</li>
            <li>always Loved secret</li>
            <li>I saw that the Secret Clinical Strength Clear deodorant was available as a free sample through my One2One Network membership, and used that opportunity to try a gel deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works very well no matter what weather we&#x27;re experiencing.  </li>
            <li>Since I love being dry I will be going back to the solid...</li>
            <li>So I was overjoyed when I saw that they now made a clear gel.</li>
            <li>deodorant dries clear</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have tried that really works to overcome my smelly sweat problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly a decade since I&#x27;d used gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I will still use if I am extra paranoid about white marks on clothes for certain outfits.</li>
            <li>It felt wet when I first applied it and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>Gel formula is nice because it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>and I had my 20-pound 17-month old on my back.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care if my antiperspirant/deodorant is invisible or makes my underarms soft; I just want it to work.</li>
            <li>always buy some variation of Secret clinical strength because it&#x27;s the only deodorant that actually lasts effectively all day when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li>I had to dry my underarm with a hairdryer before I got dressed when using this new gel.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Secret Clinical Strength Clear Gel Deodorant free as part of the One2One Network.</li>
            <li>Well, they need to work on the formula some more because in my opinion it is no better than any other regular antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors.</li>
            <li>None of the new Secret Clinical strength products (invisible solid, smooth solid, or gel) work as well as the soft/advanced solid products.</li>
            <li>It dries clear but takes awhile to dry.</li>
            <li>Since it is a clear gel, they&#x27;ve given you mostly an empty bottle, you just don&#x27;t know it yet.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the solid</li>
            <li> I have used Secret previously and enjoyed using this variety.</li>
            <li> Long lasting protection</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Secret Clinical Strenght Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network from stresssweatchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> It will actually last a few days if I&#x27;m not very active.</li>
            <li> and I have been around a long time.</li>
            <li> Even using only one click, it is so wet on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wouldn&#x27;t last long in hot, humid conditions as it didn&#x27;t last at all during my workouts.</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t let it dry, it will leave a residue on clothing.</li>
            <li> Very wet, didn&#x27;t dry.  </li>

            <li> I love Clinical Strength Solid but hated the white residue. So I was overjoyed when I saw that they now made a clear gel. I love a gel over a solid any day (thus the reason I didn&#x27;t give it only 1 star) Well, they need to work on the formula some more because in my opinion it is no better than any other regular antiperspirant. Since I love being dry I will be going back to the solid...</li>
            <li> This is the only anti-perspirant that works in Florida. I have tried many others, and this is it!</li>
            <li> Ilove it.&lt;br /&gt;To which I can do without, and I will buy again</li>
            <li> A must for those of us that sweat and don&#x27;t want to worry about body odor! Arrived on time and great packaging</li>
            <li> This is effective and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I am allergic to lots of things, but not this. (It isn&#x27;t cheap but it works).</li>
            <li> If other deodorants have failed, this one is for you!  Pricey, but worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I liked the Secret Clinical Strength, but this gel version isn&#x27;t as good. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the solid and I think it causes one of my arms to sweat more than the other. Like, a LOT more. I was soaking through my shirts but just on one side. I switched back to another deodorant and it went away. I can&#x27;t say for sure it was this that caused it, but I&#x27;m very reluctant to try it again.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter.  This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make her break out!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.  I often work outside with my husband, a Land Surveyor, and it&#x27;s so very hot and humid here in the southeast. I can go through 2 and sometimes 3 shirts in a day when we&#x27;re out in the field.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed right away that I&#x27;m not sweating through my shirts (under the arms) like I did before.&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant dries clear (no white marks on my clothes) and dries quick.  I like the fact that it protects but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or irritate my skin.  I think that during the cooler months, one application of the clinical strength would last two days without re-applying.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will keep using this product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> My son uses this as it is the only deodorant/antiperspirant that works on a teenaged boy&#x27;s stink. I worry about the aluminum content though.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Secret Clinical Strength Clear Gel Deodorant free as part of the One2One Network. I love this deodorant! My thyroid has been a little wacky since having my youngest son and I tend to sweat more so I&#x27;ve been looking for a deodorant that really will hold up. I had been using this for my day-to-day activities and it had been great, but I decided to use it when we went hiking. We were out for about two hours and I had my 20-pound 17-month old on my back. We got back to the car and yes, I did actually sniff my armpits to see how I smelled. There was no odor! My husband sure had fun bringing up how funny that looked for the next week though. I am very impressed with this deodorant and I&#x27;ll continue using it as my daily go-to product!</li>
            <li> Love this clear gel.  Just one click &amp;#34;does the trick&amp;#34; for all day. Found that too much deodorant clogs underarm pores, thus causing unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I use it to get rid of male genital odor. A smear along each side of the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34;, front to back and POOF! problem solved.</li>
            <li> Very wet, didn&#x27;t dry.  Back to solid.</li>
            <li> My neice (Age 15) says she needs more protection than regular deodorant.  Once she tried this she said it worked so I only buy this brand. One error was this one is gel and she prefers solid. So I had to buy another one but the name and strength are great.</li>
            <li> The pricing of this product is definitely a better value than my local retailers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, provides all day protection, goes on clear and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> The antiperspirant seems to do its job, but I don&#x27;t care for this scent.  It&#x27;s pretty strong, and I think it smells like a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant. It dries clear but takes awhile to dry. It works well, too.</li>
            <li> Does the trick.  Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for keeping you dry and odorless and does not leave any marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and prevents BO! Doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving or stain clothing...........what more can I ask for?  Best deodorant I have found.  It is on my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> The gel is ok.  I decided to try the new formulas as Secret Clinical Strength is the only one that works well for me living in the south.  I don&#x27;t think the gel works as well, and if you apply right after shaving your armpits, prepare for a sting.  The directions do tell you to avoid use right after shaving, but I always apply right out of the shower.  I will still use if I am extra paranoid about white marks on clothes for certain outfits.</li>
            <li> None of the new Secret Clinical strength products (invisible solid, smooth solid, or gel) work as well as the soft/advanced solid products. The gels in particular are awful. I had to dry my underarm with a hairdryer before I got dressed when using this new gel. Even if the ingredients are the same as the discontinued advanced/soft solid, this clinical strength gel simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Even before it wore off, I had breakthrough sweat with this gel almost immediately. I personally don&#x27;t care if my antiperspirant/deodorant is invisible or makes my underarms soft; I just want it to work.</li>
            <li> I struggled for years, trying everything on the market.  This is the best!</li>
            <li> Clinical strength has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I have been around a long time.</li>
            <li> Works - what more can I say... I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Texas summers are insanely hot.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve found to stand up to the miserable heat. Gel formula is nice because it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue behind and isn&#x27;t sticky. I find that it&#x27;s still working over 24 hours after applying.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Light non greasy, easy to dispense just the right amount, no residue.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any deodorant. I have only used it once. My issue is that only 1/3 of the bottle has the gel! Once you turn the dial (and turn it and turn it and turn it and turn it) to finally bring the gel to the surface, where you can dispense it, the gel starts around the middle of the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; (in the word &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;) and goes to the top. Since it is a clear gel, they&#x27;ve given you mostly an empty bottle, you just don&#x27;t know it yet.</li>
            <li> I am a man but this works for me!</li>
            <li> This is an effective gel as far as gels go. It smells great and lasts all day. Unfortunately, it wouldn&#x27;t last long in hot, humid conditions as it didn&#x27;t last at all during my workouts. Also, if you don&#x27;t let it dry, it will leave a residue on clothing.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Better than the regular strength</li>
            <li> Works great last all day it smells really good always Loved secret this is there Best deodorant they ever made :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant and being clear you don&#x27;t get the big white circles on your black dresses under the arms.  Plus it is clinical strength which is more powerful without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am very smelly when it comes to sweat.  This is the only product that I have tried that really works to overcome my smelly sweat problem.  The clear gel is great because it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a cheap perfume smell to it too.  This is the best ever.</li>
            <li> Used clinical strength for years and always struggled with white marks, but it kept me from stinking after a workout so I deat with it. I jumped for joy when I seen it was clear! Well, that was short lived. It isn&#x27;t half as good as the orginal formula. Have to reply half way through the day and still have bo in my shirts. So back to the cakey white one for me</li>
            <li> I typically purchase Dove Clinical Strength but my store was out of my normal scent, so I tried the Secret brand instead. I wound up throwing it away for 3 reasons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The gel is WET. Even using only one click, it is so wet on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as Dove, at least for me. I started having issues with heavier sweating after my 2nd son was born, and since then I&#x27;ve used clinical strength deodorants. With Dove&#x27;s, I can run, exercise, etc. and stay clean and dry. With this Secret deodorant, I noticed I was still feeling wet and not smelling the best. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. IT BURNS!! I apply deodorant after getting out of the shower and shaving. Man, right after shaving, it burns so bad. So I looked at the label, and wouldn&#x27;t you know there is alcohol in it! OUCH.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as Degree.</li>
            <li> I will not use anything except Secret Clinical Strength. I tried it when it first came out and have been hooked every since.</li>
            <li> I find the scent to be fresh and not cloying. The Sport scent is still my favorite, but this one is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear gel is more pleasant to use than the white stuff if you wear dark colored shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy some variation of Secret clinical strength because it&#x27;s the only deodorant that actually lasts effectively all day when I&#x27;m sweating. It will actually last a few days if I&#x27;m not very active. It leaves a &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; to my underarm area which can be felt when I&#x27;m soaping up in the shower, which makes me a bit uneasy - but it&#x27;s still better than stinky pits!</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s good not to much whitening!</li>
            <li> Super perfumey! Hate it!</li>
            <li> I saw that the Secret Clinical Strength Clear deodorant was available as a free sample through my One2One Network membership, and used that opportunity to try a gel deodorant.  It&#x27;s been nearly a decade since I&#x27;d used gel deodorants.  I&#x27;d always felt like I was sweating because of how wet the gel felt.  My clothes have suffered from solid deodorant stains, though-- sometimes just from putting a top on.  This was my chance to try and spare my clothes some misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially wondered if the gel deodorant&#x27;s claims of &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;stress response&amp;#34;  were exaggeration to sell a product, but I have been won over by Secret.  The gel dries quickly; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m soaking right through my hardly-worn clothes.  Application is smooth and quick.  And it smells great!  The perfect blend of crisp and clean.  It lasts for the better part of 24 hours without need for re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend it.  This is the first time I haven&#x27;t felt embarrassed wearing light colors since hitting puberty.  No more unsightly stains.  I&#x27;ll be putting a stick of Secret&#x27;s gel deodorant in my bathroom at home and in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic! It&#x27;s amazing that you can put this on at night and have perfectly odor free armpits the entire next day...even after showering! It really is a life changer for people who suffer from smelly pits</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works very well no matter what weather we&#x27;re experiencing.  I&#x27;ve been using Secret for Sensitive Skin for about 2 years now and wouldn&#x27;t trust anything else on my skin.  I LOVE IT!!!  Thank goodness I found something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating. Not with the Secret Clinical Strength clear gel. The gel works much better than other deodorants. It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes at all. It has a pleasant scent that is not too overwhelming. It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling. Not a sticky feeling like with other deodorants. It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors. Really makes you feel confident while wearing it. I highly recommend Secret Clinical Strenght Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network from stresssweatchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret previously and enjoyed using this variety. It took me a few tries to figure out how to get the gel up to the top to use, but it was easy to use after that. It felt wet when I first applied it and dried quickly. It lasted throughout the day, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a bad odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret Clinical Strength deodorant as a member of One2One Network.</li>
            <li> Long lasting protection</li>
