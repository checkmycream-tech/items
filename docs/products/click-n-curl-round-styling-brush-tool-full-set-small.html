    <ol>
            <li>If you follow directions given for wrapping and unwrapping they work great!</li>
            <li>These are great, great, great.  </li>
            <li>This so a great too; for blowing hair.  </li>
            <li>and she loved the look and has purchased also.</li>
            <li>When I am finished, I remove the rollers, brush through my hair, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this!  </li>
            <li>This was a perfect Christmas gift and was well appreciated and enjoyed!</li>
            <li>It is so nice not to have to blow out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>but they were very light and don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>I love them, but wish they had clips to help hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>These rollers are great and do exactly what they say they will do: create soft curls and great body.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very full looking, much more than I want.</li>
            <li>In general it works great.</li>
            <li>Made my hair light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>The combination of small and medium rollers is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great idea, works really well except that the brushes are way to big for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality wise, these look like they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li>The handle is very light weight and has no texture so it was hard to get a good grip</li>
            <li>This is a fun brush set to use.</li>
            <li>It gives me just the right amount of height and body and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wrapped just my roots, which is tricky to do and not leave a line, but the outcome is much more desired in my case.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to leave the rollers in and start a new section is convenient and much quicker than traditional rollers.</li>
            <li>I love using both sizes as my hair has various layers.  </li>
            <li>Very ingenious...wish I&#x27;d thought of it!  </li>
            <li>Love this - goes from flat to fuller hair</li>
            <li>The principle is good, but if your hair is short [not real short either], then this won&#x27;t work as well as it would for medium length hair styles.</li>
            <li>I had the original set and then purchased the small full set when it became available.  </li>
            <li>Curlers are too large and bulky</li>
            <li>It really brings body to your hair</li>
            <li>I let my daughter-in-law use when getting ready for a wedding</li>
            <li>Very MISLEADING.</li>
            <li>so I wish that even smaller curlers were available but these work well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend these rollers to anyone who likes lift to their hair.</li>
            <li>For fine, straight, long (2 inches below my shoulders) hair the rollers would not stay in without some sort of clip.</li>
            <li>Sent it back right away!</li>
            <li>Living in the south with the humidity, my hair goes flat quickly.  </li>
            <li>These work great when I am traveling taking up little space and allowing touch up anywhere with a little spritzer and the brush/rollers.  </li>
            <li>I like the product concept, but the medium rollers were much too large for my short hair and had to return the product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, short hair and can&#x27;t use shaping and styling products because they weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I received the small Click n Curl set as a gift and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The whole process of putting in the rollers, drying and styling only takes about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rollers are not small for short hair.</li>
            <li>I tried using the product a few different times, just to give it the good &amp;#34;college try&amp;#34; but couldn&#x27;t get past these issues.</li>

            <li> It really brings body to your hair</li>
            <li> This was a perfect Christmas gift and was well appreciated and enjoyed!</li>
            <li> My hair is too short to use the curlers.  Wish they made a smaller size.</li>
            <li> This so a great too; for blowing hair.  Would recommend to all</li>
            <li> I ordered small rollers.  They are not suitable for short hair.  I thought they would be &amp;#34;much smaller&amp;#34;.  Disappointed!  Have not used.</li>
            <li> Curlers are too large and bulky</li>
            <li> I had the original set and then purchased the small full set when it became available.  I love using both sizes as my hair has various layers.

            <li> Very MISLEADING. Rollers are not small for short hair. Box says small size when actually medium rollers. Don&#x27;t buy if have hair less than 3 inches long otherwise end up with straight hair.</li>
            <li> I should have order the smaller rollers. But these will do.</li>
            <li> Much too difficult to use.  Sent it back right away!</li>
            <li> The principle is good, but if your hair is short [not real short either], then this won&#x27;t work as well as it would for medium length hair styles.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this!  I uses this everyday!  Living in the south with the humidity, my hair goes flat quickly.  When I uses this product I have body all day long!  Only down side is I wish they made extra small size because I have very fine hair and the small doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair at times.</li>

            <li> Love this - goes from flat to fuller hair</li>
            <li> Great idea, works really well except that the brushes are way to big for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wish the brushes came in XXsmall size.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers. My hair is short so I wish that even smaller curlers were available but these work well. I have to use a clip on the curlers or they won&#x27;t stay in my hair but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great and do exactly what they say they will do: create soft curls and great body. I don&#x27;t use the handle. I dry my hair till almost completely dry, then section off the amount of hair I want to use with each roller. When I put the hair around them, I use the shaking motion they suggest, so the rollers are snug to the scalp. With the hair dryer on low-hot, I heat the rollers. I then apply my makeup. When I am finished, I remove the rollers, brush through my hair, and I&#x27;m good to go. My hair is short, but I do have a lot of hair, so I did buy the medium rollers, too. The combination of small and medium rollers is perfect.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and was quite disappointed. The idea is terrific but this product needs some improvements. For fine, straight, long (2 inches below my shoulders) hair the rollers would not stay in without some sort of clip. When I did manage to get them to stay (using a claw clip) the bristles were incredibly uncomfortable, almost painful. The handle is very light weight and has no texture so it was hard to get a good grip and I dropped it mid-brush a few times. I tried using the product a few different times, just to give it the good &amp;#34;college try&amp;#34; but couldn&#x27;t get past these issues. I will say, the volume created was terrific and lasted the day but the process was time consuming and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.  My hair is so thin as well as cut short that it is a bit difficult keep a roller in on the top.  But that&#x27;s just me.  In general it works great.</li>
            <li> I received the small Click n Curl set as a gift and absolutely love it. I have very fine, short hair and can&#x27;t use shaping and styling products because they weigh my hair down. The small Click n Curl has been the answer to my hair problems. It gives me just the right amount of height and body and lasts for hours. The whole process of putting in the rollers, drying and styling only takes about 5 minutes. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This is a fun brush set to use. It leaves my hair very full looking, much more than I want. I&#x27;ve wrapped just my roots, which is tricky to do and not leave a line, but the outcome is much more desired in my case.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to leave the rollers in and start a new section is convenient and much quicker than traditional rollers. The brush can be used as a regular round brush, so I&#x27;ve done that wo leaving any rollers in.&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise, these look like they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> These are great, great, great.  It is so nice not to have to blow out my hair.  These rollers give you volume without damaging your hair with heat from a curler or dryer.  I absolutely recommend these rollers to anyone who likes lift to their hair.</li>
            <li> I have almost shoulder length hair so I ordered small and medium. I really liked it a lot. Made my hair light and bouncy. I expected the curlers to be heavy but they were very light and don&#x27;t fall out. Planning on getting a set for my mom too!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair so I used the small size.  If you follow directions given for wrapping and unwrapping they work great!</li>
            <li> Very ingenious...wish I&#x27;d thought of it!  I love them, but wish they had clips to help hold the rollers in place.</li>
