            <li>I bought it to see if it would do as good of a job as Estee Lauder Night Repair.</li>

            <li>I have been using it for a month and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it, great product, I will recommend it any time.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many serums to help fight the signs of aging creeping up on my 40-something skin, and this L&#x27;Oreal Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair serum is one of the best!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I am 69 and my skin looks and feels so much better!  </li>
            <li>I use the 2 Lancome serums every night before bed (Genefique first, then Visionnaire), and I use this L&#x27;Oreal serum every morning immediately after my shower (followed by L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect spf 15 Cream).</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product seemed like the kind of product I needed as my skin is maturing</li>
            <li>I gave this a try, not expecting anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin nicely</li>
            <li>I  didn&#x27;t notice any significant differences in skin, but for the price, this is great for an additional mosturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Golden Balm,but this serum smells fine.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  :)</li>
            <li>The seller delivered quickly and used good packaging.</li>
            <li>It feels good going onto the skin and seems to absorb fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also, I feel a pump makes products more sanitary and protects from a steamy bathroom environment.</li>
            <li>This serum does everything it says and I am being totally honest when I say that on some days I needed no base for my make up.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it does as it promises.</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day for a month and my skin feels incredibly moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this product and now I can get it automatically shipped to me through Amazon&#x27;s subscription service.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this serum on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I want it to be healthy as can</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>The dropper when squeezed would fill up almost to the top.</li>
            <li>It does feel nice and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>THis is the absolutely best facial Hydrator and Skin repair serum on the market today...</li>
            <li>i love all their products.  </li>
            <li>I like it even more than skin creams because it is lighter on the face and neck</li>
            <li>after using this for more than a year, still love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, use it morning &amp; night</li>
            <li>A pump or squeeze bottle would be much better.  </li>
            <li>The amount dispensed is unreliable and the dropper method prevents removal of all the product purchased leaving me feeling like I paid for more product than is able to be removed from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to get this product because many years ago i used L&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>Because of the dryness caused by the latest product, I bought this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was OK.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if it is the L&#x27;Oreal or my Clarisonic Plus and Opal , but my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I think it takes more product to cover my skin.</li>
            <li>Make up glides on over the blemishes and wrinkles better.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Living in the desert, it is very dry here on the skin and one must use the best things one can find on their skin !</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the great price</li>
            <li>As to the concerns about parabens and soy ingredients: I am not convinced a strong correlation has been proven.</li>
            <li>Very gentle but effective and no acidic hydroxy ingredients.</li>
            <li>I liked this product very much, it made my skin glow</li>
            <li>It is very cool and calming, spreads on smoothly and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>At first it felt nice,</li>
            <li>I use this for fine lines,yes I have even patted under my eyes.</li>
            <li>There are a number of these products out and if compared to Est√©e Lauder night repair this one is just fine</li>
            <li>It hydrates great and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>i felt like it may  have taken more time  than it was worth since i purchased 3 items from L&#x27;Oreal...  </li>
            <li>A really great skin fluid.  </li>
            <li>Nice serum, absorbs fast, non greasy.</li>
            <li>nice item, fast express</li>
            <li>This is so non-irritating and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m very happy and my dry skin is gone at a reasonable costs.</li>
            <li>The improvement in my skin since adding this serum to my skincare regimen has been significant .....</li>
            <li>This product is smooth and creamy, go on well and absorbs quickly leaving skin moist and</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it every day and my skin is looking better, but I think I need to use it for a month or so to be sure.  </li>
            <li>so being able to get all three online is very convenient versus going from store to store.</li>
            <li>There you are paying for a full untampered bottle.</li>
            <li>But for people who are fair skin and already sensitive to the sun,the disappearance of freckles makes you more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Skin still feels clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick boost in their skin regimen.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much!</li>
            <li>Very silky smooth application, no perfume detected, no rash or burning and</li>
            <li>The result is nothing short of spectacular.</li>
            <li>This product is very elder skin friendly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for a smooth face.</li>
            <li>The pumps never completely empty the bottle, clog, and often dispense way more product than you need.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and wake up to refreshed, healthy looking skin with no dry patches.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, but it might be too strong for someone sensitive to perfume scents.  </li>
            <li>You must use it consistently to get these results.</li>
            <li>Please if you want to argue, tried the dropper on a full bottle, then a third way filled bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time, I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and it makes a remarkable difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Its Ok, I can only use it at night.  </li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal facial products makes your face looks &amp; feel youthful.</li>
            <li>Plus her skin looks really young and smooth.</li>
            <li>Oh I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; - glides on your skin and makes it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is full unlike the other customer review as I checked to make sure.</li>
            <li>There is a link, but there are so many ways we are absorbing extra estrogen into our bodies that are more deleterious, such as microwaving our food in plastic containers.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling slightly taut and dried out, you must follow up with  Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The most noticeable effect is that it is very calming to my dry skin and is not greasy</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home.</li>
            <li>I was only planning to use this product during the winter, but I now intend to use it year &#x27;round and am pleased and satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I can absolutely tell the difference when I miss using this serum for a day or two.</li>
            <li>This indicates how much serum was in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t contain much so use is sparingly.  </li>
            <li>you should try their whole line</li>
            <li>Now my mom uses it everyday,her face becomes much smoother.</li>
            <li>This serum really made a difference.</li>
            <li>and my skin is much improved with no greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Too liquidy, and too much perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Therefore I am writing this review for people who are very sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Sara  </li>
            <li>It works very well in conjunction with  L&#x27;oreal cleanser and cream for day, balm for night.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a much smoother and even appearance to my complexion.</li>
            <li>I still have very oily and sensitive skin and yet the effects of dryness are becoming obvious.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve not used a serum before you would likely see significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Good prodcut - helps to hydrate skin and keep it subtle</li>
            <li>I love this it seems to get down into the face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin, but I do have some wrinkles between my eyebrows, some post acne spots, and slight puffiness to my eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seem much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I would save the money and invest a few more dollars to buy something else.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received from Amazon, The dropper would only pick up a third full in the tube.  </li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;ll have a reaction to creams and things like this, but not with this.</li>
            <li>For me is to liquid, I used before others brands that are more heavy.</li>
            <li>read a few articles and L&#x27;Oreal products kept showing up in the top ranking along with the pricey ones.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines are smoothed, skin discolorations are fading, and my skin has an overall glow to it that is simply not there when I don&#x27;t use this serum.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>My skin looks renewed, alive!</li>
            <li>The same product purcase from stores, would be last two full months.</li>
            <li>Someone is clearly draining the bottles before sending it out.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for yoU</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for all mature women.</li>
            <li>I am a young looking 66..</li>
            <li>but I was looking old</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin NEVER wash your skin and throw anything on, it just needs time to chill.</li>
            <li>This is designed for mature skin.</li>
            <li>But there was no review about sun sensitive people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s never too early to think about anti-aging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my coworker never belive how old I am</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 year old woman.</li>
            <li>The bottle was half full when I received it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am past user of Clinique(20yrs), Ahava (7yrs) and most recently tried Arbonne (3 mos.)and</li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably  priced compared to other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Within about 10-20minutes later the entire face, forehead, and throat was very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that nothing actually gets rid of wrinkles, but this does make my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Repair\\&quot;  and it did calm down the red fiery places on my face.  </li>
            <li>Little, if any product ,is absorbed into the bloodstream via a skin cream that isn&#x27;t formulated to get much further than the upper dermal layer.</li>
            <li>Everything I tried made my skin oiler,irritated, but no less dry and flaky.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It feels good going onto the skin and seems to absorb fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also, I feel a pump makes products more sanitary and protects from a steamy bathroom environment.</li>
            <li> This serum does everything it says and I am being totally honest when I say that on some days I needed no base for my make up.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does as it promises.</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day for a month and my skin feels incredibly moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now I can get it automatically shipped to me through Amazon&#x27;s subscription service.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this serum on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I want it to be healthy as can</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> The dropper when squeezed would fill up almost to the top.</li>
            <li> It does feel nice and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> THis is the absolutely best facial Hydrator and Skin repair serum on the market today...</li>
            <li> i love all their products.  </li>
            <li> I like it even more than skin creams because it is lighter on the face and neck</li>
            <li> after using this for more than a year, still love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it morning &amp; night</li>
            <li> A pump or squeeze bottle would be much better.  </li>
            <li> The amount dispensed is unreliable and the dropper method prevents removal of all the product purchased leaving me feeling like I paid for more product than is able to be removed from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to get this product because many years ago i used L&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li> Because of the dryness caused by the latest product, I bought this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was OK.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it is the L&#x27;Oreal or my Clarisonic Plus and Opal , but my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I think it takes more product to cover my skin.</li>
            <li> Make up glides on over the blemishes and wrinkles better.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Living in the desert, it is very dry here on the skin and one must use the best things one can find on their skin !</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the great price</li>
            <li> As to the concerns about parabens and soy ingredients: I am not convinced a strong correlation has been proven.</li>
            <li> Very gentle but effective and no acidic hydroxy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very much, it made my skin glow</li>
            <li> It is very cool and calming, spreads on smoothly and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> At first it felt nice,</li>
            <li> I use this for fine lines,yes I have even patted under my eyes.</li>
            <li> There are a number of these products out and if compared to Est√©e Lauder night repair this one is just fine</li>
            <li> It hydrates great and absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy and smooth.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> i felt like it may  have taken more time  than it was worth since i purchased 3 items from L&#x27;Oreal...  </li>
            <li> A really great skin fluid.  </li>
            <li> Nice serum, absorbs fast, non greasy.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> This is so non-irritating and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very happy and my dry skin is gone at a reasonable costs.</li>
            <li> The improvement in my skin since adding this serum to my skincare regimen has been significant .....</li>
            <li> This product is smooth and creamy, go on well and absorbs quickly leaving skin moist and</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it every day and my skin is looking better, but I think I need to use it for a month or so to be sure.  </li>
            <li> so being able to get all three online is very convenient versus going from store to store.</li>
            <li> There you are paying for a full untampered bottle.</li>
            <li> But for people who are fair skin and already sensitive to the sun,the disappearance of freckles makes you more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Skin still feels clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick boost in their skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> Very silky smooth application, no perfume detected, no rash or burning and</li>
            <li> The result is nothing short of spectacular.</li>
            <li> This product is very elder skin friendly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for a smooth face.</li>
            <li> The pumps never completely empty the bottle, clog, and often dispense way more product than you need.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night and wake up to refreshed, healthy looking skin with no dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it might be too strong for someone sensitive to perfume scents.  </li>
            <li> You must use it consistently to get these results.</li>
            <li> Please if you want to argue, tried the dropper on a full bottle, then a third way filled bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time, I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and it makes a remarkable difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Its Ok, I can only use it at night.  </li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal facial products makes your face looks &amp; feel youthful.</li>
            <li> Plus her skin looks really young and smooth.</li>
            <li> Oh I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; - glides on your skin and makes it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is full unlike the other customer review as I checked to make sure.</li>
            <li> There is a link, but there are so many ways we are absorbing extra estrogen into our bodies that are more deleterious, such as microwaving our food in plastic containers.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling slightly taut and dried out, you must follow up with  Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable effect is that it is very calming to my dry skin and is not greasy</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home.</li>
            <li> I was only planning to use this product during the winter, but I now intend to use it year &#x27;round and am pleased and satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I can absolutely tell the difference when I miss using this serum for a day or two.</li>
            <li> This indicates how much serum was in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t contain much so use is sparingly.  </li>
            <li> you should try their whole line</li>
            <li> Now my mom uses it everyday,her face becomes much smoother.</li>
            <li> This serum really made a difference.</li>
            <li> and my skin is much improved with no greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Too liquidy, and too much perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Therefore I am writing this review for people who are very sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Sara  </li>
            <li> It works very well in conjunction with  L&#x27;oreal cleanser and cream for day, balm for night.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a much smoother and even appearance to my complexion.</li>
            <li> I still have very oily and sensitive skin and yet the effects of dryness are becoming obvious.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve not used a serum before you would likely see significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Good prodcut - helps to hydrate skin and keep it subtle</li>
            <li> I love this it seems to get down into the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin, but I do have some wrinkles between my eyebrows, some post acne spots, and slight puffiness to my eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seem much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I would save the money and invest a few more dollars to buy something else.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received from Amazon, The dropper would only pick up a third full in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;ll have a reaction to creams and things like this, but not with this.</li>
            <li> For me is to liquid, I used before others brands that are more heavy.</li>
            <li> read a few articles and L&#x27;Oreal products kept showing up in the top ranking along with the pricey ones.  </li>
            <li> my fine lines are smoothed, skin discolorations are fading, and my skin has an overall glow to it that is simply not there when I don&#x27;t use this serum.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> My skin looks renewed, alive!</li>
            <li> The same product purcase from stores, would be last two full months.</li>
            <li> Someone is clearly draining the bottles before sending it out.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for yoU</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for all mature women.</li>
            <li> I am a young looking 66..</li>
            <li> but I was looking old</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin NEVER wash your skin and throw anything on, it just needs time to chill.</li>
            <li> This is designed for mature skin.</li>
            <li> But there was no review about sun sensitive people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s never too early to think about anti-aging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my coworker never belive how old I am</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 year old woman.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half full when I received it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am past user of Clinique(20yrs), Ahava (7yrs) and most recently tried Arbonne (3 mos.)and</li>
            <li> It is also very reasonably  priced compared to other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Within about 10-20minutes later the entire face, forehead, and throat was very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that nothing actually gets rid of wrinkles, but this does make my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Repair\\&quot;  and it did calm down the red fiery places on my face.  </li>
            <li> Little, if any product ,is absorbed into the bloodstream via a skin cream that isn&#x27;t formulated to get much further than the upper dermal layer.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried made my skin oiler,irritated, but no less dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Use at least a week, but I felt it right away.</li>
            <li> The dropper inside doesn&#x27;t really workp  to pick up the serum, and it is difficult to get the right amount of product, especially as the jar gets empty.  </li>
            <li> A very little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Because of a medical condition I have exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li> Pure Vitamin A,a seriously toxic, fat soluble vitamin.</li>
            <li> but I may go back to my other one.  </li>
            <li> Works well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and purchased this system (serum, eye cream, and face cream).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> i had really dry skin</li>
            <li> I cannot stand for my skin to feel dry</li>
            <li> You simply cannot absorb a harmful amount from the prescription cream unless you were to apply an entire tube everyday for a month.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that this product doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as similar size serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer -- still wrinkled, but at least they&#x27;re soft wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> I wash my face, put this on next, let it sink in a little and then follow up with a moisture cream.</li>
            <li> People are now telling me I look like I am in my late 40&#x27;s, early 50&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> A big difference can be seen with just a few applications.</li>
            <li> The reason i did not give a 5 star, the bottle was not filled like the ones i purchase at my local Drugstore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add to that living in a hot dry desert climate and not having the coin to buy expensive serums.  </li>
            <li> (The other 2 are Lancome Genefique and Lancome Visionnaire).</li>
            <li> She wouldn&#x27;t use any other serum.</li>
            <li> I did not do a complaint for the simple reason,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Just a small amount take the dry feel away without being shiny.</li>
            <li> I was finished with my bottle in less than a month.</li>
            <li> But I have been using this less than one month</li>
            <li> in fact because it moisturizes so well, my skin is putting out less oil.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less flaking as well.</li>
            <li> I just used a little powder because that&#x27;s all I needed.</li>
            <li> I used this serum for one month and before I used it my face was bumpy with clogged pores,horrible skin tone,large pores, and even a few scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I kept buying it because it has caffeine and honey which is hard to find in other legit lotions that are name brand and not pricey, but it must have a small amount because it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s in a thick, dark glass bottle, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but wanted to slow down the process.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure if this is the product to do it.</li>
            <li> This has been a very dry, cold winter and my face has been so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The dropper is a little awkward, it just use it as a wand and apply a small amount tiny forehead and each cheek.  </li>
            <li> I shy away from any beauty product that makes my skin greasy, but my mature skin was feeling the winter cold and looking dull and slightly flaky.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to find all three of these items at a brick and mortar store</li>
            <li> Being in my mid-40&#x27;s, I was skeptical about trying this for that reason .</li>
            <li> I am at that awkward age between peri-menopause and menopause.</li>
            <li> As to the sanitary concern of the dropper, you should be washing your hands before you touch your face anyway and unless you smear the dropper on dirty fingers, there should be no product contamination.er on dirty fingers, there should be no product contamination.</li>
            <li> not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is dispensed with a dropper which I find awkward.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed using the L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> just disappointed  because i did not get all of the ounces...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has changed the formula of this product. Beware if it says &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  It is nor the product I have used for years. (Turns skin red and burns.)</li>
            <li> Great service and great product.  I was surprised at the great price this item was.  Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home. This item hydrates your skin and does not feel oily after the application.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick boost in their skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I shy away from any beauty product that makes my skin greasy, but my mature skin was feeling the winter cold and looking dull and slightly flaky.  I decided to give this serum a try and am hooked.  It hydrates great and absorbs quickly and completely.  It does not make my pores look big and oily, nor my skin shiny from grease.  I apply it at night and wake up to refreshed, healthy looking skin with no dry patches.  I was only planning to use this product during the winter, but I now intend to use it year &#x27;round and am pleased and satisfied.  The only thing I would change about it (and have contacted L&#x27;Oreal to make a suggestion) is to package it in a glass pump bottle.  It comes in a glass amber bottle with a dropper and takes care to avoid drips.  Also, I feel a pump makes products more sanitary and protects from a steamy bathroom environment.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Very silky smooth application, no perfume detected, no rash or burning and it works...I wear it every night and sometimes during the day under makeup. Not fond of the dropper but for the results I will deal with it. Minimizes lines and wrinkles virtually tightens neck skin. Highly recommended .</li>
            <li> The bottle was half full when I received it.  No difference in texture or wrinkles of skin.  I would save the money and invest a few more dollars to buy something else.</li>
            <li> This serum just feels wonderful.  You can almost feel the skin changing immediately. This along with the eye cream makes a difference on me. I am 69 and my skin looks and feels so much better!  Remember, this is good!  Don&#x27;t use it one time and quit!  Use at least a week, but I felt it right away.</li>
            <li> the lady who uses this says &amp;#34;This is my *evey day, must have, go to* product!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.. I like it..</li>
            <li> I used this serum for one month and before I used it my face was bumpy with clogged pores,horrible skin tone,large pores, and even a few scars. This serum does everything it says and I am being totally honest when I say that on some days I needed no base for my make up. I just used a little powder because that&#x27;s all I needed. I even started getting compliments on my skin texture. If a serum can b a woman&#x27;s best friend, this one is mine for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this product and seeing great results</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does as it promises. A big difference can be seen with just a few applications. The seller delivered quickly and used good packaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Using it twice a day for a month and my skin feels incredibly moist and soft. You must use it consistently to get these results. Occasional use will not work. Best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and purchased this system (serum, eye cream, and face cream). I have to say I&#x27;m very happy and my dry skin is gone at a reasonable costs. Also, it&#x27;s hard to find all three of these items at a brick and mortar store so being able to get all three online is very convenient versus going from store to store. This is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Tried a couple of times and  each time I felt a burning sensation for a short while. Didn&#x27;t like it. I use Retin A and have regular face peels so I can tolerate pain. But I have used Oil of Olay Regenerist Serum and it was wonderful to put on and minimized fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now I can get it automatically shipped to me through Amazon&#x27;s subscription service.  I will never run out.  This is a great skin care serum.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this serum on my skin. Non-greasy and smooth. Skin still feels clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> This product seemed like the kind of product I needed as my skin is maturing and I want it to be healthy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;I tried 2-3 drops per the instructions on the bottle. I did like the texture of the serum, however as soon as I applied the product to my face and throat I immediatly felt a burning sensation. Within about 10-20minutes later the entire face, forehead, and throat was very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to anyone with any form of sensetive skin type. So if you have sensitive skin, this product is NOT for yoU</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, it is very dry here on the skin and one must use the best things one can find on their skin ! L&#x27;Oreal has consistently good products. This serum will be nice for the winter and summer ! Thx</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many serums to help fight the signs of aging creeping up on my 40-something skin, and this L&#x27;Oreal Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair serum is one of the best! (The other 2 are Lancome Genefique and Lancome Visionnaire). I use the 2 Lancome serums every night before bed (Genefique first, then Visionnaire), and I use this L&#x27;Oreal serum every morning immediately after my shower (followed by L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect spf 15 Cream). The improvement in my skin since adding this serum to my skincare regimen has been significant ..... my fine lines are smoothed, skin discolorations are fading, and my skin has an overall glow to it that is simply not there when I don&#x27;t use this serum. I can absolutely tell the difference when I miss using this serum for a day or two. It shows in my skin. I have no idea why, or by what technology this serum works, but it works! I will never be without this! It makes my skin look amazing and works beautifully under makeup.  Love, love, love it!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of L&#x27;Oreal facial products.  I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin.  I&#x27;ve used expensive products that were okay, but I never that they delivered what they promise.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with L&#x27;Oreal.  The price can&#x27;t be beat and the product feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Thought  it would be wise to subscribe and not have to worry about running out. Not the case.  The same product purcase from stores, would be last two full months. The dropper when squeezed would fill up almost to the top. The first bottle I received from Amazon, The dropper would only pick up a third full in the tube.  This indicates how much serum was in the bottle. Please if you want to argue, tried the dropper on a full bottle, then a third way filled bottle. I was finished with my bottle in less than a month. Just received my second subscribed bottle today. Same issue. Someone is clearly draining the bottles before sending it out. Dont buy from this seller. Don&#x27;t subscribe. Buy from the stores, like rite aide or target. There you are paying for a full untampered bottle. I&#x27;ve been with Amazon for years. This is the first time, I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed. Two stars because it really is a great product. Just unhonest seller</li>
            <li> So far I have not seem much of a difference.  It does feel nice and goes on smoothly.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but wanted to slow down the process.  Just not sure if this is the product to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and it makes a remarkable difference in my skin tone. I recommend it for all mature women.</li>
            <li> i love it! i had really dry skin and this is working out well for me. I also bought the moisturizer (Hydra-Nutrition day/night). My face feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> THis is the absolutely best facial Hydrator and Skin repair serum on the market today...I highly recommend it for a smooth face.</li>
            <li> I love the age perfect serum.  I cannot stand for my skin to feel dry so I usually put some on first thing when I get up.  This is a great product.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t contain much so use is sparingly.  I only use one dropper and it seems to be enough to cover my face and neck.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed using the L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for around my eyes and no greasy residue. i love all their products.  you should try their whole line</li>
            <li> This has been a very dry, cold winter and my face has been so dry and flaky. Nothing has helped, but after I wash my face I put this on and my skin just soaks this up like a sponge. My skin looks renewed, alive! It is wonderful. I am a young looking 66.. but I was looking old and I was molting! People are now telling me I look like I am in my late 40&#x27;s, early 50&#x27;s again. Yup, this product is GOOD!!</li>
            <li> I gave this a try, not expecting anything spectacular. The result is nothing short of spectacular. I use the Age Perfect Serum, with Loreal Age Perfect day and night creams. I noticed my skin is glowing, tone has evened out and lines are diminishing. Normally I&#x27;ll have a reaction to creams and things like this, but not with this. Very gentle but effective and no acidic hydroxy ingredients. But I have been using this less than one month and I am so happy I tried it. I pray they keep it on the shelves. Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Its Ok, I can only use it at night.  It makes my skin oily if I use it during the day.</li>
            <li> Just bought my third bottle and still haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin. I kept buying it because it has caffeine and honey which is hard to find in other legit lotions that are name brand and not pricey, but it must have a small amount because it does nothing for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now daily. I don&#x27;t have many issues with my skin, but I do have some wrinkles between my eyebrows, some post acne spots, and slight puffiness to my eyes. After using this, I have not seen any change. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying. It is full unlike the other customer review as I checked to make sure.</li>
            <li> I love this it seems to get down into the face. I have ultra sensitive skin so I worried if I&#x27;d break out. No, I did not&lt;br /&gt;I think it lifts just feels good on the skin. I place this 20 minutes after I wash my skin. If you have sensitive skin NEVER wash your skin and throw anything on, it just needs time to chill. I use this for fine lines,yes I have even patted under my eyes. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li> The reason i did not give a 5 star, the bottle was not filled like the ones i purchase at my local Drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;  I love the product!!! just disappointed  because i did not get all of the ounces... I did not do a complaint for the simple reason,&lt;br /&gt;  i felt like it may  have taken more time  than it was worth since i purchased 3 items from L&#x27;Oreal...  I do like it and, buy&lt;br /&gt;  it often ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Golden Balm,but this serum smells fine. Now my mom uses it everyday,her face becomes much smoother.</li>
            <li> A really great skin fluid.  I like it even more than skin creams because it is lighter on the face and neck</li>
            <li> I like this but not as well as the oil</li>
            <li> I order this for my 83-year-old mother and she loves the stuff. She wouldn&#x27;t use any other serum.</li>
            <li> This serum is replacing another serum I&#x27;ve been using but I may go back to my other one.  It soaks into my skin nicely but I don&#x27;t care for the odor.</li>
            <li> Because of a medical condition I have exceptionally dry skin. Add to that living in a hot dry desert climate and not having the coin to buy expensive serums.  No matter the moisture CREAM I used, it wouldn&#x27;t sink into my skin enough to help.  This serum really made a difference. I wash my face, put this on next, let it sink in a little and then follow up with a moisture cream. Twice a day morning and night and my skin is much improved with no greasiness.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> after using this for more than a year, still love it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very much, it made my skin glow</li>
            <li> Over priced for the results. Leaves skin feeling slightly taut and dried out, you must follow up with  Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am at that awkward age between peri-menopause and menopause. I still have very oily and sensitive skin and yet the effects of dryness are becoming obvious. Everything I tried made my skin oiler,irritated, but no less dry and flaky. This is designed for mature skin. Being in my mid-40&#x27;s, I was skeptical about trying this for that reason . But for the price...why not? I have been using it for a month and am very pleased. It does not make my skin oiler..in fact because it moisturizes so well, my skin is putting out less oil. My skin tone is improved and my pores look smaller. I have noticed less flaking as well. Am going to venture out and buy a jar of the Age Perfect Hydra Balm for face,and neck because winter is on its way and I have read the two products work well together. As to the concerns about parabens and soy ingredients: I am not convinced a strong correlation has been proven. There is a link, but there are so many ways we are absorbing extra estrogen into our bodies that are more deleterious, such as microwaving our food in plastic containers. Little, if any product ,is absorbed into the bloodstream via a skin cream that isn&#x27;t formulated to get much further than the upper dermal layer. Take retinoids. Pure Vitamin A,a seriously toxic, fat soluble vitamin. In its pill form, one must submit to regular liver function and pregnancy test to acquire the prescription. You simply cannot absorb a harmful amount from the prescription cream unless you were to apply an entire tube everyday for a month. So, I will buy this product again. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is I am not a fan of the smell. But, it isn&#x27;t freaking my skin out and it does dissipate after about 20 minutes. Personally, I like the dropper. The pumps never completely empty the bottle, clog, and often dispense way more product than you need. As to the sanitary concern of the dropper, you should be washing your hands before you touch your face anyway and unless you smear the dropper on dirty fingers, there should be no product contamination.er on dirty fingers, there should be no product contamination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now.  I like using it.  It feels good going onto the skin and seems to absorb fairly quickly.  The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good prodcut - helps to hydrate skin and keep it subtle</li>
            <li> I love it, great product, I will recommend it any time. My skin looks softer every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Is a very good product as itself I don&#x27;t know yet the results. For me is to liquid, I used before others brands that are more heavy.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT FOR AWHILE NOW and ibought it bcause now i anm buyingall age perfect produts for age and skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, use it morning &amp; night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> The serum was pleasant and seemed to work well, but the container is not so great.  The dropper inside doesn&#x27;t really workp  to pick up the serum, and it is difficult to get the right amount of product, especially as the jar gets empty.  A pump or squeeze bottle would be much better.  I won&#x27;t buy this again unless the container is improved.</li>
            <li> I want refund for all loreal rashes hoves blisters  scales refund me asap</li>
            <li> Too liquidy, and too much perfume smell. And it doesn&#x27;t hydrate as well as their Triple Power concentrated Serum Treatment. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth and creamy, go on well and absorbs quickly leaving skin moist and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is dispensed with a dropper which I find awkward.  The amount dispensed is unreliable and the dropper method prevents removal of all the product purchased leaving me feeling like I paid for more product than is able to be removed from the bottle.</li>
            <li> At first it felt nice,b ut then in the morning my skin was a bit lighter and my freckles disappearing.I was looking forward to get this product because many years ago i used L&#x27;oreal and I was happy then. But for people who are fair skin and already sensitive to the sun,the disappearance of freckles makes you more sensitive.I bought it because the reviews are very good.But there was no review about sun sensitive people.Therefore I am writing this review for people who are very sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Sara  L</li>
            <li> Great product. I keep reordering when I run out.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it every day and my skin is looking better, but I think I need to use it for a month or so to be sure.  I&#x27;ve taken before and after pix, and that will tell.</li>
            <li> There are a number of these products out and if compared to Est√©e Lauder night repair this one is just fine</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal facial products makes your face looks &amp; feel youthful. I apply at night after cleaning with Youth Code face wash then apply night moistures.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and she swears by it!!!!  Plus her skin looks really young and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice serum, absorbs fast, non greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Hydra Nutrition Serum.  The most noticeable effect is that it is very calming to my dry skin and is not greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am past user of Clinique(20yrs), Ahava (7yrs) and most recently tried Arbonne (3 mos.)and they all began to have adverse effects.  The Arbonne which set my face on fire (red and burning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few articles and L&#x27;Oreal products kept showing up in the top ranking along with the pricey ones.  Because of the dryness caused by the latest product, I bought this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says \\&quot;Advance Skin Repair\\&quot;  and it did calm down the red fiery places on my face.  It is very cool and calming, spreads on smoothly and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a five just for that.  The dropper is a little awkward, it just use it as a wand and apply a small amount tiny forehead and each cheek.  Whether it keeps wrinkles at bay is yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my hydrating routine, along with the night cream. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I use it on my neck and face. A very little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product was OK.  I  didn&#x27;t notice any significant differences in skin, but for the price, this is great for an additional mosturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this as part 2 of my daily and nightly regimen.  It works very well in conjunction with  L&#x27;oreal cleanser and cream for day, balm for night.  I do not know if it is the L&#x27;Oreal or my Clarisonic Plus and Opal , but my skin has never been better.  Even the worry lines and &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; are diminished. I found the combination I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Day: Revitalist Cleanser (Applied with Clarisonic) Age Perfect Serum (applied with Opal) Hydrafresh Moisturizer. Night: swap out Hydrafresh for Age Perfect Balm.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that nothing actually gets rid of wrinkles, but this does make my skin feel soft.  I like the smell, but it might be too strong for someone sensitive to perfume scents.  I&#x27;m a repeat buyer -- still wrinkled, but at least they&#x27;re soft wrinkles!  :o)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, my skins so soft and bright love it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.  I bought it to see if it would do as good of a job as Estee Lauder Night Repair. It does not, but it did work.  If you&#x27;ve not used a serum before you would likely see significant improvement.</li>
            <li> This product is very elder skin friendly.  It may not remove wrinkles, but does help with a smoother look, and feels so good.  It is also very reasonably  priced compared to other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin... even Cetaphil causes rashes. This is so non-irritating and smooth. I use it on both my face and neck and I&#x27;ve noticed a much smoother and even appearance to my complexion. I&#x27;m still in my 20&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s never too early to think about anti-aging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this product doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as similar size serums I&#x27;ve used. I think it takes more product to cover my skin. Also, it&#x27;s in a thick, dark glass bottle, so I never know it&#x27;s low until it&#x27;s GONE.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for woman who are over 60yr.  I work as a CNA and my coworker never belive how old I am I have used L&#x27;Oreal products all my life. By the way I am 68.</li>
            <li> Whether this is a &amp;#34;wrinkle fighter&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know. It feels non-greasy and is the perfect moisturizer for under makeup. Just a small amount take the dry feel away without being shiny.</li>
            <li> Oh I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; - glides on your skin and makes it so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> This serum makes a difference on how make up looks and feels on my face.  Make up glides on over the blemishes and wrinkles better.  I&#x27;m 51 year old woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for my aging skin and this line is the best that I have found without spending outrageous amounts of $$$$. I could not be more pleased.</li>
