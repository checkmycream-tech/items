            <li>This is a nice throw away toothbrush</li>
            <li>If you love a good toothbrush to get the job done colgate is the one.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Everybody made fun of me but it was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>it would have been better</li>
            <li>You could get 4 of them for about 6 bucks, whereas most 2-packs cost that much or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably pay about $5 (not including shipping and handling) at the most</li>
            <li>I used this one to replace that one and my teeth are Ok now.</li>
            <li>I love&#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Most toothbrushes hurt my gums but not this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that things like this are available as add-on purchases.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li>Without any expectations, this toothbrush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush has a nice full head</li>
            <li>Again, Colgate make a good product, this was at a good price point, was added on to a larger order.</li>
            <li>and I really like the toothbrush and was a good price.</li>
            <li>Good Price, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has a nice reach and the soft full head feel fine as it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>my mouth/teeth are huge</li>
            <li>I bought this just so I would qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this in order to meet the $25 free shipping.</li>
            <li>You can brush as throughly as you want with some force and the bristles will not unravel as cheap toothbrushes would often do.</li>
            <li>If you need an item to meet the $25 free shipping, this item is indispensable.</li>
            <li>I know its cheap</li>
            <li>It is a cheap tooth brush, and it feels like one.</li>
            <li>For the price this would be a great backup, or to be used for guests that forget theirs, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this so I could meet the minimum free shipping.  </li>
            <li>They are cheap and do the job well.</li>
            <li>So there was nothing I liked or particularly dislike either.</li>
            <li>I USE IT TO CLEAN COMBS &amp; BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Nice quality soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Serves as a good choice when you just need to spend that extra dollar or two to get up to 25 dollars for Super Saver Shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great deal for an adequate toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Lasted about 5 weeks, but did the job, wore out quite quickly though.</li>
            <li>and I love the soft Colgate toothbrushes since they actually clean my teeth without decimating my gums.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine haha</li>
            <li>I got a soft toothbrush of another brand and was satisfied with that.</li>
            <li>The size is good too, its just that I expected it to be softer.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>The price was a little higher than supermarket price, but the product is great.  </li>
            <li>and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Colgate is another name very popular in the average home as i was growing up ,this toothbrush was very durable to be</li>
            <li>The good thing about this toothbrush is that its bristles do not wear out pretty fast, they remain intact for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not one of my personal favorites of toothbrushes, but it was okay</li>
            <li>you make my smile so much nicer.</li>
            <li>but I found much better toothbrushes from my local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>They work great and are long lasting.  </li>
            <li>i love it and the price is cheaper,i will buy it next time</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth that much.</li>
            <li>Would have liked a full head instead of a small oval head.  </li>
            <li>It also has a large head (as advertised).</li>
            <li>Colgate Classic Soft Full Head Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush, gets the plague off my teeth very efficiently.</li>
            <li>I really like it .</li>
            <li>Also i am going to buy it very often .</li>
            <li>the handle&#x27;s grip is really well made.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>awesome.but go get it from Walmart if you can&#x27;t really wait</li>
            <li>and if I forget to plug in my electric toothbrush then I can just grab this one really fast.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to have it sent to our home every 6 months with subscribe and save that way</li>
            <li>Easy on gums, cleans well, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush gets the job done, but definitely is nothing special.</li>
            <li>Guess it was worth the price just barely.</li>
            <li>Rather than filing down the creative bumps, I turned it into a tile cleaner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent tooth brush, I usually used medium-hard, but this is a nice brush as well.</li>
            <li>If you bought one of these every month with one of your Super Saver Shipping purchases you&#x27;d only be spending about 18 dollars per year on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a classic model.</li>
            <li>Only thing that I would want better is the brush is not very big.</li>
            <li>The best part is when it brushes my teeth and gets rid of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to use a soft toothbrush and this one does the trick.</li>
            <li>Simple toothbrush worth the price.</li>
            <li>And the brush itself is also skinny, and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely, which means I have to brush twice as long to go over the top and bottom of the tooth since the brush doesn&#x27;t reach the entire tooth.</li>
            <li>Classic soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing is worse than waking up somewhere and not being able to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Its a tooth brush the brisals are soft like they as they say and the get a rondome color snall tooth brush also</li>
            <li>I keep these in stock for unexpected guests that stay overnight.  </li>
            <li>Bristles were soft, arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t as soft as advertised.  </li>
            <li>soft head.this product came on time for changing the toothbrush time in our resident</li>
            <li>I wanted a soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums this toothbrush helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Soft toothbrush - cleans well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you&#x27;re willing to deal with a smaller/thinner grip, and smaller brush size (that is just as durable as bigger brushes) then I say go for it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are just as high as quality as others but of course, smaller like I mentioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and not too big.</li>
            <li>But its just like a regular toothbrush, not as soft as I wanted.</li>
            <li>was a surprised there were several in the box.</li>
            <li>I also noticed how strong the handle was,not weak.</li>

            <li> I also noticed how strong the handle was,not weak.</li>
            <li> The point is they will last just as long as the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re relatively small as others have pointed out, and will require more precision work with hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> The product came much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> however I consider the bristles to be medium and not soft as advertised.</li>
            <li> IS NOT SOFT.  </li>
            <li> Mine is white plastic with green grips and logo, and with blue and yellow highlights in the bristles.</li>
            <li> It works the same as any other toothbrush which all customers need to know.</li>
            <li> The fancy design (bumpy surface) on the back of the head kept hitting my other teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I actually paid less on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting a soft head, but it was rather hard</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard or too soft, and it doesn&#x27;t have on of the rubber tongue scrubbers that I don&#x27;t like, all in all, its a toothbrush and it works.</li>
            <li> Due to Amazon&#x27;s inept product descriptions and inaccurate low-resolution graphics, I&#x27;ve resorted to buying toothbrushes the old-fashioned way at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I do like the grooves on the other side of the head and</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not like you can really go wrong with it, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brush my tongue so don&#x27;t want the hard ridges on the back.</li>
            <li> I lost my previous toothbrush, thus the reason for opening the newer one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone, but for me I&#x27;ll look for something a little softer.</li>
            <li> Seemed to hold up well and didn&#x27;t scrape the gums harshly the way some toothbrushes can do.</li>
            <li> I was overall not happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The quality is below my expectations and I wouldn’t waste money buying this again.</li>
            <li> At Over 3.50 what a waste.  </li>
            <li> The product I received had irritating grooves along the brush face opposite the bristles.</li>
            <li> If you think you would be sensitive in this area then this brush will rub you wrong way.</li>
            <li> These are reliable and are not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a toothbrush, works, head a bit small</li>
            <li> usually buy these for guests...</li>
            <li> I thought it maybe because my previous toothbrush is not good.</li>
            <li> I brush hard and can&#x27;t seem to stop the habit, so I need something softer than this.</li>
            <li> very small head on this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> The handle/hold is very thin, so you feel like you&#x27;re holding a slightly thick and flattened pencil.</li>
            <li> Normally I just use whatever toothbrush my dentist gives me, but I was in a predicament because the toothbrush I was given tasted and smelled horribly of rubber.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the price doubled, at $2.00</li>
            <li> i really hated to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> This caused a nasty canker sore to develop on the inside of my lower lip.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a toothbrush that has working bristles. They don&#x27;t fall out when you brush. It&#x27;s soft and not too big. Best part is was part of subscribe &amp; save (but not anymore). Was a great way to get that 15% discount for the month.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a nice reach and the soft full head feel fine as it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is as advertised, but I&#x27;m not paying $4.00 for it. Too bad the price doubled, at $2.00 it WAS great as an add on...</li>
            <li> This is a nice throw away toothbrush and I actually paid less on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of electric toothbrushes so I like these..</li>
            <li> Colgate Classic Soft Full Head Toothbrush. Simple toothbrush worth the price. 3 stars given. havent used it yet though. !!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush and I like how it cleaned all my teeth it&#x27;s very effective and when I ware it out I am coming back and buying another one from this seller.  I am happy with their service!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a toothbrush and well, it does the job. Not one of my personal favorites of toothbrushes, but it was okay and the price was right. Seemed to hold up well and didn&#x27;t scrape the gums harshly the way some toothbrushes can do.</li>
            <li> i love brushing my teeth now thank oyou crest! keep up the good work. you make my smile so much nicer.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth with this. It&#x27;s a toothbrush. It is a good way to get over the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; hump.</li>
            <li> I bought this and I brush my teeth with it. The best part is when it brushes my teeth and gets rid of the bad stuff. I keep it on the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought this just so I would qualify for free shipping. It&#x27;s a good toothbrush. I have brushed my teeth with it on several occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to meet the $25 free shipping. Without any expectations, this toothbrush is pretty good. The bristles are soft and sturdy. You can brush as throughly as you want with some force and the bristles will not unravel as cheap toothbrushes would often do. If you need an item to meet the $25 free shipping, this item is indispensable.</li>
            <li> Its a tooth brush the brisals are soft like they as they say and the get a rondome color snall tooth brush also</li>
            <li> I was overall not happy with this toothbrush.  I know its cheap but I found much better toothbrushes from my local drugstore.  Would pass on this.</li>
            <li> I keep these in stock for unexpected guests that stay overnight.  Nothing is worse than waking up somewhere and not being able to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price was a little higher than supermarket price, but the product is great.  When next needed, we intend to order the three pack.  The price per brush is cheaper, and the quality justifies keeping extras on hand.</li>
            <li> A gag christmas present, my friend still uses it today</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I think it could be softer. I would recommend this to someone, but for me I&#x27;ll look for something a little softer. I brush hard and can&#x27;t seem to stop the habit, so I need something softer than this.</li>
            <li> what can I say this was a add on item and I really like the toothbrush and was a good price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, gets the plague off my teeth very efficiently. The product came much earlier than expected. I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li> good tooth brush since i use it i noticed different in my mouth. I really like it . Also i am going to buy it very often .</li>
            <li> It’s a toothbrush…how else do you use a toothbrush? It works the same as any other toothbrush which all customers need to know. So there was nothing I liked or particularly dislike either. The quality is below my expectations and I wouldn’t waste money buying this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush.  Bristles were soft, arrived promptly.  Would buy again if it were on sale again for the low cost.</li>
            <li> We buy these to stock up on toothbrushes.  They work great and are long lasting.  Will keep buying when they are on sale.</li>
            <li> At Over 3.50 what a waste.  I should have bought it at WGs for 99 cents it would have been better</li>
            <li> What can I say, the name Colgate speaks volumes in my opinion, and my fiance loves these toothbrushes. They were affordable and were delivered superfast!</li>
            <li> The product I received had irritating grooves along the brush face opposite the bristles. This caused a nasty canker sore to develop on the inside of my lower lip.  If you think you would be sensitive in this area then this brush will rub you wrong way. Due to Amazon&#x27;s inept product descriptions and inaccurate low-resolution graphics, I&#x27;ve resorted to buying toothbrushes the old-fashioned way at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush however I consider the bristles to be medium and not soft as advertised. I do like the grooves on the other side of the head and the handle&#x27;s grip is really well made.</li>
            <li> This is best price you&#x27;re going to find on a decent toothbrush through Amazon. Serves as a good choice when you just need to spend that extra dollar or two to get up to 25 dollars for Super Saver Shipping. These will only last you about a month before they&#x27;re frayed. They&#x27;re relatively small as others have pointed out, and will require more precision work with hard to reach teeth. But if you put in the wrist work - this tooth brush is as good as any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for families on a budget. You could get 4 of them for about 6 bucks, whereas most 2-packs cost that much or more. These brushes are just as high as quality as others but of course, smaller like I mentioned. The point is they will last just as long as the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re willing to deal with a smaller/thinner grip, and smaller brush size (that is just as durable as bigger brushes) then I say go for it. (This may even be preferable for your children) If you bought one of these every month with one of your Super Saver Shipping purchases you&#x27;d only be spending about 18 dollars per year on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for an adequate toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t as soft as advertised.  I wonder if they are mislabeled hence the rock bottom pricing? I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush!  Although I tried selecting my Power Ball numbers with the handle of this toothbrush, it has yet to select the numbers that will win the PowerBall jackpot - therefore I&#x27;m downgrading it from a 5 to a 3.</li>
            <li> Colgate is another name very popular in the average home as i was growing up ,this toothbrush was very durable to be soft head.this product came on time for changing the toothbrush time in our resident i really hated to get rid of it.I also noticed how strong the handle was,not weak.If you love a good toothbrush to get the job done colgate is the one.</li>
            <li> Good Price, shipped fast.  Again, Colgate make a good product, this was at a good price point, was added on to a larger order.</li>
            <li> i love it and the price is cheaper,i will buy it next time,i wish the shipper will be faster next time.</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting a soft head, but it was rather hard and I really don&#x27;t like them.  It also has a large head (as advertised).</li>
            <li> I have used Colgate toothbrushes successfully for years.  This toothbrush was impossible to use.  The fancy design (bumpy surface) on the back of the head kept hitting my other teeth.  Rather than filing down the creative bumps, I turned it into a tile cleaner</li>
            <li> Normally I just use whatever toothbrush my dentist gives me, but I was in a predicament because the toothbrush I was given tasted and smelled horribly of rubber. I lost my previous toothbrush, thus the reason for opening the newer one. I decided to buy from amazon instead, and I found this. The bristles are not too hard or too soft, and it doesn&#x27;t have on of the rubber tongue scrubbers that I don&#x27;t like, all in all, its a toothbrush and it works.</li>
            <li> it is the spare toothbrush in case my sonic one does not work.  It is a classic model. works well</li>
            <li> Easy on gums, cleans well, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. What more could you ask!? (best price is on ebay)</li>
            <li> I am not a picky person with toothbrushes, but the reason this toothpaste dissapointed me was that I expected it to be soft, as the name says. But its just like a regular toothbrush, not as soft as I wanted. I got a soft toothbrush of another brand and was satisfied with that. The good thing about this toothbrush is that its bristles do not wear out pretty fast, they remain intact for a long time. The size is good too, its just that I expected it to be softer.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon.com. It was about $2.50 and it is very good quality. Only thing that I would want better is the brush is not very big.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a toothbrush, works, head a bit small but it&#x27;s not like my mouth/teeth are huge so it&#x27;s fine haha</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like going out to the store so i bought this online, and what can i say, it&#x27;s a regular toothbrush.  was packaged well, and works well, and wasn&#x27;t over priced.</li>
            <li> very small head on this tooth brush.  Would have liked a full head instead of a small oval head.  Otherwise, great. Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush and it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, buy it. I got it for around a dollar or two and it&#x27;s worth that much. I&#x27;d probably pay about $5 (not including shipping and handling) at the most so it&#x27;s awesome.but go get it from Walmart if you can&#x27;t really wait, the price doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;d only be a few dollars difference.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my teeth always bleed when I brushed my teeth. I thought it maybe because my previous toothbrush is not good. I used this one to replace that one and my teeth are Ok now.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I forgot to bring one to college.  Everybody made fun of me but it was a great purchase.  I didn&#x27;t even have to move and I got a toothbrush.  Life is good.</li>
            <li> These are good toothbrushes. I love&#x27;em. And are a great value for the price. These are reliable and are not cheaply made. Definitely worth buying. No disappointments here.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap tooth brush, and it feels like one. This tooth brush gets the job done, but definitely is nothing special. For the price this would be a great backup, or to be used for guests that forget theirs, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for an add-on item if you need to get free shipping but also a great deal. It&#x27;s actually cheaper here then at my local store and I love the soft Colgate toothbrushes since they actually clean my teeth without decimating my gums. Great value. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 5 weeks, but did the job, wore out quite quickly though. Guess it was worth the price just barely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent tooth brush, I usually used medium-hard, but this is a nice brush as well. The handle/hold is very thin, so you feel like you&#x27;re holding a slightly thick and flattened pencil.</li>
            <li> I wanted a soft toothbrush. This one would be medium by my standards. I guess there are no official standards, maybe there should be.</li>
            <li> Most toothbrushes hurt my gums but not this one. Totally recommended. If you have sensitive gums this toothbrush helps a lot.</li>
            <li> IS NOT SOFT.  not happy w/it, therefore do not use it! I USE IT TO CLEAN COMBS &amp; BRUSHES OK!</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use a soft toothbrush and this one does the trick. It was inexpensive and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush has a nice full head but I don&#x27;t care for the ridges on the back of the brush.  I believe they&#x27;re for tongue scraping but they also scrape the inside of my mouth when I brush my teeth.  Don&#x27;t like that.  I brush my tongue so don&#x27;t want the hard ridges on the back.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not like you can really go wrong with it, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;REALLY CHEAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Too skinny! I feel like a giant having this in my hands. And the brush itself is also skinny, and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover my teeth completely, which means I have to brush twice as long to go over the top and bottom of the tooth since the brush doesn&#x27;t reach the entire tooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so I could meet the minimum free shipping.  Thought it was 1 toothbrush - was a surprised there were several in the box. Nice quality soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Classic soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy these for guests...dinner parties or overnight. They are cheap and do the job well.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.  It&#x27;s the same thing you&#x27;ve probably seen in your local drug store.  It&#x27;s a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for when I go on a trip and do not wish to take my electric toothbrush and if I forget to plug in my electric toothbrush then I can just grab this one really fast. Soft toothbrush - cleans well. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> The item description says that colors may vary.  Mine is white plastic with green grips and logo, and with blue and yellow highlights in the bristles.</li>
            <li> This is your very standard toothbrush - do not expect anything fancy.  It&#x27;s nice that things like this are available as add-on purchases.</li>
            <li> No reason to dislike. It is a great toothbrush. It is very convenient to have it sent to our home every 6 months with subscribe and save that way we know it is time to replace our brushes!</li>
