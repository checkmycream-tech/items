            <li>I have a very itchy scalp, no dandruff, just itchy, I rubbed a bunch on my scalp, thru out the day and it did nothing to stop it</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to the salon...</li>
            <li>It really works if you are always scratching your scalp all the time.</li>
            <li>Be sparingly with it, use a quarter size for your whole head.</li>
            <li>Not anymore thanks to this product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s mostly sold in salons and after searching high and low for it I finally decided to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>New product...Will order again for this supplier.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair very soft and has a gloss to it.</li>

            <li>I have started using Keracare products for my itchy dry scalp, I love this product, it do not weigh my hair down</li>

            <li>to apply to my scalp I parted my hair and applied it with a small brush(the brush cannot be soft so a n old toothbrush  with very soft  bristles works rather well.  </li>
            <li>If you have color treated hair or use a lot of direct heat on your hair such as curling irons and flat irons, you need to deep condition your hair weekly.  </li>

            <li> I have just what it&#x27;s called Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp and this product controls that.</li>
            <li> My scalp is always dry after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using KeraCare Dry &amp; Itchy scalp for four months now</li>
            <li> It sooths my dry scalp</li>
            <li> The dry scalp reappear after a wash.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get really dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair but my sons, one has tight, curly blond hair and the other has wavy, loose curls like you see in some Hispanic children, and I use this on their hair when it gets really dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> the other stuff I have used (castor or olive oil for example).</li>
            <li> I find that washing my hair at least once a week and using KeraCare products and a moisterizing/conditioning shampoo have made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to get rid of the dry and itchy scalp permanently.</li>
            <li> so Im not sure if I would try again because the size is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, after I wash it, it get very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Part your hair in small sections, apply the grease and rub it in all over.</li>
            <li> I also priced this at a few beauty supply stores and it was at least fourteen dollars at each one.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it left my hair so greasy that it looked dirty.</li>
            <li> This product line is on the expensive end, but a little dab will do ya and it lasts.</li>
            <li> The case was broken...</li>
            <li> and I hate grease or anything that weighs the hair down.</li>
            <li> It is also expensive</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as it control these horrible scalp conditions I had.</li>
            <li> Works well but smells terrible!</li>

            <li> I have just what it&#x27;s called Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp and this product controls that. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>

            <li> I tried this product and it left my hair so greasy that it looked dirty. I would not recommend it...</li>
            <li> Its okay. Leaves oily film on hair and skin but it does offer a bit of tingling to make you think its working...</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than going to the salon... Works well. New product...Will order again for this supplier.  No complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> Use a little in the palm of my hand and keeps my hair soft and with a nice shine to it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found this hair grease at Amazon. My beautician uses this on my hair. Because I am now homebound 98% of the time to be able to order it and not ask anyone to pick it up at the mall for me, I am truly grateful. I have been using this product over eight years. I love it. It really works if you are always scratching your scalp all the time. Be sparingly with it, use a quarter size for your whole head. Part your hair in small sections, apply the grease and rub it in all over. Your scalp feels so good it tingles. The smell is light and will not drown out your perfume.</li>
            <li> Works well but smells terrible! I liked how it made my scalp feel but the smell was real strong like a medicated ointment. It is also expensive so Im not sure if I would try again because the size is not worth the price. I also priced this at a few beauty supply stores and it was at least fourteen dollars at each one.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist use this in my hair and my hair loves it! So I had to purchase my own to have at home! My scalp is always dry after washing my hair. Not anymore thanks to this product. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve discovered that less is more.  I don&#x27;t like to put a lot of grease/spritz/holding spray, etc on my hair because it tends to exacerbate my itchy scalp condition.      I&#x27;ve been using KeraCare Dry &amp; Itchy scalp for four months now and I&#x27;m very pleased.  It sooths my dry scalp and I don&#x27;t seem to have all of the flaking that I use to.  It is very light and seems to just evaporate after some hours, unlike many other grease products which kind of sit there like vaseline.      I&#x27;ve used many products before to alleviate my dry itchy scalp that didn&#x27;t make a difference.  I find that washing my hair at least once a week and using KeraCare products and a moisterizing/conditioning shampoo have made a big difference.  If you have color treated hair or use a lot of direct heat on your hair such as curling irons and flat irons, you need to deep condition your hair weekly.  Tea tree shampoos are also soothing.     This product line is on the expensive end, but a little dab will do ya and it lasts.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  it got rid of y itchy scalp problem almost immediately.  to apply to my scalp I parted my hair and applied it with a small brush(the brush cannot be soft so a n old toothbrush  with very soft  bristles works rather well.  it is not as greasy looking as some&lt;br /&gt;of the other stuff I have used (castor or olive oil for example). excellent product.!!!!</li>
            <li> Received in very quick timing.wow! The product is wonderful! Excellent service, i recommend! Makes your hair feel tingly, silky and smells really nice!</li>
            <li> I am not able to get rid of the dry and itchy scalp permanently. The dry scalp reappear after a wash. But yes it does sooth the scalp until it on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it. It&#x27;s mostly sold in salons and after searching high and low for it I finally decided to buy it from Amazon. Being that I have relaxed hair I do not like to use much product on my hair. Sometimes I get really dry scalp and I hate grease or anything that weighs the hair down. This Kera Care product is perfect. I apply it to my scalp as needed and what I love most about it is that it does not make my hair look oily. Even after I wrap my hair at night it still has a lot of bounce and body. I also love that it has a minty feel and makes your scalp feel refreshed. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great scalp treatment for dryness</li>
            <li> This keeps my scalp moisturized and adds a nice sheen to my hair as well.  It works even better when used after steps 1 &amp; 2.</li>

            <li> I have started using Keracare products for my itchy dry scalp, I love this product, it do not weigh my hair down and I do not experience and flake and itching. I will continue to use this product as long as it control these horrible scalp conditions I had.</li>
            <li> I like Kera Care products...Works well w my haird!They always have a nice smell to the products as well. Great!</li>

            <li> I like this product.  It is very light for the hair and it smells good. I will buy this product again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This product is part of my routine when it comes to control my dandruff. It works. It even works on children.</li>
