            <li>this product is not that great...</li>
            <li>this would be great-</li>
            <li>I bought this brush in January and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product through Amazon many times and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Good idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for the price, though.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good way to style hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair looks almost as good as what they do at the beauty salon</li>
            <li>So with this I can get good volume.</li>
            <li>good barrel sizes, works well, but on-off switch doesn&#x27;t work--won&#x27;t shut off.  </li>
            <li>love it great service</li>
            <li>Love it, works great, and a bargain price.  </li>
            <li>She says it works well and is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love these curling blow drying brushes!  </li>
            <li>But with the curling blow drying brush I am able to make my hair look almost like I came from the beauty shop!  </li>
            <li>For styling, I love it!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the hot air brush and the price.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; it works great for me</li>
            <li>This styling brush does a great job on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely warm, it&#x27;s a crappy products..don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>i liked how it made my hair fuller and shinier.  </li>
            <li>It is good for travel for touching up.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was nice, no problems with ease of use.</li>
            <li>great tool, very reasonably priced and good for travel as well</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re fine haired like me, will add loads of volume and on a fortuitously good hair day, even minimize frizz and static!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and adds tons of volume and curl.</li>
            <li>It smoothes out my hair and makes having it curl under very easy.  </li>
            <li>The brush attachments come unlocked and fall off very easily.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, if you haven&#x27;t had a better one, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li>It is in two parts instead of one part , but I will be able to adapt.</li>
            <li>I have to attatch the brush which I will be using most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Top the bottom drawer</li>
            <li>Might work better on longer hair....</li>
            <li>Plastic causes static cling hair.</li>
            <li>im pleased for the price</li>
            <li>I would like it much better if it were hotter.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it was cheaper than our local Wal Mart.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say I love this product</li>
            <li>Will reorder from you when I need more.</li>
            <li>Yes I love it and the prompt service  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made and it went into the trash!  </li>
            <li>did was cause static electricity  to my hair because of the bristles.&lt;br</li>

            <li>want.good price.i am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Better for longer hair</li>
            <li>I am facing six months of rehab and am glad to know I can meet that challenge and look stylish doing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love  </li>
            <li>and she seems to be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I love this Conair brush.  </li>
            <li>but it was not at all stylish.</li>
            <li>I love this air styling brush.</li>
            <li>I shall have to get something better.</li>
            <li>Best price possible at Amazon</li>
            <li>:)  Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Works great and no negative post here.</li>
            <li>I do not use it to dry my hair, I use it for styling and it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But as far as styling, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those cheap products on Amazon that functions like it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Good product and serves my purpose very well.</li>
            <li>Styles hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Still a great tool, use it daily, and can&#x27;t imagine finding better quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it is lightweight, easy to use from any angle.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair, makes hair look fuller with more volume, no need to set hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;Cord also swivels for easy use.</li>
            <li>head detaches too easily from body when I&#x27;m using it.. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>Also I wouldn&#x27;t want strong bursts of air blowing away the style.</li>
            <li>I purchased this styling brush to replace my old favorite brush and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using hot air brushes for many years and love them.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Light weight, and easy to style with.</li>
            <li>This hot air styling brush is perfect for my fine hair; it&#x27;s the only one that styles my hair well.</li>
            <li>What a joy to finally have hair with body and style!</li>
            <li>The quality and everything was cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for last minute touch ups.</li>
            <li>However after using it maybe twice a week for 6 months neither of the brushes will lock in securely and they fall off when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li>One of the brushes doesn&#x27;t lock in good, so when I use it the brush frequently slides off.</li>
            <li>Its not for drying hair but its good for styling and its much better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I do love the hot air curling brush process of curling and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for styling than drying, so it needn&#x27;t be extremely hot, which would turn my hair to straw.</li>
            <li>The cool function sets the wave in my hair</li>
            <li>I love it, it dries &amp; curls in one step, it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>bristles and the way the brush is fixed and does not rotate are nice features, and were the blower and the heater stronger</li>
            <li>A long-lived product, the Conair styling brush is a modest size - let&#x27;s say it will fit nicely into a drawer - and doesn&#x27;t give out too much heat, so no worries about overstyling or burning out fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use, not so hot</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an older model, that over the years of traveling and being dropped, had lost many bristles.</li>
            <li>The heated feature dries my hair quickly, but allows me the option of</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Will be stocking up as these are very hard to find and work great!</li>
            <li>I expected a good Conair product, but found that this is very light weight plastic, with a barrel that will not sit in the correct place even when following the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was right!</li>
            <li>Well-made and useful.</li>
            <li>Originally liked this styling brush a lot especially with the interchangeable brushes.  </li>
            <li>you do your hair, kind of similar to a blow dryer</li>
            <li>and she came out with her hair all shiny and turning under in the right places.  </li>
            <li>The 3/4&amp;#34; is the one I use and find it to be the right size of curl.  </li>
            <li>so I have it right away.</li>
            <li>went right to Amazon.com, bought it and in 3 days.....</li>
            <li>The styling brush makes a high pitched whiney sound when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>With long hair or short hair, I Love it works great, will use it every day until I need to order a new one.</li>
            <li>Works great for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very much hair</li>
            <li>but I do like it very, very much.  </li>
            <li>so the amount of hot air blowing through your hair is reduced.</li>
            <li>even better than when I used only a hair dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>I like this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I actually owned a Conair hot air styling brush/hot iron that worked much much much better...</li>
            <li>I purchased this item hoping to love it after using a similar one at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>What hot air?</li>
            <li>Also, the noise level  is much higher than any dryer I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li>I like hot air brushes and have used Conair products for years.</li>
            <li>It worked on the first try, but after that the brushes wouldn&#x27;t stay on the handle and fell off during use.  </li>
            <li>First off the bristles from the brush</li>
            <li>Which was way much hotter and did the job!</li>
            <li>I needed a travel size replacement for my Conair hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this curler, I tried it right away, pluged it in---</li>
            <li>and it really works good for me since I have thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The air did not get hot, only warm and barely that.</li>
            <li>bobbed hair reasonably well using the Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styling Brush.</li>
            <li>This one does not have as large a blower</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and works really well,especially if you can not handle a brush and a blow dryer at the same time</li>
            <li>Nice size for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this hot air styling brush mainly because of the 3/4-inch brush.</li>
            <li>They no longer carry much of a selection.</li>
            <li>I really wanted  a rotating hiar brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This brush does both of them very well.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an identical one as I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very light,not too heart to burn my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer brush.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Much easier that a curling iron</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t turn it to much bc</li>
            <li>The product is made really well, which can also be misleading.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and as advertised</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much strength in my hands, so</li>
            <li>Its like blow drying with a brush but not as much power.</li>
            <li>It softens hair well and really detangles</li>
            <li>Hot air or cool air is mor gentle to your hair than a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It barely puts out hot air and isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li>This styling brush does the job, but beware that it only has one speed and the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>The reviews are correct in that there isn&#x27;t enough power/heat to really dry your hair effectively.</li>
            <li>It is too low power and too cool of a temperature.</li>
            <li>While the air in this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as my old one</li>
            <li>the larger attachment didn&#x27;t make my hair as full and shiny as the older model i used.  </li>
            <li>and it sure costs less money to style your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i bought this item because i used the older model that a friend of mine had.  </li>
            <li>I also bought this as a replacement for an older model Conair that broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a retired hairdresser and would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The hard brush attachment is plastic and doesn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just normal but it won&#x27;t curl or anything.</li>
            <li>The hot air brush works very well for me, accomplishing the same thing.</li>
            <li>you have long hair or a short cut, and the contoured handle makes it comfortable to grip ,you will like it!</li>
            <li>One of the brushes on the new one will not lock in place which makes it a little unhandy but I am still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>If Conair improved that, there would be no difference in my mind between the and new models.</li>
            <li>I have used one for years &amp; needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I never learned to finish off my styles with back combing or how to smooth the ends with a regular brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li>Lacks power to actually dry your hair quickly....</li>
            <li>the brush doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough..</li>
            <li>The Hot Air Styling Brush is the same as I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I have short curly hair and the Conair Hot Air Curling Brush saves me time in drying and timing my curly locks.</li>
            <li>I used a HVAC digital infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of the &#x27;hot air&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for years and the first one I bought lasted for several years.  </li>
            <li>Finally, found this hot air brush again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conair BC40JBC Hot Brush, White, 0.75 Inch</li>
            <li>I have had 2 of them over the past 20 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Better than any of the other similar products.</li>
            <li>minor nuisance but worth keeping it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and, as a result, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Something needs to distract me from the big black shoulder brace and sling. :)</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin, but this Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler gives my hair BODY!</li>
            <li>Takes too long to dry my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one which was failing.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the hot air styling brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It simplifies getting ready as it dries and styles hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I had an ancient one, maybe 25 years old, a Lady Kenmore (see how old it is?</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I was trying to get the brush attachment locked on, and the whole thing broke off, so now the brush attachments have nothing to attach to.</li>
            <li>This hot air styler is pretty much a waste of money...</li>
            <li>Towel dry first, of course.   </li>
            <li>go back to my 10  year old hot air brush, but that would require me to grow out my hair because of the bigger size.</li>
            <li>The barrel twists to lock, however if you turn the dryer in the opposite direction the barrel unlocks and falls off, as a result I am only able to dry one side properly.</li>
            <li>The older model was not a 2-in-1 brush, which is apparently no longer made.</li>
            <li>Conair hot air brush works satisfactorily but brush ends are sharp and scratch the skin.</li>
            <li>Its not dangerous, but a little bit of a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, this company no longer makes that particular item any more.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bulky to store, but not more so than the others I own.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t give this a good or bad rating because my&lt;br /&gt;hair is short and I just couldn&#x27;t get it to give volume to my hair</li>
            <li>The larger size I did want has soft bristles that don&#x27;t work to curl the hair.</li>
            <li>and it barely grabs a hold of it.</li>
            <li>It barely heats up.</li>
            <li>I did think the old brushes would work on this one as it is the same model</li>
            <li>I was unable to believe how nice this product makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>My stylist used it after cutting my hair and loved it, too.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and use the thick brush for the top and the smaller one on the sides.</li>
            <li>Your hair has to be almost dry to use it, but the package does say use on damp or dry hair, so you have to use a hair dryer first.</li>
            <li>It not only barely blow any air through the vents, but the brushes were cheap, thick plastic.</li>
            <li>I am not handy enough to be able to roll my hair on a brush and blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>So far all four model BM20XBC hot air styling brushes have failed to get hot enough.</li>
            <li>This product is honestly a waste of money, for numerous of reasons first being that it does not curl nor style your hair like it says.</li>
            <li>A fine haired female, I&#x27;ve always run into various issues with styling tools - anything from having them weigh down my hair to turning my do into a frightfully flat and frizzy mess!  </li>

            <li> this product is not that great...</li>
            <li> this would be great-</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in January and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through Amazon many times and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price, though.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good way to style hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair looks almost as good as what they do at the beauty salon</li>
            <li> So with this I can get good volume.</li>
            <li> good barrel sizes, works well, but on-off switch doesn&#x27;t work--won&#x27;t shut off.  </li>
            <li> love it great service</li>
            <li> Love it, works great, and a bargain price.  </li>
            <li> She says it works well and is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love these curling blow drying brushes!  </li>
            <li> But with the curling blow drying brush I am able to make my hair look almost like I came from the beauty shop!  </li>
            <li> For styling, I love it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the hot air brush and the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; it works great for me</li>
            <li> This styling brush does a great job on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely warm, it&#x27;s a crappy products..don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> i liked how it made my hair fuller and shinier.  </li>
            <li> It is good for travel for touching up.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was nice, no problems with ease of use.</li>
            <li> great tool, very reasonably priced and good for travel as well</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re fine haired like me, will add loads of volume and on a fortuitously good hair day, even minimize frizz and static!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and adds tons of volume and curl.</li>
            <li> It smoothes out my hair and makes having it curl under very easy.  </li>
            <li> The brush attachments come unlocked and fall off very easily.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, if you haven&#x27;t had a better one, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> It is in two parts instead of one part , but I will be able to adapt.</li>
            <li> I have to attatch the brush which I will be using most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Top the bottom drawer</li>
            <li> Might work better on longer hair....</li>
            <li> Plastic causes static cling hair.</li>
            <li> im pleased for the price</li>
            <li> I would like it much better if it were hotter.</li>
            <li> And best of all, it was cheaper than our local Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love this product</li>
            <li> Will reorder from you when I need more.</li>
            <li> Yes I love it and the prompt service  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made and it went into the trash!  </li>
            <li> did was cause static electricity  to my hair because of the bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>

            <li> want.good price.i am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Better for longer hair</li>
            <li> I am facing six months of rehab and am glad to know I can meet that challenge and look stylish doing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love  </li>
            <li> and she seems to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair brush.  </li>
            <li> but it was not at all stylish.</li>
            <li> I love this air styling brush.</li>
            <li> I shall have to get something better.</li>
            <li> Best price possible at Amazon</li>
            <li> :)  Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Works great and no negative post here.</li>
            <li> I do not use it to dry my hair, I use it for styling and it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> But as far as styling, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those cheap products on Amazon that functions like it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Good product and serves my purpose very well.</li>
            <li> Styles hair easily.  </li>
            <li> Still a great tool, use it daily, and can&#x27;t imagine finding better quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it is lightweight, easy to use from any angle.</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair, makes hair look fuller with more volume, no need to set hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;Cord also swivels for easy use.</li>
            <li> head detaches too easily from body when I&#x27;m using it.. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Also I wouldn&#x27;t want strong bursts of air blowing away the style.</li>
            <li> I purchased this styling brush to replace my old favorite brush and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using hot air brushes for many years and love them.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Light weight, and easy to style with.</li>
            <li> This hot air styling brush is perfect for my fine hair; it&#x27;s the only one that styles my hair well.</li>
            <li> What a joy to finally have hair with body and style!</li>
            <li> The quality and everything was cheap.</li>
            <li> Great for last minute touch ups.</li>
            <li> However after using it maybe twice a week for 6 months neither of the brushes will lock in securely and they fall off when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li> One of the brushes doesn&#x27;t lock in good, so when I use it the brush frequently slides off.</li>
            <li> Its not for drying hair but its good for styling and its much better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I do love the hot air curling brush process of curling and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for styling than drying, so it needn&#x27;t be extremely hot, which would turn my hair to straw.</li>
            <li> The cool function sets the wave in my hair</li>
            <li> I love it, it dries &amp; curls in one step, it really works for me.  </li>
            <li> bristles and the way the brush is fixed and does not rotate are nice features, and were the blower and the heater stronger</li>
            <li> A long-lived product, the Conair styling brush is a modest size - let&#x27;s say it will fit nicely into a drawer - and doesn&#x27;t give out too much heat, so no worries about overstyling or burning out fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to use, not so hot</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older model, that over the years of traveling and being dropped, had lost many bristles.</li>
            <li> The heated feature dries my hair quickly, but allows me the option of</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Will be stocking up as these are very hard to find and work great!</li>
            <li> I expected a good Conair product, but found that this is very light weight plastic, with a barrel that will not sit in the correct place even when following the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Well-made and useful.</li>
            <li> Originally liked this styling brush a lot especially with the interchangeable brushes.  </li>
            <li> you do your hair, kind of similar to a blow dryer</li>
            <li> and she came out with her hair all shiny and turning under in the right places.  </li>
            <li> The 3/4&amp;#34; is the one I use and find it to be the right size of curl.  </li>
            <li> so I have it right away.</li>
            <li> went right to Amazon.com, bought it and in 3 days.....</li>
            <li> The styling brush makes a high pitched whiney sound when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> With long hair or short hair, I Love it works great, will use it every day until I need to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Works great for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very much hair</li>
            <li> but I do like it very, very much.  </li>
            <li> so the amount of hot air blowing through your hair is reduced.</li>
            <li> even better than when I used only a hair dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I actually owned a Conair hot air styling brush/hot iron that worked much much much better...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping to love it after using a similar one at a friend&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> What hot air?</li>
            <li> Also, the noise level  is much higher than any dryer I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> I like hot air brushes and have used Conair products for years.</li>
            <li> It worked on the first try, but after that the brushes wouldn&#x27;t stay on the handle and fell off during use.  </li>
            <li> First off the bristles from the brush</li>
            <li> Which was way much hotter and did the job!</li>
            <li> I needed a travel size replacement for my Conair hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this curler, I tried it right away, pluged it in---</li>
            <li> and it really works good for me since I have thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The air did not get hot, only warm and barely that.</li>
            <li> bobbed hair reasonably well using the Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styling Brush.</li>
            <li> This one does not have as large a blower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and works really well,especially if you can not handle a brush and a blow dryer at the same time</li>
            <li> Nice size for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this hot air styling brush mainly because of the 3/4-inch brush.</li>
            <li> They no longer carry much of a selection.</li>
            <li> I really wanted  a rotating hiar brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This brush does both of them very well.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an identical one as I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very light,not too heart to burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer brush.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Much easier that a curling iron</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t turn it to much bc</li>
            <li> The product is made really well, which can also be misleading.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and as advertised</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much strength in my hands, so</li>
            <li> Its like blow drying with a brush but not as much power.</li>
            <li> It softens hair well and really detangles</li>
            <li> Hot air or cool air is mor gentle to your hair than a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It barely puts out hot air and isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li> This styling brush does the job, but beware that it only has one speed and the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> The reviews are correct in that there isn&#x27;t enough power/heat to really dry your hair effectively.</li>
            <li> It is too low power and too cool of a temperature.</li>
            <li> While the air in this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as my old one</li>
            <li> the larger attachment didn&#x27;t make my hair as full and shiny as the older model i used.  </li>
            <li> and it sure costs less money to style your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i bought this item because i used the older model that a friend of mine had.  </li>
            <li> I also bought this as a replacement for an older model Conair that broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a retired hairdresser and would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The hard brush attachment is plastic and doesn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just normal but it won&#x27;t curl or anything.</li>
            <li> The hot air brush works very well for me, accomplishing the same thing.</li>
            <li> you have long hair or a short cut, and the contoured handle makes it comfortable to grip ,you will like it!</li>
            <li> One of the brushes on the new one will not lock in place which makes it a little unhandy but I am still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> If Conair improved that, there would be no difference in my mind between the and new models.</li>
            <li> I have used one for years &amp; needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I never learned to finish off my styles with back combing or how to smooth the ends with a regular brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li> Lacks power to actually dry your hair quickly....</li>
            <li> the brush doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough..</li>
            <li> The Hot Air Styling Brush is the same as I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I have short curly hair and the Conair Hot Air Curling Brush saves me time in drying and timing my curly locks.</li>
            <li> I used a HVAC digital infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of the &#x27;hot air&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for years and the first one I bought lasted for several years.  </li>
            <li> Finally, found this hot air brush again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair BC40JBC Hot Brush, White, 0.75 Inch</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of them over the past 20 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Better than any of the other similar products.</li>
            <li> minor nuisance but worth keeping it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and, as a result, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Something needs to distract me from the big black shoulder brace and sling. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, but this Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler gives my hair BODY!</li>
            <li> Takes too long to dry my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one which was failing.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the hot air styling brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It simplifies getting ready as it dries and styles hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I had an ancient one, maybe 25 years old, a Lady Kenmore (see how old it is?</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I was trying to get the brush attachment locked on, and the whole thing broke off, so now the brush attachments have nothing to attach to.</li>
            <li> This hot air styler is pretty much a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Towel dry first, of course.   </li>
            <li> go back to my 10  year old hot air brush, but that would require me to grow out my hair because of the bigger size.</li>
            <li> The barrel twists to lock, however if you turn the dryer in the opposite direction the barrel unlocks and falls off, as a result I am only able to dry one side properly.</li>
            <li> The older model was not a 2-in-1 brush, which is apparently no longer made.</li>
            <li> Conair hot air brush works satisfactorily but brush ends are sharp and scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> Its not dangerous, but a little bit of a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this company no longer makes that particular item any more.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bulky to store, but not more so than the others I own.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give this a good or bad rating because my&lt;br /&gt;hair is short and I just couldn&#x27;t get it to give volume to my hair</li>
            <li> The larger size I did want has soft bristles that don&#x27;t work to curl the hair.</li>
            <li> and it barely grabs a hold of it.</li>
            <li> It barely heats up.</li>
            <li> I did think the old brushes would work on this one as it is the same model</li>
            <li> I was unable to believe how nice this product makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> My stylist used it after cutting my hair and loved it, too.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and use the thick brush for the top and the smaller one on the sides.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be almost dry to use it, but the package does say use on damp or dry hair, so you have to use a hair dryer first.</li>
            <li> It not only barely blow any air through the vents, but the brushes were cheap, thick plastic.</li>
            <li> I am not handy enough to be able to roll my hair on a brush and blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> So far all four model BM20XBC hot air styling brushes have failed to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly a waste of money, for numerous of reasons first being that it does not curl nor style your hair like it says.</li>
            <li> A fine haired female, I&#x27;ve always run into various issues with styling tools - anything from having them weigh down my hair to turning my do into a frightfully flat and frizzy mess!  </li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power so if you have thick hair, it may not be the right one for you.</li>
            <li> granted I&#x27;m not very skilled at doing things like that even with a curling iron, but I&#x27;m decent at it.</li>
            <li> when i bought this newer model, i never used the smaller attachment because my hair is pretty thick and it would take forever to style with.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product after years of good service using same model.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one speed and you practically have to blow dry your hair before using this.</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t dry OR curl my hair, not enough &#x27;blow power&#x27;.</li>
            <li> You can dry and curl at the same time, thus conserving time.</li>
            <li> Have had numerous Conair products that I loved, but consider this one worthless.</li>
            <li> It also takes a really long time to dry my hair and my hair only comes to about my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy for me to use, and creates soft curl.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it would take me about an hour to dry my hair with just this product.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, coarse, natural hair, I WOULD NOT recommend it!</li>
            <li> Dyer does not cause breaking damage and last longer than other dryers I have tried</li>
            <li> I blowed dry my hair about 80 percent.</li>
            <li> now I will just use this air dry my hair 80 percent.</li>
            <li> and flip it under dry with this.</li>
            <li> And it does dry as it styles.</li>
            <li> but it do dry your hair</li>
            <li> use this for touch up after blowing my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> It helps dry damp hair as well as style it.  </li>
            <li> It is of decent quality and works well with my thick curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to sound negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice, so won&#x27;t send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My mistake was to purchase it at a local store rather than at Amazon.com where it costs $10 less.   </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> When it came time for me to have to use this one as my other Conair quit, I used it twice when it gave a long squeel and quit.</li>
            <li> those who say it dries too slowly, let hair dry naturally for 10 minutes before using the styler.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with thick hair and this thing takes forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The soft brush makes my hair smoother than the hard brush types.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve Tryed To Curl it Dry, Wet, Half Dry and Wet,  </li>
            <li> , wet the ends.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was as expected and arrived ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> It said 10 sec</li>
            <li> I Have Long slightly Wavey Hair</li>
            <li> It says it suppose to dry while styling your hair NOT TRUE...</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted but it will work.</li>
            <li> the Big Brush Doesnt Work well and the small brush Would Rather Tangle</li>
            <li> There is no hot air involved in this brush.  </li>
            <li> Did not like the brush or other attachment.</li>
            <li> I have purchased extras to keep on hand in fear of the product being discontinued by the manufacturer due to changing trends.</li>
            <li> Its not real secure and has unlicked while in use.</li>
            <li> This product also works well on slightly damp hair, but does not have the power to handle anything close to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> but since you paid good money for it you hate to throw it out at least for a year.</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair, damp hair, and towel dried hair with no success.</li>
            <li> Its inexpensive but not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> only complaint:  </li>
            <li> the brush is not sturdy enough for my relatively thick hair and therefore not useable.  </li>
            <li> made the ends of my hair very rough not cool.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all thumbs down</li>
            <li> so weak, it barely styles my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it by mistake while looking to replace my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Now they give out and stop working in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I also have a 3/4&amp;#34; curling iron for touch-ups, but find I need it less as my skill improves.</li>
            <li> The smaller size has hard bristles like I prefer but it is too small.</li>
            <li> it had a little curl</li>
            <li> This unit puts out so little air</li>
            <li> which I s the only one ill be using ) to flip my ends under after I wetted it and my hair was 80 percent dry... and</li>
            <li> Not available in any store .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Waste of Money and a Waste of time.</li>
            <li> A Piece Of JUNK Don&#x27;t Waste</li>
            <li> For my hair it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten the knack of using the round brush &amp; blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used this item a few times &amp; I must say that I do not like the way that it works on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that the barrel was much smaller than my old model.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrific for the hair but the durability is extremely poor lately.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re Hard Earn Dollars on This Mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works as well with my hair as wetting my hair and using a drier.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t waste your $ and time like I did !</li>
            <li> It usually comes with plastic over Conair printed cardboard.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the larger diameter attachment is a brush instead of being plastic teeth as the smaller diameter one is....</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a small curling brush that was 3 /4 inch and metal so that it would hold the heat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> The smaller roller, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t lock onto the holder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no good at blow drying my hair with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> And the sad part about is that I  followed the instructions for dry hair, I started from the root of my hair and wind my hair around the bristle once like it said and held it there for 25 seconds.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time getting it to style my hair.</li>
            <li> When it stopped working I had a hard time locating another.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too late for replacement so now am looking for for the Conair BM 20C98.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To users who complained that the barrel keeps falling off, try installing the barrel without the arrow</li>
            <li> During the 10 mins it took to style my hair, it fell off at least a dozen times.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have thick hair</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t thick at all.</li>
            <li> which still works but is slowly losing parts and giving up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Not good for a lot of hair or thick</li>
            <li> The size of this curling brush is not good for the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no good at curling irons or curlers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine someone with thick hair!</li>
            <li> Not happy with brush as it keeps falling off handle even after twisting in place.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a matter of poor quality and not brawn.</li>
            <li> The problem I had was that every time I slightly rotated the brush, it fell out from the base.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been unable to learn to do the brush-and-blow-dry-at-the-same-time technique.  </li>
            <li> If you merely want a dryer, you might not like this, but if you want a styler, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Wimpy and useless.  </li>
            <li> Without the heat it is useless.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless so it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I found it very frustrating to try and use, if the barrel wasn&#x27;t falling off the darn thing was turning off.</li>
            <li> And it did very poorly!</li>
            <li> Bad wiring in the plug.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> but much much much annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a horrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife buys them three at a time. They work for about a year and then die! It does what she needs to do so it&#x27;s a compromise!</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a air brush dryer for some time. Not available in any store . they&#x27;re all combs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one which was failing. This one does not have as large a blower so the amount of hot air blowing through your hair is reduced. It&#x27;s OK, if you haven&#x27;t had a better one, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. I do love the hot air curling brush process of curling and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> So far all four model BM20XBC hot air styling brushes have failed to get hot enough. Very unhappy with this product after years of good service using same model.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted but it will work. It is in two parts instead of one part , but I will be able to adapt. I have to attatch the brush which I will be using most of the time.  I thought it was the one that stayed on all of the time. When it came time for me to have to use this one as my other Conair quit, I used it twice when it gave a long squeel and quit. I did every thing to make it work again. Then, called in some one to check on the electric part of it, and I was shown that the internal parts had come apart and now rattled. Too late for replacement so now am looking for for the Conair BM 20C98.</li>
            <li> Returned it for credit.  I understood that it was a &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; type brush not plastic.</li>
            <li> This Product Did Not Work For Me I Have Long slightly Wavey Hair And I&#x27;ve Tryed To Curl it Dry, Wet, Half Dry and Wet,  Nothing happened I&#x27;ve Even Tryed Hair Spray and Gel to get it to work Still Nothing. So I Tryed It On My Cousin who has short hair Nothing Happened Still. It&#x27;s a Waste of Money and a Waste of time. the Big Brush Doesnt Work well and the small brush Would Rather Tangle you&#x27;re hair when unraveling the curl then curl it at all. I Bought it on sale at Target. Lady&#x27;s This Is  A Piece Of JUNK Don&#x27;t Waste You&#x27;re Hard Earn Dollars on This Mess.</li>
            <li> I have used a curling blower drier for years. As they have worn out I have replaced them at the local department stores. They no longer carry much of a selection. So online shopping I have went. This brush comes with 2 brush sizes. The smaller size has hard bristles like I prefer but it is too small. The larger size I did want has soft bristles that don&#x27;t work to curl the hair. Top the bottom drawer it goes. You know that drawer that you put everything you probably won&#x27;t ever use but since you paid good money for it you hate to throw it out at least for a year.</li>
            <li> For years I have been unable to learn to do the brush-and-blow-dry-at-the-same-time technique.  I was visiting a friend, and heard what sounded like a simple blow dryer and she came out with her hair all shiny and turning under in the right places.  She let me play around with hers and I ordered it immediately.  I find it easy to use, not so hot it makes me worry about hair damage, and I like the way my hair looks after using it.  I only wish I had discovered it earlier!</li>
            <li> Well-made and useful.</li>
            <li> For my hair it was a waste of money.  Might work better on longer hair....maybe chin length.  Mine is short.</li>
            <li> Plastic causes static cling hair.</li>
            <li> This hot air styler is pretty much a waste of money...I have longish wavy hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for it...the brush doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough..it&#x27;s barely warm, it&#x27;s a crappy products..don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I saw an ad on television, that&#x27;s why I ordered this product.  I was unable to believe how nice this product makes my hair.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> love it great service</li>
            <li> I really wanted  a rotating hiar brush. but bought this. im pleased for the price it is great.!  I blowed dry my hair about 80 percent. then I wetted the ends. I have a bob that comes to the bottom of my neck. I used this the fatter attachment ( which I s the only one ill be using ) to flip my ends under after I wetted it and my hair was 80 percent dry... and my bangs. this turned out great. even better than when I used only a hair dryer and brush. I had to ocassionally use a curling iron. now I will just use this air dry my hair 80 percent. , wet the ends. and flip it under dry with this. it doesn&#x27;t look staticky or frizzy either. I also bought a rotating hiar brush as well didn&#x27;t get it yet. but for the money this is really great and im pleased.!!!!</li>
            <li> A fine haired female, I&#x27;ve always run into various issues with styling tools - anything from having them weigh down my hair to turning my do into a frightfully flat and frizzy mess!  Then this styling gem from Conair makes its debut to my limpy locks...  Conair&#x27;s air styling brush, I&#x27;ve found, will create an ease in styling your hair and if you&#x27;re fine haired like me, will add loads of volume and on a fortuitously good hair day, even minimize frizz and static!  A long-lived product, the Conair styling brush is a modest size - let&#x27;s say it will fit nicely into a drawer - and doesn&#x27;t give out too much heat, so no worries about overstyling or burning out fine hair.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My mom loves THIS air styling brush so I ordered 2 for her to keep as backups just in case Conair changes the style or features of their air styling brush.  And the price is affordable enough that you can buy several to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great, and a bargain price.  Styles hair easily.  I&#x27;m a retired hairdresser and would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush.  I never learned to finish off my styles with back combing or how to smooth the ends with a regular brush and dryer.  This brush does both of them very well.  It is a little bulky to store, but not more so than the others I own.  I stash this one at my son&#x27;s houses for my visits with him, so I don&#x27;t have to carry it back and forth in my luggage.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, but this Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styler gives my hair BODY! It&#x27;s more for styling than drying, so it needn&#x27;t be extremely hot, which would turn my hair to straw. Also I wouldn&#x27;t want strong bursts of air blowing away the style. My mistake was to purchase it at a local store rather than at Amazon.com where it costs $10 less.   If you merely want a dryer, you might not like this, but if you want a styler, I recommend it. And it does dry as it styles. Towel dry first, of course.   This is the best thing I&#x27;ve used on my hair. What a joy to finally have hair with body and style! And without damaging my hair!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my hair at all and I don&#x27;t even have thick hair it&#x27;s just normal but it won&#x27;t curl or anything. Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not happy with brush as it keeps falling off handle even after twisting in place. Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; it works great for me but this doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power so if you have thick hair, it may not be the right one for you.</li>
            <li> i bought this item because i used the older model that a friend of mine had.  i liked how it made my hair fuller and shinier.  when i bought this newer model, i never used the smaller attachment because my hair is pretty thick and it would take forever to style with.  the larger attachment didn&#x27;t make my hair as full and shiny as the older model i used.  maybe i wasn&#x27;t using it correctly, but i just put it away and never use it anymore.  i might pull it out again one day and try to use it again, but not any time soon.  also, i wanted to curl my hair with it, but that does&#x27;t work so well on asian hair, so don&#x27;t buy it for the curling option if that&#x27;s the case.</li>
            <li> This styling brush does the job, but beware that it only has one speed and the cool shot button doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten the knack of using the round brush &amp; blow dryer. The hot air brush works very well for me, accomplishing the same thing. Very easy to use and adds tons of volume and curl. I&#x27;ve been using these for years and panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love these curling blow drying brushes!  I am not handy enough to be able to roll my hair on a brush and blow dry it.  But with the curling blow drying brush I am able to make my hair look almost like I came from the beauty shop!  The cool function sets the wave in my hair and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wimpy and useless.  I bought it by mistake while looking to replace my previous one.  This one is what you should purchase if you want the best:  http://www.conair.com/1000-watt-hot-air-brush-styling-kit-p-1220-1_73_76.html</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was right! It does just what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps falling off when I&#x27;m using it. It also takes a really long time to dry my hair and my hair only comes to about my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It is of decent quality and works well with my thick curls.</li>
            <li> Good idea. Not sure if it works as well with my hair as wetting my hair and using a drier. still experimenting.</li>
            <li> I have used this item a few times &amp; I must say that I do not like the way that it works on my hair.  I have shoulder length hair that I have been told is \\&quot;thick\\&quot;.  The size of this curling brush is not good for the length of my hair.  I actually owned a Conair hot air styling brush/hot iron that worked much much much better...unfortunately, this company no longer makes that particular item any more.  A huge disappointment for me.  I would suggest passing on this item if you have my type of hair....</li>
            <li> I expected a good Conair product, but found that this is very light weight plastic, with a barrel that will not sit in the correct place even when following the instructions precisely.  I&#x27;ve used it twice, so won&#x27;t send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping to love it after using a similar one at a friend&#x27;s house. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. I don&#x27;t have very much hair and it isn&#x27;t thick at all. I wish I could have returned it. I tried it on dry hair, damp hair, and towel dried hair with no success. I guess I will continue my quest with a different brand!</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for one I lost.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even come close to curling your hair - it has no power - don&#x27;t waste your $ and time like I did !</li>
            <li> The product bearly heats up at all.  Its inexpensive but not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> The Hot Air Styling Brush is the same as I have been using for years.  It arrived in brown corrugated box with no shipping paperwork and no identification on the box.  It usually comes with plastic over Conair printed cardboard.  This was just in a box, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To users who complained that the barrel keeps falling off, try installing the barrel without the arrow aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who say it dries too slowly, let hair dry naturally for 10 minutes before using the styler.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to dry my fine, curly hair.  I would like it much better if it were hotter.</li>
            <li> This item did not work so I returned it to Amazon. I was dissatisfied with it. I did  not like this experience.</li>
            <li> Not good for a lot of hair or thick</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair and the Conair Hot Air Curling Brush saves me time in drying and timing my curly locks. I purchased this to replace an older model, that over the years of traveling and being dropped, had lost many bristles. The older model was not a 2-in-1 brush, which is apparently no longer made. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product  5 stars is because of the picking mechanism. Its not real secure and has unlicked while in use. Its not dangerous, but a little bit of a pain in the butt. If Conair improved that, there would be no difference in my mind between the and new models. Still a great tool, use it daily, and can&#x27;t imagine finding better quality for the price.</li>
            <li> There is no hot air involved in this brush.  I used a HVAC digital infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of the &#x27;hot air&#x27;.  It was 87 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was terrific about the return of this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I like it, overall, except there is no high-low settings. There&#x27;s only one speed and you practically have to blow dry your hair before using this. I have long hair and it would take me about an hour to dry my hair with just this product. I also had a hard time getting it to style my hair. It did give it body, though, which is the one of the reasons I bought it. I don&#x27;t know if I could get it to curl my hair, granted I&#x27;m not very skilled at doing things like that even with a curling iron, but I&#x27;m decent at it. It&#x27;s a good product for the price, though. It didn&#x27;t make my hair all frizzy and didn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, either.</li>
            <li> Bought this after my wife&#x27;s last one wore out. She loves it and it does a great job on her hair. This is one beauty tool she would not do without. And best of all, it was cheaper than our local Wal Mart. This made it simply a no brainer decision.</li>
            <li> This brush is terrific for the hair but the durability is extremely poor lately.  I have been using this brush for years and the first one I bought lasted for several years.  Now they give out and stop working in less than a year.  The last one I bought in May, 2012 and it has already stopped working.  Since it is guaranted for a year, I am returning it for a replacementt.</li>
            <li> Works great for fine, thin hair.  Dyer does not cause breaking damage and last longer than other dryers I have tried</li>
            <li> This product came with two interchangeable brushes and works as advertised to style my hair.  This product also works well on slightly damp hair, but does not have the power to handle anything close to wet hair.  For styling, I love it!</li>
            <li> I tried using it multiple times but it just did not do ANYTHING for my hair. It not only barely blow any air through the vents, but the brushes were cheap, thick plastic. I threw it away because I had no use for it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love this product but I do like it very, very much.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  Your hair has to be almost dry to use it, but the package does say use on damp or dry hair, so you have to use a hair dryer first. But as far as styling, it&#x27;s great.  The two brushes gave me the volume and style I was looking for.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Somehow this does not work as well as the Vidal Sassoon for my needs.</li>
            <li> great tool, very reasonably priced and good for travel as well</li>
            <li> What hot air? The air did not get hot, only warm and barely that. Without the heat it is useless. Do not waste your time and money on this. The quality and everything was cheap. This is one of those cheap products on Amazon that functions like it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the larger diameter attachment is a brush instead of being plastic teeth as the smaller diameter one is....the brush is not sturdy enough for my relatively thick hair and therefore not useable.  Also, the noise level  is much higher than any dryer I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> Great price and it really works good for me since I have thin fine hair.  Will reorder from you when I need more.</li>
            <li> was a gift.... she loves it~ sturdy</li>
            <li> Yes I love it and the prompt service  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> It barely puts out hot air and isn&#x27;t worth the time. I have very fine hair and it barely grabs a hold of it. I can&#x27;t imagine someone with thick hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this styling brush to replace my old favorite brush and am very pleased with it.  I have short to medium length hair  that is body permed.  This tool allows me to style the curls perfectly.  The heated feature dries my hair quickly, but allows me the option of&lt;br /&gt;softer, looser curls if I choose. I would recommend this product to  all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Its okk it don&#x27;t work like I thought it would but it do dry your hair it don&#x27;t style or curl..</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money. It barely heats up. The hard brush attachment is plastic and doesn&#x27;t even get warm. It&#x27;s a horrible product.</li>
            <li> This was as expected and arrived ahead of time.  I am very happy with this purchase. I always go to Amazon for things like this.</li>
            <li> Good product and serves my purpose very well. I like hot air brushes and have used Conair products for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot air brushes for many years and love them. I bought this because I appreciate the Conair name, and this product had 2 sizes of brush to go with it.  The problem I had was that every time I slightly rotated the brush, it fell out from the base.  During the 10 mins it took to style my hair, it fell off at least a dozen times.  Unfortunately I will not be able to keep this.  They need to design a &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; mechanism that keeps the brush in place until you want to release it.</li>
            <li> This styling brush does a great job on my fine hair.  Gives it bounce and shine.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It heats up fast and is easy to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the hot air styling brush for a long time.  Glad I found it.  I will order a spare to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this brush everyday. She says it works well and is very satisfied with it. I personally have never used it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the hot air brush and the price.</li>
            <li> It worked on the first try, but after that the brushes wouldn&#x27;t stay on the handle and fell off during use.  Cheaply made and it went into the trash!  I tried to give it no stars, but had to choose one.</li>
            <li> I also bought this as a replacement for an older model Conair that broke. The reviews are correct in that there isn&#x27;t enough power/heat to really dry your hair effectively. I was also disappointed that the barrel was much smaller than my old model. The barrel twists to lock, however if you turn the dryer in the opposite direction the barrel unlocks and falls off, as a result I am only able to dry one side properly. Also the on/off switch is located under your hand so you are inadvertently turning it off as you use it. I found it very frustrating to try and use, if the barrel wasn&#x27;t falling off the darn thing was turning off.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an identical one as I really like it. I did think the old brushes would work on this one as it is the same model no. but they don&#x27;t. One of the brushes on the new one will not lock in place which makes it a little unhandy but I am still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a small curling brush that was 3 /4 inch and metal so that it would hold the heat. This one is plastic. it does not hold the heat nor does it work well. It does not curl on the larger 1 inch. I wish there was a way I could return this item.</li>
            <li> Bad wiring in the plug. Trying to find out how to return it. No paperwork was shipped with. Also brush keeps coming off if you try to use it.</li>
            <li> With long hair or short hair, I Love it works great, will use it every day until I need to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Conair hot air brush works satisfactorily but brush ends are sharp and scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give this a good or bad rating because my&lt;br /&gt;hair is short and I just couldn&#x27;t get it to give volume to my hair all&lt;br /&gt;it did was cause static electricity  to my hair because of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave up. It may work well for others just not for me with short hair.</li>
            <li> This curling brush provides the option of two sizes of brushes.  The 3/4&amp;#34; is the one I use and find it to be the right size of curl.  It simplifies getting ready as it dries and styles hair at the same time.  It is also a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have a shorter hair style and just finish drying with this and I have it styled perfectly.</li>
            <li> Finally, found this hot air brush again. It is good for travel for touching up. It is light and easy to use. Great for last minute touch ups. Does not burn your head.</li>
            <li> it is lightweight, easy to use from any angle. and come with two different size of brush,&lt;br /&gt;Whether you have long hair or a short cut, and the contoured handle makes it comfortable to grip ,you will like it!</li>
            <li> I love it, it dries &amp; curls in one step, it really works for me.  I have used one for years &amp; needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it Love it. I like this one a bit more than the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair BC40JBC Hot Brush, White, 0.75 Inch</li>
            <li> I am an African American with thick hair and this thing takes forever to dry my hair. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH HEAT.  Did not like at all thumbs down</li>
            <li> Very light,not too heart to burn my hair. It is just i want.good price.i am satisfied. I recommend to the person  are sensative to heat.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a similar styling brush.  When it stopped working I had a hard time locating another.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for touch up after blowing my hair dry.  It&#x60;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped.  Better for longer hair I think.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I recently had shoulder surgery, and was looking for something to use with my non-dominant hand. This is perfect. It is not too heavy for me to use, and creates soft curl. My stylist used it after cutting my hair and loved it, too. I also have a 3/4&amp;#34; curling iron for touch-ups, but find I need it less as my skill improves. I am facing six months of rehab and am glad to know I can meet that challenge and look stylish doing it.Something needs to distract me from the big black shoulder brace and sling. :)</li>
            <li> Have had numerous Conair products that I loved, but consider this one worthless. It is too low power and too cool of a temperature. I&#x27;d love  go back to my 10  year old hot air brush, but that would require me to grow out my hair because of the bigger size. Do not buy this unit!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer brush. It helps to style while drying.</li>
            <li> This curling brush styles your hair without burning your scalp. It also will restyle your hair without wetting it. I have had 2 of them over the past 20 years and love it.  It helps dry damp hair as well as style it.  Bought this last one for a friend and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair, makes hair look fuller with more volume, no need to set hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;Cord also swivels for easy use.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good way to style hair. It is easy and fast. Would like it to be a wee bit hotter, but then maybe it would burn my hair. I am happy with the way my hair turns out. The soft brush makes my hair smoother than the hard brush types.</li>
            <li> Looked at same and/or very similar model Wally World. Saved several bucks and she seems to be satisfied. If Mama&#x27;s happy everyone is happy.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful product. Packaging was nice, no problems with ease of use. Works great and no negative post here. Thank you Amazon for a great product gift for myself.</li>
            <li> head detaches too easily from body when I&#x27;m using it.. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> It is very good for my purpose &amp; I would recommend it to antone</li>
            <li> Better than any of the other similar products. Light weight, and easy to style with.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty klutz. I&#x27;m no good at curling irons or curlers. I&#x27;m no good at blow drying my hair with a round brush and blow dryer. I am a self-admitted beauty klutz. That being written I discovered I CAN style my bobbed hair reasonably well using the Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Styling Brush. In fact, my hair looks almost as good as what they do at the beauty salon and it sure costs less money to style your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint:  The styling brush makes a high pitched whiney sound when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this hairstyles. Have very fine hair. That doesn&#x27;t hold curls well. So with this I can get good volume. Works great. Shipped fast. Packaged well. Would definitely recommend it. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and works really well,especially if you can not handle a brush and a blow dryer at the same time</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair brush.  I do not use it to dry my hair, I use it for styling and it works wonderful.  Much easier that a curling iron and I don&#x27;t get burned.  It smoothes out my hair and makes having it curl under very easy.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Originally liked this styling brush a lot especially with the interchangeable brushes.  However after using it maybe twice a week for 6 months neither of the brushes will lock in securely and they fall off when I try to use it.  Would not recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I do like this styling brush.  I have short thin hair and this is what I use to style my hair.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently got this product  used it and tried it yesterday. This product is honestly a waste of money, for numerous of reasons first being that it does not curl nor style your hair like it says. It says it suppose to dry while styling your hair NOT TRUE... First off the bristles from the brush made the ends of my hair very rough not cool. The pieces from the brush came apart after 3-5 uses. And the sad part about is that I  followed the instructions for dry hair, I started from the root of my hair and wind my hair around the bristle once like it said and held it there for 25 seconds. It said 10 sec but I wanted a tighter curl.... And it did very poorly! it had a little curl but it was not at all stylish. And you can&#x27;t turn it to much bc the barrel will unlock and come off. Also thecompany doesn&#x27;t  say this but it makes a noise whme you do your hair, kind of similar to a blow dryer but much much much annoying. I literally couldn&#x27;t take it and gave up after and went back to my curling iron. Which was way much hotter and did the job! I don&#x27;t mean to sound negative but it&#x27;s a complete disappointment. The product is made really well, which can also be misleading. This product only works for ppl with really short hair cut.... Please take my advice this product is not that great... sorry Ladies but if u are still searching for a product that styles hair while drying or  want curls get one that has the barrels that swivels bc this product does not.</li>
            <li> Nice size for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I needed a travel size replacement for my Conair hot air brush. This thing doesn&#x27;t have any power. It&#x27;s useless so it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item ( in different sizes) for years. CNt beat then!</li>
            <li> Did not like the brush or other attachment.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this curler, I tried it right away, pluged it in--- and it did work for about 2 minutes... I did re-set it but it would not work. I had to return it and will get one in the store so I have it right away.</li>
            <li> good barrel sizes, works well, but on-off switch doesn&#x27;t work--won&#x27;t shut off.  i have to unplug it to shut it off.  minor nuisance but worth keeping it.</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t dry OR curl my hair, not enough &#x27;blow power&#x27;. Disasterous product, that&#x27;s why it was rerturned. Eileen</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through Amazon many times and am very happy with it.  I have purchased extras to keep on hand in fear of the product being discontinued by the manufacturer due to changing trends. This hot air styling brush is perfect for my fine hair; it&#x27;s the only one that styles my hair well.</li>
            <li> I love this air styling brush. I had an ancient one, maybe 25 years old, a Lady Kenmore (see how old it is? Even the title is politically incorrect!) which still works but is slowly losing parts and giving up the ghost. While the air in this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as my old one (I wish there were two settings), it still does the trick. I have short hair and use the thick brush for the top and the smaller one on the sides.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and as advertised</li>
            <li> so weak, it barely styles my hair. Of course, I opened it to try it, so now I am up the creek.</li>
            <li> Been wanting an Airbrush for months!  Had a house guest recently &amp; low &amp; behold here she was using a Conair 2-in-2-1 here in my home!  She raved....I tried it....went right to Amazon.com, bought it and in 3 days.....&#x27;twas here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has 2 roller sizes and I needed the smaller size.  The smaller roller, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t lock onto the holder.  I&#x27;ll have to return it.</li>
            <li> The brush attachments come unlocked and fall off very easily. The second time I used it, I was trying to get the brush attachment locked on, and the whole thing broke off, so now the brush attachments have nothing to attach to. Into the trash it went. I don&#x27;t have much strength in my hands, so I know it&#x27;s a matter of poor quality and not brawn.</li>
            <li> Lacks power to actually dry your hair quickly....lacks power to curl hair well.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles and the way the brush is fixed and does not rotate are nice features, and were the blower and the heater stronger this would be great- I shall have to get something better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat properly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> One of the brushes doesn&#x27;t lock in good, so when I use it the brush frequently slides off.</li>
            <li> This unit puts out so little air it is almost uselsess.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and, as a result, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair. If you have thick, coarse, natural hair, I WOULD NOT recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd brush.  Best price possible at Amazon :)  Love this brush.  Will be stocking up as these are very hard to find and work great!</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this hot air styling brush mainly because of the 3/4-inch brush. The price is low also.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in January and it works great. Its not for drying hair but its good for styling and its much better than a regular brush. Its like blow drying with a brush but not as much power. It softens hair well and really detangles</li>
            <li> Can never worry about leaving your curling iron on to cause a problem.  Hot air or cool air is mor gentle to your hair than a regular curling iron.  You can dry and curl at the same time, thus conserving time.</li>
