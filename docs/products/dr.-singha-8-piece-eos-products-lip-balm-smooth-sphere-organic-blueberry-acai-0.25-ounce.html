            <li>I love this lip gloss</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with any lip balm.</li>
            <li>This is the smoothest, easiest apply I have ever found, and they keep my lips moist and healthy for hours without a need to reapply.</li>
            <li>I love all of them.</li>

            <li>Awesome, would purchase again and would definitely recommend, and gift to people.</li>
            <li>I get a great lip product that is natural that is affordable for me.</li>
            <li>I love the product in general for the great quality.</li>
            <li>Love this great stuff keep lips soft and not dry great price came in 2 days I would buy this</li>
            <li>Love your lip up, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Despite what others are saying you can get it for $3 at any drugstores, while true, it costs me more to pay for gas to go to town to get some.</li>
            <li>Quick ship and satisfied</li>
            <li>Makes my lips smooth really smooth.</li>
            <li>the lid is screw on/screw off and &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to secure it when fully closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole family uses their own flavors now...</li>
            <li>Today I bought this one at Target for free because I had a gift card</li>
            <li>I had been struggling to get my lips  smooth and found eos.</li>
            <li>The dog liked the 2nd one even more..............</li>
            <li>Love the smell but for some reason doesn&#x27;t feel like it works as good as other lip balms.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to clean them very often</li>
            <li>The twist on and off feature in your hand just makes it super user friendly.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and safe.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>It never leaves my lip feeling like it needs more after it dissipates like most other chemical laden lip balms.</li>
            <li>and it smells good too like my other two</li>
            <li>Plan to buy many different flavors from this line!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find a different smell you like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EOS lip balms in general are decent sized, and are supposedly more &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; to apply.</li>
            <li>I really like it made my lips Soft and smooth</li>
            <li>EOS lip balm makes my lips super soft.</li>
            <li>The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>One quick swipe over both lips is enough.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these</li>
            <li>highly recommend buying</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies.</li>
            <li>This one so far is my favorite next to strawberry sorbet (I only have three as of now)</li>
            <li>On top of the fact, if you carry one of these in your pocket or purse the little round ball is extremely easy to find and recognize by feel alone rather than digging to the bottom amongst all the other &#x27;tossed in&#x27; items and attempting to find lip relief in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be pretty much a type and flavor for everyone, so if blueberry is not your thing, just type in Eos and find the one right for you.</li>
            <li>and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!</li>
            <li>So far I have the tangerine, honeydew, blueberry acai and tomorrow</li>
            <li>I also like that it is certified organic; I am conscious about what I put on and in my body so this allows me to have no worries about what chemicals I&#x27;m consuming when I wear this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they get dirty very easy!</li>
            <li>Smell is subtle and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought the blueberry acai in December at my local walgreens, and I was excited because it was so hard to find.</li>

            <li> I bought the blueberry acai in December at my local walgreens, and I was excited because it was so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It felt a little smaller than the EOS I would normally buy in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell at first, but because I have terrible migraines</li>
            <li> have found that though this lip balm is difficult to carry in a front pants pocket, it fits well in a sweatshirt pocket, or is easy to find in my purse.</li>
            <li> I use this all day long.</li>
            <li> so they dont feel dry.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 star is because it was smaller than the usual EOS.</li>
            <li> Shortly after purchasing my first one, I became obsessed and had to have more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays closed</li>
            <li> I have got 4 other ones and all of my kids  </li>
            <li> Will never use those other chap sticks again...</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t buy any other lip balm I hope this helps thank you</li>
            <li> Subtle as if it were a vanilla fragrance, but obviously blueberry flavored.</li>
            <li> It is not super sticky and if your digging in your bag you can always find it because it&#x27;s shaped like a ball.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few!</li>
            <li> I am now completely addicted.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to eos lip balm .</li>
            <li> little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the &amp;#34;spokes&amp;#34; in the base of the container-</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I know how all of these smell</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I absolutely hate the smell of this!</li>

            <li> taste just like candy. mmm</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick. It smells good. Subtle as if it were a vanilla fragrance, but obviously blueberry flavored. I have to reapply often, but it smells good so that&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> love it great taste and leaves lips moist</li>
            <li> Awesome flavor and leaves lip soft and smooth. Healthy for lipid and at a great price. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this great stuff keep lips soft and not dry great price came in 2 days I would buy this it is so wroth it I have got 4 other ones and all of my kids  one they all love them great deal</li>
            <li> I loved it, the smell, taste everything. Only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 star is because it was smaller than the usual EOS. It felt a little smaller than the EOS I would normally buy in Walgreens. Makes my lips smooth really smooth.</li>
            <li> I started buying these several months ago.  I am now completely addicted. I own lots of the flavors but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Despite what others are saying you can get it for $3 at any drugstores, while true, it costs me more to pay for gas to go to town to get some. This actually saves me time and money. I get a great lip product that is natural that is affordable for me. It never leaves my lip feeling like it needs more after it dissipates like most other chemical laden lip balms. You can truly tell the difference. Love your lip up, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, taste, and the way eos makes my lips feel. I would definitely order from this buyer again.</li>
            <li> I love EOS lip balms!!!! I love that they&#x27;re organic and they smell and taste great. So far I have the tangerine, honeydew, blueberry acai and tomorrow I&#x27;ll buy the pomegranate raspberry. I hope to collect all of them. I bought the blueberry acai in December at my local walgreens, and I was excited because it was so hard to find. Let me just say that I absolutely hate the smell of this! I was disappointed because I know how all of these smell but this smells like.... A blueberry pop tart! I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t want my lips smelling like that. I loved the smell at first, but because I have terrible migraines the smell triggers off my headaches so I gave it to my mom and she loves it. But it&#x27;s still a great lip balm.</li>
            <li> I purchased the blueberry acai lip balm, however I didn&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved the honeysuckle honeydew flavor. And it arrived late.&lt;br /&gt;I love these products but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so we had to get another one as my daughter cried. This is her favorite flavor too.........The dog liked the 2nd one even more..............</li>
            <li> I discovered EOS lip balms in a beauty store years ago. Shortly after purchasing my first one, I became obsessed and had to have more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EOS lip balms in general are decent sized, and are supposedly more &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; to apply. I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies. The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours. I also like that it is certified organic; I am conscious about what I put on and in my body so this allows me to have no worries about what chemicals I&#x27;m consuming when I wear this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that though this lip balm is difficult to carry in a front pants pocket, it fits well in a sweatshirt pocket, or is easy to find in my purse. It stays closed well- the lid is screw on/screw off and &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; to secure it when fully closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of all things blueberry scented and flavored, and this lip balm is no exception.  It smells just like blueberries, with a hint of tartness from the aca&amp;iacute;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the &amp;#34;spokes&amp;#34; in the base of the container- and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!</li>
            <li> Will never use those other chap sticks again... All those chemicals... This stuff is great and works... My whole family uses their own flavors now... Quick ship and satisfied</li>
            <li> Just like all their flavors I like this one, too. I love the product in general for the great quality.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm, looooove it</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. It arrived fast and safe. It was in a cardboard and plastic display box, like the ones in stores. So it does not come like the one in the photo.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm; perfect for Men or Women. Keeps lips moisturized and hydrated. Gluten free and perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Love these lip balms! Smells great but they get dirty very easy! Just make sure to clean them very often</li>
            <li> Today I bought this one at Target for free because I had a gift card and it was pretty cheap. The smell smelt like a fruit snack that had expired months ago. My lips feel dryer. It&#x27;s that kind of lip balm where you have to keep smoothing your lips out so they dont feel dry. It&#x27;s kind of like they force you to keep applying it so your lips wont be chapped. I bought this because I liked the design and I saw a lot of people have used these. I gave it a try and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss it keeps my lips from bring chap I use this all day long.</li>
            <li> okay I ordered the EOS lip balm on February the 28th received it on March the 10th been using it for a while I really like it made my lips Soft and smooth and I probably won&#x27;t buy any other lip balm I hope this helps thank you</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. One quick swipe over both lips is enough. Anymore and it&#x27;s too waxy. But i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with any lip balm. Plan to buy many different flavors from this line! Oh yes!</li>
            <li> Would def but these again!</li>
            <li> Before I used an EOS lip balm I did not understand the concept or the popularity. I can almost guarantee, once you try this brand you will not go back to a &#x27;sticky&#x27; stick ever again. This is the smoothest, easiest apply I have ever found, and they keep my lips moist and healthy for hours without a need to reapply. The twist on and off feature in your hand just makes it super user friendly. On top of the fact, if you carry one of these in your pocket or purse the little round ball is extremely easy to find and recognize by feel alone rather than digging to the bottom amongst all the other &#x27;tossed in&#x27; items and attempting to find lip relief in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be pretty much a type and flavor for everyone, so if blueberry is not your thing, just type in Eos and find the one right for you.</li>
            <li> OMG I love love love this lip balm! I bought this from my CVS. I&#x27;ve used to have another one but I gave it to my sister. I love all of them. They moisturize so well. This smells just like blueberry muffins but if you don&#x27;t like that kind of smell I&#x27;m sure you can find a different smell you like. Bottom line this is a great product. It is not super sticky and if your digging in your bag you can always find it because it&#x27;s shaped like a ball. This is great do recommend and you can find it anyware. GREAT BREAT GREATðŸ’™</li>
            <li> Awesome. I highly recommend these</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Smell is subtle and goes on smooth. I would buy again.  Just wish you could find in stores.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to eos lip balm . I had been struggling to get my lips  smooth and found eos. highly recommend buying</li>
            <li> EOS lip balm makes my lips super soft. Awesome, would purchase again and would definitely recommend, and gift to people.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but for some reason doesn&#x27;t feel like it works as good as other lip balms.</li>
            <li> My all time fav! I have quite a few!</li>
            <li> This one so far is my favorite next to strawberry sorbet (I only have three as of now) but it goes on very smoothly and it smells good too like my other two but these lip balms tend to smell like plastic after a second sniff.</li>
            <li> Came in good condition &amp; works good</li>
