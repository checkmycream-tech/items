            <li>I think if I did buy the full sz bottle I would be quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>Smells good and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>so it makes it really nice to be able to purchase a trial size mini-for sample...</li>
            <li>The kind that after it has been on you for a while smells even better.</li>
            <li>Or, better yet, smell it in a department store before buying.</li>
            <li>love the smell...very sexy..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It came packaged safely, it&#x27;s glass</li>
            <li>It also came with another sample that I fell in love with.</li>
            <li>i received many compliments that day by both men and women.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to try out the scent without spending much.</li>
            <li>The scent really is lovely.</li>
            <li>Love, Love Love this scent and this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived on time, love the smell of this perfume it smells so sophisticated/sexy.</li>
            <li>The size was the kind you get free at perfume counter.</li>
            <li>The shipping was more than the product.</li>
            <li>So I need to do better at using it.</li>
            <li>I admit it smells better after it settles for a while.</li>
            <li>Love itt</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments .  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more of a vanilla gal.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Am glad to have this for fall/winter scent wardrobe.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great price for a sample of this particular perfume.</li>
            <li>sample size is a great way to see if purchasing a full bottle is worth it</li>
            <li>Good for the price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I cannot describe enough how exquisite and rich this fragrance is...</li>
            <li>A very full fragrance.</li>
            <li>i did not get the overbearing smell this time and felt more comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>Received order very quickly and was just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Cologne is a bit too strong for me, but it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Tom Ford did an excellent job on Black Orchid.  </li>
            <li>Black Orchid, Oud Wood and Tobacco Vanille are some of the best Parfums on the market!</li>
            <li>Heads up, This is a free sample vile.</li>
            <li>This scent is amazing and you really don&#x27;t need a lot...</li>
            <li>it was very powerful and a bit feminine.</li>
            <li>At first I said no way would I spend more than 65 bucks on perfume, but this one is tempting.</li>
            <li>I can admire the structure, but to me it smells exactly like a healthy, well-maintained compost heap.  </li>
            <li>Get this for your special nights out.</li>
            <li>It has taken on a very sensual persona and my go-to scent for that special time with my love one.</li>
            <li>Will purchase this again but full size bottle.</li>
            <li>I think that even though I had to pay for it, it&#x27;s better than buying a whole bottle and not liking it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>It starts off smelling a bit musky but dries into the skin and becomes a sweet floral scent.</li>
            <li>Went ahead and ordered a full bottle after wearing this sample twice.</li>
            <li>It was a stocking stuffer for my 19 yr old son.. smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This fragrance in my opinion is the second best scent he has put out next to the Noir.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent which has become pivotal part of my overall essence.</li>
            <li>A high price for a &amp;#34;Free Sample&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, however, on me, it does begin to smell like a more masculine scent as it wears down.</li>
            <li>I was hesistant to try this product out, so I had to purchase this vial first before spending the $200 for the full bottle at Nieman&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>mostly women but the  few men who liked it begged to know what i was wearing.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s more masculine</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and bright at the same time.</li>
            <li>, married.</li>
            <li>It is elegant and different.</li>
            <li>This was plainly marked as not for sale a free sample.</li>
            <li>Haha!  </li>
            <li>Love tom ford fragrance, can&#x27;t afford the big size, this tester vial gives a chance to smell</li>
            <li>I adore perfume and own literally hundreds of bottles, so my taste ranges pretty widely, but this is one that I would never wear.</li>
            <li>Love the scent but an hour later it was gone.  </li>
            <li>This was still a good way to try it out a few times while I made up my mind.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t imagine how happy I am with this small bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very full, deep bodied, and sensual esp during drydown.</li>
            <li>The first spray I think is very over powering.  </li>
            <li>I cant wait until my large one arrives.</li>
            <li>Private Blend Worthy!  </li>
            <li>I think it is a perfume that is very sensual and intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I you really want to try it save you money and go to store</li>
            <li>Very feminine yet rocky.</li>
            <li>Gooooooood Very goooooood</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>After a couple of hours, that is the smell that I REALLY like.  </li>
            <li>its ok, about what i expected.</li>
            <li>Just one spritz on the neck and you are ready for anything.  </li>
            <li>after wearing it a few times i have grown to love this juice and was even willing to spend $130 on a bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased a full bottle at one of the big box stores and it was very costly.  </li>
            <li>and the staying power is very long, I actually find myself awakened in the morning sniffing my own arm, thinking WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>and I spritz a tiny bit of that along with Black Orchid, and it intensifies the fragrance so deeply (in a yummy,tantalizing/drooling way) that both men and women are following me around sniffing me to the point where I think they may take a bite LOL!</li>
            <li>I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AGAIN FOR MORE OF THE SAME THINGS</li>
            <li>Very small and pricey, but does the job, and I did not want to spend too much on a fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li>but my clients and everyday people love it on me.</li>
            <li>I usually go for Fresh smelling Clean Citrus notes but, when I smelled this I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this in the future as a set, such as a shower gel, face balm and/or lotion if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>The scent is carnal and very adult.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the sample first.</li>
            <li>that being said it is not over masculine or feminine- somewhere in between...</li>
            <li>but, can guarantee, it will make you want to purchase the bigger size... which you can get for a whole lot cheaper on fragrance.net....</li>
            <li>It is not the same alcohol based cologne scents that all smell very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely unisex</li>
            <li>A little strong a first but wears away quickly and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li>Dries down to a sweet spicy note.  </li>
            <li>Will recommend this men&#x27;s cologne Tom Ford Black Orchid for that special guy in your life.</li>
            <li>but once the dry down started it was a very unique smell.</li>
            <li>At first it hits you hard with a strong wood tone, but eventually rolls in to a delicate sweet scent with a wood undertone.</li>
            <li>Okay, so there are so many rave reviews, and the big bottle of this is very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Sexy, spicy, and serious.</li>
            <li>A little sweet for a man.</li>
            <li>If trying it for the first time, be careful.</li>
            <li>The product came pretty fast even during the busy and usually slow holiday season.</li>
            <li>When I wear it,  I barely try to squeeze anything out at all.  </li>
            <li>I had to purchase this because where I live I would have to drive 1 hour away to find a big enough mall that has samples.</li>
            <li>love the smell and is subtle but lasting. will be ordering a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>This small amount is just right for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> I you really want to try it save you money and go to store</li>
            <li> Very feminine yet rocky.</li>
            <li> Gooooooood Very goooooood</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> After a couple of hours, that is the smell that I REALLY like.  </li>
            <li> its ok, about what i expected.</li>
            <li> Just one spritz on the neck and you are ready for anything.  </li>
            <li> after wearing it a few times i have grown to love this juice and was even willing to spend $130 on a bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased a full bottle at one of the big box stores and it was very costly.  </li>
            <li> and the staying power is very long, I actually find myself awakened in the morning sniffing my own arm, thinking WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> and I spritz a tiny bit of that along with Black Orchid, and it intensifies the fragrance so deeply (in a yummy,tantalizing/drooling way) that both men and women are following me around sniffing me to the point where I think they may take a bite LOL!</li>
            <li> I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AGAIN FOR MORE OF THE SAME THINGS</li>
            <li> Very small and pricey, but does the job, and I did not want to spend too much on a fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li> but my clients and everyday people love it on me.</li>
            <li> I usually go for Fresh smelling Clean Citrus notes but, when I smelled this I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this in the future as a set, such as a shower gel, face balm and/or lotion if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> The scent is carnal and very adult.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the sample first.</li>
            <li> that being said it is not over masculine or feminine- somewhere in between...</li>
            <li> but, can guarantee, it will make you want to purchase the bigger size... which you can get for a whole lot cheaper on fragrance.net....</li>
            <li> It is not the same alcohol based cologne scents that all smell very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely unisex</li>
            <li> A little strong a first but wears away quickly and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> Dries down to a sweet spicy note.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend this men&#x27;s cologne Tom Ford Black Orchid for that special guy in your life.</li>
            <li> but once the dry down started it was a very unique smell.</li>
            <li> At first it hits you hard with a strong wood tone, but eventually rolls in to a delicate sweet scent with a wood undertone.</li>
            <li> Okay, so there are so many rave reviews, and the big bottle of this is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sexy, spicy, and serious.</li>
            <li> A little sweet for a man.</li>
            <li> If trying it for the first time, be careful.</li>
            <li> The product came pretty fast even during the busy and usually slow holiday season.</li>
            <li> When I wear it,  I barely try to squeeze anything out at all.  </li>
            <li> I had to purchase this because where I live I would have to drive 1 hour away to find a big enough mall that has samples.</li>
            <li> love the smell and is subtle but lasting. will be ordering a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> This small amount is just right for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I still do like the notes, just not sure if I need a whole bottle yet.</li>
            <li> It smells a little \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to me.</li>
            <li> I love musky spicy scents , but this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I thought i was getting a bigger bottle for the amt of money I spent.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a larger size than I received.  </li>
            <li> I mean a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Tom Ford is a genius with his fragrances :) However, these fragrances are very expensive, when one does not know what they smell like..</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this scent but the full size is so expensive.</li>
            <li> i got a sample of tom ford black orchid a while back</li>
            <li> a little  goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Also, one other thing - this can be worn by both women and men.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this got to hot while shipping, but it smelled like it went bad or was old.</li>
            <li> I am also a fan of Vanille Apricot_which smells like upside down pineapple cake..</li>
            <li> I just received my  sample of Black Orchid by Tom Ford</li>
            <li> a rip off noon the less.</li>
            <li> so I should have used HALF of what I sprayed.</li>
            <li> Spray it on and the door opens with Chocolate, Black Orchids, Woods and Truffles.  </li>
            <li> I keep my little vile in a plastic baggie, inside my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> If only the regular size weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> when I first tried this i hated the smell instantly and so did my wife.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Very heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed too strong</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to make a perfume that lasts all day?  </li>
            <li> It smelled alright when put it on, not the layered, complex scent I&#x27;ve been reading about.</li>
            <li> however; very expensive for such a small sample size</li>
            <li> Very small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very small sample and pricey.</li>
            <li> But when I first sprayed it it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong in just trying the mini size sample....</li>
            <li> Obsessed....</li>
            <li> fragrance is too heavy and becomes sickening after a while.</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing............................</li>
            <li> it does have a chocolate base note to it that is devine.  </li>
            <li> I hate to run out of it</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud or it was exposed to heat or something. It smelled alright when put it on, not the layered, complex scent I&#x27;ve been reading about. After 30 minutes you can&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
            <li> Received order very quickly and was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> great parfum smell good</li>
            <li> Very heavy fragrance. I definitely recommend the sample first. Or, better yet, smell it in a department store before buying.</li>
            <li> Did not receive with a cap on sample. Was not the same smell I have been using. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Will purchase this again but full size bottle.</li>
            <li> love the smell...very sexy.. a little  goes a long way..however; very expensive for such a small sample size</li>
            <li> love the smell and is subtle but lasting. will be ordering a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this got to hot while shipping, but it smelled like it went bad or was old.</li>
            <li> The funniest thing about this purchase was I bought it for myself but found out it was for a women so I just gave it to my girl and she loved it</li>
            <li> Just heavenly! Love it.</li>
            <li> Sexy, spicy, and serious. Boyfriend loves!</li>
            <li> This is a good value....I would definately buy it again.  It is very handy to keep in a drawer or purse.</li>
            <li> I was hesistant to try this product out, so I had to purchase this vial first before spending the $200 for the full bottle at Nieman&#x27;s. This is a scent that needs time to develop, it takes you through a journey. At first it hits you hard with a strong wood tone, but eventually rolls in to a delicate sweet scent with a wood undertone. I would recommend this for an evening out, it will definitely turn heads. Also, one other thing - this can be worn by both women and men. I learned about this scent from my friend Adrian, because he was wearing it, and now I own it too!</li>
            <li> This one is nice too. A little sweet for a man.</li>
            <li> Tom Ford is a genius with his fragrances :) However, these fragrances are very expensive, when one does not know what they smell like.. so it makes it really nice to be able to purchase a trial size mini-for sample... Let me just say this.... I cannot describe enough how exquisite and rich this fragrance is... it&#x27;s tantalizing... the ingredients mixed together do give it a Unisex quality. that being said it is not over masculine or feminine- somewhere in between... it does have a chocolate base note to it that is devine.  I am also a fan of Vanille Apricot_which smells like upside down pineapple cake.. and I spritz a tiny bit of that along with Black Orchid, and it intensifies the fragrance so deeply (in a yummy,tantalizing/drooling way) that both men and women are following me around sniffing me to the point where I think they may take a bite LOL! and the staying power is very long, I actually find myself awakened in the morning sniffing my own arm, thinking WOW!!!  its is definitely a beautiful fragrance! cant go wrong in just trying the mini size sample.... but, can guarantee, it will make you want to purchase the bigger size... which you can get for a whole lot cheaper on fragrance.net.... I mean a whole lot cheaper. $40 to $50 bucks depending on size.  :)</li>
            <li> I just received my  sample of Black Orchid by Tom Ford and I love it. I think it is a perfume that is very sensual and intoxicating. The kind that after it has been on you for a while smells even better. I just ordered it in a larger size with the lotion so I could layer the scent. Who needs lingerie when u are wearing this!</li>
            <li> The product came pretty fast even during the busy and usually slow holiday season.I thought it was a great price for a sample of this particular perfume. It came packaged safely, it&#x27;s glass so packaging matters. It also came with another sample that I fell in love with. 5 star rating for a simple 5 star product and transaction.  I would recommend this seller&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells awful. I was not pleased with this. If you already love this scent, great. If trying it for the first time, be careful. It is very strong and smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell not to strong..</li>
            <li> smell great I hate to run out of it</li>
            <li> im a 30 y/o male, married. when I first tried this i hated the smell instantly and so did my wife. it was very powerful and a bit feminine. but once the dry down started it was a very unique smell. i decided to try it again while going to work. i am a salesman. i did not get the overbearing smell this time and felt more comfortable with it. i received many compliments that day by both men and women. mostly women but the  few men who liked it begged to know what i was wearing. after wearing it a few times i have grown to love this juice and was even willing to spend $130 on a bottle. my wife still does not like it but my clients and everyday people love it on me. Heads up, This is a free sample vile. I knew that when purchasing this. I had to purchase this because where I live I would have to drive 1 hour away to find a big enough mall that has samples. I think that even though I had to pay for it, it&#x27;s better than buying a whole bottle and not liking it. Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I purchased a full bottle at one of the big box stores and it was very costly.  This small amount is just right for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance lasts and is exotic and delightful.  It is elegant and different.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, however, on me, it does begin to smell like a more masculine scent as it wears down. I still do like the notes, just not sure if I need a whole bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this scent but the full size is so expensive. This is a great way to try out the scent without spending much. The scent really is lovely. It&#x27;s soft and bright at the same time. It is not the same alcohol based cologne scents that all smell very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this for a guy or a girl? YUP!!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance in my opinion is the second best scent he has put out next to the Noir.  I&#x27;d buy this in the future as a set, such as a shower gel, face balm and/or lotion if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smelt wonderful but it was over priced. I thought i was getting a bigger bottle for the amt of money I spent.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great way to try the product before purchasing.  I will be buying the full size bottle.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Good for the price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Very small bottle.  However the perfume was good.  I expected it to be a larger size than I received.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This was awesomely scented and came just as pictured and described. Love, Love Love this scent and this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this scent which has become pivotal part of my overall essence. It has taken on a very sensual persona and my go-to scent for that special time with my love one.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time, love the smell of this perfume it smells so sophisticated/sexy. sample size is a great way to see if purchasing a full bottle is worth it</li>
            <li> The size was the kind you get free at perfume counter. I you really want to try it save you money and go to store</li>
            <li> Very small sample and pricey. I&#x27;m using for travel (one trip only). The shipping was more than the product.</li>
            <li> I can see why it&#x27;s considered among the sexiest perfumes. The scent is carnal and very adult. If only the regular size weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how happy I am with this small bottle! I felt in love with this perfume, it opens so beautiful at my skin. Very feminine yet rocky.</li>
            <li> I don t know if he will like it</li>
            <li> At first I said no way would I spend more than 65 bucks on perfume, but this one is tempting. I don&#x27;t smell this on me all day as I think I should, but that goes with any &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; with me. I think if I did buy the full sz bottle I would be quite happy with it. This was still a good way to try it out a few times while I made up my mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan.  However, my sister loved it so she was happy to take it.  Perfume is very much a personal thing.  This is not a scent for me.  It seemed too overpowering for my taste.</li>
            <li> This was plainly marked as not for sale a free sample. The perfume was great butwas a rip off noon the less.</li>
            <li> Gooooooood Very goooooood</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!! Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Smells good and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing and you really don&#x27;t need a lot...so if you cant afford the bottle.  Get this for your special nights out.</li>
            <li> Okay, so there are so many rave reviews, and the big bottle of this is very expensive.  The first spray I think is very over powering.  When I wear it,  I barely try to squeeze anything out at all.  After a couple of hours, that is the smell that I REALLY like.  So I need to do better at using it. It&#x27;s definitely a different smell.  However, NO ONE has told me that they like the smell at all.  Haha!  We&#x27;ll see.  I keep my little vile in a plastic baggie, inside my makeup bag.  It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> fragrance is too heavy and becomes sickening after a while. Also I feel I was ripped off for the size I got for $10.48/</li>
            <li> excellent scent kudos Tom Ford</li>
            <li> I admit it smells better after it settles for a while. But when I first sprayed it it smelled awful. It&#x27;s very strong so I should have used HALF of what I sprayed. It smells a little \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to me. I love musky spicy scents , but this was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Got these on time &amp; love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> Private Blend Worthy!  Tom Ford did an excellent job on Black Orchid.  Spray it on and the door opens with Chocolate, Black Orchids, Woods and Truffles.  Dries down to a sweet spicy note.  I have never smelled anything like it and believe me I&#x27;ve stocked up. I usually go for Fresh smelling Clean Citrus notes but, when I smelled this I was hooked.  Black Orchid, Oud Wood and Tobacco Vanille are some of the best Parfums on the market!</li>
            <li> Love tom ford fragrance, can&#x27;t afford the big size, this tester vial gives a chance to smell/wear this wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> THANK THANK YOU ITS WHAT I WANTED YOU HAVE VERY GOOD PRODUCTS I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AGAIN FOR MORE OF THE SAME THINGS</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes I have smelt in years. AAAAAAA+++++ the scent does not change on your skin.... Love itt</li>
            <li> A high price for a &amp;#34;Free Sample&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> It is very different than what I&#x27;m used to. A little strong a first but wears away quickly and doesn&#x27;t last long enough to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I cant wait until my large one arrives. It starts off smelling a bit musky but dries into the skin and becomes a sweet floral scent.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the perfume</li>
            <li> Very disappointed too strong</li>
            <li> Great way for testing the product. Will recommend this men&#x27;s cologne Tom Ford Black Orchid for that special guy in your life.</li>
            <li> Smells like men&#x27;s after shave.</li>
            <li> i got a sample of tom ford black orchid a while back and i loved it .  I got so many compliments .  but this stuff smells like a mans collogne ...</li>
            <li> its ok, about what i expected.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more! On time,and great packers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this musky smell.  I think it&#x27;s more masculine and I&#x27;m more of a vanilla gal.</li>
            <li> This vial is perfect for the purse.</li>
            <li> No&#x27;t like what I need but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I received my shipment way before it was do! The package was Tom Ford Orchid perfume. I love it! It smells fantastic and it lasts pretty much all day. I definitely will be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> Obsessed....like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled. Completely unisex</li>
            <li> Went ahead and ordered a full bottle after wearing this sample twice. It&#x27;s very full, deep bodied, and sensual esp during drydown. Am glad to have this for fall/winter scent wardrobe.</li>
            <li> nice, but it&#x27;s to heavy for me. Reminds me &#x27;&amp;#34;Opium&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very small and pricey, but does the job, and I did not want to spend too much on a fragrance that I didn&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li> It was a stocking stuffer for my 19 yr old son.. smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Package smelled like cigarette smoke</li>
            <li> This has become a very popular perfume for good reason, it smells better than anything else.  And some men like to wear it.  Just one spritz on the neck and you are ready for anything.  A very full fragrance.</li>
            <li> I adore perfume and own literally hundreds of bottles, so my taste ranges pretty widely, but this is one that I would never wear. I can admire the structure, but to me it smells exactly like a healthy, well-maintained compost heap.  Not something I would wear to dinner.</li>
            <li> Cologne is a bit too strong for me, but it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love the scent but an hour later it was gone.  What&#x27;s up with perfume these days?  You spend $100, and it&#x27;s gone 1 or 2 hours later!!  I can&#x27;t afford to spend this.  Why is it so hard to make a perfume that lasts all day?  Yes, I know it has a lot to do with chemistry, but I have tried literally 2 dozen perfume samples in the last 6 months and found ONE that lasts all day. ONE!!!!!  And I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent.  Very disappointing............................</li>
