            <li>It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Fierce has a great scent to it, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: great scent, just seems too overdone by A&amp;F nowadays...</li>

            <li>Although \\&quot;Beauty Ted\\&quot; said the fragrange was authentic</li>
            <li>my guess is it&#x27;s not a fake one, give good impression</li>
            <li>Best to spray on clothes and let it sit and dry for a while.</li>
            <li>It smells great; sexy, fresh, intriguing, and free.</li>
            <li>The parfum is okay and with the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Ive bought this cologne a few times before and loved it!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and saved me the effort of having to travel to the brick and mortar store to pick it up.</li>
            <li>you will like it as much as i do, I will surely rebuy it from amazon and that&#x27;s pretty much it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so masculine and it reminds me of shopping when you walk by the Abercrombie store in the mall :)</li>
            <li>You can go to any mall in America with an A&amp;F store, and you&#x27;ll know right away which hallway</li>
            <li>exactly as described and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this from the Abercrombie store and the nice smell stays for a long time ...</li>
            <li>Hi there, first i would like to present myself like someone who likes to try new things and give good feedback.</li>
            <li>One of the most easily recognizable smells for people who have visited the mall in the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>The box was wrapped, unopen and unused, got here on time and was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Now, since he smells soooooo good, I follow him everywhere (and so do the other girls in town)!!!</li>
            <li>This cologne was fast delivered first of all.</li>
            <li>it is the real fierce and not fake.</li>
            <li>But still, i&#x27;ve been complimented by girls saying i was really smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance, this fragrance is a real man, for which one can go, which is ready to seek new adventures!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I live in Italy and I ordered this parfum directly in the USA.</li>
            <li>only thing, I have to put like 3-4 poff of it to really be \\&quot;surrounded\\&quot; by the perfum smell or the range that it will get won&#x27;t be that far.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND HAS NO REGRETS EITHER!  </li>
            <li>, due that it was my first time buying this cologne, and from the seller.</li>
            <li>Too me, it&#x27;s now reserved for the ultra stuck up prep mall crowd (which really, that&#x27;s the stereotype of all A&amp;F products, but they&#x27;ve really gone overboard with the Fierce scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE NO REGRETS...</li>
            <li>Girls go wild for the smell of it back then and still today.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a little confused about that, but overall amazing scent, and no problems with shipping.</li>

            <li> : On the skin, it gets out after a couple of hours, but on clothes it really stays for a long time (like for the party, the next morning i could still smell it a little bit on my t-shirt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> alot of people say the product they from here smells the same but doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>

            <li> the duration, well still I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s suppose to last, but that&#x27;s what I realize</li>
            <li> But some reason When i wore it the fragrance didnt seem to last that long on me.</li>
            <li> in this one bought from internet , the   smell is the same but doesn´t stays for long time as the other...</li>
            <li> However, it is the same scent that A&amp;F hoses down all their merchandise with.</li>
            <li> But i didnt purchase my previous colognes from the actual Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store.</li>
            <li> I wish it would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> When I went to say hello to one of my friend, she said : \\&quot;omg, are you weiring some a&amp;f?!\\&quot; in a split of a sec.</li>
            <li> (btw sorry for my bad spelling, i&#x27;m french :P)</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT A REAL STRONG SMELL;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s down by the lingering \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M HOPEFUL THAT MY HUSBAND WILL PUT ALL OF HIS OTHER COLOGNES AWAY!</li>
            <li> At first was afraid to get it</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is it came in a little box wrapped in thin bubble wrap, and the box did not say fragile.</li>
            <li> i bought this aftershave in california a few years ago while on holiday,im from scotland.and when iwear it</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to save a few bucks nextime i will just purchase from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> does that mean its watered down?</li>
            <li> A LITTLE ON THE SUBTLE SIDE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed with the smell though</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t wear the scent!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;d be too afraid to wear it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the same nauseating scent that hits you when you walk into any Aberchrombie &amp; Fitch retail outlet. To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening. The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant. And rest be assured, that is not the only thing it will be repelling.</li>
            <li> i bought this aftershave in california a few years ago while on holiday,im from scotland.and when iwear it everyone comments on it,guys and girls,if im in a bar or club,people always ask me what im wearing and how good it smells.i don t wear anything else now.thank goodness  A+F opened a store in the UK.its an aftershave u can wear anytime.love it</li>
            <li> I live in Italy and I ordered this parfum directly in the USA. It arrived in Italy after one month and it took another month to go through the customs at milano Linate!and the postman charged another 25 extra euro with the delivery...I will buy another one ONLY physically in the US. The parfum is okay and with the original packaging.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and worth the price. Quick shipping and saved me the effort of having to travel to the brick and mortar store to pick it up.</li>
            <li> Very best product. I received it at home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  I&#x27;ll make more products in Amazon. It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love love love this cologne. I bought it for my fiance, who has worn it for years but recently ran out. I was under the assumption that the only place to get this cologne was Abercrombie, but was stoked to find it on here! (And for cheaper!)</li>
            <li> alot of people say the product they from here smells the same but doesn&#x27;t last as long does that mean its watered down?</li>
            <li> Hi there, first i would like to present myself like someone who likes to try new things and give good feedback. When I bought this perfum, I had no idea what it was suppose to smells like (cause they don&#x27;t make any in canada). But I like to have some class and by seeing the good comments on the Fierce, well it made me want to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of friends and the third time I weir it was for a party. When I went to say hello to one of my friend, she said : \\&quot;omg, are you weiring some a&amp;f?!\\&quot; in a split of a sec. So I guess the smell is the good one haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the duration, well still I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s suppose to last, but that&#x27;s what I realize : On the skin, it gets out after a couple of hours, but on clothes it really stays for a long time (like for the party, the next morning i could still smell it a little bit on my t-shirt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing, I have to put like 3-4 poff of it to really be \\&quot;surrounded\\&quot; by the perfum smell or the range that it will get won&#x27;t be that far. But still, i&#x27;ve been complimented by girls saying i was really smelling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my guess is it&#x27;s not a fake one, give good impression, the delivery to canada was good too (no dmg or delay, no problems at all lol). Price sounds good too for the results it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will like it as much as i do, I will surely rebuy it from amazon and that&#x27;s pretty much it! (btw sorry for my bad spelling, i&#x27;m french :P)</li>
            <li> One of the most easily recognizable smells for people who have visited the mall in the last 20 years. It smells great; sexy, fresh, intriguing, and free. Highly recommended. Get the big one.</li>
            <li> Fierce has a great scent to it, no doubt about it. However, it is the same scent that A&amp;F hoses down all their merchandise with. You can go to any mall in America with an A&amp;F store, and you&#x27;ll know right away which hallway it&#x27;s down by the lingering \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; scent. I used to love this scent; all the compliments I heard people get from it. Now, I&#x27;d be too afraid to wear it.

            <li> Great cologne... found out it was &amp;#34;Fierce&amp;#34; here on Amazon after visiting the store.  The ladies seem to love it!  :)  As always a great experience at Amazon!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL MEN&#x27;S COLOGNE!  I BOUGHT THIS COLOGNE FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS AND I HAVE NO REGRETS...MY HUSBAND HAS NO REGRETS EITHER!  IT SMELLS FABULOUS!  IT&#x27;S NOT A REAL STRONG SMELL; A LITTLE ON THE SUBTLE SIDE. I&#x27;M HOPEFUL THAT MY HUSBAND WILL PUT ALL OF HIS OTHER COLOGNES AWAY!</li>
            <li> I bought this from the Abercrombie store and the nice smell stays for a long time ... in this one bought from internet , the   smell is the same but doesn´t stays for long time as the other...</li>
            <li> Fierce smells amazing. It seems to change and get better throughout the day. Best to spray on clothes and let it sit and dry for a while. I wish it would last a little longer. One of my favorites..</li>
            <li> Love this perfume on my husband. Good price and Fast Shipping!!! I Highly recommend this perfume for a perfect gift. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing....whenever my husband wears it he gets so many compliments....I have found out that many women like to wear it too....my daughter and her friends are always using his, so I had to buy him a back-up...but I have to agree with the girls when they say its a unisex product...smells great on men &amp; women...:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl, and yes I bought this, it&#x27;s supposedly unisex. It&#x27;s a very pleasant smell. I only use 1 spray a day, and it lasts for hours. I&#x27;m a little obsessed with the smell though, I&#x27;m always opening the bottle to smell it when I&#x27;m in my room. Smells like the Abercrombie store, that I never shop at, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t wear the scent! The only negative thing is it came in a little box wrapped in thin bubble wrap, and the box did not say fragile. The cologne came in the same box as if you bought it from the Abercrombie store, but the cap has some scratches on it, I&#x27;m a little confused about that, but overall amazing scent, and no problems with shipping.</li>
            <li> This cologne was fast delivered first of all. The smell of it last all day, people like will complement you. At first was afraid to get it, due that it was my first time buying this cologne, and from the seller. You will not be disappointed with this product and the seller. I recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mens cologne!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been caught spraying some on my pillow too! :-0&lt;br /&gt;Great Product Abercrombie!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased. The box was wrapped, unopen and unused, got here on time and was exactly what I was expecting. Also, the price here is significantly better than buying this at the A&amp;F store. I will be buying the cologne here from now on!</li>
            <li> it is the real fierce and not fake.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  Now, since he smells soooooo good, I follow him everywhere (and so do the other girls in town)!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance, this fragrance is a real man, for which one can go, which is ready to seek new adventures!</li>
            <li> I have loved this cologne since I was a teenager, and I still buy it for my husband, who also loves it. It&#x27;s so masculine and it reminds me of shopping when you walk by the Abercrombie store in the mall :)</li>
            <li> As titled states. Never seen girls react that well. In short, it&#x27;s worth it. Girls go wild for the smell of it back then and still today.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it was packaged nicely. But some reason When i wore it the fragrance didnt seem to last that long on me. Ive bought this cologne a few times before and loved it! The smell lingered and everything. And when i would tske my clothes off and put it in the hamper it would still smell like the cologne. But i didnt purchase my previous colognes from the actual Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store. Although \\&quot;Beauty Ted\\&quot; said the fragrange was authentic i hv second thoughts. I didnt return it cuz it still smells the same but just doesnt last long. Instead of trying to save a few bucks nextime i will just purchase from the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
