    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best *</li>
            <li>This product is great for couples looking to spice things up!</li>
            <li>My husband and I got this after we read all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>If you are into toys and like to spice up things from time to time this is a great addition to the toy box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for couples and individuals.</li>
            <li>Great during intercourse, amazing to use during anal.  </li>
            <li>Good toy forsure if ur looking for couple play.</li>
            <li>It stay right where it feels best for her and</li>
            <li>works amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design fits perfectly for a woman&#x27;s body and works very well for both partners.</li>
            <li>It has a great battery life and is very easy to clean and store after being used.</li>
            <li>If I were a woman I&#x27;d fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is way better than any cockring.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t wait to give it a more thorough run through tonight.</li>
            <li>OMG Love IT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to get a lube that will not damage the device.</li>
            <li>I wasnt convinced it was any better than a dual bullet system.</li>
            <li>This is defintly intresting to use but enjoyable</li>
            <li>Both my girlfriend and I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so many</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s because I do just fine without it, thankyouverymuch.  :-)</li>
            <li>Multiple settings are very good.</li>
            <li>the remote lets her choose what feels best.</li>
            <li>Some lube used with this also helps it slide in, and allows the man to fit in better.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend this for any and everyone.</li>
            <li>In fact, I enjoy this as well.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves it and so do I. Can be used solo or for more pleasurable fun for the couple.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be an amazing new experience for my boyfriend and I. Turns out, we did just fine without it.</li>
            <li>NEW FAVORITE TOY!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money on this!</li>
            <li>The wireless remote is a great.</li>
            <li>It is kind of loud too.  </li>
            <li>Its fun.</li>
            <li>so i thought it would be fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it has a pretty cool charging system that leads you wondering &amp;</li>
            <li>also openly admits using it on her own</li>
            <li>Fun to use.</li>
            <li>Bought for the wife and she said it was and exciting option</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week, using it everyday to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34; and discovering just how to use it with my body that would give me the best possible result from the product.</li>
            <li>However, my wife doesn&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a pretty dang neat toy for the bedroom.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I know these things are highly personal... pardon the pun.  </li>
            <li>Maybe one of the earlier ones are better?  </li>
            <li>Also, the material attracts every kind of fuzz, hair, fluff, dust bunny imaginable</li>
            <li>Wireless remote is nice though.  </li>
            <li>but they did replace the first one</li>
            <li>More power than last model.</li>
            <li>Gross factor is huge.  </li>
            <li>an absolute must have.</li>
            <li>The thin part shaped in two.&lt;br /&gt;But was great for that week it worked</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>You have to practically be touching the remote to the we-vibe for it to work.</li>
            <li>it completely gets in the way and it seems like a battle to choose sides, right or left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No rubber smell like many other toys</li>
            <li>New positive feelings.</li>
            <li>and it does what was expected which is always nice to know what your getting and to actually get it!</li>
            <li>its revolutionary!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-its a pretty cool concept and definitely a change from the traditional cock</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time I reach for it, I get a giant smile from her.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Which would mean it does not work through clothing if you wanted a sexy night out to be even sexier ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;-100% waterproof which mean if you want to use it in the nontraditional way of &amp;#34;double penetration&amp;#34; that works out rather nicely.</li>
            <li>as i stated in the title i would recommend this product to people who do have lots of money on hand and want to try something new that may dissatisfy them.</li>
            <li>but I only paid attention to the positive ones.  </li>
            <li>It made no difference as far as either one of us climaxing.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is we wish it was a bit stronger, and that you could turn it straight off instead of cycling through the settings to turn it off.</li>
            <li>But if you dont, like many of us in this bad economy, I would recommend going a more tradition route like foreplay with a Hitachi (and attachments, my personal preference of sex toys)</li>
            <li>I think the major plus is the vibration is pretty strong and does the job for me, but it doesn&#x27;t bother him or cause him to &amp;#34; go soft&amp;#34;, which is usually the case with all of my other vibrators.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, we were pleased with it!</li>
            <li>But this little gadget just doesn&#x27;t do anything exciting for</li>
            <li>Having to shift it left or right definitely ruins the mood.</li>
            <li>The remote does not function very well especially when trying to sync it.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s worth the money but no magic wand.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I Recieved quicker than expected</li>
            <li> Motor is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> All of my animals were a little worried that it was a strange torture device that would harm them.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth $100, but that is my opinion.</li>
            <li> Usually they don&#x27;t even notice my other vibes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anal, for couples for buy this product (small end inserted in the anus)&lt;br /&gt;-convenient USB charger</li>

            <li> It was useless and totally in the way.</li>
            <li> so it is impossible to use directly out of the drawer.  </li>
            <li> Have to work hard.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical it&#x27;s definitely thin enough to be a couples toy!&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using it on date night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-its a bit expensive compared to other sex toys</li>
            <li> Truly a game changer.  </li>
            <li> but the bulkiness of it made it uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-it has an awful rubbery smell that just wont seem to wash off&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Truly a game changer.  Great during intercourse, amazing to use during anal.  I am going to tell all my friends this is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a pretty dang neat toy for the bedroom. If I were a woman I&#x27;d fall in love with it. However, my wife doesn&#x27;t use it very much. Maybe I need to use it on her while in public, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s a thought&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It broke with in a week! The thin part shaped in two.&lt;br /&gt;But was great for that week it worked</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend.  OMG!  She loves it.  Best *** ever.  In fact, I enjoy this as well.  Would strongly recommend this for any and everyone.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded by mine and my wife&#x27;s expectations. It has a great battery life and is very easy to clean and store after being used.</li>
            <li> Thought we would like even more but not too bad....</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Descent quality.&lt;br /&gt;- Remote control.-&lt;br /&gt;- Can charge it from USB.&lt;br /&gt;- No rubber smell like many other toys have.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes lack instant OFF button.</li>
            <li> This is way better than any cockring. It stay right where it feels best for her and the remote lets her choose what feels best. She was having aftershocks for a couple hours after our maiden voyage with it. We can&#x27;t wait to give it a more thorough run through tonight.</li>
            <li> Its fun. I suppose it&#x27;s worth the money but no magic wand. Good toy forsure if ur looking for couple play.</li>
            <li> OMG Love IT Thank You and I Recieved quicker than expected and it does what was expected which is always nice to know what your getting and to actually get it! Thanks again. I will tell those that ask such a personal question.</li>
            <li> I bought this vibrator after seeing some images of a girl using it on herself (solo) so i thought it would be fun. I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week, using it everyday to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34; and discovering just how to use it with my body that would give me the best possible result from the product. For me the cons outweigh the pros i assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-it has a pretty cool charging system that leads you wondering &amp;#34;how can this even work? its revolutionary!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-its a pretty cool concept and definitely a change from the traditional cock rings.&lt;br /&gt;-100% waterproof which mean if you want to use it in the nontraditional way of &amp;#34;double penetration&amp;#34; that works out rather nicely. I would recommend anal, for couples for buy this product (small end inserted in the anus)&lt;br /&gt;-convenient USB charger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-it has an awful rubbery smell that just wont seem to wash off&lt;br /&gt;-if trying to stick another penis like object in yourself vaginally (or if it were a penis for you couples out there) it completely gets in the way and it seems like a battle to choose sides, right or left.&lt;br /&gt;-difficult insertion of a penis or penis like object in which ever hole you choose insertion.&lt;br /&gt;-the remote is tricky and does not work at a short distance. You have to practically be touching the remote to the we-vibe for it to work. Which would mean it does not work through clothing if you wanted a sexy night out to be even sexier ;)&lt;br /&gt;-it needs to charge for SIXTEEN hours. 16 hours! is a long long wait.&lt;br /&gt;-its a bit expensive compared to other sex toys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as i stated in the title i would recommend this product to people who do have lots of money on hand and want to try something new that may dissatisfy them. But if you dont, like many of us in this bad economy, I would recommend going a more tradition route like foreplay with a Hitachi (and attachments, my personal preference of sex toys)</li>
            <li> My husband and I got this after we read all the great reviews. Needless to say, we were pleased with it! I think the major plus is the vibration is pretty strong and does the job for me, but it doesn&#x27;t bother him or cause him to &amp;#34; go soft&amp;#34;, which is usually the case with all of my other vibrators. We like the fact that it is not too big, doesn&#x27;t get in the way of anything, and its quiet. It&#x27;s design fits perfectly for a woman&#x27;s body and works very well for both partners. Definitely worth the money on this!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I know these things are highly personal... pardon the pun.  But this little gadget just doesn&#x27;t do anything exciting for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s because I do just fine without it, thankyouverymuch.  :-)</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an amazing new experience for my boyfriend and I. Turns out, we did just fine without it. It made no difference as far as either one of us climaxing.  It did NOT stay in place. Having to shift it left or right definitely ruins the mood. I&#x27;m disappointed. Maybe one of the earlier ones are better?  Or maybe the 4?</li>
            <li> The wireless remote is a great. The sensation is out of this world. If you are into toys and like to spice up things from time to time this is a great addition to the toy box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to get a lube that will not damage the device. You&#x27;ll need it to get everything into the sandbox at the same time. :&#x3D;O</li>
            <li> After my friends raved about the We-Vibe I decided to try it out.  It is difficult to get the thing to actually turn on after being charged.  Also, the material attracts every kind of fuzz, hair, fluff, dust bunny imaginable so it is impossible to use directly out of the drawer.  Gross factor is huge.  It must be washed before and after use.  Not enough pressure on the clitorus and I wasnt convinced it was any better than a dual bullet system. It is kind of loud too.  All of my animals were a little worried that it was a strange torture device that would harm them.  Usually they don&#x27;t even notice my other vibes.  Definitely not worth $100, but that is my opinion. Wireless remote is nice though.  I gave it 4 stars because it seems well made, but just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I read reviews saying not to buy this product but I only paid attention to the positive ones.  Should never have ordered.  It was useless and totally in the way.</li>
            <li> This is defintly intresting to use but enjoyable</li>
            <li> Motor is not strong enough. Multiple settings are very good. The remote does not function very well especially when trying to sync it.</li>
            <li> Both my girlfriend and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It kicked our sex life up so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I reach for it, I get a giant smile from her.&lt;br /&gt;She also openly admits using it on her own so it is a win-win for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Had 2 both worked for a lil while but they did replace the first one</li>
            <li> NEW FAVORITE TOY! works amazing. Simple to use. Fun to use. great for couples and individuals. More power than last model. Tops in my book.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and so do I. Can be used solo or for more pleasurable fun for the couple. We have recommended this to numerous friends</li>
            <li> My wife likes it! New positive feelings. One wish for improvements - to each part of the massager operated independently of the other. For example, one to vibrate, and the second will be been switched off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical it&#x27;s definitely thin enough to be a couples toy!&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using it on date night.</li>
            <li> Bought for the wife and she said it was and exciting option but the bulkiness of it made it uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> This product is great for couples looking to spice things up! It can even be used solo for either partner if they wish to use it that way. Some lube used with this also helps it slide in, and allows the man to fit in better. Only downside is we wish it was a bit stronger, and that you could turn it straight off instead of cycling through the settings to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Will take some getting used to but hopefully she&#x27;ll cum around</li>
            <li> Thought it would be stronger or faster.  Have to work hard.  Was disappointed after reading the reviews.  Would definitely not recommend</li>
            <li> A gift to a friend, well received...</li>
