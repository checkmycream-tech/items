            <li>Strong hold great smell easy to get into hair...</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the best yet.</li>
            <li>but so far this one gives me the best hold, and this is just thier medium formula where with others i needed a strong one!</li>
            <li>Steadfast is great for a light feel but the smell fades as soon as it&#x27;s put on.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell!</li>
            <li>Also very cheap compared to the competition.</li>
            <li>a nice strong water based pomade....feels nice and light going on, but will hold my hair all day...</li>
            <li>Cheap pomade with a trendy lable</li>
            <li>Smells nice though, like a light cologne of sort.</li>
            <li>but Sauvecito works better</li>
            <li>I love this pomade and buy it for my boyfriend all the time.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love the color and the design of the pomade.</li>
            <li>It feels really good and fresh in your hair.</li>
            <li>but yea overall this pomade is great!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommended this to all my friend and they seemed to love it as well.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels...</li>
            <li>I love the background of the pomade and the smell :)</li>
            <li>Better than most.</li>
            <li>Crisp clean smell that reminds you of the ocean and a great hold to go with it.</li>
            <li>strong hold better for the smell and tighter hold.</li>
            <li>fine hair probably OK hold but</li>
            <li>Like most water based pomades, it goes on easily and combs thru without pulling and shapes easily.  </li>
            <li>All in all, Steadfast is just ok.</li>
            <li>I have become quite the connoisseur of water based pomade products, and I must say that Steadfast is among my top 5 favorites.  </li>
            <li>and it washes out easily</li>
            <li>so it washes out easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Styles easily and washes out just as easy.</li>
            <li>thier site says they&#x27;re releasing strong hold version soon</li>
            <li>Has a fairly strong cologne scent that I&#x27;m not a fan of,  does contain Propylene Glycol in ingredients.</li>
            <li>The hold is very much like Layrite deluxe.</li>
            <li>I like this Steadfast way better than the other popular brands smells clean and looks great.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>light to the touch and applies easy.  </li>
            <li>keep it Steadfast</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, it reminds me of the cologne Kirra.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>;  Steadfast does have a &amp;#34;pleasing odor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>great product, clean fragrance, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li>Still like the Layrite original and Layrite</li>
            <li>You just need the right water to pomade ratio and it will hold super strong.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff, it&#x27;s okay,  </li>
            <li>Over all not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent that matches the transparent blue color in the tub.</li>
            <li>(you get a better hold this way) without feeling any tugging or loss of hair.&lt;br /&gt;After only having it for a day, I can easily say that this will be replacing my original go-to pomade Suavecito</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>Great pomade exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Holds the hair very well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>first I use some Brylcreem and then the Steadfast...great combo!</li>
            <li>it fades fast, hold is light.  </li>
            <li>Great hold, nice faint aroma.</li>
            <li>Its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP  STEADFAST!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only describe it as clean, bright, slightly masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It has a decent hold, somewhere between light and medium.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomend Steadfast pomade get this</li>
            <li>And yes it washes out very easy with just water) and my hair is super fizzy and dry after.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>Not only does it hold VERY well and lasts all day, but it also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Compared to other water-based pomades, it dries out the hair more and more product is required to achieve a steady hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to my favorite Suavecito.</li>
            <li>Steadfast for me is a true medium hold water based pomade that lasts through the day and isn&#x27;t too waxy or greasy as long as it isn&#x27;t over applied.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t lend much credence to companies getting the basic formula figured out, that part should be easy.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really does &amp;#34;tame the waves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really like the price on this Pomade</li>
            <li>The texture is pretty soft almost like hair gel.</li>
            <li>, I usually use Uppercut Deluxe and this was cheaper at the time and</li>
            <li>This is a decent pomade.</li>
            <li>It has a clean soapy scent to it which goes very well with the clear blue color.</li>
            <li>overall good pomade, it felt a little to watery for me, and took more than usual to hold.</li>
            <li>Good pomade but not great.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new go to pomade.</li>
            <li>Not ALL water based pomades are the same, but MOST of them are made with the same basic formula.  </li>
            <li>and so every other product he was using would result in his scalp becoming red.</li>
            <li>The only drawback that I see in this product, is that I wish it had a little more holding power.</li>
            <li>I try not to wear too much cologne and as a result, regularly forget to wear any at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my boyfriend because he had a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>Not as much hold as I&#x27;d like if it&#x27;s windy outside, but it still holds up for day to day stuff.</li>
            <li>so dry, I had to stop using it and invest in special shampoo that helps restore moisture to overley dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it held fine</li>
            <li>Layrite still stays as my daily but on lazy days I use the Steadfast.</li>
            <li>Hair stays firm, and when washed out hair is free of all product unlike other pomades.</li>
            <li>and I am a sucker for cool package design.  </li>

            <li> , I may apply  a little heavier next time to see what happens.</li>
            <li> But you have to use a ridiculous amount to actually get it last all day.</li>

            <li> but because its waterbased and it drys up like all other waterbased</li>
            <li> The main reason i&#x27;m not really enjoying this pomade is it dries my hair out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get down to brass tax with this pomade.</li>

            <li> Good stuff but what if a kid ingests it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Holds and smells great!</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome! i usually get it at a nearby barbershop but thought id get it online this time. iv used suavecito strong/firme hold and bonafide brands but so far this one gives me the best hold, and this is just thier medium formula where with others i needed a strong one! thier site says they&#x27;re releasing strong hold version soon so i cant wait to try that one out. this stuff really does &amp;#34;tame the waves&amp;#34;. keep it Steadfast</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping I&#x27;ve heard great reviews for this pomade can&#x27;t wait to try it thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but does not hold good.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that this stuff is awesome! The smell is fantastic, it reminds me of the cologne Kirra. It&#x27;s a noticeable scent but not overpowering. The application is great! I have pretty thick wavy hair and I can apply this stuff to my completely dry hair (you get a better hold this way) without feeling any tugging or loss of hair.&lt;br /&gt;After only having it for a day, I can easily say that this will be replacing my original go-to pomade Suavecito</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell! Goes in soft and nice,  the hold is great for my pomp! Highly reccomend Steadfast pomade get this</li>
            <li> Great hold, nice faint aroma. Not think. Definitely my new go to pomade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold for life. Not only does it hold VERY well and lasts all day, but it also smells amazing. I try not to wear too much cologne and as a result, regularly forget to wear any at all. But this stuff has that manly/ cologne smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering but smells great!</li>
            <li> Cheap pomade with a trendy lable</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend because he had a sensitive scalp and so every other product he was using would result in his scalp becoming red. Once he began to use this product the redness disappeared and I believe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s water based. He styles his hair perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to wash out with no residue.its a great product and I&#x27;d recommend it to all men!</li>
            <li> Steadfast for me is a true medium hold water based pomade that lasts through the day and isn&#x27;t too waxy or greasy as long as it isn&#x27;t over applied. Has a fairly strong cologne scent that I&#x27;m not a fan of,  does contain Propylene Glycol in ingredients. Overall a solid performing choice...</li>
            <li> As a Barber I see a lot of pomades. This by far is one of the best yet. Crisp clean smell that reminds you of the ocean and a great hold to go with it. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a decent pomade. it holds rather well and has a great scent. however, it left me EXTREMLEY dry. so dry, I had to stop using it and invest in special shampoo that helps restore moisture to overley dry hair. I have stopped using it for close to 5 weeks now and my hair is still awfuly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-good hold&lt;br /&gt;-decent shine&lt;br /&gt;-great scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-dries hair out&lt;br /&gt;-a little on the expensive side&lt;br /&gt;-makes hair look stringy (like hair gel)</li>
            <li> Great smell and great hold. Also very cheap compared to the competition. Win win!</li>
            <li> I added this onto an order on a whim during a pomade-purchasing spree.  It has a nice, light scent that matches the transparent blue color in the tub. Like most water based pomades, it goes on easily and combs thru without pulling and shapes easily.  It has a decent hold, somewhere between light and medium.  However, it performs very similarly to Axe pomade (yes, I had to try it!) at twice the price.  All in all, Steadfast is just ok.</li>
            <li> Great smell great hold but it does hold like a gel when it dries. Would recommend. Pomade is softer and easier to apply to hair than others, Also people that said it didnt hold, i dont agree. You just need the right water to pomade ratio and it will hold super strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get down to brass tax with this pomade. It has a clean soapy scent to it which goes very well with the clear blue color. The texture is pretty soft almost like hair gel. The hold is very much like Layrite deluxe. The main reason i&#x27;m not really enjoying this pomade is it dries my hair out pretty bad. I&#x27;ll wash it out (And yes it washes out very easy with just water) and my hair is super fizzy and dry after. I never got this with other water based pomades.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my favorite Suavecito. Over all not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare to other pomades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold and texture is like Layrite yellow&lt;br /&gt;Shine is like Suavecito</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff and it smells great too!:-)</li>
            <li> Compared to other water-based pomades, it dries out the hair more and more product is required to achieve a steady hold. Smells nice though, like a light cologne of sort.</li>
            <li> Smells great, holds all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little weak scent.. compare with layrite and suavecito</li>
            <li> I have become quite the connoisseur of water based pomade products, and I must say that Steadfast is among my top 5 favorites.  Not ALL water based pomades are the same, but MOST of them are made with the same basic formula.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t lend much credence to companies getting the basic formula figured out, that part should be easy.  After that, it&#x27;s the aroma that I value next.  As Everett from the movie &amp;#34;O Brother Where Art Thou&amp;#34; said, &amp;#34;I like the smell of my hair treatment. The pleasing odor&#x27;s half the point!&amp;#34;  Steadfast does have a &amp;#34;pleasing odor&amp;#34;.  I can only describe it as clean, bright, slightly masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Good pomade, is what is was promised to be.</li>
            <li> But you have to use a ridiculous amount to actually get it last all day. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t move around a lot during his job yet his hair would constantly fall in his face unless he took it to work with him.</li>
            <li> Great product. Availability is the only problem.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I like this Steadfast way better than the other popular brands smells clean and looks great.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, it&#x27;s okay,  but Sauvecito works better</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. Holds the hair very well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hold, great smell, easy to wash out! I love this pomade and buy it for my boyfriend all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The wife loves the scent. Smells like cologne. Don&#x27;t pay double for a name. The hold is great, washes out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great pomade exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I like this, I usually use Uppercut Deluxe and this was cheaper at the time and Uppercut was sold out... I like this a lot, has a nice scent.  Not overpowering at all.  Good hold and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Not as much hold as I&#x27;d like if it&#x27;s windy outside, but it still holds up for day to day stuff. Nice fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t to strong but smells very good and it last all day not greasy and it washes out easily</li>
            <li> This pomade surprise me... Strong hold great smell easy to get into hair...i got wavy curly hair and this pomade did its job and made my hair look awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time ive gotten this pomade i love it the smell is just so good i never get tired if it. I love the color and the design of the pomade. Its waterbased so it washes out easy. It doesnt not tug or pull your hair. It feels really good and fresh in your hair. It holds great has an ok shine but because its waterbased and it drys up like all other waterbased but yea overall this pomade is great!!! Its my top one in my waterbased pomade category!!! Get yours now!! Its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP  STEADFAST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; TAME THE WAVES</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off. Holds hair. I would recommended this to all my friend and they seemed to love it as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the price on this Pomade and I am a sucker for cool package design.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  Very pleasant smell, light to the touch and applies easy.  I have thick hair and it held fine and my hair still felt nice, I may apply  a little heavier next time to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Great product! Styles easily and washes out just as easy. Hair stays firm, and when washed out hair is free of all product unlike other pomades.</li>
            <li> The best product for sideparts. Very easy to style and it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and wish it was stronger...it fades fast, hold is light.  fine hair probably OK hold but thicker hair probably not.</li>
            <li> a nice strong water based pomade....feels nice and light going on, but will hold my hair all day...I love the way it feels...first I use some Brylcreem and then the Steadfast...great combo!</li>
            <li> overall good pomade, it felt a little to watery for me, and took more than usual to hold. but the scent was amazing.</li>
            <li> Good smell and good product...but I prefer non-water soluble.</li>
            <li> I love the background of the pomade and the smell :) it stays all day on my hair and the smell , girls love it :D</li>
            <li> great product, clean fragrance, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Steadfast Pomade is an all around great product. It applies very easy and as an awesome clean scent!  The only drawback that I see in this product, is that I wish it had a little more holding power.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Still like the Layrite original and Layrite strong hold better for the smell and tighter hold. Steadfast is great for a light feel but the smell fades as soon as it&#x27;s put on. Steadfast also doesn&#x27;t hold my slick back as tight to the head as the Layrite does but does comb easier. Layrite still stays as my daily but on lazy days I use the Steadfast.</li>
            <li> Good pomade but not great. Better than most. Go for it if you want the shine</li>
