            <li>Great products &amp; customer service</li>
            <li>Great addition to potpourri or relaxing bath salts or soak.</li>
            <li>I applied the oil to cotton balls in my dresser drawers and find that this has greatly improved the smell and my clothes smell pleasantly of Cedar oil now.</li>
            <li>I love cedar, the closets are the best for keeping those moths out and</li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>
            <li>They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  </li>
            <li>Good value and again, the smell is very nice, like being out in Yosemite.</li>
            <li>It may not be the fault of the seller, but this oil does not have a pleasant cedar smell.</li>
            <li>This oil smells wonderful (woodsy but not too strong) and works wonders for the hair.</li>
            <li>good product to have around the house</li>
            <li>I use this cedarwood oil in water to spray around the house... makes my house smell good - supposed to scare away the scorpions too.  </li>
            <li>Good for unwinding at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>THe quality was good and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Still good as a air freshener</li>
            <li>the cedar blocks, liners etc. are excellent for keeping fabric must free and</li>
            <li>Would be good on potpourri as well.</li>
            <li>The lemon grass is lighter but this is good for body oil and candles.</li>
            <li>I read online that it&#x27;s good for fleas.</li>
            <li>Product was as stated and had good fragrance potency.</li>
            <li>It has a good Cedar wood smell and is a good quality oil.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>for what it is it is good...</li>
            <li>smells good</li>
            <li>Good quality and price.</li>
            <li>Good first-aid oil.</li>
            <li>good company, good prices, good oils.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price, delightful smell.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and will purchase from Plant Therapy again.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell, would buy more.  </li>
            <li>Its potent!</li>
            <li>I am finally able to sleep again!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the more pleasant smelling cedar wood oils I have purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Calmed my son within 15 mins it was amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not the darker, musty smell (which is also nice) of Texas Cedarwood by Aura</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start using it to make my own bath salts as well.</li>
            <li>you want an affordable option for either of these &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Juniperus Virginiana,&amp;#34; I would go to Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>Nice size, nice price point.</li>
            <li>all their oils are great and thank you for providing such great oils!</li>
            <li>I liked this because it met my expectations, I think.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent that I add to my shampoo as it aids in hair growth.</li>
            <li>A NICE WOOD BURNING SMELL IN THE HOME.  </li>
            <li>I use the cedarwood oil(mixed with peppermint) to make my own flea control for our dog.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to smell the scent you smell on a warm summer day when the cedar chips are out in the garden.</li>
            <li>Smells great, we use it in tandem with lavender in a spray bottle with some distilled water in the nursery to calm the baby, seems to do a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>My rose oil is stronger.</li>
            <li>I use it to add a nice manly scent to my shaving soap.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cabin like smell we love to use in our diffuser during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I use it on wood to restore the freshness and so far it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>They offer wholesale costs, don&#x27;t require you to sign up for anything, and they are a great company with very transparent and honest practices.</li>
            <li>Great item to use when you are making soap for the first time and don&#x27;t know what fragrance to use.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and powerful and the price is great.</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling essential oil in history.</li>
            <li>Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li>definitely be buying this great value going forward!</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy oils, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this smell and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an excellent product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work in the closets against moths.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love PT!!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li>I even find the cedar is excellent to burn in my essential oil burner in order to have the feeling of a cleansed room.&lt;br /&gt;plant</li>
            <li>therapy is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this cedar scent in the house and use it often.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Its an interesting, woodsy smell..</li>
            <li>It smells so much better than moth balls.</li>
            <li>but I thought that maybe if I warmed it up and let the scent fill the room it would smell better.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order this oil again, and the shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li>It gives them an added demension! :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it to what I&#x27;d intended.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say its one of the better brands.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better of this company.</li>
            <li>Very calming and is a great product.</li>
            <li>Now I am purchasing more for my cedar chest.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it blends well with my oil blends.</li>
            <li>Cedarwood essential oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thought it would carry a more &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; aroma.</li>
            <li>Its more like a sawdust smell.</li>
            <li>My feet will enjoy it later, I presume, but for now my house will smell wonderful everytime I use it.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as I expected and it is excellent oil!</li>
            <li>Just put 4 drops in a spray bottle with 4 drops of Lavendar oil  fill with water,and you have a great natural flea treatment.</li>
            <li>II received my Cedar oil very quickly, and it was packed well.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t smell as strongly as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>This is probably fine for fragrance purposes.</li>
            <li>Remaining product itself seems fine.</li>
            <li>I use the fine mist about 1 per month in my closets to prevent moths.  </li>
            <li>You adjust how strong you want the smell or just a light scent.</li>
            <li>works great, smells great and much cheaper than other brands!</li>
            <li>He also is itch free.</li>
            <li>I am now looking into bags of cedar chips to put in draws and cabinets to keep them bug free also.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The great part about undiluted essential oils is that you can modify the smell.</li>
            <li>The cedarwood is a great essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I believe in essential oils and this brand is great.</li>
            <li>a try I know many like it to help calm</li>
            <li>I read where cedarwood oil mixed with lotion made a great product for your feet, claiming the scent would made you sleepy, so I bought some.  </li>
            <li>They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  </li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, only used the Cedarwood oil a couple times, but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I love plant therapy oils and will continue to purchase only plant therapy oils because I know they are good quality.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the cedarwood essential oil, which is one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li>This oil is very strong and has  an unusual scent that I did not like.</li>
            <li>Fresh and renewed!  </li>
            <li>I also like to inhale once a day to help me be more aware.</li>
            <li>This has that pure, bright smell like the cedar atlas (I think it&#x27;s Simplers brand) that I get at Whole Foods (for about 3x the price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gum based so it was sooooo sticky to clean up.</li>
            <li>Not quite a nice red cedar smell, more like a musty wood smell</li>
            <li>True to their scent and rich in fragrant oil.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is high quality and has been suitable for the purpose I intended.</li>
            <li>It does linger longer, but it smells too sweet and perfume-like, not rustic cedar wood smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks plant therapy :)</li>
            <li>It true is a life saver.</li>
            <li>The company brand overall is good though.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>I found a recipe online for treating a pregnant dog for fleas.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and earthy.</li>
            <li>I prefered the one from Russia as the oils from USA have particular slightly stingy smell, however it&#x27;s the best one in USA, as of now.</li>
            <li>The oil was well wrapped (no wasteful packaging) and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like this essential oil, it smells great on.</li>
            <li>I fall asleep quickly</li>
            <li>I have been struggling to get a good nights sleep for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for related therapeutic purposes, though.</li>
            <li>I was told it would help calm my son...</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product is as shown, the photo of the product is size accurate.</li>
            <li>It has a deep scent that is kind of haunting.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this particular scent is not all that strong.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both agree on this one (which doesn&#x27;t happen often with my essential oils) - this has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of being out in the woods - taking in the fresh air amongst the forest around me.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer does seem to take care in the purity of the product so for that its worth mentioning the authenticity.</li>
            <li>have not tried mixing it with other oils for a better fragrance, but there are better smelling cedarwood oils out there.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to have the scent of real cedar in a natural oil to clean and refresh my cedar chests and boxes.</li>
            <li>, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend it for its powerful potent aroma if you are into sawdust smells.</li>
            <li>But very, very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will go here first when I am looking for another oil.</li>
            <li>I love Plant therapy essential Oils.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like inhaling the fresh scent of real Cedarwood.</li>
            <li>I love it mixed with Patchouli</li>
            <li>I have been quite pleased by Plant Therpy&#x27;s essential oils</li>
            <li>I love essential oil</li>
            <li>and I found this one to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>this essential oil is used on my cedar blocks, sachets and more to refresh the cedar odor</li>
            <li>I have purchased several eo&#x27;s from Plant Therapy and always satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>While not the same fragrance as the American cedar wood blocks originally had, this one is pleasant and serves the same deodorizing purpose as the blocks originally had.</li>
            <li>I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  </li>
            <li>They usually bring in fleas every year, and it&#x27;s a battle to get rid of them because our yard is very sandy, but this summer was such a breeze, and my house always smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li>In a warm, humid environment, this product protects my items from mildew and other bacteria from growing almost everywhere.</li>
            <li>Add it to other essential oils to make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Kinda masculine and good for designing male products that are natural.</li>
            <li>They are really pure and mix well.</li>
            <li>The cedarwood is pure and fragrant .</li>
            <li>I have a question, they are ready to answer!!!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li>and it did not smell anything like real cedar.</li>
            <li>I threw it away that very day.</li>
            <li>This is much safer than toxic moth balls.</li>
            <li>The product was wrapped well and didn&#x27;t spill and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very homey smelling.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>If you have a very hyperactive child like I do .. BUY THIS NOW.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is fast too....</li>
            <li>Worked really well for my husband&#x27;s circulation and sleep issues.  </li>
            <li>and I seem to be in a much deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li>Diluting it with a teaspoon of carrier oil was just too much</li>
            <li>I will purchase again from Plant Therapy Essential oils, they seem very enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Our family uses this oil as a bug repellant for indoors and outdoors and it works pretty well so far!</li>
            <li>I have many other plant therapy oils</li>
            <li>I have a lot of wooden floors and furniture, after I clean them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use a different brand in the past, loved the authentic smell of cedar, but it didn&#x27;t linger as long as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually it has a slightly spicier smell, that I think I like better than the cedar atlas.</li>
            <li>Ok but not white or red cedar</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li>Also, if I happen to wake up I fall back to sleep rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for that (not able to test it accurately) but it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It falls half way between sweet in the forest smell and strait up over powering fresh cedar wood sawdust up your nose</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, I am also a very light sleeper.  </li>
            <li>We live in an area with tons of mosquitoes all day all night.</li>
            <li>Very masculine fragrance but its just not for me.</li>
            <li>Has a funny back smell.</li>
            <li>It has full fragrance and is just as I expected.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m going to pay this much for such a small quantity, I was expecting more smell.</li>
            <li>Pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Reminds my of my old home in the forest.</li>
            <li>(So far.. no problems) .</li>
            <li>NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE NOSES.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling if I ran it thru the dryer, it would completely dissipate.  </li>
            <li>I read about using Cedar Oil for improving the musty smell in an old dresser.  </li>
            <li>I have a 30 year old home with a wood paneled room and wanted the room to smell new again, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to achieve that with this.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected in the product.</li>
            <li>Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li>I think they need to fix the bottles they are using to something easier to see how much you have left and also closer to the size need for the amount they give you, Not 2 times bigger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Young Living or DoTerra Essential Oils, this is not what you want.</li>
            <li>This is &amp;#34;Cedrus Deodara.&amp;#34; Young Living&#x27;s Therapeutic Grade is &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica.&amp;#34; DoTerra (though I do not recommend this brand based on third party testing finding adulteration in their Peppermint oil) uses &amp;#34;Juniperus</li>
            <li>I do wish the scent would last longer on the soft surfaces I put it on, though.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I add a little lavender oil too, since it is a very aromatic combination.  </li>

            <li> I applied the oil to cotton balls in my dresser drawers and find that this has greatly improved the smell and my clothes smell pleasantly of Cedar oil now.</li>
            <li> I love cedar, the closets are the best for keeping those moths out and</li>
            <li> Nice!  </li>
            <li> They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  </li>
            <li> Good value and again, the smell is very nice, like being out in Yosemite.</li>
            <li> It may not be the fault of the seller, but this oil does not have a pleasant cedar smell.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful (woodsy but not too strong) and works wonders for the hair.</li>
            <li> good product to have around the house</li>
            <li> I use this cedarwood oil in water to spray around the house... makes my house smell good - supposed to scare away the scorpions too.  </li>
            <li> Good for unwinding at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> THe quality was good and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Still good as a air freshener</li>
            <li> the cedar blocks, liners etc. are excellent for keeping fabric must free and</li>
            <li> Would be good on potpourri as well.</li>
            <li> The lemon grass is lighter but this is good for body oil and candles.</li>
            <li> I read online that it&#x27;s good for fleas.</li>
            <li> Product was as stated and had good fragrance potency.</li>
            <li> It has a good Cedar wood smell and is a good quality oil.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> for what it is it is good...</li>
            <li> smells good</li>

            <li> Good first-aid oil.</li>
            <li> good company, good prices, good oils.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price, delightful smell.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and will purchase from Plant Therapy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, would buy more.  </li>
            <li> Its potent!</li>
            <li> I am finally able to sleep again!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the more pleasant smelling cedar wood oils I have purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Calmed my son within 15 mins it was amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not the darker, musty smell (which is also nice) of Texas Cedarwood by Aura</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using it to make my own bath salts as well.</li>
            <li> you want an affordable option for either of these &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Juniperus Virginiana,&amp;#34; I would go to Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> Nice size, nice price point.</li>
            <li> all their oils are great and thank you for providing such great oils!</li>
            <li> I liked this because it met my expectations, I think.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent that I add to my shampoo as it aids in hair growth.</li>
            <li> A NICE WOOD BURNING SMELL IN THE HOME.  </li>
            <li> I use the cedarwood oil(mixed with peppermint) to make my own flea control for our dog.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to smell the scent you smell on a warm summer day when the cedar chips are out in the garden.</li>
            <li> Smells great, we use it in tandem with lavender in a spray bottle with some distilled water in the nursery to calm the baby, seems to do a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> My rose oil is stronger.</li>
            <li> I use it to add a nice manly scent to my shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cabin like smell we love to use in our diffuser during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I use it on wood to restore the freshness and so far it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> They offer wholesale costs, don&#x27;t require you to sign up for anything, and they are a great company with very transparent and honest practices.</li>
            <li> Great item to use when you are making soap for the first time and don&#x27;t know what fragrance to use.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and powerful and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling essential oil in history.</li>
            <li> Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li> definitely be buying this great value going forward!</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy oils, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an excellent product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work in the closets against moths.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love PT!!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> I even find the cedar is excellent to burn in my essential oil burner in order to have the feeling of a cleansed room.&lt;br /&gt;plant</li>
            <li> therapy is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this cedar scent in the house and use it often.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Its an interesting, woodsy smell..</li>
            <li> It smells so much better than moth balls.</li>
            <li> but I thought that maybe if I warmed it up and let the scent fill the room it would smell better.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order this oil again, and the shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li> It gives them an added demension! :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it to what I&#x27;d intended.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say its one of the better brands.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better of this company.</li>
            <li> Very calming and is a great product.</li>
            <li> Now I am purchasing more for my cedar chest.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it blends well with my oil blends.</li>
            <li> Cedarwood essential oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Thought it would carry a more &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; aroma.</li>
            <li> Its more like a sawdust smell.</li>
            <li> My feet will enjoy it later, I presume, but for now my house will smell wonderful everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as I expected and it is excellent oil!</li>
            <li> Just put 4 drops in a spray bottle with 4 drops of Lavendar oil  fill with water,and you have a great natural flea treatment.</li>
            <li> II received my Cedar oil very quickly, and it was packed well.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell as strongly as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> This is probably fine for fragrance purposes.</li>
            <li> Remaining product itself seems fine.</li>
            <li> I use the fine mist about 1 per month in my closets to prevent moths.  </li>
            <li> You adjust how strong you want the smell or just a light scent.</li>
            <li> works great, smells great and much cheaper than other brands!</li>
            <li> He also is itch free.</li>
            <li> I am now looking into bags of cedar chips to put in draws and cabinets to keep them bug free also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The great part about undiluted essential oils is that you can modify the smell.</li>
            <li> The cedarwood is a great essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I believe in essential oils and this brand is great.</li>
            <li> a try I know many like it to help calm</li>
            <li> I read where cedarwood oil mixed with lotion made a great product for your feet, claiming the scent would made you sleepy, so I bought some.  </li>
            <li> They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  </li>
            <li> so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, only used the Cedarwood oil a couple times, but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I love plant therapy oils and will continue to purchase only plant therapy oils because I know they are good quality.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cedarwood essential oil, which is one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li> This oil is very strong and has  an unusual scent that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Fresh and renewed!  </li>
            <li> I also like to inhale once a day to help me be more aware.</li>
            <li> This has that pure, bright smell like the cedar atlas (I think it&#x27;s Simplers brand) that I get at Whole Foods (for about 3x the price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gum based so it was sooooo sticky to clean up.</li>
            <li> Not quite a nice red cedar smell, more like a musty wood smell</li>
            <li> True to their scent and rich in fragrant oil.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is high quality and has been suitable for the purpose I intended.</li>
            <li> It does linger longer, but it smells too sweet and perfume-like, not rustic cedar wood smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks plant therapy :)</li>
            <li> It true is a life saver.</li>
            <li> The company brand overall is good though.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.  </li>
            <li> I found a recipe online for treating a pregnant dog for fleas.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and earthy.</li>
            <li> I prefered the one from Russia as the oils from USA have particular slightly stingy smell, however it&#x27;s the best one in USA, as of now.</li>
            <li> The oil was well wrapped (no wasteful packaging) and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil, it smells great on.</li>
            <li> I fall asleep quickly</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to get a good nights sleep for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for related therapeutic purposes, though.</li>
            <li> I was told it would help calm my son...</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product is as shown, the photo of the product is size accurate.</li>
            <li> It has a deep scent that is kind of haunting.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this particular scent is not all that strong.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree on this one (which doesn&#x27;t happen often with my essential oils) - this has a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of being out in the woods - taking in the fresh air amongst the forest around me.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer does seem to take care in the purity of the product so for that its worth mentioning the authenticity.</li>
            <li> have not tried mixing it with other oils for a better fragrance, but there are better smelling cedarwood oils out there.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to have the scent of real cedar in a natural oil to clean and refresh my cedar chests and boxes.</li>
            <li> , butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend it for its powerful potent aroma if you are into sawdust smells.</li>
            <li> But very, very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will go here first when I am looking for another oil.</li>
            <li> I love Plant therapy essential Oils.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like inhaling the fresh scent of real Cedarwood.</li>
            <li> I love it mixed with Patchouli</li>
            <li> I have been quite pleased by Plant Therpy&#x27;s essential oils</li>
            <li> I love essential oil</li>
            <li> and I found this one to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> this essential oil is used on my cedar blocks, sachets and more to refresh the cedar odor</li>
            <li> I have purchased several eo&#x27;s from Plant Therapy and always satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> While not the same fragrance as the American cedar wood blocks originally had, this one is pleasant and serves the same deodorizing purpose as the blocks originally had.</li>
            <li> I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  </li>
            <li> They usually bring in fleas every year, and it&#x27;s a battle to get rid of them because our yard is very sandy, but this summer was such a breeze, and my house always smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li> In a warm, humid environment, this product protects my items from mildew and other bacteria from growing almost everywhere.</li>
            <li> Add it to other essential oils to make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Kinda masculine and good for designing male products that are natural.</li>
            <li> They are really pure and mix well.</li>
            <li> The cedarwood is pure and fragrant .</li>
            <li> I have a question, they are ready to answer!!!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li> and it did not smell anything like real cedar.</li>
            <li> I threw it away that very day.</li>
            <li> This is much safer than toxic moth balls.</li>
            <li> The product was wrapped well and didn&#x27;t spill and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very homey smelling.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> If you have a very hyperactive child like I do .. BUY THIS NOW.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping is fast too....</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my husband&#x27;s circulation and sleep issues.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to be in a much deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li> Diluting it with a teaspoon of carrier oil was just too much</li>
            <li> I will purchase again from Plant Therapy Essential oils, they seem very enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Our family uses this oil as a bug repellant for indoors and outdoors and it works pretty well so far!</li>
            <li> I have many other plant therapy oils</li>
            <li> I have a lot of wooden floors and furniture, after I clean them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a different brand in the past, loved the authentic smell of cedar, but it didn&#x27;t linger as long as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually it has a slightly spicier smell, that I think I like better than the cedar atlas.</li>
            <li> Ok but not white or red cedar</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> Also, if I happen to wake up I fall back to sleep rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for that (not able to test it accurately) but it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It falls half way between sweet in the forest smell and strait up over powering fresh cedar wood sawdust up your nose</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, I am also a very light sleeper.  </li>
            <li> We live in an area with tons of mosquitoes all day all night.</li>
            <li> Very masculine fragrance but its just not for me.</li>
            <li> Has a funny back smell.</li>
            <li> It has full fragrance and is just as I expected.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m going to pay this much for such a small quantity, I was expecting more smell.</li>
            <li> Pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Reminds my of my old home in the forest.</li>
            <li> (So far.. no problems) .</li>
            <li> NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE NOSES.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling if I ran it thru the dryer, it would completely dissipate.  </li>
            <li> I read about using Cedar Oil for improving the musty smell in an old dresser.  </li>
            <li> I have a 30 year old home with a wood paneled room and wanted the room to smell new again, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to achieve that with this.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected in the product.</li>
            <li> Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent.</li>
            <li> I think they need to fix the bottles they are using to something easier to see how much you have left and also closer to the size need for the amount they give you, Not 2 times bigger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Young Living or DoTerra Essential Oils, this is not what you want.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;Cedrus Deodara.&amp;#34; Young Living&#x27;s Therapeutic Grade is &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica.&amp;#34; DoTerra (though I do not recommend this brand based on third party testing finding adulteration in their Peppermint oil) uses &amp;#34;Juniperus</li>
            <li> I do wish the scent would last longer on the soft surfaces I put it on, though.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I add a little lavender oil too, since it is a very aromatic combination.  </li>
            <li> You cant see how much you have left in the bottle because of how dark the bottle is and the fact that the bottom is all glass, the oil doesn&#x27;t even go down that far.</li>
            <li> Some bug was biting me, so I mixed the pure cedar oil with coconut oil to use on my skin; no more bug bites.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this brand to see if it would last long.  </li>
            <li> This will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> However, scent doesn&#x27;t stay around for long and is a bit medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strange, but that is likely due to the level of concentration when smelling the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak and barely recognizable to have any aroma at all.&lt;br /&gt;Dissappoment.</li>
            <li> I also use it to wash clothes and other house hold chores like mopping and rainbow vacuum  </li>
            <li> Biggest problem I have had with this product is that the Jar is so dark and so much bigger than needed.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle...</li>
            <li> but after bathing my garage floor with this stuff I expected to not see any roaches.</li>
            <li> not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought for it wide amount of uses.</li>
            <li> I used essential oil to make my own bug repellent and it works.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the scent I expected</li>
            <li> Fast shipping especially since I live overseas on a military base.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with other oils and I must say the smell is divine.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Cedarwood and have never experience one like this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other uses people use cedarwood for</li>
            <li> Scent was just as expected and it serves the purpose I intended it for!</li>
            <li> The product leaked out of bottle and got all over other items and the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with other scents</li>
            <li> but it blends well with other scents.</li>
            <li> the bugs make it hard to sit outside in the evenings.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding locally</li>
            <li> I make my own flea repellent</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only vaguely &amp;#34;cedar-ish&amp;#34; and not as strong/potent as the other essential oils I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> but to me it smells a little like someone urinated in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying it out this summer by brushing a little of it on their coats.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this one for making homemade bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m being to harsh?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super overpower as some I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I take a small glass spray bottle (meant for perfume), and add 15 drops of cedarwood oil and fill it up with water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was supposed to smell like</li>
            <li> After going to a shop and smelling other Cedarwood oils, I realized that this is a poor product.</li>
            <li> It is about 100 years old, appeared dried out, and smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> Other Plant Therapy Essential Oils (Frankincense &amp; Patchouli) were bad also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely quit ordering from my other supplier which was very expensive &amp; the shipping was very expensive also...</li>
            <li> Air drying my clothes leaves them with a faint &amp;#34;is</li>
            <li> Worked well with two other oils for my homemade mosquito repellent.  </li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing and thought I could use it in my closets to help prevent moths.</li>
            <li> (Someone told me using cedarwood oil on pets was a non-toxic way to rid them of fleas and ticks, so I applied it to my cat which got her mad, but whatever was bothering her went away</li>
            <li> 10 drops in a cup of (unscented) detergent and my laundry comes out smelling very faintly of cedarwood.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil in a frustrated attempt to fix my eoach problem.</li>
            <li> &amp; I must say I was shocked by the price &amp; the quality....</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to report that it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I am not at all disappointed in the quality of this oil!</li>
            <li> To me, it has an Awful smell.</li>

            <li> This is not the cedar smell I think of when it comes to mind. After going to a shop and smelling other Cedarwood oils, I realized that this is a poor product. I wanted something to make me think of the the freshness of the outdoors and cabins. Instead this cedarwood smells like a musky damp wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried mixing it with other oils for a better fragrance, but there are better smelling cedarwood oils out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling essential oil in history. Fast shipping, great price, delightful smell.</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils. With the heat in Florida the bugs make it hard to sit outside in the evenings. Mixing Cedarwood and Citronella I together, makes a wonderful natural insect repellent. Also safe on my dogs.</li>
            <li> Awesome and Affordable</li>
            <li> This has that pure, bright smell like the cedar atlas (I think it&#x27;s Simplers brand) that I get at Whole Foods (for about 3x the price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the darker, musty smell (which is also nice) of Texas Cedarwood by Aura Cacia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually it has a slightly spicier smell, that I think I like better than the cedar atlas. But very, very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying this great value going forward! Thanks!</li>
            <li> i am making message oils and have been experimenting with different scents. this oil is of great quality and mixes well with any carrier oil. thank you.</li>
            <li> I used essential oil to make my own bug repellent and it works.  I also use it to wash clothes and other house hold chores like mopping and rainbow vacuum  it has multiple uses.  good product to have around the house</li>
            <li> great stuff!...awesome seller!</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy oils, and I have tried many.  True to their scent and rich in fragrant oil.  I will go here first when I am looking for another oil.</li>
            <li> I love Plant therapy essential Oils. I have never been disappointed. I bought this to use with other oils and I must say the smell is divine. it&#x27;s like inhaling the fresh scent of real Cedarwood. I have used other brands of Cedarwood and have never experience one like this one.</li>
            <li> second order on this,Love the smell, Ive been using it on our animals collars to help rid fleas.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, would buy more.  Reminds my of my old home in the forest.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this one for making homemade bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Great oil.  I use it on my wrists neat.  It has a deep scent that is kind of haunting.  I&#x27;m going to start using it to make my own bath salts as well.</li>
            <li> Pure and simple. Fast shipping especially since I live overseas on a military base.</li>
            <li> I use this cedarwood oil in water to spray around the house... makes my house smell good - supposed to scare away the scorpions too.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I take a small glass spray bottle (meant for perfume), and add 15 drops of cedarwood oil and fill it up with water.  I spray this mixture on my dogs and on my bedding and furniture.  Sometimes I add a little lavender oil too, since it is a very aromatic combination.  This is the only thing I have done this summer to prevent fleas and ticks on my dogs, and they haven&#x27;t been bitten once!  They usually bring in fleas every year, and it&#x27;s a battle to get rid of them because our yard is very sandy, but this summer was such a breeze, and my house always smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this smell and so does my husband.  Good for unwinding at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This was dr. recommended to me. I put it on the bottoms of my feet. It helps me sleep at night. Great product!</li>
            <li> I make my own flea repellent and this is a must have oil! works great, smells great and much cheaper than other brands!</li>
            <li> A dot of this on my forehead every night has replaced an OTC sleeping pill! I&#x27;m told it encourages the release of melatonin. All I know is, it works great!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.  Exactly what I expected in the product.</li>
            <li> Ok but not white or red cedar</li>
            <li> i used this product to &#x27;reconstitute&#x27; some hanging cedar strips/planks that i put in a closet during the summer, which had lost their scent.  so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I love it mixed with Patchouli</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was supposed to smell like but to me it smells a little like someone urinated in the bottle.  Like I said it could just be me but that&#x27;s what it smells like and I don&#x27;t even like to use it.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a good deal for the price. It smells just like it should and I&#x27;m pleased with the product. If you like cedarwood I recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome for keeping bugs away!!  It helps me keep fleas away!  The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.  Really Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other uses people use cedarwood for but I used it as a form of roach repelling.  I hate to report that it didn&#x27;t work.  After using it for several weeks we still see the occasional roach in the garage.  Perhaps I&#x27;m being to harsh?  I don&#x27;t know, but after bathing my garage floor with this stuff I expected to not see any roaches.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Helps me sleep when diffused with lavender and clary sage.</li>
            <li> I needed this oil for products I am making.  It came exactly as I expected and it is excellent oil!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Some bug was biting me, so I mixed the pure cedar oil with coconut oil to use on my skin; no more bug bites. Also rubbed some through Fife&#x27;s, my cat, fur just in case he had fleas. He also is itch free. Thank you for such an excellent product. I am now looking into bags of cedar chips to put in draws and cabinets to keep them bug free also.</li>
            <li> I have been quite pleased by Plant Therpy&#x27;s essential oils and this is no exception. I feel this is high quality and has been suitable for the purpose I intended. I shall be continuing to order from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT &amp; GREAT PRICE!!!  I mix together cedar, lemon, rosemary orange, pine needle oil, &amp; lavender &amp; it keeps bugs away!!! YEA!!!!</li>
            <li> I love essential oil and I found this one to be exactly what I wanted.  THe quality was good and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
            <li> This is probably fine for fragrance purposes. That is why it gets 3 starts, but keep reading if you are wanting this for therapeutic reasons like aromatherapy, topical, or internal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Young Living or DoTerra Essential Oils, this is not what you want. This is &amp;#34;Cedrus Deodara.&amp;#34; Young Living&#x27;s Therapeutic Grade is &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica.&amp;#34; DoTerra (though I do not recommend this brand based on third party testing finding adulteration in their Peppermint oil) uses &amp;#34;Juniperus virginiana.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an affordable option for either of these &amp;#34;Cedrus Atlantica&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Juniperus Virginiana,&amp;#34; I would go to Mountain Rose Herbs. They offer wholesale costs, don&#x27;t require you to sign up for anything, and they are a great company with very transparent and honest practices.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strange, but that is likely due to the level of concentration when smelling the bottle.  I do wish the scent would last longer on the soft surfaces I put it on, though.  I have a 30 year old home with a wood paneled room and wanted the room to smell new again, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to achieve that with this.  Still good as a air freshener and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work in the closets against moths.</li>
            <li> I am not at all disappointed in the quality of this oil! Scent was just as expected and it serves the purpose I intended it for! I would purchase Plant Therapy oils in future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love PT!!&lt;br /&gt;If I have a question, they are ready to answer!!!&lt;br /&gt;They always aim to please and their products are awesome! They are my go to !!</li>
            <li> II received my Cedar oil very quickly, and it was packed well.  I plan on using it to try to deter ticks from biting me and my family. I will purchase again from Plant Therapy Essential oils, they seem very enviromentally friendly.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cabin like smell we love to use in our diffuser during the winter months. Nice size, nice price point. will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> I love cedar, the closets are the best for keeping those moths out and the cedar blocks, liners etc. are excellent for keeping fabric must free and the smell is not overpowering. this essential oil is used on my cedar blocks, sachets and more to refresh the cedar odor and I mix it with lemon water and citrus for a room spray. I even find the cedar is excellent to burn in my essential oil burner in order to have the feeling of a cleansed room.&lt;br /&gt;plant therapy is my favorite. all their oils are great and thank you for providing such great oils!</li>
            <li> Bought this looking for a &amp;#34;Christmas scent&amp;#34; for the diffuser.  This wasn&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for related therapeutic purposes, though.</li>
            <li> I love this cedar scent in the house and use it often. I use my in an infuser which puts out a mist.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to have the scent of real cedar in a natural oil to clean and refresh my cedar chests and boxes.</li>
            <li> Remaining product itself seems fine. The product leaked out of bottle and got all over other items and the bottle itself. It is gum based so it was sooooo sticky to clean up.</li>
            <li> I found a recipe online for treating a pregnant dog for fleas. It has worked like a charm. Just put 4 drops in a spray bottle with 4 drops of Lavendar oil  fill with water,and you have a great natural flea treatment.</li>
            <li> This is great smelling and does well in the oil burner and plug in diffuser as well.  Would be good on potpourri as well.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It&#x27;s very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li> good company, good prices, good oils.  Very happy with this product and will purchase from them again.  I have purchased several eo&#x27;s from Plant Therapy and always satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> The great part about undiluted essential oils is that you can modify the smell. You adjust how strong you want the smell or just a light scent. These oils are some of best I tried. They are really pure and mix well. This might not be a fragrance for everyone. The lemon grass is lighter but this is good for body oil and candles. Great product.</li>
            <li> Its an interesting, woodsy smell.. It reminds me of CA, and our honeymoon in Tahoe. Kinda masculine and good for designing male products that are natural.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised and just what I needed. I put some on cotton pads and hide them in my closets to keep moths away. It smells so much better than moth balls.</li>
            <li> Our family uses this oil as a bug repellant for indoors and outdoors and it works pretty well so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention to use it to reactivate the cedar blocks that I use in leather shoes that are stored between uses that often leave them damp. While not the same fragrance as the American cedar wood blocks originally had, this one is pleasant and serves the same deodorizing purpose as the blocks originally had.</li>
            <li> I opened it and smelled it and it did not smell anything like real cedar. I didn&#x27;t like the smell but I thought that maybe if I warmed it up and let the scent fill the room it would smell better. It did not. I threw it away that very day.</li>
            <li> I added some of this oil to water and keep it in a spray bottle.  I use the fine mist about 1 per month in my closets to prevent moths.  Moths, of course, don&#x27;t like the odor of cear.</li>
            <li> I am using this product to help protect my winter garments, and garage storage. This is much safer than toxic moth balls.</li>
            <li> Worked well with two other oils for my homemade mosquito repellent.  I would definitely order this oil again, and the shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> Biggest problem I have had with this product is that the Jar is so dark and so much bigger than needed. You cant see how much you have left in the bottle because of how dark the bottle is and the fact that the bottom is all glass, the oil doesn&#x27;t even go down that far. I think they need to fix the bottles they are using to something easier to see how much you have left and also closer to the size need for the amount they give you, Not 2 times bigger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the scent I expected, it&#x27;s only vaguely &amp;#34;cedar-ish&amp;#34; and not as strong/potent as the other essential oils I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered cedarwood to help with sleep issues. Excellent oil. Will order again.</li>
            <li> The Cedarwood essential Oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good! I use it on wood to restore the freshness and so far it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with your product. Used it to make a beard oil that myself and my son are using and it works great. Thank you, you&#x27;ve got a repeat customer</li>
            <li> I bought this product for using on my dogs. I read online that it&#x27;s good for fleas. I&#x27;ll be trying it out this summer by brushing a little of it on their coats.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to renew the scent of cedar in a closet. This oil is very strong and has  an unusual scent that I did not like. To me, it has an Awful smell. I gave it to a friend who intends to use it in a storage unit to keep the bugs out.</li>
            <li> Great item to use when you are making soap for the first time and don&#x27;t know what fragrance to use.</li>
            <li> This was a bit disappointing and thought I could use it in my closets to help prevent moths. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not. However, scent doesn&#x27;t stay around for long and is a bit medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> Product was as stated and had good fragrance potency.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this essential oil. I purchased to make a hair mask and it smells delicious. I would highly recommend this seller. The product was wrapped well and didn&#x27;t spill and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It has a good Cedar wood smell and is a good quality oil.  I like to mix a couple of drops with Sandelwood and Amber scents wax.  It gives them an added demension! :)</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like cedar.  I&#x27;ve use a different brand in the past, loved the authentic smell of cedar, but it didn&#x27;t linger as long as I&#x27;d like.  Decided to try this brand to see if it would last long.  It does linger longer, but it smells too sweet and perfume-like, not rustic cedar wood smell.</li>
            <li> as described . not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> The seller promptly processed the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the more pleasant smelling cedar wood oils I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It falls half way between sweet in the forest smell and strait up over powering fresh cedar wood sawdust up your nose so all you smell is it for days;&lt;br /&gt;To me it mixes well with vetiver.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Just what I expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it met my expectations, I think.  Meaning the product was excellent, it&#x27;s just that I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it to what I&#x27;d intended.  (Someone told me using cedarwood oil on pets was a non-toxic way to rid them of fleas and ticks, so I applied it to my cat which got her mad, but whatever was bothering her went away so . . .)  Then I discovered what was MY problem was mosquitos lurking.  Anyway, only used the Cedarwood oil a couple times, but I&#x27;m sure it is a good product.  Problem with cat is solved.  .</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cedarwood essential oil, which is one of my favorite smells. I love plant therapy oils and will continue to purchase only plant therapy oils because I know they are good quality. I have many other plant therapy oils and I have to say its one of the better brands. Thanks plant therapy :)</li>
            <li> Even diluted did not smell like cedar. Has a funny back smell.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with other scents</li>
            <li> For some reason it doesn&#x27;t smell like cedar wood.  It&#x27;s weak and barely recognizable to have any aroma at all.&lt;br /&gt;Dissappoment. I was expecting better of this company.</li>
            <li> I used this in my perfume recipe and I adore the smell.  It is very subtle and a little goes a long way.  This will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I dilute this oil and spray on my screens, curtains, cushions etc. to deter insects.  I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for that (not able to test it accurately) but it smells amazing!  It&#x27;s like the smell of sheets that have been in a cedar closet for a while.  Very homey smelling. Shipped fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> This has a great aroma to it. Very calming and is a great product. I buy all my E.Os from here. (So far.. no problems) . If you have a very hyperactive child like I do .. BUY THIS NOW. It true is a life saver. Calmed my son within 15 mins it was amazing</li>
            <li> Nice scent that I add to my shampoo as it aids in hair growth. The scent is mild and earthy.</li>
            <li> Inherited a cedar sewing box from grandma.  It is about 100 years old, appeared dried out, and smelled bad.  After applying this Cedarwood Oil to the unfinished inside, the wood has a restored depth of grain and scent.  Fresh and renewed!  My brother was impressed, so I shared the bottle with him for his cedar chest.  Now I am purchasing more for my cedar chest.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I know smell is a personal preference, so take this with a grain of salt I suppose.  I personally didn&#x27;t care for this one at all.</li>
            <li> A NICE WOOD BURNING SMELL IN THE HOME.  IT REMINDS OF A WOOD BURNING FIREPLACE.  NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE NOSES.</li>
            <li> The smell of this particular scent is not all that strong. I would not buy this scent again. The company brand overall is good though.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree on this one (which doesn&#x27;t happen often with my essential oils) - this has a nice aroma. It reminds me of being out in the woods - taking in the fresh air amongst the forest around me. Soooooo beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Love Plant Therapy oils! Great quality, great price!</li>
            <li> The cedarwood is a great essential oil.  I use it in a shelter for alternating smells for the dogs that are housed there.</li>
            <li> I believe in essential oils and this brand is great. My daughter used it to help her boys sleep. Hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li> I use the cedarwood oil(mixed with peppermint) to make my own flea control for our dog. I also use it to spray around the outside of of doors, windowsills, and patio screen to keep bugs out of the house. Since this is am oil I have a hard time finding locally I got a great price and saved the gas and miles on the car and my time in trying to find it. Shipping was super fast as well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. The scent is strong and powerful and the price is great. I will definitely be ordering more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company. I would give it a 10! Great products &amp; customer service you could ever ask for. Will buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I prefered the one from Russia as the oils from USA have particular slightly stingy smell, however it&#x27;s the best one in USA, as of now.</li>
            <li> I was told it would help calm my son... well He seemed a LOT hyper...&lt;br /&gt;go figure we cant even take Benedryl it messes us up!!!&lt;br /&gt;So for what it is it is good... for us.. bummer...&lt;br /&gt;worth a try I know many like it to help calm</li>
            <li> I was hoping to smell the scent you smell on a warm summer day when the cedar chips are out in the garden. nope. it&#x27;s a bit stinky.</li>
            <li> purchased this to mix with my laundry detergent...works like a charm!  10 drops in a cup of (unscented) detergent and my laundry comes out smelling very faintly of cedarwood.  I have a feeling if I ran it thru the dryer, it would completely dissipate.  Air drying my clothes leaves them with a faint &amp;#34;is that me? Oooh...I smell good&amp;#34; smell thru the day.  Lasts about a week on the hanger.</li>
            <li> I read where cedarwood oil mixed with lotion made a great product for your feet, claiming the scent would made you sleepy, so I bought some.  I still have the lotion I was going to mix it with unopened but I put some with Rosemary Oil in a pan with water and heated it.  Even my family members who are used to me trying aromas kept commenting on the excellent result this gave.  My feet will enjoy it later, I presume, but for now my house will smell wonderful everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> Not quite a nice red cedar smell, more like a musty wood smell but it blends well with other scents. Very masculine fragrance but its just not for me. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great addition to potpourri or relaxing bath salts or soak. It will add the smell ofthe outdoors. Add it to other essential oils to make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Smells great, we use it in tandem with lavender in a spray bottle with some distilled water in the nursery to calm the baby, seems to do a fairly good job. Good value and again, the smell is very nice, like being out in Yosemite.</li>
            <li> Nice!  I used this to restore cedar chest and it works wonderful.  I will buy from Plant Therapy Essential Oils in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil in a frustrated attempt to fix my eoach problem. I mixed it with water and sprayed it around all the walls in my kitchen. Almost ended my bug problem overnight!</li>
            <li> I read about using Cedar Oil for improving the musty smell in an old dresser.  I applied the oil to cotton balls in my dresser drawers and find that this has greatly improved the smell and my clothes smell pleasantly of Cedar oil now.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell as strongly as I&#x27;d hoped. Also it&#x27;s a tiny little bottle...if I&#x27;m going to pay this much for such a small quantity, I was expecting more smell. My rose oil is stronger.</li>
            <li> My expectations were exceeded! The oil was well wrapped (no wasteful packaging) and arrived quickly. The cedarwood is pure and fragrant . Very pleased and will purchase from Plant Therapy again. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil, it smells great on. I would buy it again. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I ordered several varieties of oils from Plant Therapy.  They arrived on time, and as described.  I had been having oils compounded for me at a local store, butt hey never seemed to get it quite right, so I ended up paying for oils that I just didn&#x27;t like and didn&#x27;t use, so I decided to give it a try myself.  The products that I received from plant therapy totally exceeded my expectations.  They smelled much better than anything that I had bought elsewhere,the scent of each each perfectly indicative of their names.  I contacted them via email with a question regarding advice on what oil would be good to add to what I had mixed ( which I loved already, but was just looking for that last element to perfectly round it out).  They got back to me within an hour, and gave me some great advice on what to add.  I will definitely be using them for all my oil and aromatherapy purchases in the future.  Great service, great product!</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like any Cedarwood I&#x27;ve ever smells.  Other Plant Therapy Essential Oils (Frankincense &amp; Patchouli) were bad also.</li>
            <li> This oil smells medicinal. It may not be the fault of the seller, but this oil does not have a pleasant cedar smell.</li>
            <li> One reason why I purchased Cedarwood oil is because of it&#x27;s anti-bacterial quality. I have a lot of wooden floors and furniture, after I clean them. I always add 5 drops on a rag and wipe this product on them. In a warm, humid environment, this product protects my items from mildew and other bacteria from growing almost everywhere.</li>
            <li> smells good i use it on the cedar wood blocks i have to give the scent back to them .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using plant therapy products for a while now &amp; I must say I was shocked by the price &amp; the quality....I&#x27;ve completely quit ordering from my other supplier which was very expensive &amp; the shipping was very expensive also...&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast too....&lt;br /&gt;NEEDLESS TOO STAY I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED W/ THE PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my husband&#x27;s circulation and sleep issues.  Good quality and price.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I use it to add a nice manly scent to my shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product is as shown, the photo of the product is size accurate. I use this essential oil for all kinds of things. I like to mix it with Jojoba oil and use on my scalp to stimulate my roots and accelerate hair growth. I also like to inhale once a day to help me be more aware. This oil smells wonderful (woodsy but not too strong) and works wonders for the hair.</li>
            <li> This oil suits my needs perfectly. I love the scent and it blends well with my oil blends. It&#x27;s not super overpower as some I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> We live in an area with tons of mosquitoes all day all night. I started using this and we have had no bites!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Cedarwood essential oil is wonderful. It has full fragrance and is just as I expected.I am using it as part of an essential oil mix for purification.</li>
            <li> Its potent! Thought it would carry a more &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; aroma. Its more like a sawdust smell. Not keen on that. Overall I would recommend it for its powerful potent aroma if you are into sawdust smells. The manufacturer does seem to take care in the purity of the product so for that its worth mentioning the authenticity.</li>
            <li> this is part of my collection</li>
            <li> Good first-aid oil. Bought for it wide amount of uses.</li>
            <li> smells just like my cedar chest</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help with sleep.  I have been struggling to get a good nights sleep for a very long time.  I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, I am also a very light sleeper.  I started to put a drop or two of fractionated coconut oil in the palm of my hand and one drop of cedarwood, I then apply it to my big toes and foot.  I do the same for both feet.  I am finally able to sleep again!  I fall asleep quickly and I seem to be in a much deeper sleep.  Also, if I happen to wake up I fall back to sleep rather quickly.  I tried diffusing this and also making a diluted roller ball with this, but it just didn&#x27;t give me the same effect.  Diluting it with a teaspoon of carrier oil was just too much and it didn&#x27;t work.  So happy I discovered this oil!</li>
