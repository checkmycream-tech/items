    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not the best coverage!</li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I would say it conceals them about 80% - and I am totally happy with that!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lighter concealer, but this works great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just amazing!</li>
            <li>Does not provide as good of coverage as hoped.</li>
            <li>GOOD APPLICATION/COVERAGE&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>Provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>It lasts beautifully all day with no smudging, caking, or creeping into fine lines.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love  it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found if you use a nice moisturizer for eyes before applying it helps.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It does make my eyes look more refreshed and youthful.</li>
            <li>I learned about this product from the woman who tests and writes about the best cosmetics in different categories (Paula something??).</li>
            <li>I ended up buying another concealer from the Dollar store that worked better than this product.</li>
            <li>It has better staying power on my somewhat oily skin and makes my under eye circles disappear.</li>
            <li>I feel better about my 57</li>
            <li>It did show up quickly in shipping, which was nice though.</li>
            <li>and she was so in love with the quick results that she went and bought some too!</li>
            <li>have used this by itself as a real quick &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m at home and catch my reflection in the mirror, but don&#x27;t want to apply full</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that such a healthy product is also so effective and CHEAP.</li>
            <li>I have light skin but prefer a combination of this light color and medium.</li>
            <li>It also does not go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I did 2 applications and saw a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to go on and does a pretty good job of hiding and lighting the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The price is good so it will get the job down, but will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li>I think the key to using it is to apply your foundation everywhere but the undereye area, apply a light coat of this concealer, and then sweep over the area with a very fine setting powder (not a typical face powder).</li>
            <li>you can put on a thin coat for daytime, then if need more, powder lightly then add a touch more.</li>
            <li>and it goes on better and may last longer.</li>
            <li>does an excellent job of concealing, but tends to settle and cake a little later in the day.the less you use, the better.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike some liquid concealers, it does NOT make the wrinkles more visible once it gets dry.  </li>
            <li>It covers impeccably with a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with product, does not make my eyes water as in other products and is odorless as well.</li>
            <li>I use the pad of my ring finger to pat it on under my eyes and a little on my upper eyelids as it&#x27;s a great brightener.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s orange tinted which covers well and is creamy not thin or chalky.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and it did not do its job very well, even when paired with a powder.</li>
            <li>So this product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and was skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I will and have spent a fortune to find a good dark circle concealer.</li>
            <li>This does ok, but I&#x27;d like to find a green one to counter the color.</li>
            <li>This does diminish the dark area under the eye for me, I use the brush to better control the  application to the dark area and then blend lightly with the finger tip to blend into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I use it pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>Use a small brush for better control of product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic in a small jar.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product works - even on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a much thicker and dryer texture, which I actually prefer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% safe to use, no hazardous chemicals.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older and gotten less sleep with three kids, I&#x27;ve needed some help with dark circles;) I ordered this after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles that really bother me, but want a very natural make up finish.</li>
            <li>so I never expected that it would.</li>
            <li>+ years since my dark undereye circles are not the first thing I see when I look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of my dark circles, but I&#x27;m realistic</li>

            <li> Okay if you want to wear alone, but as the the corrective tone is very orange, I found it super hard to layer under my foundation :(</li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $38 for a small tube of concealer.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because it said it had an orange tint to help conceal dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> I have visible dark circles under my eyes and this product totally covers them.</li>
            <li> The orange tint is supposed to counteract the purple and blue of dark circles but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Overall the product did nothing to lessen the look of my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a yellow concealer and liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> There is still a lot left in this little pot, so I would say that it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It has a slight peachy color which counteracts blue and purple in the undereye area</li>
            <li> My dark circles ARE pretty bad, so I need heavy duty PURE orange when it comes down to it..</li>
            <li> Not as expected for under eye dark circles</li>
            <li> Just dab a small amount under your eye, where your dark circles lie and they not only brighten, but because of the peach color, they get rid of the blue/green hue too!</li>
            <li> I apply much less of this than other concealers I have used.</li>
            <li> Does help offset the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never purchased a product specifically for concealing dark circles before.</li>
            <li> I am 56 and have hereditary dark purple shadows under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping it would cover my dark circles</li>
            <li> This does nothing to conceal dark circles.</li>
            <li> I think it tones down my dark circles well and blends with my CC cream with no problem.</li>
            <li> Although the container is small, a little goes a long way and the price is a steal!</li>
            <li> It does crease a little</li>
            <li> try a little primer</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a lonnnng way.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with very dark under eye circles or someone who doesn&#x27;t prefer their makeup to crease.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it will work on persons with lighter under eye circles but if you have very dark circles like I do, it does not.</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER</li>

            <li> Not the best coverage!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles that really bother me, but want a very natural make up finish. This is fantastic! you can put on a thin coat for daytime, then if need more, powder lightly then add a touch more. DAB, do not &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; on. Dab dab dab.</li>
            <li> Does help offset the dark circles.  I have light skin but prefer a combination of this light color and medium.</li>
            <li> Does not provide as good of coverage as hoped. The price is good so it will get the job down, but will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older and gotten less sleep with three kids, I&#x27;ve needed some help with dark circles;) I ordered this after reading positive reviews. I really like it. It&#x27;s orange tinted which covers well and is creamy not thin or chalky. It does crease a little but I&#x27;ve found if you use a nice moisturizer for eyes before applying it helps. It does make my eyes look more refreshed and youthful. Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  it is easy to go on and does a pretty good job of hiding and lighting the dark circles.  Next time I might buy the darker orange but wondering is that made for darker skin?  I did 2 applications and saw a significant difference.  Will defiantly purchase again!</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER&lt;br /&gt;NOT GOOD APPLICATION/COVERAGE&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEN I GUESS YOU BUY WHAT YOU PAY FOR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never purchased a product specifically for concealing dark circles before. I had previously been using a yellow concealer and liquid foundation. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product works - even on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of my dark circles, but I&#x27;m realistic so I never expected that it would. I would say it conceals them about 80% - and I am totally happy with that!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much. I use the pad of my ring finger to pat it on under my eyes and a little on my upper eyelids as it&#x27;s a great brightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this by itself as a real quick &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m at home and catch my reflection in the mirror, but don&#x27;t want to apply full makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this about 8 months ago and I use it pretty much daily. There is still a lot left in this little pot, so I would say that it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I will and have spent a fortune to find a good dark circle concealer. I am 56 and have hereditary dark purple shadows under my eyes. I have paid as much as $38 for a small tube of concealer. I learned about this product from the woman who tests and writes about the best cosmetics in different categories (Paula something??). Don&#x27;t be concerned about the mention of an orange tone or coconut oil in the product. It has a slight peachy color which counteracts blue and purple in the undereye area and it is not greasy at all. I apply much less of this than other concealers I have used. It covers impeccably with a very small amount of product. Although the container is small, a little goes a long way and the price is a steal! I think the key to using it is to apply your foundation everywhere but the undereye area, apply a light coat of this concealer, and then sweep over the area with a very fine setting powder (not a typical face powder). It lasts beautifully all day with no smudging, caking, or creeping into fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes. This does ok, but I&#x27;d like to find a green one to counter the color.</li>
            <li> Its not the color that i order... don&#x60;t like it</li>
            <li> Okay if you want to wear alone, but as the the corrective tone is very orange, I found it super hard to layer under my foundation :( immediately cakey.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping it would cover my dark circles and it did not do its job very well, even when paired with a powder. I ended up buying another concealer from the Dollar store that worked better than this product. It also creases instantly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with very dark under eye circles or someone who doesn&#x27;t prefer their makeup to crease. It did show up quickly in shipping, which was nice though. Perhaps it will work on persons with lighter under eye circles but if you have very dark circles like I do, it does not.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because it said it had an orange tint to help conceal dark eye circles. My dark circles ARE pretty bad, so I need heavy duty PURE orange when it comes down to it.. So this product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Use a small brush for better control of product. This does diminish the dark area under the eye for me, I use the brush to better control the  application to the dark area and then blend lightly with the finger tip to blend into the skin. So far very pleased with product, does not make my eyes water as in other products and is odorless as well.</li>
            <li> I switched to this form Benefit Erase Paste. This has a much thicker and dryer texture, which I actually prefer.  It has better staying power on my somewhat oily skin and makes my under eye circles disappear.</li>
            <li> does an excellent job of concealing, but tends to settle and cake a little later in the day.the less you use, the better. try a little primer and it goes on better and may last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It conceals well and the color blended well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well I just wish it had stronger pgiment</li>
            <li> I found this product on EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep web site. It&#x27;s 100% safe to use, no hazardous chemicals. It&#x27;s amazing that such a healthy product is also so effective and CHEAP. I have visible dark circles under my eyes and this product totally covers them. Also, unlike some liquid concealers, it does NOT make the wrinkles more visible once it gets dry.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not as expected for under eye dark circles</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lighter concealer, but this works great. Only thing after awhile I have to reblend since my lines become noticeable, but when I apply translucent powder it last all day</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a small jar. A little bit goes a lonnnng way. Just dab a small amount under your eye, where your dark circles lie and they not only brighten, but because of the peach color, they get rid of the blue/green hue too! Just amazing! Used it on my model (I&#x27;m a photographer) and she was so in love with the quick results that she went and bought some too!</li>
            <li> This does nothing to conceal dark circles. The orange tint is supposed to counteract the purple and blue of dark circles but it doesn&#x27;t work. It also does not go on smooth. Overall the product did nothing to lessen the look of my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and was skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised! I think it tones down my dark circles well and blends with my CC cream with no problem. I feel better about my 57+ years since my dark undereye circles are not the first thing I see when I look in the mirror anymore. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Love  it! Provides good coverage.</li>
