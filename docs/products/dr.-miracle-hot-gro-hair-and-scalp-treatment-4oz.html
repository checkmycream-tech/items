            <li>The product also needs to be a bit warm to use (rubbing my index finger across it a bit did the trick).</li>
            <li>Dr Miracle&#x27;s Hot Gro smells great, gingery and sort of spicy, with a pleasant scalp tingle that is not at all overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I let it stay in this time and work its magic.</li>

            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to many friends with simular hair.</li>
            <li>so my hair is easy to section and part.</li>
            <li>At this point I knew that it wasn&#x27;t going to come out easily.</li>
            <li>Great but just starting using it.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed a significantly smoother texture now since I started using Dr Miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I love this hair care product, it really works well and seem to promote hair growth,  </li>
            <li>After washing it out, I found out that I still had my hair luckily, ha.</li>
            <li>It also has improved the condition of my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It was flat and oily, which made my hair look even thinner; my hair loss stood out more since my hair lost whatever volume at the top that it had.</li>
            <li>The products repaired my hair quickly and the tingling feeling proves that it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do not think it is inteded for straight, fine hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product for medium coarse hair/ perm hair</li>
            <li>so I figured why not see what else is out their just to make sure I was not missing nothing.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>a really good product back in the day in philly black women used to make their own dr.miracle with glovers mange and mix it with Vaseline</li>
            <li>I had previously used the Doo-Gro brand for my hair and had a good experience</li>
            <li>I really do believe hot gro works!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is because I did not use it for over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>threw my parts with some hot gro ..</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t hot and tingly...</li>
            <li>She says that this product actually helped her to get a healthy and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product it works very well !</li>
            <li>It burned at first the scalp,but gradually using it, there was no burning.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight with the intent of putting it on my scalp, letting it sit for 30 minutes and then rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>Because that&#x27;s exactly what it is going to do to your hair.</li>
            <li>other good products for natural hair .</li>
            <li>The price is also very decent compared to the stores.</li>
            <li>Certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>suddenly it felt like my hair was falling out and sparks from light had struck my hair maybe.</li>
            <li>This really helped with avoiding greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product Dr. Miracles</li>
            <li>I tried this product and within two-three weeks I really began to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work, but it felt like it was working bc of the tingling</li>
            <li>leaves a very sticky feeling on your hair even with 3 times shampoo already.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me but just because it didn&#x27;t does not mean that it don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>My head is back to full hair head...</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, but I did notice about a half inch difference after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why the negative comments about Dr  Miracles hot gro because I love it... didn&#x27;t seem greasy,  didn&#x27;t have a smell  to it</li>
            <li>I have used it for about three months on my very curly biracial Afro American and Caucasian hair and it has made my hair grow very fast.</li>
            <li>Probably much better results for Afro-American hair, or hair that holds up well under heavy products.  </li>
            <li>My hair grew faster than normal.</li>
            <li>Most of the product had come out by then, but my scalp has been left dry, itchy and tender from the dish soap chemicals.</li>
            <li>I only used it a sparingly a few more times after this incident and it still got hot</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping that it would help even a little, but it ended up being the most harmful of all the products I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>The only down side about the product for me is the smell it has a very strong medicated smell</li>
            <li>I ended up gathering as many different shampoos as I could find (I never seem to fully empty my bottles before I buy new shampoos).</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would steer clear of it!</li>
            <li>I am currently using this as a pre-shampoo hot treatment.</li>
            <li>But when im ready to grow back out my hair</li>
            <li>Make my fell soft and stronger</li>
            <li>and i used it every morning in my scalp to keep the scalp moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Well after some extensive research I stumbled upon a fix for getting vaseline/petroleum jelly out of your hair (you&#x27;d be surprised how often that apparently happens haha).</li>
            <li>When they say hot, they do mean hot!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>wondering is that normal .im african american natural hair .any</li>
            <li>I finally got the product to wash out, my hair was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It really makes you look like you haven&#x27;t washed for days if have have any semblance of long hair because it takes that much effort to get it down to your scalp.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty tingly once the heat settles down...</li>
            <li>I am a 19 year old female dealing with extensive hair loss.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin.</li>

            <li> My hair is fine and thin.</li>
            <li> if you flat iron your hair and have Dr Miracle product in your hair</li>
            <li> I am a person that doesnt like one style for too long</li>
            <li> Was very greasy and thick, took me 6 washes over 3 days to get rid of the oily feel on my strands.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The only downsides I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you stop using it my hair doesn&#x27;t grow like it does when I use it and it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp after it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> My edges fell out because of box braids and this product grew them back in less than two months.</li>
            <li> My hair that had not really grown in years began to thicken up.</li>
            <li> Grows my hair at an alarming rapid rate.</li>
            <li> doesnt not really has a scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure that this worked because it made my hair such a greasy mess 2 days later, after repeat attempts to wash it out, that I never tried it again.</li>
            <li> I used it mainly in my scalp because it was very thick</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and it grows faster by using this product and other products made my DR.</li>
            <li> so the hair was not bouncy but extremely clammy.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product in the future and I recommend this product for anyone with slow growth issues.</li>
            <li> it is extremely greasy!</li>
            <li> After my second shower I got frustrated and threw the whole product away after just one use.</li>
            <li> I have really thin spots along my hairline due to years of individual braids.</li>
            <li> The 1st time that I used it, I did not feel anything for a few minutes then</li>
            <li> I had a thin spot in the front of my hair and after using this for about a month once a day, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t use it, but I have used it before and it definitely fills in the areas that may thin from styling your hair.</li>
            <li> My temples and crown had been having some trouble with growing hair....</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to any women, or any men who don&#x27;t want their hair a mess!</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night and give it a chance for my hair to absorb the product</li>
            <li> I will try melting small amounts in the microwave, and then applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product I did not like, only because it was so thick, and difficult to even finger out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any breakage while brushing or after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I know by now, we&#x27;ve all seen the late night commericals, and</li>
            <li> The content is orange and thick just like vaseline</li>
            <li> Not a good buy</li>
            <li> I bought this product approximately two months ago and my hair has grown about two inches.</li>
            <li> not happy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical getting this</li>
            <li> However, 3 bad hair days in a row are the trade off.</li>
            <li> By this time I was getting incredibly frustrated</li>
            <li> this is terrible!!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is though awful</li>
            <li> It smells awful and caused breakage not hair growth.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> made my hair feel sticky</li>
            <li> Dr Miracle&#x27;s Hot Gro smells great, gingery and sort of spicy, with a pleasant scalp tingle that is not at all overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not think it is inteded for straight, fine hair like mine.  Probably much better results for Afro-American hair, or hair that holds up well under heavy products.  Was very greasy and thick, took me 6 washes over 3 days to get rid of the oily feel on my strands.&lt;br /&gt;After I finally got the product to wash out, my hair was soft and shiny.  However, 3 bad hair days in a row are the trade off.</li>
            <li> Has been about 10 weeks...don&#x27;t see any growth yet.</li>
            <li> this is terrible!! my hair looks as if I had not washed them a month! although I did it 4 times already today! even with vinegar! nothing works! do not try to use this stuff on your hair!</li>
            <li> Lemme tell you this. When they say hot, they do mean hot! I had previously used the Doo-Gro brand for my hair and had a good experience so I figured why not see what else is out their just to make sure I was not missing nothing. Case in point, which lead me to Dr. Miracle. I know by now, we&#x27;ve all seen the late night commericals, and the girl with the frazzy hair, etc. Well, I was just looking for something to contribute to the strength and growth of mine (I am male thank you) so I decided to try this out. The 1st time that I used it, I did not feel anything for a few minutes then suddenly it felt like my hair was falling out and sparks from light had struck my hair maybe. After washing it out, I found out that I still had my hair luckily, ha. I only used it a sparingly a few more times after this incident and it still got hot but I let it stay in this time and work its magic. It gets pretty tingly once the heat settles down...Other than that I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is because I did not use it for over a long period of time. I just did nomt like the instant effects that it had.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this. I use this on my scalp after it&#x27;s dry so my hair is easy to section and part. This really helped with avoiding greasy hair.  The product also needs to be a bit warm to use (rubbing my index finger across it a bit did the trick). I had a thin spot in the front of my hair and after using this for about a month once a day, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Miracles for 3 years and I am impressed with their products. My hair grew faster than normal. I was getting a lot of compliments about my braids. If anyone is having problems with their hair, I suggest trying Dr. Miracles.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product on my hair since i was 14, all yu need to do is put it on your roots and let it work its magic  ...now im 20 and i havent had a problem with this product ...it tingles because it has a form of methol in it to waken up ya hair folicles ..i personally like that tingly feeling.I am a person that doesnt like one style for too long so i tend to cut my hair, color,weaves, etc . But when im ready to grow back out my hair i just put in a protective style and glide threw my parts with some hot gro .. Amazing product for medium coarse hair/ perm hair i shoud say.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why the negative comments about Dr  Miracles hot gro because I love it... didn&#x27;t seem greasy,  didn&#x27;t have a smell  to it and it wasn&#x27;t hot and tingly... in fact its  making my bald spot in my hair grow...  use it  one time sometimes twice a day and wash hair once a week. Thanks for making this product Dr. Miracles</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year now along with the anti-breakage formula and my results are excellent.  I hardly have any breakage while brushing or after shampooing.  Love it.</li>
            <li> their isn&#x27;t  nothing  like hair grease!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, after I used my clinical strength dandruff shampoo this stuff worked great! My hair grew about an inch in a month, use this after every shower. This works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I love this hair care product, it really works well and seem to promote hair growth,  Four more words ok.</li>
            <li> Your hair will definitely grow!  I have used it for about three months on my very curly biracial Afro American and Caucasian hair and it has made my hair grow very fast. It also has improved the condition of my hair tremendously.  I also have noticed a significantly smoother texture now since I started using Dr Miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing is the smell and if you flat iron your hair and have Dr Miracle product in your hair please have a window or some ventilation nearby because when product comes in contact with heat it will produce a smoke that will burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought this product approximately two months ago and my hair has grown about two inches. The only down side about the product for me is the smell it has a very strong medicated smell but it works. I will continue to use the product in the future and I recommend this product for anyone with slow growth issues.</li>
            <li> a really good product back in the day in philly black women used to make their own dr.miracle with glovers mange and mix it with Vaseline you can buy glovers mange on amazon and believe me it works not trying to step on any body toes just saying and I hope this is was helpful</li>
            <li> I really do believe hot gro works! I have really thin spots along my hairline due to years of individual braids. I tried this product and within two-three weeks I really began to see a difference. My hair that had not really grown in years began to thicken up. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. The only downsides I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you stop using it my hair doesn&#x27;t grow like it does when I use it and it is extremely greasy. I usually use it at night and give it a chance for my hair to absorb the product</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would not buy this product again becuase it has petrolatum ; fact i did not notice before; and we all know what this ingredients does to our african hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a creamy hair moisturizer, but turns out it&#x27;s hair grease! The upside is that it smells great, moisturizes my hair, and adds shine. It&#x27;s definitely better than similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for her edges but she doesn&#x27;t use it, but I have used it before and it definitely fills in the areas that may thin from styling your hair. The price is also very decent compared to the stores.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this as a pre-shampoo hot treatment. I like the fresh scent. Its tingly, but I did put a lot on. It is really good stuff.</li>
            <li> i didnt feel  no tingling on my hair at all .ive been using it for about 2 weeks now im still waiting for some results .im wondering is that normal .im african american natural hair .any other good products for natural hair .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work, but it felt like it was working bc of the tingling</li>
            <li> It has good smell and good stimulates to my scrull, be happy you had purchase it and looking good after words.</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr. Miracle products.  The products repaired my hair quickly and the tingling feeling proves that it works. I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> it is extremely greasy! couldn&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 or 3 times!</li>
            <li> I wanted the medicated</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong, but I did notice about a half inch difference after 4 weeks. Make the scalp fell good. I like it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast with PRIME, I always use Dr. Miracle and it&#x27;s one of the few products I use on my hair. When you use it has a tingling feeling and I personally think my hair is stronger and it grows faster by using this product and other products made my DR. Miracle</li>
            <li> Love it. Grows my hair at an alarming rapid rate. My edges fell out because of box braids and this product grew them back in less than two months.</li>
            <li> Make my fell soft and stronger</li>
            <li> I was skeptical getting this but it truly helps hair growth.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s sister likes it. She says that this product actually helped her to get a healthy and shiny hair. She was having some issue with hair loss and after applying this product she says that it helped a lot. The smell of this product is though awful</li>
            <li> I like this product it works very well !</li>
            <li> Not sure that this worked because it made my hair such a greasy mess 2 days later, after repeat attempts to wash it out, that I never tried it again. It really makes you look like you haven&#x27;t washed for days if have have any semblance of long hair because it takes that much effort to get it down to your scalp. Certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Used it on my daughter who has shorter hair and also didn&#x27;t see any effects.</li>
            <li> This product I did not like, only because it was so thick, and difficult to even finger out of the jar. I will try melting small amounts in the microwave, and then applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the warm feeling you get when you put the product on your hair and the product feels very good.</li>
            <li> made me hair look greasy. It smells awful and caused breakage not hair growth. My hair is fine and thin. Not a good buy</li>
            <li> Still using but it definitely keeps your hair moist.</li>
            <li> It burned at first the scalp,but gradually using it, there was no burning. I used it mainly in my scalp because it was very thick and i used it every morning in my scalp to keep the scalp moisturized and soft. It was used once on my hair but left the hair too clamped like vaseline so the hair was not bouncy but extremely clammy. It is well suited for the scalp only not for the hair. The content is orange and thick just like vaseline doesnt not really has a scent.</li>
            <li> leaves a very sticky feeling on your hair even with 3 times shampoo already. not happy.</li>
            <li> Great but just starting using it.</li>
            <li> My temples and crown had been having some trouble with growing hair.... This made that all disappear...  In 3 to 4 months...  My head is back to full hair head... In fact it grow longer and has this sheen I love. This works and I love the tingly feeling that comes after oiling... I</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful. I am a 19 year old female dealing with extensive hair loss. I had tried shampoos &amp; conditioners, creams, supplements, vitamins, and medications all designed for hair loss and none of them worked. So I looked to using OTC hair growth methods. I bought this hoping that it would help even a little, but it ended up being the most harmful of all the products I have tried so far. I used it for the first time tonight with the intent of putting it on my scalp, letting it sit for 30 minutes and then rinsing it out. I got out of the shower and my roots and scalp were incredibly greasy and sticky. I was in no condition to go anywhere with my hair the way it was. It was flat and oily, which made my hair look even thinner; my hair loss stood out more since my hair lost whatever volume at the top that it had. So I went back and washed just my hair a second time, still it was greasy and sticky. At this point I knew that it wasn&#x27;t going to come out easily. I ended up gathering as many different shampoos as I could find (I never seem to fully empty my bottles before I buy new shampoos). I ended up with about 4 or 5 different shampoos, and just went ahead and took another shower, and I used all 4 or 5 of the shampoos one at a time. I got out and my hair was STILL COATED IN THE PRODUCT! By this time I was getting incredibly frustrated so I googled \\&quot;how to get grease out of your hair.\\&quot; Well after some extensive research I stumbled upon a fix for getting vaseline/petroleum jelly out of your hair (you&#x27;d be surprised how often that apparently happens haha). I figured it would be the same approach for getting something so sticky and oily out of your hair. People suggested things like baby powder, baby oil, vinegar, and dish soap. Dish soap was the only one of those that I had lying around the house, so I went and took a THIRD shower to wash my hair for the 8th time!! This time I used a quarter-sized dollop of dish soap on my scalp and massaged it in, let it sit for about 5 minutes then rinsed and conditioned my hair. Most of the product had come out by then, but my scalp has been left dry, itchy and tender from the dish soap chemicals. After my second shower I got frustrated and threw the whole product away after just one use. I would not recommend this product to any women, or any men who don&#x27;t want their hair a mess! If you&#x27;re a person who gels your hair or slicks it back, than this product is perfect for you! Because that&#x27;s exactly what it is going to do to your hair. Otherwise I would steer clear of it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me but just because it didn&#x27;t does not mean that it don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This grease treatment is wonderful for my granddaughter and me it do wonders so if you need your hair to grow use this.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. I am still trying it to see some improvement.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me about it. I love the product. Would recommend to many friends with simular hair. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love it! Works wonders &amp; smells good!</li>
