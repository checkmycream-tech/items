            <li>I followed the directions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>This cleaner really works well for my curling iron.</li>
            <li>Made the iron look just like new!</li>
            <li>My iron was better off with the little bits of hairspray on it.  </li>

            <li> I have coarse hair, so I use a lot of oils and products on my hair to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that there was a flat ironer cleaner.</li>
            <li> on your hair to flat iron, do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Spray it on, leave for a few minutes and wipe off with a soft cloth.  </li>
            <li> Be careful however that no excess fluid seeps inside your styling tool.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware cuz it&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product had leaked slightly when it arrived, but not much.</li>
            <li> So for those of you like myself who use extremely heavy product (i.e., oils, creams, etc.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> My iron was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> At least then I could scratch at it with my finger nails.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell on the styling tool to then put in your hair when you use it next.  </li>
            <li> Sadly to say I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I am very annoyed that I purchased this product, and wish I never had.  </li>
            <li> and I figured out why, my curling iron was dirty</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. Cleans quickly, easily. I already reorder.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that there was a flat ironer cleaner. Ordered it to try it out and it works. From the picture it doesn&#x27;t look big, but when I received it, it was big enough. Just bought a new flat iron and I&#x27;m trying to keep it in good condition for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> If you use your hair straightener, crimper, or hair curler alot this is a must have. It cleans your styling tool so it lasts longer. I used it once and I love it alot, it isn&#x27;t strong in smell and it arrived amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Before finding this product I used scissors to scrape off hair spray residue from my curling iron which scratched the iron.  This product cleans the iron thoroughly and safely.  Spray it on, leave for a few minutes and wipe off with a soft cloth.  I am still on my first bottle purchased in October of 2014, have used it daily for 5 months and still have several uses left.  Bought two more bottles before I needed to in case it suddenly isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> It did not remove the burned on residue from my argan oil infused curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use 2 find my hair had like a red color after curling it and I figured out why, my curling iron was dirty and I bought this. Sooo happy I did!!!</li>
            <li> My iron was pretty bad.  This would work OK if you kept up with the cleaning from the time the iron was new.  Will do that when I replace my iron.</li>
            <li> This cleaner really works well for my curling iron. I use hot tools iron so thought I would try the same cleaner. I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> This works great, melts the gunk off my flat iron with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have  a hot tools curling iron and a FHI Runway flat iron which retails for about $450.  I used this first on my curling iron, because I wanted to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t damage my precious flat iron.  All it did was leave a sticky residue that I couldn&#x27;t get off.  It smells like windex, and the smell continues to burn off of your iron and into your hair for weeks.  I followed the directions EXACTLY.  I am very annoyed that I purchased this product, and wish I never had.  My iron was better off with the little bits of hairspray on it.  At least then I could scratch at it with my finger nails.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is excellent! It removes build-up and discolouration on flatiron plates well. Be careful however that no excess fluid seeps inside your styling tool.</li>
            <li> This worked amazingly well to clean my flat iron! All the gunk that was built up came right off after letting the product sit on the straightener for about a minute. Made the iron look just like new!</li>
            <li> This is a wonder product to keep the curling iron clean. I bought this to go along with the curling iron I bought my stepdaughter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product. I have coarse hair, so I use a lot of oils and products on my hair to flat iron it. This product is made for people who do not use heavy products, wherein rubbing alcohol will clean a flat iron with minimal residue build up. So for those of you like myself who use extremely heavy product (i.e., oils, creams, etc.) on your hair to flat iron, do not buy this product. Buyer beware cuz it&#x27;s a complete waste of money. Buy a cheap cream hair relaxer instead. It will instantly clean your flat iron all nice and shiny. Go to YouTube under \\&quot;cleaning a flat iron\\&quot; to get complete directions on how to use a cream relaxer to clean your flat iron.</li>
            <li> This product had leaked slightly when it arrived, but not much. Some of the labeling had washed off. In any case it does work really well to clean all my styling tools!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try Easy Off as if it were an oven.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would wipe away all of the dirt and grime off of my hair straightener. I sprayed a good amount on my hair straightener and let it sit their too. It only took off a lil bit of dirt from the sides of the hair straightener but it didnt completely remove all of the dirt and stains off of my iron. Sadly to say I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> The product totally works as advertised.  When applied to a warm iron, it loosens all accumulated debris and makes it a breeze to remove.  Only takes several sprays on a very large iron to get the job done.  I used a slightly damp rag to wipe away debris and the product was fast in its action.  I&#x27;m a licensed stylist and this cleans my tools so well they always look new and thats a huge plus in our industry.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for cleaning off your heated styling tools! I love this product, it cleans  very well and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell on the styling tool to then put in your hair when you use it next.  I recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> This product did a remarkable job of cleaning my new curling iron.  I didn&#x27;t have to go to the old routine of heating and scrubbing.</li>
