            <li> Love the scent, would have been 5 stars if the lid had been on the bottle tight and it hadn&#x27;t spilled out a quarter of the contents into the bag and leaked into the box</li>
            <li> Only thing I use on my hair. I have used this brand and type for about 2 years. My hair has never been healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trained my hair to be washed every 5--7 days on this product. I have long, natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Once again I love Alba Plumeria shampoo. Washes well, especially with all of the product in my hair. I especially like that it moisturizes my color treated hair. GREAT shampoo!!! Smells WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo.  My husband uses it too and he says it even helps get rid of his dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this so much, I wish they sold it in stores near me so I didn&#x27;t have to order it over the internet all the time! Works as well as every other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it with the same scent of Alba shampoo. I have long, thick, frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling super amazing, but it&#x27;s not any different than usual. I just love the scent so much, I will keep using it for this reason. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t really lather up.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is wonderful. i first saw this product in the natural foods section but they didnt have the plumeria. it smells great. will definetly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It smells wonderful and makes my hair look healthy. I&#x27;ll buy it again and also try some other Alba Botanica products.</li>
            <li> I buy this and the conditioner set at whole foods. I have only been using it for a few days but already notice a difference in my hair quality such as texture, oiliness after a whole day, thickness, etc. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived and since I know the product, all is good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it&#x27;s a bit hard to rinse out.</li>

            <li> Love the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I got the conditioner too and even my hair dresser noticed.  I&#x27;d only been using it for 3 weeks when I went in to get my hair cut and colored and she said, &amp;#34;Okay, what have you been using on your hair?  It looks so shiny and healthy.&amp;#34;  What more can you ask for.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product with benign effects on healthy. I just feels natural, with pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> But dries my hair out too much. Wanted it to work so much  I bought it on 2 separate occasions. Fail...both times...boo.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well!</li>
            <li> Leaves so much residue in my hair!</li>
