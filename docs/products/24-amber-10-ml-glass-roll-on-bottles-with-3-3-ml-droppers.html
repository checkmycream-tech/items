            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Planning to purchase more!</li>
            <li>These seem like really nice rollers.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put diluted oils in it, because that makes the top come off.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with droppers and rollers.</li>
            <li>Love the bottles</li>
            <li>I then decided to go through my inventory and make sure that I didnt have more like this.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>love these bottles perfect for essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love these bottles.  </li>
            <li>The rollerball fell out of most of these I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I can push the caps on easily without any tools to help me.</li>
            <li>, it seems like the others are fine.</li>
            <li>Rolling in one direction works best and you need little to no pressure.</li>
            <li>Everyone of the ones that NOT fall out we bottles I had filled yesterday...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of plastic and obviously cheap.</li>
            <li>This is costing me way more than it is worth.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I would have read all reviews before purchasing this product - those posting about the rollerball falling out were absolutely correct!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I used these myself first before sharing with others - how embarrassing would that have been.</li>
            <li>:) Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they have the roll on which makes it so much easier to apply the oils.</li>
            <li>I just recently got into essential oils so being able to buy 24 complete bottles was awesome, but going forward, I will try to look for metal or glass rollers because these rollers sometimes stick with thicker oils.</li>
            <li>These r were great until the little balls started falling out.  </li>
            <li>But overall, the rollers seem to work nicely.</li>
            <li>Great tiny bottles to fill up with essential oils.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and were delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>These are exactly wanted I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>I had 2 or 3 of the balls fall out  of the first 8 bottles.  </li>
            <li>These are total junk...working on a solution for a better quality bottle and will post it when I find it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would make them better is a metal ball.</li>
            <li>Absolutely lkove these!</li>
            <li>Came very well packaged!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find an easy way to use them daily &amp; not expose them to the air multiple times daily.</li>
            <li>Nice dark amber glass.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>The plastic rollerballs make it possible for me to apply oils and serums to my skin without exposing the serum or oil to the air or light.</li>
            <li>Packed well which I was pleasantly surprised with, in a way that pretty much ensured no damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy again because the service is fast and the price is good for a small bundle instead of having to buy four dozen from my regular supplier.  </li>
            <li>The amber glass is high quality.</li>
            <li>have 12 roller bottles &amp; only 1 new roller top left.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I filled, when I screwed the lid on, the top disintergrated and not only was the bottle ruined, but the expensive essential oils I had mixed were unusable due to the pulverized glass from the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The rollers on these bottles are complete garbage.</li>
            <li>Either they don&#x27;t roll/release oil or they fall apart completely.</li>
            <li>Nothing missing, not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Since serums are often quite expensive and  they can spoil quickly when exposed to light &amp; /or</li>
            <li>It is also quite disturbing to me to lose some of my precious oils to spillage each time the ball falls out!</li>
            <li>The heading indicates 24 Amber roll - on but next to the stars, it says Clear.  </li>
            <li>I have only used one so far and the rollerball does not stay in.</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered so far has been getting my order completed.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is going to be true for all</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great quality product! worked perfectly :)</li>
            <li> These are great rollers for the price! The only issue is that there is plastic sticking up on each of the balls, but it is not scratchy.</li>
            <li> Received timely and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have only used one so far and the rollerball does not stay in. Not sure if this is going to be true for all or if I just picked a bad one.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and value. These are exactly wanted I wanted and needed. They work perfectly for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast delivery.....will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put diluted oils in it, because that makes the top come off. Great for undiluted oils.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> The roller balls will,stay in for a few days but will fall out while using them and cause the oils to spill all over. Very disappointed in these:(</li>
            <li> Roll on bottles have glass balls and they work well. Great price. So far no leaking compared with other brands and colors that I have tried. Just don&#x27;t over tighten any rollerball bottle! The Pipettes are very handy. Nice dark amber glass. :) Thanks.</li>
            <li> Work Great.  I can push the caps on easily without any tools to help me.</li>
            <li> These are great. I will buy again in the future. Work well and are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great price! Love that it comes with droppers and rollers. I just recently got into essential oils so being able to buy 24 complete bottles was awesome, but going forward, I will try to look for metal or glass rollers because these rollers sometimes stick with thicker oils. It was perfect for a starter item though.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottles.  Great service.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> These are very good glass rollers and came nicely packaged.  Good price.  I&#x27;ll buy again because the service is fast and the price is good for a small bundle instead of having to buy four dozen from my regular supplier.  The amber glass is high quality.</li>
            <li> Such a deal!  Love the bottles and they arrived in good shape.  Had to turn around and order another set!</li>
            <li> Great size, rollers work well</li>
            <li> Loved the price. They work well.</li>
            <li> I had 2 or 3 of the balls fall out  of the first 8 bottles.  I hope that is it, it seems like the others are fine.</li>
            <li> These r were great until the little balls started falling out.  Have to be very careful so they don&#x27;t come out.  Would t order these again.</li>
            <li> Product just as descibed..will order from again</li>
            <li> These roller bottles seemed to work well until oils have been in them for a few days. The roller balls fall out! Today at the market I had several bottles that I was sampling or selling that the balls fell out. I then decided to go through my inventory and make sure that I didnt have more like this. I went through 100 bottles and had 74 of the rollerballs fall out.  Everyone of the ones that NOT fall out we bottles I had filled yesterday...These are total junk...working on a solution for a better quality bottle and will post it when I find it</li>
            <li> The first bottle I filled, when I screwed the lid on, the top disintergrated and not only was the bottle ruined, but the expensive essential oils I had mixed were unusable due to the pulverized glass from the top of the bottle.  This was an expensive bottle fail, the oils would have sold for $20 and are now usless.</li>
            <li> Amber glass bottles are a great way to protect the serums that I buy for my skin. The plastic rollerballs make it possible for me to apply oils and serums to my skin without exposing the serum or oil to the air or light. Since serums are often quite expensive and  they can spoil quickly when exposed to light &amp; /or air I was happy to find an easy way to use them daily &amp; not expose them to the air multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> These seem like really nice rollers.  The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered so far has been getting my order completed.  But overall, the rollers seem to work nicely.</li>
            <li> Great tiny bottles to fill up with essential oils. I love the fact that they have the roll on which makes it so much easier to apply the oils.</li>
            <li> great deal. good quality, well packaged</li>
            <li> Perfect. As described, on time.</li>
            <li> These leak when they are on their sides because the lid doesn&#x27;t work properly.  The price was reasonable and were delivered quickly.  I only use these bottles if I don&#x27;t have to throw it in a bag and go.  They usually just sit in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Balls fallout of the bottle makes biggest mess.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks the roller ball part falls off :( Couldn&#x27;t find a way to just get them replaced????&lt;br /&gt;I have 12 roller bottles &amp; only 1 new roller top left.....12 out of 24 roller part fell off :(</li>
            <li> Nothing missing, not disappointed at all. Packed well which I was pleasantly surprised with, in a way that pretty much ensured no damage. Lovely. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> The heading indicates 24 Amber roll - on but next to the stars, it says Clear.  I&#x27;m not sure which it is.</li>

            <li> love these bottles perfect for essential oils. Only thing that would make them better is a metal ball.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles.  I use them to mix my essential oils with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I would have read all reviews before purchasing this product - those posting about the rollerball falling out were absolutely correct! Very disappointed especially when description says &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34;. I have replaced the rollerball tip 3 times on a single bottle.

            <li> Great rollers at an awesome price!</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Glass roller bottles arrived promptly. Love them!</li>
            <li> the balls will not stay in</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. The rollerball fell out of most of these I&#x27;ve used. I guess they still work you just have to be careful with the ball. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lkove these! Using them for essential oils blends and easier application for individual oils. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with any damaged ones or issues with the roller. Rolling in one direction works best and you need little to no pressure. Planning to purchase more! Came very well packaged!</li>
