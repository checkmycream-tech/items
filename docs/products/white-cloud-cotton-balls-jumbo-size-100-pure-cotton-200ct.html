            <li>Excellent cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>No matter what all you use them for, there&#x27;s one thing you can&#x27;t deny - they&#x27;re perfect for the job.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t taste very good...</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase</li>
            <li>Loved the cotton balls but they are not what I would consider jumbo.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this is a good product</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>one companies definition of jumbo and large seem to vary a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li>Cotton balls have so many uses.</li>
            <li>I suppose but I will have to use more a couple each time.</li>
            <li>They will work fine</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to keep an eye for something larger than jumbo lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad, because that is the exact number of cotton balls that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Clean and moisture absorbent.</li>
            <li>clean usage.</li>
            <li>just easier, overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>When doing nails, they have ruined many a perfect nail by leaving big balls of threaded cotton all over and stuck in almost dried</li>
            <li>These cotton balls are of good quality, but I would have described them as large not jumbo...but they are of good size, certainly larger than some cotton balls that are described as large, but then very similar to some cotton balls that are described as large.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a good bag that doesn&#x27;t break down too.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>Personally I&#x27;ve used them for wound sanitation, moisturizer application, make-up remover, to removed nail polish and so much more.</li>
            <li>, I simply use two cotton balls most of the time for certain applications.....</li>
            <li>It kind of defeats the purpose of buying \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; when you have to use 3 each time because they are too small to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and the amount for the daily injections I have to take.</li>
            <li>Very soft cottonballs-</li>
            <li>This only gets a star because I have to so that I can save others from purchasing these highly overpriced NOT jumbo cotton balls!</li>
            <li>but since it comes in such a large bag you can always double up!</li>

            <li> Just the right size and the amount for the daily injections I have to take.</li>
            <li> This is a giant bag of cotton balls.  There are 200 of them.  I&#x27;m glad, because that is the exact number of cotton balls that I wanted.  Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Quality item!  Is what it is and does what it does. Comes in a good bag that doesn&#x27;t break down too.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Tiny bag of cotton balls. $7 for Walmart brand. I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li> These are NOT jumbo cotton balls. They are regular sized. I was looking for jumbo cotton balls for a craft project and was disappointed when I opened these. They are pretty small.</li>
            <li> I was planning to use these for cosmetics, removing makeup and such. No such luck, however, these are tiny! If you want to make a sheep arts and crafts project with your kid, these are just the cotton balls for you. If you want to use them for personal use, skip them and purchase a bag from the store so you can see what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> This only gets a star because I have to so that I can save others from purchasing these highly overpriced NOT jumbo cotton balls!</li>
            <li> Solid cotton balls, not much more to say.</li>
            <li> These are NOT JUMBO unless you are a Barbie doll.  Tiny, little, not usable, waste of money.</li>
            <li> This saved me a trip to my local walmart.  They&#x27;re a little smaller than I wanted but since it comes in such a large bag you can always double up!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t taste very good...</li>
            <li> Very soft cottonballs- they don&#x27;t fall apart like some brands do.</li>
            <li> I use cotton balls daily and this size bag saves me going to store to stock up</li>
            <li> worst cotton balls I have ever used.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  They are not jumbo.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. Cotton balls have so many uses. This brand is durable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Excellent cotton balls.  Clean and moisture absorbent.</li>
            <li> this pkg is BIG, but OMG the cotton balls are bad. Every use has them shredding threads of cotton all over. When doing nails, they have ruined many a perfect nail by leaving big balls of threaded cotton all over and stuck in almost dried polish.&lt;br /&gt;My take is that they have puffed up these balls with an inordinant amount of AIR to make them bigger; that air the disallows&lt;br /&gt;normal clean usage.</li>
            <li> Loved the cotton balls but they are not what I would consider jumbo.</li>
            <li> Well sizes seem to differ when buying cotton balls.....one companies definition of jumbo and large seem to vary a great deal.  These cotton balls are of good quality, but I would have described them as large not jumbo...but they are of good size, certainly larger than some cotton balls that are described as large, but then very similar to some cotton balls that are described as large.  Anyways, this is a good product and I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase, I simply use two cotton balls most of the time for certain applications.....just easier, overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> When it comes to multiple use products, I don&#x27;t think anything can compare to cotton balls. Personally I&#x27;ve used them for wound sanitation, moisturizer application, make-up remover, to removed nail polish and so much more. No matter what all you use them for, there&#x27;s one thing you can&#x27;t deny - they&#x27;re perfect for the job. They&#x27;re absorbent, they distribute product well, they don&#x27;t leave pieces all over your face neither do they tear before you&#x27;re done with them. I can&#x27;t complain when it comes to these especially when a pack lasts for months at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought these at walmart last week (3.68 for 400) because I needed some for my facial toner application and I use them to apply vitamin E oil after waxing my eyebrows. They are very small. A lot smaller than the last pack I had previously. I guess the word jumbo doesn&#x27;t mean what it used to. They will work fine I suppose but I will have to use more a couple each time. It kind of defeats the purpose of buying \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; when you have to use 3 each time because they are too small to cover your face and neck. Oh well. Lesson learned. I guess I will have to keep an eye for something larger than jumbo lol.</li>
