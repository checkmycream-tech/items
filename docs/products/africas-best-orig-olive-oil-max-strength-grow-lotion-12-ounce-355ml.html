            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>Very great product leaves hair and body soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I used to blame products for not being as good when it was really me not taking the best care of my hair</li>
            <li>This is a lighter product that does an incredible job by knocking out the frizz and leaving my hair soft, curly and controlled.</li>
            <li>the smell is not my favorite but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I love Organic Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>I found it helped keep my hair hydrated most of the day</li>
            <li>This particular product is great</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair products for dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for my natural 4c hair!</li>
            <li>Before giving a comment its best to properly use the product consistently.</li>
            <li>My salon lady was amazed at how quickly my hair grew!</li>
            <li>Its light yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Overall, It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer, I have used that leaves my hair soft long after I apply it.</li>
            <li>This hair cream is good for all hair types, and definitely works.</li>
            <li>If you do not take care of the state of your hair most hair products will not benefit you as much as it could.</li>
            <li>not a bad product</li>
            <li>I do use the super gro in the jar and have seen some growth, that I will buy again.</li>
            <li>it smells good,and so far its ok</li>
            <li>It is worth it though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty watery product.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this product locally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, results are not instant all the time, most people drop things after a day or two from being unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I live in braids so like most people, I had lost a good part of my front hair, so I started to use this product, I will apply a little bit on the front and edges of my head (or where hair used to be) and then spray African Royale BRX Braid &amp; Extensions Sheen Spray.</li>
            <li>I have think curly hair and this product was everything I didnt expect it to be, positively of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair already grows pretty fast but when using this product I had 3 INCHES of growth in a MONTH.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5star rating, but the cost is a bit high for the amount of product you get!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair grow so fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much else to say...</li>
            <li>it didnt help much with isnt really the product itself but the state of your hair.</li>
            <li>Deep conditioning, moisturizing and sealing hair with oil is important.</li>
            <li>When its dry, deep conditioning is the best fix, when its limp you need protein, if you have an issue with split ends oil after you moisturize each time and dont leave your hair out all the time.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of products advertised for hair but its best to be able to differentiate which is for aid or maintenance (such as this lotion) or products that will gradually solve your hair crisis if its dry or weak (such as deep conditioning as i mentioned before).</li>
            <li>, I had to keep putting more on often then usual.</li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair that soft</li>
            <li>my 20 years old daughter loves it</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair always used to be dry, particularly at the ends</li>
            <li>It is just so hard to find it available in the stores here, so I thought gosh let me check our My Amazon, and low and behold</li>

            <li> I agree with the other comment - this product is very watery and probably won&#x27;t do much for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and moisturized without weighing it down...</li>
            <li> I dn&#x27;t think it is actually doing anything to my hair but making it look like I just washed it (wet result)</li>
            <li> Keep away from sulfates in shampoos, they are the #1 crime for dry hair</li>
            <li> , it does have a pretty thin consistency like others mentioned but it works because it is easier to put on my hair when I have my single braids.</li>
            <li> I only had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Some products do not give instant gratification and you will see results after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It has protein and other ingredients that&#x27;s beneficial to your hair.</li>
            <li> Its watery because it IS water based you probably are just not used to it like the other customer was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the issue for you and the other customer</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the hair but makes it a little wet.</li>
            <li> After the spray, I put a little bit in my palms and massage in</li>
            <li> I come every few months and buy five bottles and stock up.</li>
            <li> When I come thru my hair ,very little hair is in the comb.  </li>
            <li> I usually did this before bed and then tie my scarf</li>
            <li> half of it gets lost in the drain, and is not good for my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> The ingredients on this lotion wasnt really bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty watery product. I dn&#x27;t think it is actually doing anything to my hair but making it look like I just washed it (wet result)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and I really like it, it does have a pretty thin consistency like others mentioned but it works because it is easier to put on my hair when I have my single braids. I live in braids so like most people, I had lost a good part of my front hair, so I started to use this product, I will apply a little bit on the front and edges of my head (or where hair used to be) and then spray African Royale BRX Braid &amp; Extensions Sheen Spray. After the spray, I put a little bit in my palms and massage in (I do this after the spray because I want to massage both the spray and moisturizer in at the same time). I usually did this before bed and then tie my scarf and I have front hair again! It did help my hair grow and helps moisturize my hair and braids. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The only products that helps hydrate my hair.. It is a bit watery, but that&#x27;s why it works for me.. I would have given it a 5star rating, but the cost is a bit high for the amount of product you get!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other comment - this product is very watery and probably won&#x27;t do much for thick hair.  I did not purchase mine at Amazon but at a local chain store.  Will not buy again.  I do use the super gro in the jar and have seen some growth, that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The consistency is almost that of water. half of it gets lost in the drain, and is not good for my really thick hair. Also. If applied after washing and conditioning my hair, and if left in, it will leave product flakes in my hair. I prefer elasta qp.     ALSO  if you see a picture of 2 bottles, it is misleading. You are only getting the daily lotion......</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair grow so fast. I saw results in a week!</li>
            <li> not a bad product it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair that soft, I had to keep putting more on often then usual. I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t order this again ...</li>
            <li> it smells good,and so far its ok</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very good.  When I come thru my hair ,very little hair is in the comb.  An excellent product.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It took a while for it to come but it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> My son uses this for moisturizer. He likes it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products for dry, curly hair.  I used to use a mixture of Infusium/Pink oil.  This is a lighter product that does an incredible job by knocking out the frizz and leaving my hair soft, curly and controlled.</li>
            <li> Very great product leaves hair and body soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This hair cream is good for all hair types, and definitely works. My salon lady was amazed at how quickly my hair grew! It moisturizes the hair, without leaving it too greasy. I have curly hair, but recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Yes this product has a watery consistency,.however it leaves my hair soft and moisturized without weighing it down...it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair my 20 years old daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this product locally. I did not find it anymore. I came to Amazon, and I buy it here. I come every few months and buy five bottles and stock up. This product works well for me. It has helped my hair grow a lot, and I like how when you comb your hair, it keeps your hair in place all day. The only downside is the greasiness. It is worth it though.</li>
            <li> Great for my natural 4c hair! Its light yet moisturizing. Don&#x27;t have much else to say...the smell is not my favorite but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it. It is just so hard to find it available in the stores here, so I thought gosh let me check our My Amazon, and low and behold it was there and at a great price.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002ABMM5S Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Olive Oil Growth Lotion]] Great product for hair. I love Organic Olive Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I use all of them. It makes your hair feel soft and manageable. This particular product is great but it&#x27;s best used when you wash your hair. It moisturizes the hair but makes it a little wet. Overall, It&#x27;s a great product. It has protein and other ingredients that&#x27;s beneficial to your hair. I only had it for a few weeks so I will have to get back to you on the results. However, I do recommend you try it. [...]</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer, I have used that leaves my hair soft long after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Its watery because it IS water based you probably are just not used to it like the other customer was. I also bought it at a market and not on here but its been a wonderful product. Ive been natural for a few years and have now just started researching natural products. The ingredients on this lotion wasnt really bad so I took it. Because it is watery I found it helped keep my hair hydrated most of the day (like your body your hair thrives with alot of water) and did an excellent job for growth. My hair already grows pretty fast but when using this product I had 3 INCHES of growth in a MONTH. I have think curly hair and this product was everything I didnt expect it to be, positively of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the issue for you and the other customer it didnt help much with isnt really the product itself but the state of your hair.
