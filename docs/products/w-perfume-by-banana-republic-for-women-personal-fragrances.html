            <li>It is fresh and fragrant!  </li>
            <li>Love the light scent and much cheaper on Amazon then retail store.</li>
            <li>But not TOO sweet.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SOFT, LIGHT SCENT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and crisp.</li>

            <li> I WAS CRUSHED WHEN IT WAS DISCONTINUED</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all I needed to confirm that this has been watered down.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little spice to it, too.  </li>
            <li> This scent was introduced to me by my mother on one of her few visits to the South.  </li>
            <li> You can barely detect the fragrance when applied and that which you do apply is just useless.  </li>
            <li> BUT YET THEY ARE NOT TOP SELLERS.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it was watered down or worse yet, just water.  </li>
            <li> BUT AT LEAST I CAN FIND THEM ON-LINE.</li>
            <li> I am extremely, extremely disappointed and the bottle is just taking up space on the dresser because I will not waste the atmosphere with this useless product... to say the least.</li>
            <li> the packaging looked pristine which gave me the false hope that it was legitimate.  </li>
            <li> REALLY SAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if it was a splash on since the fragrance was so faint.</li>
            <li> Whatever happened to authenticity... :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the scent but not in the service.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love using this perfume and to discover that Amazon offers awesome price for it is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED \\&quot;W\\&quot; FROM BANANA REPUBLIC FOR YEARS.  I LOVE THE SOFT, LIGHT SCENT.  I WAS CRUSHED WHEN IT WAS DISCONTINUED AND I BOUGHT OVER 10 BOTTLES WHEN IT WAS FIRST DISCONTINUED.  I ONLY HAD ONE BOTTLE LEFT AND THOUGHT I WOULD CHECK ON-LINE AND THERE IT WAS.  I WAS SO HAPPY BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO BE WITHOUT IT.  \\&quot;W\\&quot; AND \\&quot;LOVELY\\&quot; BY SARAH JESSICA PARKER ARE THE ONLY TWO SCENTS I WEAR.  IT&#x27;S AMAZING THAT I ALWAYS RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS FROM BOTH WOMEN AND MEN WHEN I&#x27;M WEARING IT SO I&#x27;M SURPRISED \\&quot;W\\&quot; WAS DISCONTINUED AND THAT \\&quot;LOVELY\\&quot; IS NOT MARKETED MORE BY SARAH JESSICA PARKER.  HOW COULD SO MANY PEOPLE STOP ME, COMMENT ABOUT IT OR ASK ME WHAT I AM WEARING BUT YET THEY ARE NOT TOP SELLERS.  REALLY SAD BUT AT LEAST I CAN FIND THEM ON-LINE.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and much cheaper on Amazon then retail store. I always get complements when wearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume without having even smelled it.  It is fresh and fragrant!  I highly recommend this if you need a good summer perfume!</li>
            <li> for the price and size you cant beat a better offer. I first got this as a gift awhile ago and when i finished it, i decided i wanted to get another one. this one was so cheap and i just love the smell. i am  definately buying more</li>
            <li> I would recommend this fragrance to everyone. I was very pleased with my order, and, it arrived on time! It deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this fragrance before and this one did not match up. It&#x27;s as if it was a splash on since the fragrance was so faint. Amazon took care of this problem</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I believe that it was watered down or worse yet, just water.  the packaging looked pristine which gave me the false hope that it was legitimate.  You can barely detect the fragrance when applied and that which you do apply is just useless.  I am extremely, extremely disappointed and the bottle is just taking up space on the dresser because I will not waste the atmosphere with this useless product... to say the least.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent! Wearing it makes me feel so good and fresh all day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now.  It has become one of my favorites ever since! Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product Banana Republic by Banana Republic 4.2 oz Spray is not the same as what i previously ordered it obviously has to much alcohol in it and it does have the same refreshing all day fragrance. I will not purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the customers. I received this perfume as a graduation gift...ran out and decided to buy another one because I LOVED the scent! The first sniff and that&#x27;s all I needed to confirm that this has been watered down. Very disappointed. Whatever happened to authenticity... :(</li>
            <li> Love it only thing is doesn&#x27;t come wrapped in plastic</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it&#x27;s a light floral that&#x27;s just right for everyday. I used the fragrance since it was launched and I know I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance. I will wear nothing else. It&#x27;s clean and crisp. Not overpowering. Love it.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what I ordered, no troubles</li>
            <li> This scent was introduced to me by my mother on one of her few visits to the South.  We went to the local Banana Republic and got some for me, as I thought that it was a really nice scent.  It&#x27;s light, sexy, and sweet.  But not TOO sweet.  There&#x27;s a little spice to it, too.  Yummy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it use to.  I was disappointed in the scent but not in the service.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!!! Great price too :)</li>
