            <li>Looks nice too.</li>

            <li>Its really a shame because it was flawless for so many years.  </li>
            <li>this was a very good sunless tanning lotion, went on really well with no streaks, not the darkest i have used but still noticeable.</li>

            <li>There are just too many chemicals in it though.  </li>
            <li>A much better tanner to try is also found here on amazon, &#x27;Carribean Solutions Beach Colours Self Tanner&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>This is No. 1 on my list for sunless tanning, my skin is so soft after using it and the color is amazing, great product.</li>

            <li>And a great natural color.</li>
            <li>All listed have their pros and cons, but in my opinion, Alba is a superior product and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>and I have a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply evenly, smells good for a self-tanning lotion, and color is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Cannot fathom so many good reviews, and I really gave the product a good try several times.  </li>

            <li>seed oilÂ¹, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li>Nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I find it to have the most pleasant small of all tanners I have tried.</li>
            <li>This product works particularly well the first application, but doesn&#x27;t produce as good a color with subsequent applications on top of the first.  </li>
            <li>Alba sunless golden tanning cream is scentless, mositurizes my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better price, better ingredients, and work better than more expensive name brands.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised there was no odor as most sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite of all the tanners I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>favorite home self tanner by far</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it is worth a shot if you use sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face and also for my arms and my legs and when you compare the color change to your original skin color, that&#x27;s when you realize that it really worked.</li>
            <li>Glides right on doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>Here are the ingredients in the Alba Sunless very emollient sunless tanner; its a step up from some tanners, but just not as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can easily apply a light coating each day to keep the same intensity.  </li>
            <li>Works great and best of all this is one of only two self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried that does not leave a bad smell.</li>
            <li>Mild smell, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I was even able to apply it to my body (without gloves or a mitt) without it staining my hands before I washed them.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits: natural tan, soft skin, NO SCENT!!, easy to apply, no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>It looks like you have a real tan without the sun!  </li>
            <li>I love this product--- totally natural color and no icky smell -- I think I even prefer this to my spray tan salon</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing a self tanner of this brand.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you apply it right before bed or really scrub your skin after a shower, it could come off.</li>
            <li>A little leaning if you apply too much but otherwise good.</li>
            <li>love this, all year long</li>
            <li>the first day, no issues; the 2nd day, some tingling; by the 3rd time, I had full-fledged cold-burning sensation and itching.</li>
            <li>Absorbs in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>(they thought it was  real tan)</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emollient?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very emollient  </li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty good which is surprising since most of these sunless tanning lotions really smell horrible.  </li>
            <li>I did like the smell better than other self tanners</li>
            <li>This one gave me barely any streaking and lasted a couple of days, same as most.  </li>
            <li>I use this every few days mixed with my daily face moisturizer on my face and hands, and it gives me the perfect amount of color and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally fair complexion and I have tried almost every sunless tanning product on the market from the most expensive to the most affordable and this product takes the cake- seriously.</li>
            <li>There are better, less chemical products out there.</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by my friends.</li>
            <li>It also becomes sticky in humidity (moreso than normal bronzing creams).</li>
            <li>seemed to last for a few days and faded evenly, also i liked the color it produced not an orange.</li>
            <li>very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Gradual development of the tint looks very natural and even.</li>
            <li>much cleaner and actually leaves a much prettier, and still natural looking color.  </li>
            <li>i was doubtful at first, but this turned out to be a very good buy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t aim for &#x27;just back from Brazil&#x27; dark sunless tanners, because it&#x27;s just too many problems with streaking.</li>
            <li>and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>My coloring is pale/pink and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to others for a natural sunless tan.</li>
            <li>An example of natural &#x3D; doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Also the fact that it is  basically a natural product is a plus for me</li>
            <li>It never really dried, and rubbed off everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping with the natural  ingredients it would work.  </li>
            <li>No streaking  Takes a long time to dry enough to put on light colored clothing</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to use it every day or every other day to keep your color consistent.</li>
            <li>But be careful of too much on knees, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li>Going to try bare minerals self tanner.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to all the regular tanning products and this did not hurt my skin at all.</li>
            <li>: the lotion is a bit thicker so it generally takes about 30 mins to dry or soak into your skin completely after your apply it, but who doesn&#x27;t have 30 mins to pamper themselves?</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and texture of these bronzing cream, but it tends to transfer to clothing pretty badly.  </li>

            <li> I use this every few days mixed with my daily face moisturizer on my face and hands, and it gives me the perfect amount of color and looks really natural.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally fair complexion and I have tried almost every sunless tanning product on the market from the most expensive to the most affordable and this product takes the cake- seriously.</li>
            <li> There are better, less chemical products out there.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my friends.</li>
            <li> It also becomes sticky in humidity (moreso than normal bronzing creams).</li>
            <li> seemed to last for a few days and faded evenly, also i liked the color it produced not an orange.</li>
            <li> very natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Gradual development of the tint looks very natural and even.</li>
            <li> much cleaner and actually leaves a much prettier, and still natural looking color.  </li>
            <li> i was doubtful at first, but this turned out to be a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t aim for &#x27;just back from Brazil&#x27; dark sunless tanners, because it&#x27;s just too many problems with streaking.</li>
            <li> and it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> My coloring is pale/pink and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to others for a natural sunless tan.</li>
            <li> An example of natural &#x3D; doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Also the fact that it is  basically a natural product is a plus for me</li>
            <li> It never really dried, and rubbed off everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping with the natural  ingredients it would work.  </li>
            <li> No streaking  Takes a long time to dry enough to put on light colored clothing</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to use it every day or every other day to keep your color consistent.</li>
            <li> But be careful of too much on knees, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> Going to try bare minerals self tanner.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to all the regular tanning products and this did not hurt my skin at all.</li>
            <li> : the lotion is a bit thicker so it generally takes about 30 mins to dry or soak into your skin completely after your apply it, but who doesn&#x27;t have 30 mins to pamper themselves?</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and texture of these bronzing cream, but it tends to transfer to clothing pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> I wouldve hoped they would at least write \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; or something on the new bottles</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, 1 week or so.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much, a little goes a long way and it did leave me with decent color.  </li>
            <li> have tried Clarins, St. Tropez (foam and cream), Clinique, Bare Essentials (bare minerals brand), and Tan Towels --- slightly obsessed right?</li>
            <li> I applied daily for a few days and just felt a major confidence boost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last two years, usually as spring approaches and I want to give myself a natural looking tan without the harmful effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> It dried non-greasy, almost powdery feeling and didn&#x27;t rub off like other self tanners that generally have a greasy feel and never really dry.  </li>
            <li> got here promptly, works as well as other similar products.</li>
            <li> I heard if you use baby powder after you are dry that it will prevent that from happening.</li>
            <li> The bottle recommends letting it dry for 15 min before getting dressed</li>
            <li> uhh I can not live without this sunless lotion.</li>
            <li> Does come off a little bit on my shirt but not too bad.would definitely recommend !!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, but a little comes off on the bath wrap I wear while applying the lotion simply because it comes into contact with the lotion during that time.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the bottle should come in a bigger size.....</li>
            <li> Not a nice or natural looking gradual tanner.  </li>
            <li> expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> , just be careful when rubbing it in as you should be with all self tanners</li>
            <li> The other self tanning product I gave the same duplicate review due to the fact that one of them tends to add a little orange tint.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It had none of that awful smell that some other products which give a sunless tan have and gave a good tan.  </li>
            <li> Be careful on areas like knees and ankles - it can hang up and leave dark spots!</li>
            <li> The only negative is it stains your hands.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I purchased it from puritan pride, as I usually do and the formula was vastly different.  </li>
            <li> I use about half lotion and half self tanner which help avoid steaks.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something new, unfortunately this product let me down.</li>
            <li> It does rub off on your under clothes a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s the norm with other products of this type.</li>
            <li> It takes a few applications to achieve my desired color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but it helps with the winter blahs that strike around this time every year in the northeast.</li>
            <li> Does not have an offensive smell that used to prevent me from using self tanning products in the past.</li>
            <li> but I usually end up waiting 30 min by the time I finish styling my hair and getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Too bad, i had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re always shocked to find that it&#x27;s a tanning lotion I only apply twice a week!</li>
            <li> so I just ordered from Amazon because I got tired of driving from store to store looking for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them all from expensive brands to over the counter.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hello fellow tan-in-a-can lover! Lets be honest, white pasty skin isn&#x27;t attractive, but neither is skin cancer or wrinkles. I have a naturally fair complexion and I have tried almost every sunless tanning product on the market from the most expensive to the most affordable and this product takes the cake- seriously. Alba sunless golden tanning cream is scentless, mositurizes my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Clarins, St. Tropez (foam and cream), Clinique, Bare Essentials (bare minerals brand), and Tan Towels --- slightly obsessed right? All listed have their pros and cons, but in my opinion, Alba is a superior product and is very affordable. I was even able to apply it to my body (without gloves or a mitt) without it staining my hands before I washed them.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits: natural tan, soft skin, NO SCENT!!, easy to apply, no harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the lotion is a bit thicker so it generally takes about 30 mins to dry or soak into your skin completely after your apply it, but who doesn&#x27;t have 30 mins to pamper themselves?</li>
            <li> This does no leave you yellow or orange - it does as it says it will and tan will stay on several days.  You can easily apply a light coating each day to keep the same intensity.  Better price, better ingredients, and work better than more expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought two products similar in function to one another at the same time. The other self tanning product I gave the same duplicate review due to the fact that one of them tends to add a little orange tint. I cannot determine which one as I rotate their applications. Still, all in all they exceed the quality of most self tanning products sold in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Regular self tanners break me out but I can use this without any issues at all.  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t streak.  Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and it looks so natural. Love!</li>
            <li> My favorite sunless tanning lotion! Mild smell, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this lotion. Easy to apply in a few minutes. Glides right on doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or oily. Absorbs in a reasonable amount of time. very natural looking color. It takes a few applications to achieve my desired color. I&#x27;m very fair skinned with red hair. I applied daily for a few days and just felt a major confidence boost. I will use it all summer. I love it!!!! I&#x27;ve tried many other sunless tanning projects and spa treatments and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works pretty well! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few days and I have a nice golden tan. It actually smells pretty good which is surprising since most of these sunless tanning lotions really smell horrible.  The only negative is it stains your hands.  I washed my hand immediately after applying it and they&#x27;re still stained.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great product. It gives you a nice golden tan, smells nice and is all natural.  I will definitely be ordering it from Amazon again.  Oh yeah, for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores so I just ordered from Amazon because I got tired of driving from store to store looking for it.</li>
            <li> this was a very good sunless tanning lotion, went on really well with no streaks, not the darkest i have used but still noticeable. has a pleasant smell also. seemed to last for a few days and faded evenly, also i liked the color it produced not an orange.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...the first day, no issues; the 2nd day, some tingling; by the 3rd time, I had full-fledged cold-burning sensation and itching. Too bad, i had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I found a recommendation in a magazine.  It had none of that awful smell that some other products which give a sunless tan have and gave a good tan.  expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I believe I have tried almost every sunless tanning cream under the sun.  My coloring is pale/pink and my skin is sensitive.  I tried this lotion before swearing off chemicals as much as possible.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin too much, a little goes a long way and it did leave me with decent color.  I don&#x27;t aim for &#x27;just back from Brazil&#x27; dark sunless tanners, because it&#x27;s just too many problems with streaking. This one gave me barely any streaking and lasted a couple of days, same as most.  There are just too many chemicals in it though.  I have added the list of ingredients at the end of this review.  A much better tanner to try is also found here on amazon, &#x27;Carribean Solutions Beach Colours Self Tanner&amp;#34;.  Its  comparable in cost, much cleaner and actually leaves a much prettier, and still natural looking color.  Here are the ingredients in the Alba Sunless very emollient sunless tanner; its a step up from some tanners, but just not as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua (water), dihydroxyacetone, glyceryl stearate SE, C12-15 alkylbenzoate, carthamus tintorius (safflower) seed oilÂ¹, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, dimethicone, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, stearic acid, ceteareth-20, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), calendula officinalis flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, echinacea angustifolia extract, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, citric acid, erythrulose, isopropyl palmitate, lactic acid, retinyl palmitate, sodium citrate, steareth-20, tocopherol, xanthan gum, benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, butylphenyl methylpropional, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, limonene, linalool, fragrance (parfum).&lt;br /&gt;Â¹Certified Organic Ingredient.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have a number of issues with itching caused by self tanners. No issue here.  I use about half lotion and half self tanner which help avoid steaks.  Tan lasts 3-5 days.  Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I noticed a tan starting to appear within 30 minutes and I was pleasantly surprised there was no odor as most sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and this sunless tanning lotion. It is by far my favorite of all the tanners I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I like! A little leaning if you apply too much but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is all natural and works with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It looks like you have a real tan without the sun!  There is no streaking or orange skin color look. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> A bit more streaky than others I&#x27;ve had, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I receive compliments on my suntan, I tell them what I use . (they thought it was  real tan) So They ask the brand name  , I say Alba.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite tanning products does leave you orange. The item Shipped very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use it every day or every other day to keep your color consistent.</li>
            <li> I like this and will continue to use it, just be careful when rubbing it in as you should be with all self tanners</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my friends. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am happy with it. I would recommend it to others for a natural sunless tan.</li>
            <li> got here promptly, works as well as other similar products.</li>
            <li> Love this product and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product--- totally natural color and no icky smell -- I think I even prefer this to my spray tan salon --my favorite home self tanner by far</li>
            <li> This is a great self-tanning product - it does not look orange like many others. But be careful of too much on knees, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner. It is so rich and has a very pleasant smell to it. I bought it for my niece to use instead of tanning for prom and she looked fabulous! Nice natural glow. It does rub off on your under clothes a little bit. I heard if you use baby powder after you are dry that it will prevent that from happening. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it is worth a shot if you use sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> This product smells delicious and feels like I am putting lotion on, not self tanner. I put on at night before bed and wake up with a nice healthy glow! My husband loves the smell too! Does come off a little bit on my shirt but not too bad.would definitely recommend !! Only complaint is the bottle should come in a bigger size..... I haven&#x27;t done the research though so it might.</li>
            <li> love this, all year long</li>
            <li> Easy to apply evenly, smells good for a self-tanning lotion, and color is very natural looking.  Moisturizes skin too.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a &amp;#34;natural food store&amp;#34; and figured this is a safe,  healthy brand &amp; product.  Upon further research it&#x27;s rated a 7 out of 10 of unsafe cosmetic products on independent product safety websites. Research for yourself.  There are better, less chemical products out there.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and texture of these bronzing cream, but it tends to transfer to clothing pretty badly.  It also becomes sticky in humidity (moreso than normal bronzing creams).</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! It smells like peaches, I even put it on my face. It&#x27;s a super-rich cream that goes on smoothly. I&#x27;ll be ditching those unnatural tanners...they stink!</li>
            <li> I have white skin and don&#x27;t tan well so when the warm weather arrives and I want some color this product has worked fantastic! If I know I have a special event that I want to look great at I start to use it 2-3 days prior and by the time the event arrives I have a nice color to my arms &amp; legs. I&#x27;ve tried many other products but this one is the best plus it&#x27;s safe on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something new, unfortunately this product let me down. This self tanner dose not work, developing into no color at all.</li>
            <li> I am very white and this didn&#x27;t change the color of my skin at all. An example of natural &#x3D; doesn&#x27;t work. I did like the smell better than other self tanners but since it didn&#x27;t work that didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I use this every few days mixed with my daily face moisturizer on my face and hands, and it gives me the perfect amount of color and looks really natural. I also love that it&#x27;s cruelty-free. I&#x27;m not sure why, but it helps with the winter blahs that strike around this time every year in the northeast. I will always have some in stock.</li>
            <li> Works great and best of all this is one of only two self-tanners I&#x27;ve tried that does not leave a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gradual development of the tint looks very natural and even. Does not have an offensive smell that used to prevent me from using self tanning products in the past.</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is excellent. It&#x27;s the best self tab cream I have ever used. It does not stink after it starts to turn. It&#x27;s very emollient? And a great natural color. Not orange!  I&#x27;ve used them all from expensive brands to over the counter. This is a great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Fantastic color and smells great!!  Be careful on areas like knees and ankles - it can hang up and leave dark spots!</li>
            <li> Product seems just fine.  Smells pleasant.  Also the fact that it is  basically a natural product is a plus for me</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing a self tanner of this brand. i was doubtful at first, but this turned out to be a very good buy. Infact i&#x27;m on my way to ordering another one. It is very creamy therefore you really don&#x27;t need so much to apply but the color comes out beautiful. I use it for my face and also for my arms and my legs and when you compare the color change to your original skin color, that&#x27;s when you realize that it really worked. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is No. 1 on my list for sunless tanning, my skin is so soft after using it and the color is amazing, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last two years, usually as spring approaches and I want to give myself a natural looking tan without the harmful effects of the sun. The Alba self tanning lotion goes on smoothly and dries quickly. The bottle recommends letting it dry for 15 min before getting dressed but I usually end up waiting 30 min by the time I finish styling my hair and getting dressed. I use the lotion about twice a week - it actually gets darker the next day so I don&#x27;t need to reapply. It doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothes, but a little comes off on the bath wrap I wear while applying the lotion simply because it comes into contact with the lotion during that time. I&#x27;ve never found that it comes off on my sheets or even my bath towel. I suppose if you apply it right before bed or really scrub your skin after a shower, it could come off. But this has never happened to me. I&#x27;ve had several friends ask me if I went to a tanning salon and they&#x27;re always shocked to find that it&#x27;s a tanning lotion I only apply twice a week! The smell is nice and it leaves my skin feeling soft. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and was very very happy with it.  It dried non-greasy, almost powdery feeling and didn&#x27;t rub off like other self tanners that generally have a greasy feel and never really dry.  A few months ago, I purchased it from puritan pride, as I usually do and the formula was vastly different.  It never really dried, and rubbed off everywhere.  I ordered it from this site afterwards in hopes that puritan pride had screwed up, however, when I received this in the mail, it was the same greasy formula.  Its really a shame because it was flawless for so many years.  I wouldve hoped they would at least write \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; or something on the new bottles so I didnt end up wasting my money.  Going to try bare minerals self tanner.  I hear its great.</li>
            <li> This works great, doesn&#x27;t streak, color is brown not red. My skin is sensitive to all the regular tanning products and this did not hurt my skin at all. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last too long, 1 week or so. Not sure if that&#x27;s the norm with other products of this type. But overall, great buy!</li>
            <li> uhh I can not live without this sunless lotion. best thing ever. I love it</li>
            <li> Great product  Very emollient  No streaking  Takes a long time to dry enough to put on light colored clothing</li>
            <li> .. and streaky.  Cannot fathom so many good reviews, and I really gave the product a good try several times.  Not a nice or natural looking gradual tanner.  Wish I had returned instead of retrying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used. I recommend to anyone that wants a great tan with out the sun:)</li>
            <li> Well, here we go again, another sunless tanning lotion that I break out in a rash.  Very disappointed.  I was hoping with the natural  ingredients it would work.  No such luck!</li>
            <li> This product works particularly well the first application, but doesn&#x27;t produce as good a color with subsequent applications on top of the first.  Recommend after two applications, scrub skin and the apply.  I find it to have the most pleasant small of all tanners I have tried.</li>
