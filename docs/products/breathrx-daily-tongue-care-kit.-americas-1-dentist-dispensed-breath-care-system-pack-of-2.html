    <ol>
            <li>I was so impressed</li>
            <li>My husband was so impressed that he now uses it too.</li>
            <li>Works excellent!</li>
            <li>This stuff is a bit pricey but the best!</li>
            <li>Best price here, then</li>
            <li>This is the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with this... did wonders for my breath.  </li>
            <li>What I like best about this kit though are the tongue scrapers.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li>This probably wasn&#x27;t a great idea.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great breath cleanser. . .</li>
            <li>and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>how great your mouth feels the morning after</li>
            <li>It works really great</li>
            <li>This BreathRx spray and the scrapers it comes with are very effective.</li>
            <li>Pleasant tasting.  </li>
            <li>My dentist sent me home with one of these flexible tongue cleaners, and I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a plunge, and I am very glad that I did.    </li>
            <li>Love this product-I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li>So glad they carry it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how gunky</li>
            <li>-18.&lt;br /&gt;It made my breath smell nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kind of turned a bit OCD with it -</li>
            <li>They spray will even conquer garlic and onion breath...highly effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use every morning and evening after brushing your teeth and for a quick breath lift any time during the day.</li>
            <li>This spray works 100X better than just trying to brush your tongue.</li>
            <li>you use this spray and the included scraper (I also love the scraper)</li>
            <li>Love my tongue spray.  </li>
            <li>I love this product would recommend it</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I like orabrush&#x27;s brush better than the saw design.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>A fair warning: the first time you scrape, what you see come off your tongue may be frightening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is pretty good at removing that stuff and you/others will notice it in your breath.</li>
            <li>Needed somethign more efficient and the smooth ones at the store weren&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li>They alone are worth the price of the kit because they are so effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product, works great, and really gets my tongue clean.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li>The tongue care kit is very easy to use and does help to enhance a fresh breath.</li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference for me.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really noticed a difference by using this product.</li>
            <li>Since I could not find this locally, it was great to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this spray because it really works for me!</li>
            <li>I bring this spray and a toothbrush to use during the flights to keep my mouth clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how clean you think your mouth is after you brush.  </li>
            <li>Now there is barely any gunk, and I am confident that BreathRx will be able to get rid of it all.    </li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either, I&#x27;ve been using the spray for a week and you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any</li>
            <li>and I have had fresh clean breath ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s mild taste, it works though.</li>
            <li>The mouth spray is strong but works very well.</li>
            <li>I think this type of scraper works best, and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>But it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth kissing fresh.  </li>
            <li>I probably have more bitter receptors than most people, so the taste may be acceptable to you.</li>
            <li>Cleans your tongue and your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>However, other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li>I recently started taking a long-term antibiotic which had effectively killed many of the good bacteria in my mouth, which left an off-white sludge on my tongue that I couldn&#x27;t effectively get rid of.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different tongue scrapers and zinc-based tongue sprays and gels, and this and the Tung brush and gel are in my view the best.</li>
            <li>But in reality, my husband had on more than one occasion commented on my breath situation, even right after I have flossed, brushed, and rinsed with mouthwash!</li>
            <li>Good item please tell BreathRx to put the item in refill size I have 12 little spray bottles waiting to be refilled</li>
            <li>Since the concentration is only a bit stronger than the mouthwash, better to swish with the mouthwash and use the tongue scraper</li>
            <li>First time using a tongue cleaner and now will never stop.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years first by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Overall the product is OK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>Love the BreathRx Daily Tongue Care Kit, been using it since it came out.</li>
            <li>It is pretty gross, but it&#x27;s better than staying in there all day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The spray not only helps freshen my breath, but I really do think it helps get more sludge off of my tongue when I use it compared to scraping alone.</li>
            <li>After using this product just once, you will wonder how you went your whole life without it.</li>
            <li>Your breath is fresher and cleaner much, much longer than trying to brush your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this spray to everyone!</li>
            <li>Would be easier if it was just a straight stick to hold...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help for me.</li>
            <li>It grosses me out to think how much reside I would carry around on my tongue if I didn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the blue color aesthetically, but I can see how it&#x27;d be better if it were just clear or something and didn&#x27;t stain your tongue.</li>
            <li>but I wish they would go a little more natural and get rid of the very strong blue dye in the mixture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that I really find that gets my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought the kit mainly for the scrapers.</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast with Amazon Prime, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much stuff is on your tongue.</li>
            <li>The product is decent BUT after a while of being in the bathroom cabinet, the spray button STOPS WORKING (happened to both containers).</li>
            <li>I was given the white tongue scraper at my dentist&#x27;s office years ago and wanted a new one as well as one for my girlfriend (who thought it was cool).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>More sludge came off, but not anywhere near as much, and it caused a bit of irritation that lasted a few hours after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps get rid of white coat on tounge&lt;br /&gt;Spray makes mouth feel fresh</li>
            <li>Would rather use a normal tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for two and comes with the softer (blue) scraper too just in case the white is too rough for you (though it does have two sides, soft &amp; regular, already).</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>when compared to the other full bottle included.</li>
            <li>After using this you&#x27;ll never NOT use it - brushing alone feels like only doing half the job any more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had a bit of a white coat on my tounge no matter how much I scrub it with my brush.</li>
            <li>Felt like it was too much work for the same results that I would get from just using regular mouth wash.</li>
            <li>product is great for eliminating germs that cause bad breath</li>
            <li>A great product to prevent bad breath</li>
            <li>I sprayed 2 sprays on my tongue, as far back as I could, per the directions.</li>
            <li>I originally bought a 2 pack from my dentist office a few years back and as simple as the design is</li>
            <li>and I noticed a white buildup on the back of my tongue near my throat.  </li>
            <li>The spray just tastes like any normal breath spray: a strong artificial mint flavor, but surprisingly no burning (I was half expecting some kind of burning or tinging sensation).</li>

            <li> The tongue cleaners were rough and at times I would wonder if I was damaging the upper layer of my tongue.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use the spray, but when sprayed on the back of my tongue as directed, the taste is so bitter that I gag.</li>
            <li> It would go down, but nothing comes out even though there is plenty left.  </li>
            <li> there was a container for the tounge scrubs, there&#x27;s not a really sanitary place to keep it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of discussing stuff coming out of my tongue as other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> After using this for the last few weeks it is gone!</li>
            <li> If husband don&#x27;t use it and uses other, it don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these - seriously!  </li>
            <li> but I feel like I have dry mouth after I used this product, not sure why.</li>
            <li> This is the only tongue spray that really get&#x27;s the plaque off your tongue &amp; get&#x27;s rid of bad breath.</li>
            <li> I feel like my breath is fresher throughout the course of the day, and morning breath is indescribably MUCH less offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The BreathRx spray and plastic scrapers are, however, a little neater than the Tung products, and so are my preferred choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was from my dentist for bad breath.</li>
            <li> , my breath is getting fresher, and my tongue has gotten used to the scraping so that there is no more irritation.</li>
            <li> If you have a small buildup on your tongue</li>
            <li> I was not able to find them again until I found them on Amazon.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently started taking a long-term antibiotic which had effectively killed many of the good bacteria in my mouth, which left an off-white sludge on my tongue that I couldn&#x27;t effectively get rid of. My dentist said not to worry about it, other than possibly increased bad breath, and that it would go away after taking the medicine. I didn&#x27;t have the patience, and started using a tongue scraper. Disappointingly, the tongue scraper alone did little but irritate my tongue. I was about to give up, until I saw this kit (2 oz spray and two scrapers) on sale for $7 at a local store. I decided to take a plunge, and I am very glad that I did.    I sprayed 2 sprays on my tongue, as far back as I could, per the directions. The spray just tastes like any normal breath spray: a strong artificial mint flavor, but surprisingly no burning (I was half expecting some kind of burning or tinging sensation). Despite it&#x27;s mild taste, it works though. One pass of the scraper, and a thick, nasty sludge easily came off of my tongue and into the sink. WOW! I was so impressed, I did it another time. This probably wasn&#x27;t a great idea. More sludge came off, but not anywhere near as much, and it caused a bit of irritation that lasted a few hours after. But it was worth it. There was probably only 30% of the gunk that was there before.     I have only been using it for about a week, but each day my tongue is getting cleaner, my breath is getting fresher, and my tongue has gotten used to the scraping so that there is no more irritation. Now there is barely any gunk, and I am confident that BreathRx will be able to get rid of it all.    It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really noticed a difference by using this product. The tongue cleaners were rough and at times I would wonder if I was damaging the upper layer of my tongue. I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of discussing stuff coming out of my tongue as other reviews stated. I bought the two bottles and only used one. Felt like it was too much work for the same results that I would get from just using regular mouth wash.</li>
            <li> The title may be a bit of an overstatement. But in reality, my husband had on more than one occasion commented on my breath situation, even right after I have flossed, brushed, and rinsed with mouthwash! Thank goodness I found BreathRx. I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it. I feel like my breath is fresher throughout the course of the day, and morning breath is indescribably MUCH less offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray not only helps freshen my breath, but I really do think it helps get more sludge off of my tongue when I use it compared to scraping alone. A fair warning: the first time you scrape, what you see come off your tongue may be frightening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this was a Subscribe and Save product because the BreathRx Tongue Care Kit will be a permanent part of my oral care from now on. My husband was so impressed that he now uses it too.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder.  Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> After using this product just once, you will wonder how you went your whole life without it. Seeing the gunk come off of your tongue is an eye-opener. This has become a part of my daily teeth-brushing routine. Using it before going to bed will decrease the offensiveness of morning breath by a LOT (of course, you still need to brush your teeth in the morning). Not a bad price either, I&#x27;ve been using the spray for a week and you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used any when compared to the other full bottle included. A+ product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores anymore, but Amazon always seems to have it in stock.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product, works great, and really gets my tongue clean.  It&#x27;s the only thing that I really find that gets my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> I was given the white tongue scraper at my dentist&#x27;s office years ago and wanted a new one as well as one for my girlfriend (who thought it was cool). I saw them for sale individually but the reviews were bad (shipped in a plastic baggy? Yuck). This is a great deal for two and comes with the softer (blue) scraper too just in case the white is too rough for you (though it does have two sides, soft &amp; regular, already). The mouth spray is strong but works very well. I actually really like the blue color aesthetically, but I can see how it&#x27;d be better if it were just clear or something and didn&#x27;t stain your tongue. Not a problem though.</li>
            <li> It is part of my daily oral hygienic care. I no longer need mouthwash… it just takes care of bad breath and other germs causing tartar, decay, etc.</li>
            <li> Great product. Although I don&#x27;t like the scraper they include, so I just use a different one.</li>
            <li> product is great for eliminating germs that cause bad breath&lt;br /&gt;from your tongue.  Pleasant tasting.  It&#x27;s amazing how gunky&lt;br /&gt;your tongue can get.  No wonder 80% of bad breath is caused&lt;br /&gt;by bacteria on tongue.  Go for this product.</li>
            <li> I was recovering from taking antibiotics for a while and I noticed a white buildup on the back of my tongue near my throat.  After using this for the last few weeks it is gone! The tongue scraper that comes with this set is hard to find anywhere else, the ones at the local grocery store section are terrible.  The spray that comes with this reminds me of the mouthwash from the dentist but it does not taste bad at all.  If you have a small buildup on your tongue I suggest you purchase this set.  Use it two times a day when you brush your teeth and just spray the liquid on and watch the gunk fall off!</li>
            <li> Great breath cleanser. . . But the last three sprayers I&#x27;ve bought have stopped working with several weeks.  Such a pricey product should be sturdier.  Since the concentration is only a bit stronger than the mouthwash, better to swish with the mouthwash and use the tongue scraper</li>
            <li> This BreathRx spray and the scrapers it comes with are very effective. If you&#x27;ve never used a tongue scraper, believe me, a toothbrush just won&#x27;t do the job. I have tried a few different tongue scrapers and zinc-based tongue sprays and gels, and this and the Tung brush and gel are in my view the best. The BreathRx spray and plastic scrapers are, however, a little neater than the Tung products, and so are my preferred choice.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth kissing fresh.  Recommended by my dental hygenist.  First time using a tongue cleaner and now will never stop.</li>
            <li> Works excellent! Love the clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while when I was 17-18.&lt;br /&gt;It made my breath smell nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this spray because it really works for me! It&#x27;s great to use every morning and evening after brushing your teeth and for a quick breath lift any time during the day. This spray works 100X better than just trying to brush your tongue. Your breath is fresher and cleaner much, much longer than trying to brush your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flavor and am not left with the &#x27;alcohol&#x27; sensation like with using a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this spray and the included scraper (I also love the scraper) you can see all the bacteria and gunk that&#x27;s on your tongue if you just ate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot internationally and am stuck on 16 hour flights. I bring this spray and a toothbrush to use during the flights to keep my mouth clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this spray to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought the kit mainly for the scrapers. I think this type of scraper works best, and they last a long time. Five stars for the scrapers! I have tried to use the spray, but when sprayed on the back of my tongue as directed, the taste is so bitter that I gag. Zero stars for the spray! I probably have more bitter receptors than most people, so the taste may be acceptable to you. I use the scraper after brushing, before mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have used this item before. The first one I received was from my dentist for bad breath. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Love my tongue spray.  Been using this for years first by my dentist.  I buy it here and save some $</li>
            <li> This is the only tongue spray that really get&#x27;s the plaque off your tongue &amp; get&#x27;s rid of bad breath. If husband don&#x27;t use it and uses other, it don&#x27;t work. Especially on bad breath. This stuff is a bit pricey but the best! Best price here, then any where&#x27;s else!</li>
            <li> Love this product-I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. It&#x27;s simple to use and it really works. I have not found another over-the-counter product that can match it.</li>
            <li> I love this product would recommend it</li>
            <li> Since I could not find this locally, it was great to find it on Amazon.  Have been using it for years and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best tongue scraper I&#x27;ve used. The sauce you spray in your mouth is alright too.. but I prefer brushing, scraping, then using listerine.</li>
            <li> Blame the glowing reviews on this product but this was one of those things that I thought I didn&#x27;t need but would try anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out I was no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Once you see what comes off your tongue every night and how great your mouth feels the morning after, you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t discover this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Good item please tell BreathRx to put the item in refill size I have 12 little spray bottles waiting to be refilled</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this to me. I&#x27;ve also had a bit of a white coat on my tounge no matter how much I scrub it with my brush. Needed somethign more efficient and the smooth ones at the store weren&#x27;t doing anything. This kit has teeth to get into the grooves of the tounge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Helps get rid of white coat on tounge&lt;br /&gt;Spray makes mouth feel fresh&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two types of tounge scrubs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a container for the tounge scrubs, there&#x27;s not a really sanitary place to keep it.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is OK but I feel like I have dry mouth after I used this product, not sure why.</li>
            <li> This item works okay. A little awkward to use the tongue scraper. Would be easier if it was just a straight stick to hold...</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast with Amazon Prime, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much stuff is on your tongue. This is pretty good at removing that stuff and you/others will notice it in your breath.</li>
            <li> It works really great I recommend it for everyone so anyone needing product for your mouth this is what you need.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for the tongue scrapers.  I originally bought a 2 pack from my dentist office a few years back and as simple as the design is, they don&#x27;t sell anything like this at the stores.  I was not able to find them again until I found them on Amazon.  So glad they carry it!  I sometimes use the spray too but the scrapers I use every time I brush.  It&#x27;s funny how clean you think your mouth is after you brush.  Even after a pre-rinse, brushing, and water-pik, you&#x27;ll be amazed at what you scrape off your tongue!  I cannot live without these - seriously!  I get all panicky when I have packed mine for a trip and cannot find it.  I&#x27;ve kind of turned a bit OCD with it - but that&#x27;s a good thing!  Everybody should get one and see the gunk that is left behind if you don&#x27;t scrape!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help for me. All it does is make my tongue blue and stain my teeth. Would rather use a normal tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> The product is decent BUT after a while of being in the bathroom cabinet, the spray button STOPS WORKING (happened to both containers).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with this... did wonders for my breath.  Only reason that it&#x27;s not 5 is that the spray button stopped working.  It would go down, but nothing comes out even though there is plenty left.  That stated about 3 weeks after I started to use it. I don&#x27;t want to have to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; the pump to make it work.  However, other than that I loved it. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I like orabrush&#x27;s brush better than the saw design. The mouthwash is the same ingredient as the tongue spray. Save the money.</li>
            <li> They spray will even conquer garlic and onion breath...highly effective.  What I like best about this kit though are the tongue scrapers.  They alone are worth the price of the kit because they are so effective.  It grosses me out to think how much reside I would carry around on my tongue if I didn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> The tongue care kit is very easy to use and does help to enhance a fresh breath. Its effectiveness is as described in the literature.</li>
            <li> Love the BreathRx Daily Tongue Care Kit, been using it since it came out. Cleans your tongue and your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the BreathRx product line of mouthwash and tongue cleaner but I wish they would go a little more natural and get rid of the very strong blue dye in the mixture.  It turns my tongue very blue.  I am not sure what the point of that is.  I think it detracts form the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I use it every morning and it has worked wonders on my breath.  After using this you&#x27;ll never NOT use it - brushing alone feels like only doing half the job any more.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never used a tongue scraper before, but now I will for the rest of my life.  I had no idea all that stuff is on your tongue in the morning.  It is pretty gross, but it&#x27;s better than staying in there all day.  Must have product.</li>
            <li> I use this three times a day and I have had fresh clean breath ever since I started using it. The tongue scraper works wonders. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from breath issues.</li>
            <li> A great product to prevent bad breath</li>
            <li> My dentist sent me home with one of these flexible tongue cleaners, and I&#x27;ve loved it. It makes a HUGE difference for me. Highly recommend.</li>
