            <li>The Adrenaline series does a FANTASTIC job of keeping odor and perspiration in check!</li>

            <li>works almost to good &amp;#62;;)</li>
            <li>It also smells too strong.  </li>
            <li>your Great Uncle Jack; b) that Eastern European guy at the club.</li>
            <li>It works really well and has a nice scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I saw this reviewed somewhere as being the strongest working, and have to agree it is true.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it is one of the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this particular product yet.  </li>
            <li>* Mild scent&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on scented stuff, but this has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fine and doesn&#x27;t seem any better than other Degree products I have used.  </li>
            <li>No such luck for us, but it did keep him dry, and smelled great.</li>
            <li>Kept me dry and Oder free and irritant free</li>
            <li>My favorite and I can never find it reasonable priced in stores locally.</li>
            <li>I read a consumer reports type review rating this deodorant very highly.</li>
            <li>I kind of enjoy it on my husband, actually, and I am a 30-something mama of 4 little ones.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>it is not his preferred color because he really likes the smell.  </li>
            <li>* Twist-feed on the bottom is very easy to use when half asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer the cool rush or any of the other versions really.</li>
            <li>So 4 stars because it works well, -1 because it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>it has a little bit of a strong scent but works well, I always use it.</li>
            <li>I take it with me when I travel (especially hiking), and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Finally an antiperspirant which really does what it says it can do.  </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and lots of people had success switching from gel to solid with it</li>
            <li>I came here to Amazon to cancel the subscription because my husband prefers the clear deoderant (this is white)</li>

            <li> I was a bit disappointed, the bar was set too high!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> Liked this stuff, smelled strong and great</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and smells good.  Win win.</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does what it&#x27;s supposed to do; however, I am not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> Deoderant part works, but not antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I saw this reviewed somewhere as being the strongest working, and have to agree it is true.  I take it with me when I travel (especially hiking), and it has worked very well.  I&#x27;m not big on scented stuff, but this has a nice smell to it.  I wish I could buy it locally, but this seems to be the one scent that they never have in stock.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my hubby and he loves it</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because, regardless of the fact it is a solid and not the gel and still gave my husband a rash, he&#x27;s always gotten rashes from solids. I read the other reviews and lots of people had success switching from gel to solid with it and I decided to try it for my husband. No such luck for us, but it did keep him dry, and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product. The Adrenaline series does a FANTASTIC job of keeping odor and perspiration in check! Seriously, it is one of the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ironman scent leaves a bit to be desired. There are these spicy notes to it that don&#x27;t make you reminisce of a famous triathlete, but rather: a) your Great Uncle Jack; b) that Eastern European guy at the club. And since this stuff works so well, you are reminded of it well into the night and next morning.</li>
            <li> Product does a good job, but could be better - Don&#x27;t let the adrenaline name fool you, acts as any other deodorant/antiperspirant does.</li>
            <li> it has a little bit of a strong scent but works well, I always use it. in Afghanistan it hold up to 130 deg heat</li>
            <li> Finally an antiperspirant which really does what it says it can do.  Even my wife likes using it from time to time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, keeps me from stinking, so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Nice size and keeps you from sweating, but this caused a rash.  It also smells too strong.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> As the second reviewer, I have to disagree with the previous statement about the fragrance.  I kind of enjoy it on my husband, actually, and I am a 30-something mama of 4 little ones.  I came here to Amazon to cancel the subscription because my husband prefers the clear deoderant (this is white) and he said it was too bad it is not his preferred color because he really likes the smell.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> My favorite and I can never find it reasonable priced in stores locally.</li>
            <li> My favorite! It works really well and has a nice scent that lasts all day. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is our son&#x27;s favorite deodorant!!! Let me tell you, it can easily double as men&#x27;s cologne too!!! lol When he uses it, it smells so fantastic, fresh and clean!!!</li>
            <li> Kept me dry and Oder free and irritant free</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way!!!</li>
            <li> Works great to keep b.o. away. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about this particular product yet.  The scent is difficult to decipher when it sometimes mixes with b.o.</li>

            <li> works almost to good &amp;#62;;)</li>
            <li> Not working as well as my Speedstick, sad because I usually love degree.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* It lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;* Mild scent&lt;br /&gt;* No rash, no peeling&lt;br /&gt;* Twist-feed on the bottom is very easy to use when half asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going through different brands to see what will work, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve had no problems with.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Aluminum Zirconium Tetrahydrochlorex 19%&amp;#34; - That&#x27;s the ingredient that&#x27;s working for me right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what&#x27;s in Arid-XX, which used to work for me.  I don&#x27;t know if Arid changed temporarily, or if the inactive ingredients are different, or maybe it only works for a while, then fails.  The dispenser on these is way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigges plus here is that it doesn&#x27;t have C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, which causes my skin to itch after a few hours, and for a few days.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have Zinc Ricinoleate, which causes my underarms to peel.  This DOES have Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex at 19%.  Anything 15-20% of AZT works well for me.</li>
            <li> Like it, the scent is a bit too strong to wear to work, but to the gym or to hang around the house perfect.</li>
    </ol>
