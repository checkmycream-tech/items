            <li>Best of all I don&#x27;t smell like a Pina Colada all day!</li>
            <li>He is very fair skinned</li>

            <li>They&#x27;ve shown no signs of irritation, and I feel good about using this on their tender skin.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>and I went berry picking on a warm sunny day</li>
            <li>It did not have any odor to it so that made it nice too.  </li>
            <li>I reapplied it to her mid-day, but did not reapply my own.  </li>
            <li>scent is nice to me: it reminds me of summer days around a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li>you reapply this sunscreen as suggested (every 40 minutes after swimming/sweating, or every two hours), it serves nicely as an SPF 40 sunblock.</li>
            <li>Good for our youngest who we can&#x27;t easily use the spray on sunscreen on yet.  </li>
            <li>This is far and away the best sunscreen I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Cots Pediatric sun block has a nice, Lightweight feel with none of the oiliness or greasiness that many lotions have.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, SPF 40 is quite suitable.</li>

            <li>This product was OK.</li>
            <li>pleased with this sunscreen for our children, and will be keeping this one on the shopping list.</li>
            <li>Our Doctor looked at the ingredient list and gave the okay.  </li>
            <li>My daugther is allergic to many things, so we decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I feel safe applying or drenching my kids now with this product.</li>
            <li>Our kids count on us to protect them from so many things and that includes sunburn.  </li>
            <li>And while it is a smaller bottle, this is perfect for travel or to keep in a diaper bag or purse.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a satisfied mom.</li>
            <li>It protected my kids skins pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy as the spray on kinds, but probably better for the kids.  </li>
            <li>It still worked just fine, but the ease of application of spray versions is better for me.</li>
            <li>Great SPF relief for kids skin all the way as early as six months.</li>
            <li>I love that it is free of virtually everything I seek to avoid when choosing skincare products - oils, ABA, and Phthalates</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Cotz products and have been very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>(though it&#x27;s very mild), and this didn&#x27;t irritate her skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs.</li>
            <li>far this has been perfect on him without any reactions and that makes me very</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty strong for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it did work just fine when we used it, so if you need a product like this, I can recommend it.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it might frustrate some people.</li>
            <li>I get them free with Vine reviews</li>
            <li>It is 100% scent free and 100% non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Cotz Pediatric Spf 40]] is that it is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Rubs in easily and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Cotz Pediatric SPF is a good option in terms of a lack of odor and a general lack of greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and using rather than the competition!</li>
            <li>After reading some research, I know that higher isn&#x27;t always better, and that SPF 35 provides a 99% coverage.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to find a gentle, safe sunscreen for him.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to keep your babies safe from the sun while they play and have fun!</li>
            <li>No irritation, even on freshly-rinsed skin, and it felt light and soaked right in.</li>
            <li>If I had kids, I&#x27;d ignore this product, in favor of having a large container&#x27;s worth that I could feel better about applying generously.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is one of the best products I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>quickly to the skin</li>
            <li>Not as strong as other creams, chemical wise, but just as strong protection wise for your little ones.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin and tends to break out with the dreaded &#x27;bumps&#x27; from many of the skin-care products out there.</li>
            <li>I moved to Los Angeles where it&#x27;s intensely sunny everyday - and I am very fair skinned - and I haven&#x27;t burned once since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I like the more natural ingredients than most brands, but I think the claim that it goes on clear is a stretch</li>
            <li>There are HUGE tubes of sunblock out there for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The bonus is that it also feels smooth and gentle on the skin when one slathers it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>My FAVORITE sunscreen by far.</li>
            <li>This is a good creamy sunscreen that uses zinc oxide in place of the chemicals used by some other products.  </li>
            <li>have a friend who burns very rapidly, and for the first time I&#x27;ve got a sunscreen that I felt comfortable recommending.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to provide acceptable sun blocking for an adult, but a higher SPF formula would be nicer and perhaps better for use on children.</li>
            <li>But for our normal backyard use, it seems fine.</li>
            <li>general consensus is that I should use the pediatric lotions because they are hypoallergenic and formulated with more care than the concoctions sold for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t notice it on my fair kids (who are almost as white as the sunscreen), but my daughter who is aboriginal Taiwanese (i.e. more dark skinned than most Asian folks) has to have this rubbed in A LOT to make her true skin tone show instead of the pasty whiteness of this.</li>
            <li>I do have dry skin, so I&#x27;m more tolerant of greasy products than some, but this felt pretty light and un-greasy to</li>
            <li>I think if you used it as a whole body product, it would take a while to put on and would use up a tube pretty quickly, but might be worth it if you have irritation</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it rubbed in as easily as it did.  </li>
            <li>It seems more gentle, for sensitive skin (or that of children, for whom it is intended).</li>
            <li>Cotz absorbs completely, quickly and without leaving a greasy film on the skin and it has protected him from too much sun exposure when we have been outdoors for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily, more like lotion than any other zinc oxide sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t feel as heavy or greasy as some sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>So while the zinc oxide scent might be taken as a little industrial, to me it brings up memories of good, youthful times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a little one who needs protection from the unforgiving summer rays, this would be a good product to try.</li>
            <li>When they are little it is up to the parent to make sure that they have a good sunblock on and that it&#x27;s being reapplied when necessary.  </li>
            <li>We were out in the sun for about 6 hours the first time we tried it, but not in the water.  </li>
            <li>I used this sparingly at first for that reason.</li>
            <li>However, to my delight, this product worked out well and did exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Before use I took this to our last Doctors appointment and asked if it was okay to use since he wasn&#x27;t yet six months.  </li>
            <li>It prevented burns in the hot florida sun.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who needs to protect themselves from sun&#x27;s exposure and wants to prevent burning of the skin - that should be everyone!</li>
            <li>After trying this on my baby and seeing how light and absorbent it was, I tried it on my (sensitive) face.</li>
            <li>While the kids wrinkled their nose and said they were sticky, it actually went on pretty easily and did not seem greasy.  </li>
            <li>(\\&quot;Extra gentle for a child&#x27;s thinner skin,\\&quot; the package promises, and it is very true.)  </li>
            <li>This is a more basic sunscreen, but at the same time a sunscreen not chock full of chemicals that make it easier to spray/spread/etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a solid sunblock that spreads easily, soaks right in, and leaves a clear, matte finish.</li>
            <li>that it really shouldn&#x27;t be used on the face.</li>
            <li>thanks to my CoTZ.</li>
            <li>What i love about this formula is the zinc oxide as a natural physical sunblock.</li>
            <li>have very light skin (think Snow White and then bleach a few shades) and tend to burn quite easily.</li>
            <li>At 20%, it has more than three times the zinc oxide as every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve owned or considered.  </li>
            <li>I also love that while using it I didn&#x27;t notice any stinging, increased presence of acne, or other signs of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>:)) In general, she is not hyper sensitive, but we do use baby detergent and cloth or natural diapers, so she&#x27;s not accustomed to a lot of chemicals aside from baby wash, and still had no problems.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the California sun&#x27;s effect on my (older) skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I use this only on the tiny baby and my own face, neck and chest (and a much cheaper chemical sunscreen on the rest of my body, which is less sensitive), the price is fine with me.</li>
            <li>My children are very active this year with so many outdoor activities, from tee-ball &amp; baseball, swimming, golf lessons, fishing &amp; boating, camping, etc...</li>
            <li>Thus, I need a high SPF.</li>
            <li>Prices vary over time, so it may come in line with other products, but as things stand now, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d shell out the extra money for this without trying some of the more affordable products first.</li>
            <li>Two of my children are very fair-skinned, and I thought this might offer better coverage than the spray-on sunscreens we usually use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this primarily on my darker skinned youngest child, because she doesn&#x27;t need as much coverage and because she - as a 20-month-old - has less surface area to cover.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive sense of smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything but a slight sunscreen odor.</li>
            <li>Yet, it appealed to me because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see purchasing it under any other circumstances, however, because it is significantly more than the regular sunscreens we use.</li>
            <li>His only advice was to test a small area of skin first to make sure he didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to keep it off his hands to avoid getting into his eyes.  </li>
            <li>guys, we&#x27;re talking so sensitive I can&#x27;t use shampoo in my hair because it hurts my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and so far appears to add sun protection without irritation for my grandbaby&lt;</li>
            <li>I used this product on my 18 month old son when we took him swimming at his grandparents.</li>
            <li>I often break out in acne after getting hives from an allergic reaction to many perfumes and chemicals common in face products.  </li>
            <li>I used this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen on both myself and my 3 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>It truly does not irritate or sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But so far I haven&#x27;t seen any sun damage or wrinkles ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;CôTZ fits the bill for our young ones.</li>
            <li>If you have a child with sensitive skin, this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen is a quality product that should suit your needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on both a 7-8 month old and a preschooler.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m no longer a baby, I do have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried the brands that claim to be organic, all natural, acne-non-inducing, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have overly sensitive skin and use may baby products as they are either unscented or lightly scented and contain few irritants in their chemical</li>
            <li>(It actually makes a nice &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; nice base for my makeup.)</li>
            <li>The best thing is that my kids hate to put sunscreen becauue of the scent.</li>
            <li>I am not a sunscreen expert and have, since my children have gotten a bit older, moved to easier applications, such as spray sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a slight \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell which dissipates quickly which is the trade off you get for leaving the masking perfumes off the ingredients</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only downfall is the high price.  </li>
            <li>sunscreen is my new favourite as it is invisible and so far has not caused any rash nor additional breakouts on my face, neck or inner arms.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d burn right through it, since it was only a low spf, but it lasted me for several hours, through the water and soap of the car wash.</li>
            <li>It is expensive but it&#x27;s safe for infants and it works!</li>
            <li>Sunscreens are a bit hard to review since the typical user can&#x27;t really comment on the chemical safety or tell for sure they&#x27;re getting the SPF claimed.</li>
            <li>This is a decent, thick, white sunscreen that fades quickly into skin and becomes clear, even though it&#x27;s 20% zinc oxide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only slight nit is that 3.5 ounce is a relatively small amount of sunscreen for the price so unless you are using this only for your face you can easily go through in quite quickly.</li>
            <li>For me, the physical barrier products work well, but previous generations (including the Cotz from 2 summers ago) were kind of weird feeling and visible and on the skin, so last summer I went with a light chemical sunscreen for my face</li>
            <li>I think they should expand their marketing as perfume free items for the outdoors can be hard to find.</li>
            <li>(we were outside nearly all day, every day).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be in water, but I am skeptical since it didn&#x27;t stand up over the course of a hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, if you check the active ingredients, you will see that this includes plenty of chemicals itself, but if your kids react poorly to other products, it&#x27;s definitely worth a</li>
            <li>(Plus it&#x27;s hard to spray her down!) :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to apply as the aerosol sunscreen that we typically use, but I feel more comfortable using the Cotz sunscreen on my daughter since it doesn&#x27;t have so many nasty</li>
            <li>Our other child has very sensitive skin</li>

            <li> and I wanted to find a gentle, safe sunscreen for him.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to keep your babies safe from the sun while they play and have fun!</li>
            <li> No irritation, even on freshly-rinsed skin, and it felt light and soaked right in.</li>
            <li> If I had kids, I&#x27;d ignore this product, in favor of having a large container&#x27;s worth that I could feel better about applying generously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is one of the best products I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> quickly to the skin</li>
            <li> Not as strong as other creams, chemical wise, but just as strong protection wise for your little ones.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and tends to break out with the dreaded &#x27;bumps&#x27; from many of the skin-care products out there.</li>
            <li> I moved to Los Angeles where it&#x27;s intensely sunny everyday - and I am very fair skinned - and I haven&#x27;t burned once since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I like the more natural ingredients than most brands, but I think the claim that it goes on clear is a stretch</li>
            <li> There are HUGE tubes of sunblock out there for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The bonus is that it also feels smooth and gentle on the skin when one slathers it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> My FAVORITE sunscreen by far.</li>
            <li> This is a good creamy sunscreen that uses zinc oxide in place of the chemicals used by some other products.  </li>
            <li> have a friend who burns very rapidly, and for the first time I&#x27;ve got a sunscreen that I felt comfortable recommending.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to provide acceptable sun blocking for an adult, but a higher SPF formula would be nicer and perhaps better for use on children.</li>
            <li> But for our normal backyard use, it seems fine.</li>
            <li> general consensus is that I should use the pediatric lotions because they are hypoallergenic and formulated with more care than the concoctions sold for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t notice it on my fair kids (who are almost as white as the sunscreen), but my daughter who is aboriginal Taiwanese (i.e. more dark skinned than most Asian folks) has to have this rubbed in A LOT to make her true skin tone show instead of the pasty whiteness of this.</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin, so I&#x27;m more tolerant of greasy products than some, but this felt pretty light and un-greasy to</li>
            <li> I think if you used it as a whole body product, it would take a while to put on and would use up a tube pretty quickly, but might be worth it if you have irritation</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it rubbed in as easily as it did.  </li>
            <li> It seems more gentle, for sensitive skin (or that of children, for whom it is intended).</li>
            <li> Cotz absorbs completely, quickly and without leaving a greasy film on the skin and it has protected him from too much sun exposure when we have been outdoors for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily, more like lotion than any other zinc oxide sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t feel as heavy or greasy as some sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> So while the zinc oxide scent might be taken as a little industrial, to me it brings up memories of good, youthful times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a little one who needs protection from the unforgiving summer rays, this would be a good product to try.</li>
            <li> When they are little it is up to the parent to make sure that they have a good sunblock on and that it&#x27;s being reapplied when necessary.  </li>
            <li> We were out in the sun for about 6 hours the first time we tried it, but not in the water.  </li>
            <li> I used this sparingly at first for that reason.</li>
            <li> However, to my delight, this product worked out well and did exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Before use I took this to our last Doctors appointment and asked if it was okay to use since he wasn&#x27;t yet six months.  </li>
            <li> It prevented burns in the hot florida sun.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who needs to protect themselves from sun&#x27;s exposure and wants to prevent burning of the skin - that should be everyone!</li>
            <li> After trying this on my baby and seeing how light and absorbent it was, I tried it on my (sensitive) face.</li>
            <li> While the kids wrinkled their nose and said they were sticky, it actually went on pretty easily and did not seem greasy.  </li>
            <li> (\\&quot;Extra gentle for a child&#x27;s thinner skin,\\&quot; the package promises, and it is very true.)  </li>
            <li> This is a more basic sunscreen, but at the same time a sunscreen not chock full of chemicals that make it easier to spray/spread/etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a solid sunblock that spreads easily, soaks right in, and leaves a clear, matte finish.</li>
            <li> that it really shouldn&#x27;t be used on the face.</li>
            <li> thanks to my CoTZ.</li>
            <li> What i love about this formula is the zinc oxide as a natural physical sunblock.</li>
            <li> have very light skin (think Snow White and then bleach a few shades) and tend to burn quite easily.</li>
            <li> At 20%, it has more than three times the zinc oxide as every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve owned or considered.  </li>
            <li> I also love that while using it I didn&#x27;t notice any stinging, increased presence of acne, or other signs of skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> :)) In general, she is not hyper sensitive, but we do use baby detergent and cloth or natural diapers, so she&#x27;s not accustomed to a lot of chemicals aside from baby wash, and still had no problems.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the California sun&#x27;s effect on my (older) skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I use this only on the tiny baby and my own face, neck and chest (and a much cheaper chemical sunscreen on the rest of my body, which is less sensitive), the price is fine with me.</li>
            <li> My children are very active this year with so many outdoor activities, from tee-ball &amp; baseball, swimming, golf lessons, fishing &amp; boating, camping, etc...</li>
            <li> Thus, I need a high SPF.</li>
            <li> Prices vary over time, so it may come in line with other products, but as things stand now, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d shell out the extra money for this without trying some of the more affordable products first.</li>
            <li> Two of my children are very fair-skinned, and I thought this might offer better coverage than the spray-on sunscreens we usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this primarily on my darker skinned youngest child, because she doesn&#x27;t need as much coverage and because she - as a 20-month-old - has less surface area to cover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive sense of smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything but a slight sunscreen odor.</li>
            <li> Yet, it appealed to me because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see purchasing it under any other circumstances, however, because it is significantly more than the regular sunscreens we use.</li>
            <li> His only advice was to test a small area of skin first to make sure he didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to keep it off his hands to avoid getting into his eyes.  </li>
            <li> guys, we&#x27;re talking so sensitive I can&#x27;t use shampoo in my hair because it hurts my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and so far appears to add sun protection without irritation for my grandbaby&lt;</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 18 month old son when we took him swimming at his grandparents.</li>
            <li> I often break out in acne after getting hives from an allergic reaction to many perfumes and chemicals common in face products.  </li>
            <li> I used this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen on both myself and my 3 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> It truly does not irritate or sting sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But so far I haven&#x27;t seen any sun damage or wrinkles ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;CôTZ fits the bill for our young ones.</li>
            <li> If you have a child with sensitive skin, this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen is a quality product that should suit your needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both a 7-8 month old and a preschooler.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m no longer a baby, I do have incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried the brands that claim to be organic, all natural, acne-non-inducing, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have overly sensitive skin and use may baby products as they are either unscented or lightly scented and contain few irritants in their chemical</li>
            <li> (It actually makes a nice &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; nice base for my makeup.)</li>
            <li> The best thing is that my kids hate to put sunscreen becauue of the scent.</li>
            <li> I am not a sunscreen expert and have, since my children have gotten a bit older, moved to easier applications, such as spray sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a slight \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell which dissipates quickly which is the trade off you get for leaving the masking perfumes off the ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downfall is the high price.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen is my new favourite as it is invisible and so far has not caused any rash nor additional breakouts on my face, neck or inner arms.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d burn right through it, since it was only a low spf, but it lasted me for several hours, through the water and soap of the car wash.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it&#x27;s safe for infants and it works!</li>
            <li> Sunscreens are a bit hard to review since the typical user can&#x27;t really comment on the chemical safety or tell for sure they&#x27;re getting the SPF claimed.</li>
            <li> This is a decent, thick, white sunscreen that fades quickly into skin and becomes clear, even though it&#x27;s 20% zinc oxide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only slight nit is that 3.5 ounce is a relatively small amount of sunscreen for the price so unless you are using this only for your face you can easily go through in quite quickly.</li>
            <li> For me, the physical barrier products work well, but previous generations (including the Cotz from 2 summers ago) were kind of weird feeling and visible and on the skin, so last summer I went with a light chemical sunscreen for my face</li>
            <li> I think they should expand their marketing as perfume free items for the outdoors can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> (we were outside nearly all day, every day).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be in water, but I am skeptical since it didn&#x27;t stand up over the course of a hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, if you check the active ingredients, you will see that this includes plenty of chemicals itself, but if your kids react poorly to other products, it&#x27;s definitely worth a</li>
            <li> (Plus it&#x27;s hard to spray her down!) :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to apply as the aerosol sunscreen that we typically use, but I feel more comfortable using the Cotz sunscreen on my daughter since it doesn&#x27;t have so many nasty</li>
            <li> Our other child has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She is now older, but we there are still little ones in our family that face the same issues.  </li>
            <li> No real bad reaction from this although her skin still got very dry and rough on her face so maybe having other issues.</li>
            <li> I have the typical sensitive skin that people of northern European heritage are plagued with.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (if you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews, you know that!)</li>
            <li> It works well for my needs as an active, single adult.</li>
            <li> This SPF goes on without leaving a mess and so far hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation on the sensitive little ones.  </li>
            <li> We spent several hours out in the sun midday and no one got burned.  </li>
            <li> In general, for outdoor activities, I typically prefer to cover up over applying a lot of sunscreen, but I do like to use it if I&#x27;ve got exposed skin.</li>
            <li> (6 of those were on a 34 lb child, and the other was to an average sized adult).  </li>
            <li> He has a tendency to get very pink in the son, and he still did (probably from the heat), but it did not last, so I know he did not burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After not too long, the product migrated into my eyes, and stung painfully until I was able to wash it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found myself applying this product twice over the course of an hour because I was getting so pink.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not necessarily for \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; use...for those that do a lot of swimming or for spending a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the base is slightly oily/balmy, which is fine for a baby sitting in a stroller, but for adults, the formula is not transfer resistant (obviously to be as non-reactive, non chemical as possible), so it tends to leave residue on clothing and surfaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We did not break out in any rashes or any other adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> As this is sunscreen, it has performed relatively well in that I have not been sunburnt over the course of the past mini heatwave this week.  </li>
            <li> the other zinc oxide sunscreens I have, this one has instructions to apply 15 minutes before sun exposure, and of course after 40 minutes of swimming or sweating and after towel drying.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients in it is zinc oxide, and it also contains no fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to make it just slightly hard to rub in, especially on squishy baby cheeks.</li>
            <li> It burns when it runs down my face and into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve officially entered Summer, the sun has just been bearing down upon us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally I shy away from products that are significantly more expensive than the competition, but this time I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> (family of five) took a bottle to the beach for a week, and used about half of it during that time</li>
            <li> My little one loves the outdoors.  </li>
            <li> When my daughter was little, she had eczema and finding a sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate</li>
            <li> because her hands are forever all over her face and in her mouth, and I was a little put off by all the unpronounceable ingredients.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen goes on very thick, white and creamy and seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because it seemed like my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s skin was having a bad reaction to regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I just remember that it was in an orange and lime green spray can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Daugther had this on for a few hours and no signs of any allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I found myself reappling this a few times over a period of time at the beach.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s faster and easier to apply than other zinc oxide sunscreens which are thick and gooey and leave a thin white layer on the skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do some personal investigation on that, since that brand is significantly less expensive than the Cotz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to be outside for long periods of time without getting a little bit of a tan, but this sunscreen seems to have just about stopped my tan cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I grab it because I&#x27;m running a little late</li>
            <li> With a small, expensive tube, I always underuse the product and make too little spread out a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once she got past the price, she tried it and now she swears by it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the small size of the tube, and 2.</li>
            <li> I will break out from using most lotions, potions and, of course, sunblock is one of the worst culprits of my breakouts.</li>
            <li> SPF of this sunscreen is 40, and it is made from a mineral complex rather than chemicals which appealed to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(The one, rather frivolous complaint I have is that the label does not want to stay on the tube, it keeps peeling off like a removable sticker and getting stuck to things and looking dirty and gross.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no getting around it, this sunscreen is twice as expensive as any other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on very thickly (like zinc diaper rash cream) but it rapidly blends in without being greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to pull it off entirely and have an unlabeled tube, but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> so I seem like an unlikely consumer for this type of product.  </li>
            <li> I do need to avoid using this on my face, unfortunately, because the lotion does travel when I sweat.</li>
            <li> year, my youngest son got a real nasty reaction to a sunscreen we used on him last year, while he was in swimming lessons.</li>
            <li> It was not at all unpleasant to wear, even under makeup.  </li>
            <li> The bad news: the price.  </li>
            <li> Our pediatrician told me that Coppertone Water Babies is well rated, and the chemicals aren&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not a sunscreen expert and have, since my children have gotten a bit older, moved to easier applications, such as spray sunscreens. My husband had picked this one up and I put it in the car and recently had the opportunity to try it.  The kids and I went berry picking on a warm sunny day and I applied this sunscreen to all of us before we went.  While the kids wrinkled their nose and said they were sticky, it actually went on pretty easily and did not seem greasy.  It did not have any odor to it so that made it nice too.  We spent several hours out in the sun midday and no one got burned.  We did not break out in any rashes or any other adverse effects.  I will continue to use this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (if you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews, you know that!) guys, we&#x27;re talking so sensitive I can&#x27;t use shampoo in my hair because it hurts my skin and eyes. I can&#x27;t use any lotions that have any sort of fragrance, even essential oils. But this sunscreen did not irritate my skin, my face, or my eyes. Not only that, I was out in the sun for several hours, and the only place I burned was where I couldn&#x27;t reach on my back (note to self: if you can&#x27;t cover the open skin in sun screen, don&#x27;t wear it outside). I thought I&#x27;d burn right through it, since it was only a low spf, but it lasted me for several hours, through the water and soap of the car wash. I am very happy with this stuff, and will definitely re-order and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has virtually no scent&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly to the skin&lt;br /&gt;does not irritate my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;  and so far appears to add sun protection without irritation for my grandbaby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Cotz products and have been very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;While I get them free with Vine reviews this is actually a product / brand I would and do buy.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 18 month old son when we took him swimming at his grandparents. He has a tendency to get very pink in the son, and he still did (probably from the heat), but it did not last, so I know he did not burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF of this sunscreen is 40, and it is made from a mineral complex rather than chemicals which appealed to me. The active ingredients in it is zinc oxide, and it also contains no fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions indicate that it needs to be applied fifteen minutes before going outside and after forty minutes of swimming.</li>
            <li> I have overly sensitive skin and use may baby products as they are either unscented or lightly scented and contain few irritants in their chemical composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is my new favourite as it is invisible and so far has not caused any rash nor additional breakouts on my face, neck or inner arms.  I often break out in acne after getting hives from an allergic reaction to many perfumes and chemicals common in face products.  As this is sunscreen, it has performed relatively well in that I have not been sunburnt over the course of the past mini heatwave this week.  I have tanned (but not burnt) this is not the product to reply on if you are looking to prevent a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current brand is from the Cancer Council of Australia, but this is a close second and I will use this as it is easier to get here in the US.</li>
            <li> Great SPF relief for kids skin all the way as early as six months. Not as strong as other creams, chemical wise, but just as strong protection wise for your little ones. Highly recommended to keep your babies safe from the sun while they play and have fun!</li>
            <li> The bad news: the price.  There&#x27;s no getting around it, this sunscreen is twice as expensive as any other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that aggravates me: it&#x27;s worth it.  This is far and away the best sunscreen I have ever tried.  At 20%, it has more than three times the zinc oxide as every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve owned or considered.  It goes on smoothly and easily, more like lotion than any other zinc oxide sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.  (\\&quot;Extra gentle for a child&#x27;s thinner skin,\\&quot; the package promises, and it is very true.)  Here in Florida it&#x27;s nearly impossible to be outside for long periods of time without getting a little bit of a tan, but this sunscreen seems to have just about stopped my tan cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who burns very rapidly, and for the first time I&#x27;ve got a sunscreen that I felt comfortable recommending.  Once she got past the price, she tried it and now she swears by it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other zinc oxide sunscreens I have, this one has instructions to apply 15 minutes before sun exposure, and of course after 40 minutes of swimming or sweating and after towel drying.  (Somehow I never remember to reapply sunscreen to my hands after washing them.)  Like the others, it needs to be reapplied after two hours.  And they all warn you to ask a doctor before applying to children under six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the price, I try to save this sunscreen for days when I&#x27;m going to be mostly outside.  Sometimes I grab it because I&#x27;m running a little late and it&#x27;s faster and easier to apply than other zinc oxide sunscreens which are thick and gooey and leave a thin white layer on the skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I shy away from products that are significantly more expensive than the competition, but this time I can&#x27;t.  This is simply the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any children so I seem like an unlikely consumer for this type of product.  Yet, it appealed to me because I have very sensitive skin so a product aimed at children seemed like it had the potential to give me the sun protection I&#x27;m looking for without aggravating my skin.  I love that it is free of virtually everything I seek to avoid when choosing skincare products - oils, ABA, and Phthalates yet still does a great job at keeping sunburn at bay.  I liked that it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t feel as heavy or greasy as some sunscreens.  It was not at all unpleasant to wear, even under makeup.  I also love that while using it I didn&#x27;t notice any stinging, increased presence of acne, or other signs of skin irritation.  My only slight nit is that 3.5 ounce is a relatively small amount of sunscreen for the price so unless you are using this only for your face you can easily go through in quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen on both myself and my 3 year old daughter.  We were out in the sun for about 6 hours the first time we tried it, but not in the water.  I reapplied it to her mid-day, but did not reapply my own.  I am happy to say that neither of us experienced sunburn.  I was surprised that it rubbed in as easily as it did.  It&#x27;s not nearly as easy to apply as the aerosol sunscreen that we typically use, but I feel more comfortable using the Cotz sunscreen on my daughter since it doesn&#x27;t have so many nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the high price.  This tube only lasted for 7 applications.  (6 of those were on a 34 lb child, and the other was to an average sized adult).  Our pediatrician told me that Coppertone Water Babies is well rated, and the chemicals aren&#x27;t bad.  I&#x27;m going to do some personal investigation on that, since that brand is significantly less expensive than the Cotz.</li>
            <li> Two of my children are very fair-skinned, and I thought this might offer better coverage than the spray-on sunscreens we usually use. It didn&#x27;t. It still worked just fine, but the ease of application of spray versions is better for me. I&#x27;m using this primarily on my darker skinned youngest child, because she doesn&#x27;t need as much coverage and because she - as a 20-month-old - has less surface area to cover. (Plus it&#x27;s hard to spray her down!) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest does have a touch of what I&#x27;d call eczema (though it&#x27;s very mild), and this didn&#x27;t irritate her skin. I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive sense of smell, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything but a slight sunscreen odor. I like the more natural ingredients than most brands, but I think the claim that it goes on clear is a stretch - I don&#x27;t notice it on my fair kids (who are almost as white as the sunscreen), but my daughter who is aboriginal Taiwanese (i.e. more dark skinned than most Asian folks) has to have this rubbed in A LOT to make her true skin tone show instead of the pasty whiteness of this.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it seemed like my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s skin was having a bad reaction to regular sunscreen.  No real bad reaction from this although her skin still got very dry and rough on her face so maybe having other issues.</li>
            <li> This is a decent, thick, white sunscreen that fades quickly into skin and becomes clear, even though it&#x27;s 20% zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice to me: it reminds me of summer days around a chlorinated pool. So while the zinc oxide scent might be taken as a little industrial, to me it brings up memories of good, youthful times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you reapply this sunscreen as suggested (every 40 minutes after swimming/sweating, or every two hours), it serves nicely as an SPF 40 sunblock. It&#x27;s plenty strong for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It burns when it runs down my face and into my eyes. I avoided my eye area, as suggested on the tube, but did apply some to my forehead and the sides of my face. After not too long, the product migrated into my eyes, and stung painfully until I was able to wash it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The tube is pretty small, for the price point. You get 3.5 ounces. There are HUGE tubes of sunblock out there for a much cheaper price. If I had kids, I&#x27;d ignore this product, in favor of having a large container&#x27;s worth that I could feel better about applying generously. With a small, expensive tube, I always underuse the product and make too little spread out a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The label keeps peeling itself off the tube. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it might frustrate some people. You could end up with a mystery lotion tube, eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid sunblock that spreads easily, soaks right in, and leaves a clear, matte finish. It works well for my needs as an active, single adult. I do need to avoid using this on my face, unfortunately, because the lotion does travel when I sweat. Four Stars for my needs, if I don&#x27;t mind carrying another sunscreen for facial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for parents to use on their kids because of 1. the small size of the tube, and 2. that it really shouldn&#x27;t be used on the face. Three Stars for that demographic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 3.5 Stars total, rounded up to 4 because the sunblock does work.total, rounded up to 4 because the sunblock does work.</li>
            <li> I have the typical sensitive skin that people of northern European heritage are plagued with. My doctor cautions me about sun exposure. Although this product is designed for children, I enjoyed using it. It truly does not irritate or sting sensitive skin. It goes on easily and absorbs. The price is a little expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and tends to break out with the dreaded &#x27;bumps&#x27; from many of the skin-care products out there. I used this sparingly at first for that reason. However, to my delight, this product worked out well and did exactly what it should. Recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this item for the lack of perfumes in it. Great for campers and backpackers. I think they should expand their marketing as perfume free items for the outdoors can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE sunscreen by far. It is 100% scent free and 100% non-greasy. I moved to Los Angeles where it&#x27;s intensely sunny everyday - and I am very fair skinned - and I haven&#x27;t burned once since I started using this. I wear it over my skin cream and under my makeup every day. (It actually makes a nice &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; nice base for my makeup.) It goes on very thickly (like zinc diaper rash cream) but it rapidly blends in without being greasy or slimy. Best of all I don&#x27;t smell like a Pina Colada all day! (Like you do with traditional drug store sunscreens) Seriously, this is one of the best products I have ever bought. I was worried about the California sun&#x27;s effect on my (older) skin. But so far I haven&#x27;t seen any sun damage or wrinkles ... thanks to my CoTZ. Is it weird to be in love with a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily and disappears quickly.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy, which is a big plus for me.  The lotion has a slight \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell which dissipates quickly which is the trade off you get for leaving the masking perfumes off the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;We (family of five) took a bottle to the beach for a week, and used about half of it during that time (we were outside nearly all day, every day).  No one got a burn, so that&#x27;s another win in my book.</li>
            <li> The Cotz Pediatric SPF is a good option in terms of a lack of odor and a general lack of greasiness.  I was not an overly shiny potpourri smelling individual after application.  The one thing I question though is its effectiveness for exposure to sun over thirty minutes.  I used this SPF for a hike.  I was not in the water and I did not sweat an incredible amount.  I found myself applying this product twice over the course of an hour because I was getting so pink.  I did not burn, which is good, but I think you need to use caution if you are hoping to just use one application and be done.  I don&#x27;t know how effective it would be in water, but I am skeptical since it didn&#x27;t stand up over the course of a hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 to 4 stars</li>
            <li> Cots Pediatric sun block has a nice, Lightweight feel with none of the oiliness or greasiness that many lotions have.  It seemed to provide acceptable sun blocking for an adult, but a higher SPF formula would be nicer and perhaps better for use on children.</li>
            <li> This is a good creamy sunscreen that uses zinc oxide in place of the chemicals used by some other products.  Of course, if you check the active ingredients, you will see that this includes plenty of chemicals itself, but if your kids react poorly to other products, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen goes on very thick, white and creamy and seems to work well.  It lasted for an afternoon at a water park under battle conditions and no one got burned.  We used it on our faces to avoid irritation, but went for a spray on sunscreen below the neck.  I think if you used it as a whole body product, it would take a while to put on and would use up a tube pretty quickly, but might be worth it if you have irritation problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last concern is that it&#x27;s currently a bit pricey.  Prices vary over time, so it may come in line with other products, but as things stand now, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d shell out the extra money for this without trying some of the more affordable products first.</li>
            <li> This product was OK. It seems more gentle, for sensitive skin (or that of children, for whom it is intended). But it&#x27;s not necessarily for \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; use...for those that do a lot of swimming or for spending a lot of time in the sun. In those cases, it will likely need to be re-applied every so often. But for our normal backyard use, it seems fine.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve officially entered Summer, the sun has just been bearing down upon us. My children are very active this year with so many outdoor activities, from tee-ball &amp; baseball, swimming, golf lessons, fishing &amp; boating, camping, etc... they are needing some protection from the blistering sun, especially this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CôTZ fits the bill for our young ones. It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and they have gotten great protection from sunburns with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, my youngest son got a real nasty reaction to a sunscreen we used on him last year, while he was in swimming lessons. (I&#x27;ll add the brand later when my wife can remember where we put the can). I just remember that it was in an orange and lime green spray can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this has been perfect on him without any reactions and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this sunscreen for our children, and will be keeping this one on the shopping list.</li>
            <li> If you have a child with sensitive skin, this Cotz Pediatric sunscreen is a quality product that should suit your needs. I couldn&#x27;t see purchasing it under any other circumstances, however, because it is significantly more than the regular sunscreens we use. But it did work just fine when we used it, so if you need a product like this, I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> My little one loves the outdoors.  He is very fair skinned and I wanted to find a gentle, safe sunscreen for him.  He is not quite 6 months yet but I decided to get this brand to try anyway.  Before use I took this to our last Doctors appointment and asked if it was okay to use since he wasn&#x27;t yet six months.  Our Doctor looked at the ingredient list and gave the okay.  His only advice was to test a small area of skin first to make sure he didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it and to keep it off his hands to avoid getting into his eyes.  We followed his advice and all is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cotz absorbs completely, quickly and without leaving a greasy film on the skin and it has protected him from too much sun exposure when we have been outdoors for extended periods of time.  It is expensive but it&#x27;s safe for infants and it works!</li>
            <li> What i love about this formula is the zinc oxide as a natural physical sunblock. no chemicals or any \\&quot;actives\\&quot; that could leach into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the base is slightly oily/balmy, which is fine for a baby sitting in a stroller, but for adults, the formula is not transfer resistant (obviously to be as non-reactive, non chemical as possible), so it tends to leave residue on clothing and surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For babies, A+! for adults, C.</li>
            <li> My daugther is allergic to many things, so we decided to give this a try.  Daugther had this on for a few hours and no signs of any allergic reaction.  It protected my kids skins pretty good too.  I feel safe applying or drenching my kids now with this product.</li>
            <li> Our kids count on us to protect them from so many things and that includes sunburn.  When they are little it is up to the parent to make sure that they have a good sunblock on and that it&#x27;s being reapplied when necessary.  One of the things I like about [[ASIN:B008U2Y9BQ Cotz Pediatric Spf 40]] is that it is good for sensitive skin.  When my daughter was little, she had eczema and finding a sunblock that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate it wasn&#x27;t easy. She is now older, but we there are still little ones in our family that face the same issues.  This SPF goes on without leaving a mess and so far hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation on the sensitive little ones.  And while it is a smaller bottle, this is perfect for travel or to keep in a diaper bag or purse.</li>
            <li> This is a more basic sunscreen, but at the same time a sunscreen not chock full of chemicals that make it easier to spray/spread/etc.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it applies well, and it works.  Not as easy as the spray on kinds, but probably better for the kids.  Good for our youngest who we can&#x27;t easily use the spray on sunscreen on yet.  Our other child has very sensitive skin and this has not caused any issue there either.</li>
            <li> As did my daughter.  It prevented burns in the hot florida sun.  Definitely worth the money and using rather than the competition!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both a 7-8 month old and a preschooler. They&#x27;ve shown no signs of irritation, and I feel good about using this on their tender skin. It is thick enough to make it just slightly hard to rub in, especially on squishy baby cheeks. Sunscreens are a bit hard to review since the typical user can&#x27;t really comment on the chemical safety or tell for sure they&#x27;re getting the SPF claimed. But as I have no reasons to doubt the claims in this case and it seems to be working well, I&#x27;m a satisfied mom.</li>
            <li> Since living in Florida, we go through a lot of sun screen. I found myself reappling this a few times over a period of time at the beach. I also use it when just out and about. I found  the product greasy and leaves a film. The best thing is that my kids hate to put sunscreen becauue of the scent.They always run or try to wipe it off themselves. This has no scent and they did not want to take it off. Good product but you will have to reapply if you are outside in the sun for longer then a hour.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m no longer a baby, I do have incredibly sensitive skin. I will break out from using most lotions, potions and, of course, sunblock is one of the worst culprits of my breakouts. I have tried the brands that claim to be organic, all natural, acne-non-inducing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general consensus is that I should use the pediatric lotions because they are hypoallergenic and formulated with more care than the concoctions sold for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miraculously, I found that Cotz&#x27; sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me breakout at all. The bonus is that it also feels smooth and gentle on the skin when one slathers it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin (think Snow White and then bleach a few shades) and tend to burn quite easily. In the summer, if I&#x27;m driving from work and there is sun falling on my arms through the windshield, I&#x27;m likely to come home with a pinkish to red skin. Thus, I need a high SPF. After reading some research, I know that higher isn&#x27;t always better, and that SPF 35 provides a 99% coverage. Therefore, SPF 40 is quite suitable. With sunscreen, as with lots of things in life, it&#x27;s the frequency of use, rather than the height of the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this sunblock with me on a recent trip to Six Flags and discovered that if I reapllied it every three hours, even after water use, I didn&#x27;t burn at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to protect themselves from sun&#x27;s exposure and wants to prevent burning of the skin - that should be everyone! If you have a little one who needs protection from the unforgiving summer rays, this would be a good product to try.</li>
            <li> In general, for outdoor activities, I typically prefer to cover up over applying a lot of sunscreen, but I do like to use it if I&#x27;ve got exposed skin. For me, the physical barrier products work well, but previous generations (including the Cotz from 2 summers ago) were kind of weird feeling and visible and on the skin, so last summer I went with a light chemical sunscreen for my face (Neutrogena liquid). After trying this on my baby and seeing how light and absorbent it was, I tried it on my (sensitive) face. No irritation, even on freshly-rinsed skin, and it felt light and soaked right in. I do have dry skin, so I&#x27;m more tolerant of greasy products than some, but this felt pretty light and un-greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs equally well and is non-irritant to my 9-month-old baby, though I skipped her hands and face (UV barrier sun bonnet instead) because her hands are forever all over her face and in her mouth, and I was a little put off by all the unpronounceable ingredients. :)) In general, she is not hyper sensitive, but we do use baby detergent and cloth or natural diapers, so she&#x27;s not accustomed to a lot of chemicals aside from baby wash, and still had no problems. (The only product that&#x27;s ever given her a reaction is the California Baby diaper cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I use this only on the tiny baby and my own face, neck and chest (and a much cheaper chemical sunscreen on the rest of my body, which is less sensitive), the price is fine with me. I&#x27;m seldom out for longer than the recommended application time, and the baby never is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The one, rather frivolous complaint I have is that the label does not want to stay on the tube, it keeps peeling off like a removable sticker and getting stuck to things and looking dirty and gross. I don&#x27;t want to pull it off entirely and have an unlabeled tube, but it&#x27;s annoying. Not enough to take off a star, but I hope someone from Cotz reads this and works on their packaging.</li>
