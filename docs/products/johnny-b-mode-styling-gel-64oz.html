            <li>I love the way it smells and the way it makes my husband&#x27;s hair look, it feels like a mixture between pudding and jello</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>

            <li>Shipping was fast and Johnny B is always been my gel of choice great deal as well</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s a gel/pomade type of hair product.</li>

            <li>I love this hair gel and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Whenever I need to order more, i will be using them.</li>
            <li>I just thought it was more paste than gel .</li>
            <li>The best and only gel I use, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Love this gel for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product .</li>
            <li>It has this great smell and keeps my son and husbands hair looking good all day long!</li>
            <li>my new favorite gel smells great and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of the gel and of course how good of a job it does on my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>My husband love it specially the price</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Best gel hands down!  </li>
            <li>but this was a great deal and should keep me going for the next 3 years.</li>
            <li>No flake last all day and great smell.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that the product smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Buy here because most barbershops charge about 20 for one that&#x27;s good for 3-4 weeks, this Big Boy would run about a cool $50 where I get my hair cut../</li>
            <li>super easy to wash out of hair</li>
            <li>Great size &amp; at a great price, this will last a very long time, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>the last one I bought lasted me a year ,smelled good strong hold .</li>
            <li>He said is sets great &amp; doesn&#x27;t make sure head feel tight.  </li>
            <li>After using many hair gel products over the years, I tried this after asking my barber what they use noticing after every haircut my hair looked &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, smelled good and remained in-place with minimal stiffness.</li>
            <li>The jar was full and undamaged.</li>
            <li>The 64 oz lasted me almost 7 full months.</li>
            <li>love the smell and how much play room you have with this product.</li>
            <li>So after cleaning it up and saving some of it I ended up with 3/4 full</li>
            <li>A true testament to the distributor.</li>
            <li>love you product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve started using it myself, because it has a medium-firm hold, i.e., I can still run a comb through my hair when it&#x27;s dry; it doesn&#x27;t flake; has a nice, light scent; and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and does not flake like other gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and with this much product in one container, you can definitely have pompadour parties.</li>
            <li>Love the gel, my husband uses this and doesn&#x27;t leave whitish residu after a few hours, smells good and holds well, recommend</li>
            <li>how quickly i recieved it.</li>
            <li>The large size lasts an extremely long time and the product itself works great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff all i use for past years always great buy and fast ship here</li>
            <li>service just wish for free samples so I can try the whole line of jb</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to put your hand in the big container unless you refill your own container&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and also not an easy to find product</li>
            <li>It gives me just the right amount of hold and is never flaky.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for the price they usually sell these at barber shops at about $30.00 and</li>
            <li>Has a very high shine, is very good for thick hair like mine</li>
            <li>My husband has very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product, it is not anything like a pomade it is a hard drying product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Gives your hair a nice wet look</li>
            <li>I get full control without the flaky white stuff that you see in the cheap gel.</li>
            <li>Love that I can buy a big container</li>
            <li>Both my brother and Dad are avid users of this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my husband and so glad that I bought this larger sized tub.</li>
            <li>, oriced very  well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>yet strong enough to hold hair in place all day</li>
            <li>They are very close in color.</li>
            <li>I have really course hair and this product manages my Nava-fro well.</li>
            <li>My Husband loves it so much that he&#x27;s introduced it to others &amp; they are now using this styling gel.  </li>
            <li>so Amazon comes through and also gives you fast delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li>After a few haircuts, I asked what kind of gel he used and told me the name of it.</li>
            <li>This gel was legit and exact product, but must buy new.</li>
            <li>Originally, I bought this for my teenage son, because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the salon price of $16 for a 16 oz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product though I was hesitant to buy it due to other reviews cautioning about fakes being shipped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells awesome (like seriously as a female this stuff drives me crazy in a good way) but not strong or overpowering</li>
            <li>The picture shows my gel that I normally buy but the one I received has a white lid and it&#x27;s not the original one...  </li>
            <li>My boys can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Smells decent, does not flake,</li>
            <li>This product wont flake or gummed, it dries really quick and the gel give your extra buddy so you can work with any hair styles.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite gel it does not flake you could even fall asleep with it in your hair and wake up with your same hair dew, I got standard shipping it took longer than I thought</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Top seal was unsealed and looked like some was missing out of it</li>
            <li>He loves this gel because he is able to grow his hair out longer, and the gel hold last all day long.</li>
            <li>I love all Johnny B products, would recommend this product highly to all who want to look slick.</li>
            <li>The ingredients on the new gel matches verbatim the Johnny B website&#x27;s MSDS page for this replacement gel product.</li>
            <li>It is cool to get it in a big bottle but the smell is not as strong as a small bottle</li>
            <li>He is a United Stated soldier and wears a patrol cap on a daily basis, and this styling gel holds his hair in position as well as no flaking like most other gels.</li>
            <li>compared the new gel with my old gel that I purchased in February 2014.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what i expected fast shipping also</li>
            <li>The only slight difference is the newly sent gel scent is not as strong as the old gel.</li>
            <li>I have lots of thick heavy hair and works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Holds super firm, all day, flakes sometimes.</li>
            <li>All you need is about a dimes size worth, and throw a little water in your hair for a dark and natural look, and pronto your ready for a night on the town.</li>
            <li>However, the old gel has a couple of additional ingredients not mentioned currently on the Johnny B website: &amp;#34;PVP&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Aminomethyl Propanol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Panthenol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sorbitol&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Blue 1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Yellow 5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 64oz of this product  2times and both times the top of the lid was broken leaving gel all over the bottle.</li>
            <li>This particular jar last for a long while.</li>
            <li>Only reason its not a perfect rating since the product itself is amazing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Happy with the product, I recommend to anyone that uses as much gel as me.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and the way it makes my husband&#x27;s hair look, it feels like a mixture between pudding and jello</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love that I was able to find this in the Fat Boy Jar.  </li>

            <li> Shipping was fast and Johnny B is always been my gel of choice great deal as well</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s a gel/pomade type of hair product.</li>
            <li> Definitely top 10.</li>
            <li> I find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Spikes only.</li>

            <li> I love this gel.</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I need to order more, i will be using them.</li>
            <li> I just thought it was more paste than gel .</li>
            <li> The best and only gel I use, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love this gel for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product .</li>
            <li> It has this great smell and keeps my son and husbands hair looking good all day long!</li>
            <li> my new favorite gel smells great and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the gel and of course how good of a job it does on my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> My husband love it specially the price</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Best gel hands down!  </li>
            <li> but this was a great deal and should keep me going for the next 3 years.</li>
            <li> No flake last all day and great smell.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that the product smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Buy here because most barbershops charge about 20 for one that&#x27;s good for 3-4 weeks, this Big Boy would run about a cool $50 where I get my hair cut../</li>
            <li> super easy to wash out of hair</li>
            <li> Great size &amp; at a great price, this will last a very long time, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> the last one I bought lasted me a year ,smelled good strong hold .</li>
            <li> He said is sets great &amp; doesn&#x27;t make sure head feel tight.  </li>
            <li> After using many hair gel products over the years, I tried this after asking my barber what they use noticing after every haircut my hair looked &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, smelled good and remained in-place with minimal stiffness.</li>
            <li> The jar was full and undamaged.</li>
            <li> The 64 oz lasted me almost 7 full months.</li>
            <li> love the smell and how much play room you have with this product.</li>
            <li> So after cleaning it up and saving some of it I ended up with 3/4 full</li>
            <li> A true testament to the distributor.</li>
            <li> love you product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve started using it myself, because it has a medium-firm hold, i.e., I can still run a comb through my hair when it&#x27;s dry; it doesn&#x27;t flake; has a nice, light scent; and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and does not flake like other gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and with this much product in one container, you can definitely have pompadour parties.</li>
            <li> Love the gel, my husband uses this and doesn&#x27;t leave whitish residu after a few hours, smells good and holds well, recommend</li>
            <li> how quickly i recieved it.</li>
            <li> The large size lasts an extremely long time and the product itself works great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff all i use for past years always great buy and fast ship here</li>
            <li> service just wish for free samples so I can try the whole line of jb</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to put your hand in the big container unless you refill your own container&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and also not an easy to find product</li>
            <li> It gives me just the right amount of hold and is never flaky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the price they usually sell these at barber shops at about $30.00 and</li>
            <li> Has a very high shine, is very good for thick hair like mine</li>
            <li> My husband has very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great product, it is not anything like a pomade it is a hard drying product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Gives your hair a nice wet look</li>
            <li> I get full control without the flaky white stuff that you see in the cheap gel.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy a big container</li>
            <li> Both my brother and Dad are avid users of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband and so glad that I bought this larger sized tub.</li>
            <li> , oriced very  well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> yet strong enough to hold hair in place all day</li>
            <li> They are very close in color.</li>
            <li> I have really course hair and this product manages my Nava-fro well.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves it so much that he&#x27;s introduced it to others &amp; they are now using this styling gel.  </li>
            <li> so Amazon comes through and also gives you fast delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> After a few haircuts, I asked what kind of gel he used and told me the name of it.</li>
            <li> This gel was legit and exact product, but must buy new.</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought this for my teenage son, because I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the salon price of $16 for a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product though I was hesitant to buy it due to other reviews cautioning about fakes being shipped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells awesome (like seriously as a female this stuff drives me crazy in a good way) but not strong or overpowering</li>
            <li> The picture shows my gel that I normally buy but the one I received has a white lid and it&#x27;s not the original one...  </li>
            <li> My boys can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Smells decent, does not flake,</li>
            <li> This product wont flake or gummed, it dries really quick and the gel give your extra buddy so you can work with any hair styles.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite gel it does not flake you could even fall asleep with it in your hair and wake up with your same hair dew, I got standard shipping it took longer than I thought</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Top seal was unsealed and looked like some was missing out of it</li>
            <li> He loves this gel because he is able to grow his hair out longer, and the gel hold last all day long.</li>
            <li> I love all Johnny B products, would recommend this product highly to all who want to look slick.</li>
            <li> The ingredients on the new gel matches verbatim the Johnny B website&#x27;s MSDS page for this replacement gel product.</li>
            <li> It is cool to get it in a big bottle but the smell is not as strong as a small bottle</li>
            <li> He is a United Stated soldier and wears a patrol cap on a daily basis, and this styling gel holds his hair in position as well as no flaking like most other gels.</li>
            <li> compared the new gel with my old gel that I purchased in February 2014.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what i expected fast shipping also</li>
            <li> The only slight difference is the newly sent gel scent is not as strong as the old gel.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick heavy hair and works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Holds super firm, all day, flakes sometimes.</li>
            <li> All you need is about a dimes size worth, and throw a little water in your hair for a dark and natural look, and pronto your ready for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> However, the old gel has a couple of additional ingredients not mentioned currently on the Johnny B website: &amp;#34;PVP&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Aminomethyl Propanol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Panthenol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sorbitol&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Blue 1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Yellow 5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 64oz of this product  2times and both times the top of the lid was broken leaving gel all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> This particular jar last for a long while.</li>
            <li> Only reason its not a perfect rating since the product itself is amazing</li>
            <li> It has a unique, very thick consistency and will hold anything in place.</li>
            <li> im a long time user of american crew gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does start to have white residue if you sleep with it on (not really flaky just like white dust type</li>
            <li> It arrived intact with no open product loss as before or what other buyers have also indicated.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s it is not worth the time to have to keep sending back a product that I need.</li>
            <li> Perhaps splurging almost $30 on gel may be too harsh for some, but I know it will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only concern I have is the bottom of the gel&#x27;s container is slightly dented due to shipping with inadequate cushioning around the product to protect from the rough handling of the box during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can wet it and redo my hair .</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time unless you constantly mess with it or sleep in it.</li>
            <li> and you only  need very little product to fix up your hair.</li>
            <li> and I use a small amount on my hair so it should last me a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Also, other gels would make him break out when he would sweat, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> this gel is half the price, the hold lasts twice as long, while using  less product!</li>
            <li> Use a little and you&#x27;ll get a wet hair look all day.</li>
            <li> and he is extremely picky about his hair!</li>
            <li> I compared the both of them and tis one has less ingredients .</li>
            <li> Use a little or a lot,  depends on the style for the day.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price I paid for it, to have half of it wasted!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a few years...</li>
            <li> my hair feels clumped and heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look the same and it flakes, not good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little hard to get off but does not stain</li>
            <li> You can brush hair after gel is dried and hard and still no flakes.</li>
            <li> I had bought a 16oz for $15 for the past couple years,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> If you use a lot it dries hard but washes out with no problem.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever (we&#x27;ve had our for at least 1 year and the container keeps the product from drying or anything)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible as the lid was open and gel was all over the outside.</li>
            <li> so I know that this bad boy here will last me almost 4 years, give or take.</li>
            <li> Packaging not great.</li>
            <li> : (these are issues I could see other people having with this product</li>
            <li> Ill be giving this away ASAP.</li>
    </ol>

I love the way it smells and the way it makes my husband&#x27;s hair look, it feels like a mixture between pudding and jello it feels awesome in your hand when applying. It lasts a long time unless you constantly mess with it or sleep in it. I would definitely and am going to buy this product again (if it ever runs out that is!)</li>
            <li> No build up. No flaking.  You can brush hair after gel is dried and hard and still no flakes. Best hair product ever. Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> love you product and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is cool to get it in a big bottle but the smell is not as strong as a small bottle</li>

            <li> I love this stuff all i use for past years always great buy and fast ship here</li>
            <li> my new favorite gel smells great and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li> I love this gel!! Keeps my hair in place all day. I only apply once in the morning and will hold all day until i shower</li>
            <li> It is what I was needing  really happy and I&#x27;ll will buy it again</li>
            <li> For my husband. Love the smell. Does not flake but holds well. Enormous jar, will last forever!</li>
            <li> My barber would always use this gel after my haircut. I really like the scent of the gel and of course how good of a job it does on my hair. After a few haircuts, I asked what kind of gel he used and told me the name of it. There was no question I&#x27;d get the big 64 oz. I recently purchased a second container. The 64 oz lasted me almost 7 full months.</li>
            <li> Second product Purchase March 2017:&lt;br /&gt;I just reordered this hair gel. It&#x27;s a great product though I was hesitant to buy it due to other reviews cautioning about fakes being shipped. I decided to order from &amp;#34;Top Shelf Barber Supplies&amp;#34; through Amazon.com. I placed the Prime order on March 18th and received the order on March 19th. It arrived intact with no open product loss as before or what other buyers have also indicated. The only concern I have is the bottom of the gel&#x27;s container is slightly dented due to shipping with inadequate cushioning around the product to protect from the rough handling of the box during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I compared the new gel with my old gel that I purchased in February 2014. They are very close in color. The only slight difference is the newly sent gel scent is not as strong as the old gel. Gel viscosity appears to be the same. The ingredients on the new gel matches verbatim the Johnny B website&#x27;s MSDS page for this replacement gel product. However, the old gel has a couple of additional ingredients not mentioned currently on the Johnny B website: &amp;#34;PVP&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Aminomethyl Propanol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Panthenol&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sorbitol&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;Blue 1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Yellow 5&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My husband love it specially the price</li>
            <li> I love that I was able to find this in the Fat Boy Jar.  The value is great and the product is awesome for those that need a good hold all day.  I have lots of thick heavy hair and works great for me.  It has an excellent scent.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff; good thing because I have a lifetime supply since I didn&#x27;t notice this is a 64 oz container!</li>
            <li> love the smell and how much play room you have with this product. super easy to wash out of hair yet strong enough to hold hair in place all day, i think it would probably hold it for another day if i didn&#x27;t wash it out</li>
            <li> Great product good shipping</li>
            <li> It is a very good product And I&#x27;m happy with it but from the shipping part the jar led was busted and the product was all in the bag So after cleaning it up and saving some of it I ended up with 3/4 full</li>
            <li> Good gel. Great scent and hold. Has a very high shine, is very good for thick hair like mine</li>
            <li> Love this gel. This particular jar last for a long while. Smells great and does not flake like other gels I&#x27;ve tried. I have been using only this gel for years. Definitely recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a few years...By far is the best hair gel out there. I get full control without the flaky white stuff that you see in the cheap gel. All you need is about a dimes size worth, and throw a little water in your hair for a dark and natural look, and pronto your ready for a night on the town. save yourself some money and time and buy the big one.....you wont regret it.!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite hair gel.  The large size lasts an extremely long time and the product itself works great.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price.</li>
            <li> Great size &amp; at a great price, this will last a very long time, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and Johnny B is always been my gel of choice great deal as well 64oz $20 can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Was exactly what i expected fast shipping also</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite! Love the smell! Cheaper on Amazon than locally!</li>
            <li> With this gel I can hold my hair even in the rain. The scent is great and with this much product in one container, you can definitely have pompadour parties. Trust me I already did. Go forth and buy it, Johnny B knows how to make a goode product!</li>
            <li> I received this product in excellent time, but when I opened the package the lid was off and it had spilled a majority of the gel all over the inside of the packaging. Not worth the price I paid for it, to have half of it wasted!</li>
            <li> This gel was legit and exact product, but must buy new. Don&#x27;t buy used gel. That is gross. Came in on time and was sealed and taped.</li>
            <li> great product, awesome smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and service.</li>
            <li> Its a good gel im a barber and it keeps my clients hair looking kul. It has a nice smell to it I thought since it was big it was not going to be consentrated and its nice.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I put this sutff on my hare.&lt;br /&gt;I put this stuff everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps my fuzzies stay.&lt;br /&gt;I dont mind that i have to pay.&lt;br /&gt;I can do run i can jump i can play.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel that I have ever used. I will only use this product!</li>
            <li> Great consistency, not greasy, great value. I love all Johnny B products, would recommend this product highly to all who want to look slick.</li>
            <li> Great hair gelâ€¦.great service just wish for free samples so I can try the whole line of jb</li>
            <li> Great product! The big tub will last a while! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing! I love the fact that it&#x27;s a gel/pomade type of hair product. Keeps my hair in place and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Looks like it was used before I bought. Top seal was unsealed and looked like some was missing out of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of hair gels, but nothing comes close to this. Use a little or a lot,  depends on the style for the day.  If you use a lot it dries hard but washes out with no problem. Use a little and you&#x27;ll get a wet hair look all day.</li>
            <li> Love the gel, my husband uses this and doesn&#x27;t leave whitish residu after a few hours, smells good and holds well, recommend</li>
            <li> One of the best hair gels on the market. Definitely top 10. And at those ranks none differ by a lot. It would be up to preferences.</li>
            <li> No concerns here. Been using this product for roughltly 10 years. Smells decent, does not flake, lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> I have really course hair and this product manages my Nava-fro well. No flakes and smells great. 1 tub lasts 9 months.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel in the world</li>
            <li> not the same . the last one I bought lasted me a year ,smelled good strong hold . I can wet it and redo my hair . this one comes off . will not buy it again . I compared the both of them and tis one has less ingredients . looks a bit different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: for the price it will do just now I have to buy head and shoulders but it lasted me for 9 months and that&#x27;s the only reason I keep buying it unlit I find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Spikes only. It is too gummy for anything else.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy a big container and it lasts forever it seems. Great gel, really high quality!!</li>
            <li> This is like the best gel I ever had and believe me I&#x27;ve tried a lot of em lol, smell awsome and it last all day...</li>
            <li> Works good and smells great</li>
            <li> I started using Johnny B hair gel when my barber suggested it and put it in my hair. The smell is awesome! My wife loves it and so do I. It gives me just the right amount of hold and is never flaky. I bought the 64 oz jar because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> Awesome gel!  I would like for the smell to last longer after a while the gel inside just losses its potency.  Also, it&#x27;s a pricey gel.</li>
            <li> My husband has very straight hair.  He loves this gel because he is able to grow his hair out longer, and the gel hold last all day long.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT... I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS</li>
            <li> My boys can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff... Packaging not great. This stuff will last forever</li>
            <li> This is a great item. And was sutprised how quickly i recieved it.</li>
            <li> Do I need 64 oz of hair gel ? Heck no but this was a great deal and should keep me going for the next 3 years. Love it !</li>
            <li> My Husband loves it so much that he&#x27;s introduced it to others &amp; they are now using this styling gel.  He said is sets great &amp; doesn&#x27;t make sure head feel tight.  I like that it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel. It was a great buy</li>
            <li> Greatest hair gel ever. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> im a long time user of american crew gel. this gel is half the price, the hold lasts twice as long, while using  less product!</li>
            <li> These is the best gel I ever use.</li>
            <li> Its Johnny B! Smells Amazing! Works great! No flakes!  BIG bucket! Cheap price! GET IT!!!</li>
            <li> Both my brother and Dad are avid users of this product. It smells good and works well! This gel is also made in L.A</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I like that I can break up my hair without it flaking. Best gel ever!</li>
            <li> The best gel out there. Holds, looks, and smells great.</li>
            <li> Great smell and hold and you get a great amount for an awesome price.... Highly recommended and also not an easy to find product so Amazon comes through and also gives you fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> Great love the gel perfect smell too.</li>
            <li> The picture shows my gel that I normally buy but the one I received has a white lid and it&#x27;s not the original one...  My hair doesn&#x27;t look the same and it flakes, not good!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> This is the best gel out. No flake last all day and great smell. I used to use Crew gel I have switched best thing I did for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband and so glad that I bought this larger sized tub. He is a United Stated soldier and wears a patrol cap on a daily basis, and this styling gel holds his hair in position as well as no flaking like most other gels. I love that it smells pleasant and it holds like it states. He has some curly locks and this gel definitely does the job. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My boys use this on their hair and they love it!  It has this great smell and keeps my son and husbands hair looking good all day long!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It is the most popular gel in my town at the moment and I can understand why.  Does not flake. Easy to put on and take off.  I have medium-long hair and it keeps it in place all day even after vigorous exercise. I definitely recommend this gel!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel and recommend it. it not greasy like others and you only  need very little product to fix up your hair.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent! Whats more impressive is how fast I received the product. A true testament to the distributor. Whenever I need to order more, i will be using them. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Upgraded to a five star review. Great shipping!!</li>
            <li> my hair feels clumped and heavy. BOO.  Ill be giving this away ASAP. I just thought it was more paste than gel .</li>
            <li> Great product, I was introduce to this product when I took my first hair cut with my barber. This product wont flake or gummed, it dries really quick and the gel give your extra buddy so you can work with any hair styles. Another thing is that the product smells fantastic. I would recommend to buy it from Amazon because is way cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I switch between this and paste depending on how I want to do my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent quality gel for an even more amazing price.  I had bought a 16oz for $15 for the past couple years,  but I won&#x27;t be doing that anymore!</li>
            <li> The best and only gel I use, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a unique, very thick consistency and will hold anything in place. I love this stuff and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love this gel for my hair. This is my second time ordering it from amazon. Will order again in 6months. Great price. Love amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best gel that I&#x27;ve ever used!  It holds all day and doesn&#x27;t flake in your hair!  I&#x27;ve used it for the past 5 years and I still love it!</li>
            <li> Great, my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Last forever, oriced very  well!</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk definitely saves money. Perhaps splurging almost $30 on gel may be too harsh for some, but I know it will last me a very long time. The 16 oz product lasted me 1 year so I know that this bad boy here will last me almost 4 years, give or take.</li>
            <li> johnny b great product..</li>
            <li> Great product and great deal</li>
            <li> This gel is the best.</li>
            <li> Holds super firm, all day, flakes sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite gel it does not flake you could even fall asleep with it in your hair and wake up with your same hair dew, I got standard shipping it took longer than I thought but I finally got it within a month it&#x27;s great for the price they usually sell these at barber shops at about $30.00 and that&#x27;s if they carry them this big . They gel works great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good stuff I like it</li>
            <li> Great hair care products from Johnny B..</li>
            <li> Great Price, Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best gel hands down!  No flakes and smells great.  Buy here because most barbershops charge about 20 for one that&#x27;s good for 3-4 weeks, this Big Boy would run about a cool $50 where I get my hair cut../</li>
            <li> This is the best gel my husband has ever used and he is extremely picky about his hair! Also, other gels would make him break out when he would sweat, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love the product . I ordered the 64oz of this product  2times and both times the top of the lid was broken leaving gel all over the bottle. I will just go and buy it at Sally&#x27;s it is not worth the time to have to keep sending back a product that I need.</li>
