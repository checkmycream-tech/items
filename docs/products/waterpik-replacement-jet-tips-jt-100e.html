            <li>I absolutely love my Waterpik!</li>
            <li>I love my Waterpik WP-100!  </li>
            <li>no, it fits fine and my teeth are happy.</li>
            <li>color coding would be a nice additional feature but is not offered.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to have it covered for when you do...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always floss, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own color tip.  </li>
            <li>Nice color coding.</li>
            <li>Nice for people who can&#x27;t floss.  </li>
            <li>We got extras so now each kid has their own tip, and can share the waterpik.</li>
            <li>Great clean.</li>
            <li>I bought the new Waterpik Waterflosser Ultra, and the tips work perfect with it!  </li>
            <li>My new waterpik flosser with jet tips work great!  </li>
            <li>They break very easily and you can not buy them at any of the stores where I bought my waterpiks.  </li>
            <li>I got this in place of using floss, water flossing is more effective.</li>
            <li>like to add hydrogen peroxide or salt to make this an even more effective treatment.</li>
            <li>These replacements work as good as the original tips.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s to say, other than they fit perfectly, just like the original tips that came with this excellent Waterpik unit..</li>
            <li>Hopefully there will be more when these were out.</li>
            <li>They were reasonably priced, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i recommend having this item for healthy teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Excellent extra parts for both myself and my family for my existing Waterpik unit.  </li>
            <li>For me, I thought that the something with a finer tip would be better.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Love my Waterpik and these tips.</li>
            <li>i love the water pic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much more I can tell you about a replacement tip for a Waterpik</li>
            <li>So much better.</li>
            <li>Love my waterpic have had one for years.  </li>
            <li>When I want to order more I now know where to order them.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize there were more than one size.</li>

            <li>I Love my waterpik...</li>
            <li>I was amazed and how many food particles came out between my teeth with the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>if you have many users buy at list one replacement pack&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s an excellent complement to brushing/flossing as it gets deep into your gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So perfect it seems they weren&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li>Takes up some counter space on counter top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay more for better quality.</li>
            <li>I love these tips.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are okay.  </li>
            <li>Love my waterpik though.  </li>
            <li>For clarity - the retailer that provided this item did a great job of getting the product to me and there are no negative issues with them.  </li>
            <li>great to have to replace &amp; is a great asset to keeping teeth clean &amp; free of debris, especially id&#x3D;f have crowns or a bridge</li>
            <li>I am sure that it will be fine.</li>
            <li>i find it was more cheap  </li>
            <li>We have really enjoyed the waterpik and the kids enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product so far.</li>

            <li>product good - fast shipping</li>
            <li>The basic system is wonderful, it saves time and does a better job than flossing, and these replacement parts were exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new WaterPik because these WaterPik heads fit perfectly in my machine , thank you so much</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>price is reasonable and the tip fit perfectly--each one is good for 6 months.</li>
            <li>The rubber tip splits easily.</li>
            <li>and I am able to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I find these are good replacements for your waterpik, I think they work extremely well, and feel that the value is good for the price.</li>
            <li>These replacement tips work fine with my Waterpik.</li>
            <li>product worked fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I love my waterpik, it is easy to use and it does a very good job, I always had trouble flossing because my fingers hurt,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>worked, fit fine.</li>
            <li>Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!</li>
            <li>very good product and service was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;the price is reasonable even on top of cost we have to pay for international courier charges.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit and I ended up buying a water flosser.</li>
            <li>They fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless</li>
            <li>They also fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W which we have for traveling.  </li>
            <li>( concerned that its fit to the bottom might wear-out over time).  </li>
            <li>They fit my water pik and do that job.</li>
            <li>Great price on an item I use regularly.</li>
            <li>After-market parts sometimes don&#x27;t fit because they&#x27;re knock-offs</li>
            <li>but these seem to be the genuine article.</li>
            <li>Didnt fit my machine.</li>
            <li>Product worked well and fit well</li>
            <li>Perfect, I am very happy with the waterpik jet flosser, and the additional tips I purchased are nice to have on hand in case one is broken or misplaced.</li>
            <li>They work great and are the same as the original ones that come with it.</li>
            <li>They fit the machine well and help keep my daughters teeth clean between her braces.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, compact size &amp; really makes a difference in look &amp; feel of your teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li>I have bought these from more than one seller, they wear out very fast.</li>
            <li>Original waterpik product.</li>
            <li>These are original parts still in original pkg</li>
            <li>original pieces lasted alittle over a year&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I forgot how effective and how much more quiet this one is.  </li>
            <li>This is the tool to help you clean out your water heater.</li>
            <li>, it floss my teeth, my teeth now clean.</li>
            <li>teeth never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>and they feel so clean after.</li>
            <li>I never though I would purchase a Waterpik, but it has most certainly done the job.  </li>
            <li>Teeth and mouth feel super clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to be able to order replacement tips on amazon as well.</li>
            <li>The process is really effortless and you do a better job than string flossing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I got lucky when I ordered these</li>

            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll purchase these again when we need more.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is really great for cleaning between the teeth where other products fail, and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for a truly clean mouth!  </li>
            <li>Ordering through Amazon was quick and economical.  </li>

            <li>I have trouble with my teeth and this jet tip is great</li>
            <li>Item was as described with fast free shipping.</li>
            <li>Writing a review for a replacement tip is not that exciting.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in good condition and worked just as expected.</li>
            <li>The adult versions are much better.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a 2nd one!</li>
            <li>but it would have been nice to have color choices so we could differentiate between family members personal tips.</li>
            <li>Got here quick, packaged well and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>There is no operational reason for the bottom of the groove to be at right angles -</li>
            <li>And it was the right part for my unit.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M sure my next checkup will be super.  </li>
            <li>The new pick is easier to use and seems more powerful than the older one .I</li>
            <li>It doesnt throw the water current as strong as the original one.</li>
            <li>They fit like new and are in use.  </li>
            <li>Adding a little mouthwash gets two objectives done at once  Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li>new tip restores the jet intensity to its original spec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to selecting any of these tips for your Waterpik, be sure to go to the Waterpik site and lookup the correct tip model for your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed and at the \\&quot;right\\&quot; price.  </li>
            <li>The lid on top of the water tank is unstable and often when I try to put it back in place, it drops in to the water tank.</li>
            <li>fit my old waterpik, so I can still use it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient than trying to find in local stores, which don&#x27;t carry all models.</li>
            <li>I had some gum pain, most likely as a result of gingivitis.</li>
            <li>This is our first time using a waterpik</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, Speedy Delivery, A+A+A+</li>
            <li>The new tips work very well, and it&#x27;s easy to notice the difference when replacing an older one.</li>
            <li>When my originals flamed out, I was using a noisy large replacement</li>
            <li>First I ordered at the Water Pik store but the price was more and the shipping charges were extreme.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s entirely possible the tip would have worked fine if WATERPIK HADN&#x27;T CHANGED THE DIAMETER OF THE TIPS!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>We really don&#x27;t need to be exchanging germs, now, do we?</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so i really can not give my opinion.  </li>
            <li>and she said my gums are looking so much healthier.</li>
            <li>My gums are so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>Could be cheaper and available at a local store.</li>
            <li>After 3 days of using this, the pain disappeared and my teeth feel much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Really like the waterpik.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>and she really loves it.</li>
            <li>Thanks alot.</li>
            <li>These tips won&#x27;t fit my older unit, so I&#x27;m out the entire cost, my teeth are rotting</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t use them yet, as I still have several of the original tips.</li>
            <li>These are pretty much the exact same that come with the Waterpik WP</li>
            <li>The real thing lasts a year or more with frequent use, if one is careful.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li>he likes doing it more than flossing too so less fights for us.</li>
            <li>Not too sure why anyone would rate less than a four on here, been using this replacement for about 2 months and have not had one problem.</li>
            <li>I needed replacement tips for my WaterPik, - and had looked in stores but the price was too high to my thinking.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these tips.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by my Periodontal Hygenist and has met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>have the battery powered unit and was a little worried it might be more of a custom</li>
            <li>but other then that it was fine.</li>
            <li>This groove is deep into the plastic and is designed with right angles at the bottom of the groove.  </li>
            <li>Finally got the right tips for my waterpik.</li>
            <li>I ordered these tips to go along as spares for our new Waterpic Flooser.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t live without one</li>
            <li>When I ordered new brushes I also ordered he jet tips.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea I needed to replace my tips, but these new ones gave my water pik renewed force.</li>
            <li>You will feel the difference in your mouth when you use new Waterpik Jet tips.  </li>
            <li>Bought them with a new Waterpik thinking they were a wear item</li>
            <li>Because I like my Water-Pik WP100 very much, when I needed replacement jet tips, I checked several suppliers, chose Amazon, and the 2 packs of jet tips were sent by OneCountryShop.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>exactly the same as the ones that came with my unit.</li>
            <li>I ordered two sets, and they were cool enough to send me two sets that all had different colors in the band!  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old heads with these.</li>
            <li>My old ones were really really old</li>
            <li>I bought these Water Pik Jet Tips because they direct the water stream directly between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to know that these wear out over time with useage.</li>
            <li>It took me a few days to be completely comfortable using the device</li>
            <li>so far we have no issues with these and the work as stated.</li>
            <li>They do a really lousy job of differentiating between all the various types of replacements available and whether they fit all the models, etc.</li>
            <li>This right angle causes a reduction in strength, thus is easy to fail.  </li>
            <li>Problem is, the original product only has tips for one person, so \\&quot;replacement tips\\&quot; are necessary so it can be shared by other family members.  </li>
            <li>We tried the &#x27;bargain store&#x27; versions and they barely lasted a month.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time i buy this item for my sister, she uses it frequently, and she didn&#x27;t complain about it before, therefore its the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>i bought 3 of them, thinking the new ones will last about the same</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe how much these things cost, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money for something that will last.  </li>
            <li>if you have ever tried to fit your fingers inside a little ones mouth with floss wrapped around them you know exactly what i mean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the exact same brand (not a cheap knock-off) as the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>As they get older, the hole in the tip seems to get larger due to the water pressure, so the effectiveness lessens.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love my Waterpik WP-100!  </li>
            <li> no, it fits fine and my teeth are happy.</li>
            <li> color coding would be a nice additional feature but is not offered.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to have it covered for when you do...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always floss, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> Everyone has their own color tip.  </li>
            <li> Nice color coding.</li>
            <li> Nice for people who can&#x27;t floss.  </li>
            <li> We got extras so now each kid has their own tip, and can share the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Great clean.</li>
            <li> I bought the new Waterpik Waterflosser Ultra, and the tips work perfect with it!  </li>
            <li> My new waterpik flosser with jet tips work great!  </li>
            <li> They break very easily and you can not buy them at any of the stores where I bought my waterpiks.  </li>
            <li> I got this in place of using floss, water flossing is more effective.</li>
            <li> like to add hydrogen peroxide or salt to make this an even more effective treatment.</li>
            <li> These replacements work as good as the original tips.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say, other than they fit perfectly, just like the original tips that came with this excellent Waterpik unit..</li>
            <li> Hopefully there will be more when these were out.</li>
            <li> They were reasonably priced, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i recommend having this item for healthy teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Excellent extra parts for both myself and my family for my existing Waterpik unit.  </li>

            <li> Love my waterpic have had one for years.  </li>

            <li> I Love my waterpik...</li>
            <li> I was amazed and how many food particles came out between my teeth with the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> if you have many users buy at list one replacement pack&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s an excellent complement to brushing/flossing as it gets deep into your gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So perfect it seems they weren&#x27;t really necessary.  </li>
            <li> Takes up some counter space on counter top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay more for better quality.</li>
            <li> I love these tips.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are okay.  </li>
            <li> Love my waterpik though.  </li>
            <li> For clarity - the retailer that provided this item did a great job of getting the product to me and there are no negative issues with them.  </li>
            <li> great to have to replace &amp; is a great asset to keeping teeth clean &amp; free of debris, especially id&#x3D;f have crowns or a bridge</li>
            <li> I am sure that it will be fine.</li>
            <li> i find it was more cheap  </li>

            <li> product good - fast shipping</li>
            <li> The basic system is wonderful, it saves time and does a better job than flossing, and these replacement parts were exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new WaterPik because these WaterPik heads fit perfectly in my machine , thank you so much</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> price is reasonable and the tip fit perfectly--each one is good for 6 months.</li>
            <li> The rubber tip splits easily.</li>
            <li> and I am able to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I find these are good replacements for your waterpik, I think they work extremely well, and feel that the value is good for the price.</li>
            <li> These replacement tips work fine with my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> product worked fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> I love my waterpik, it is easy to use and it does a very good job, I always had trouble flossing because my fingers hurt,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> worked, fit fine.</li>
            <li> Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!</li>
            <li> very good product and service was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;the price is reasonable even on top of cost we have to pay for international courier charges.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit and I ended up buying a water flosser.</li>
            <li> They fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless</li>
            <li> They also fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W which we have for traveling.  </li>
            <li> ( concerned that its fit to the bottom might wear-out over time).  </li>
            <li> They fit my water pik and do that job.</li>
            <li> Great price on an item I use regularly.</li>
            <li> After-market parts sometimes don&#x27;t fit because they&#x27;re knock-offs</li>
            <li> but these seem to be the genuine article.</li>
            <li> Didnt fit my machine.</li>
            <li> Product worked well and fit well</li>
            <li> Perfect, I am very happy with the waterpik jet flosser, and the additional tips I purchased are nice to have on hand in case one is broken or misplaced.</li>
            <li> They work great and are the same as the original ones that come with it.</li>
            <li> They fit the machine well and help keep my daughters teeth clean between her braces.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, compact size &amp; really makes a difference in look &amp; feel of your teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> I have bought these from more than one seller, they wear out very fast.</li>
            <li> Original waterpik product.</li>
            <li> These are original parts still in original pkg</li>
            <li> original pieces lasted alittle over a year&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I forgot how effective and how much more quiet this one is.  </li>
            <li> This is the tool to help you clean out your water heater.</li>
            <li> , it floss my teeth, my teeth now clean.</li>
            <li> teeth never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> and they feel so clean after.</li>
            <li> I never though I would purchase a Waterpik, but it has most certainly done the job.  </li>
            <li> Teeth and mouth feel super clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to be able to order replacement tips on amazon as well.</li>
            <li> The process is really effortless and you do a better job than string flossing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works as advertised.  </li>

            <li> Item was as described with fast free shipping.</li>
            <li> Writing a review for a replacement tip is not that exciting.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good condition and worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> The adult versions are much better.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a 2nd one!</li>
            <li> but it would have been nice to have color choices so we could differentiate between family members personal tips.</li>
            <li> Got here quick, packaged well and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> There is no operational reason for the bottom of the groove to be at right angles -</li>
            <li> And it was the right part for my unit.</li>
            <li> The price was right too.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M sure my next checkup will be super.  </li>
            <li> The new pick is easier to use and seems more powerful than the older one .I</li>
            <li> It doesnt throw the water current as strong as the original one.</li>
            <li> They fit like new and are in use.  </li>
            <li> Adding a little mouthwash gets two objectives done at once  Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> new tip restores the jet intensity to its original spec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to selecting any of these tips for your Waterpik, be sure to go to the Waterpik site and lookup the correct tip model for your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed and at the \\&quot;right\\&quot; price.  </li>
            <li> The lid on top of the water tank is unstable and often when I try to put it back in place, it drops in to the water tank.</li>
            <li> fit my old waterpik, so I can still use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient than trying to find in local stores, which don&#x27;t carry all models.</li>
            <li> I had some gum pain, most likely as a result of gingivitis.</li>
            <li> This is our first time using a waterpik</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Speedy Delivery, A+A+A+</li>
            <li> The new tips work very well, and it&#x27;s easy to notice the difference when replacing an older one.</li>
            <li> When my originals flamed out, I was using a noisy large replacement</li>
            <li> First I ordered at the Water Pik store but the price was more and the shipping charges were extreme.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely possible the tip would have worked fine if WATERPIK HADN&#x27;T CHANGED THE DIAMETER OF THE TIPS!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> We really don&#x27;t need to be exchanging germs, now, do we?</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so i really can not give my opinion.  </li>
            <li> and she said my gums are looking so much healthier.</li>
            <li> My gums are so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> Could be cheaper and available at a local store.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using this, the pain disappeared and my teeth feel much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Really like the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> Thanks alot.</li>
            <li> These tips won&#x27;t fit my older unit, so I&#x27;m out the entire cost, my teeth are rotting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use them yet, as I still have several of the original tips.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the exact same that come with the Waterpik WP</li>
            <li> The real thing lasts a year or more with frequent use, if one is careful.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li> he likes doing it more than flossing too so less fights for us.</li>
            <li> Not too sure why anyone would rate less than a four on here, been using this replacement for about 2 months and have not had one problem.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement tips for my WaterPik, - and had looked in stores but the price was too high to my thinking.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these tips.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my Periodontal Hygenist and has met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> have the battery powered unit and was a little worried it might be more of a custom</li>
            <li> but other then that it was fine.</li>
            <li> This groove is deep into the plastic and is designed with right angles at the bottom of the groove.  </li>
            <li> Finally got the right tips for my waterpik.</li>
            <li> I ordered these tips to go along as spares for our new Waterpic Flooser.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t live without one</li>
            <li> When I ordered new brushes I also ordered he jet tips.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea I needed to replace my tips, but these new ones gave my water pik renewed force.</li>
            <li> You will feel the difference in your mouth when you use new Waterpik Jet tips.  </li>
            <li> Bought them with a new Waterpik thinking they were a wear item</li>
            <li> Because I like my Water-Pik WP100 very much, when I needed replacement jet tips, I checked several suppliers, chose Amazon, and the 2 packs of jet tips were sent by OneCountryShop.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> exactly the same as the ones that came with my unit.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets, and they were cool enough to send me two sets that all had different colors in the band!  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old heads with these.</li>
            <li> My old ones were really really old</li>
            <li> I bought these Water Pik Jet Tips because they direct the water stream directly between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to know that these wear out over time with useage.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to be completely comfortable using the device</li>
            <li> so far we have no issues with these and the work as stated.</li>
            <li> They do a really lousy job of differentiating between all the various types of replacements available and whether they fit all the models, etc.</li>
            <li> This right angle causes a reduction in strength, thus is easy to fail.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, the original product only has tips for one person, so \\&quot;replacement tips\\&quot; are necessary so it can be shared by other family members.  </li>
            <li> We tried the &#x27;bargain store&#x27; versions and they barely lasted a month.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time i buy this item for my sister, she uses it frequently, and she didn&#x27;t complain about it before, therefore its the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> i bought 3 of them, thinking the new ones will last about the same</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe how much these things cost, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money for something that will last.  </li>
            <li> if you have ever tried to fit your fingers inside a little ones mouth with floss wrapped around them you know exactly what i mean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the exact same brand (not a cheap knock-off) as the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> As they get older, the hole in the tip seems to get larger due to the water pressure, so the effectiveness lessens.  </li>
            <li> I made a false move with my waterpic and broke the original Jet Tip&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had put it off for too long, thinking regular dental floss was sufficient.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the two extra tips, I was happy to find one of them was white (the little collar at the base of the pik).</li>
            <li> We bought extra piks for other family members and they are still being stored in the paper conainter</li>
            <li> These work as they should for some models of the Waterpik water flossing system, but be very careful when ordering that you know which model of flosser you have as some of the stems, which insert into the flosser&#x27;s handle, are different diameters and lengths.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s exceedingly difficult to know whether the tip you are ordering is actually the same one as the original in the box.  </li>
            <li> I went to countless stores, with no success.</li>
            <li> When I upgraded to a newer Waterpik model, the previous tips did not fit the new machine.</li>
            <li> Went around several local stores, but no luck finding a small inexpensive item like this</li>
            <li> I just got the waterpick a few months ago and although it came with a bunch of other (mostly useless) tips, it only came with one of the main tips, so I had to order an extra set of regular tips so that my husband could use it too.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> It would have been helpful if Waterpik alerted customers that their unit has been arbitrarily made obsolete.</li>
            <li> Was as described and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Compatible; works as expected.</li>
            <li> I received what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just stow it in the same compartment that you stow your water hose for drinking water...not in the black water bin!</li>
            <li> Not certain why they recommend replacing them when nothing but water runs through them, but I did and all is well.</li>
            <li> Although 7-day delivery was estimated, the small package arrived the very next day after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with using fingernail polish or finding some model car paint that I can use to paint the collar of the other one.</li>
            <li> my dental hygenist recommended i start water flossing due to my receding gumline.  </li>
            <li> Usually by the time I need extra parts for the products I buy they are no longer made, so this time I am prepared.</li>
            <li> Gives other family members a chance to use the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> replaced the broken one and it works like new.  </li>
            <li> Amazon took care of everything, which is why I did not rate it down.</li>
            <li> and I couldnt remember to replace them (or remember to write down the #) when i went to WalMart.  </li>
            <li> The switch is on the main unit, not the handle, which makes this extremely difficult for kids to use without spraying water everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The issue that I have with the WaterPik Jet tips (the JT-100E) is that they are designed in a way that makes them fail at a high rate.  </li>
            <li> The box was broken when I got it right out of the mail, the plastic was broken on one of them and half the class jet tip was dangling out.</li>
            <li> its way easier than getting my little guy to floss or having to do it my self.</li>
            <li> , these are very hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my waterpik, once opened I can&#x27;t return it, so I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The one that is green with the reusable decals.  </li>
            <li> not sure you need to have extras laying around.  </li>
            <li> Small irritants:  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find these at any regular store so resorted to the internet.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, thank you replacement accessories for my system.  </li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads so that my husband and I could share a waterpic, but it was so hard to find additional pic.  </li>
            <li> So late one night I found these on the internet.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell these in traditional stores.</li>
            <li> Crazy that drugstores and bed and bath stores don&#x27;t carry replacements for waterpic, but carry lots of replacements for other brands/types of dental hygiene electronics.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> and they were the proper replacement, but it was a crap shoot when ordering.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Instead of paying for expensive tips over and over again, I will be looking for a brand that isn&#x27;t designed with tip problems.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong size for my waterpik.</li>
            <li> i like it ,but  i find  it is too expensive,  </li>
            <li> The order was wrong, and woundn&#x27;t work on my</li>
            <li> I was unable to find them in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> Expensive with shipping but works well.</li>
            <li> you select the wrong tip it will not work and may be impossible to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have crazy teeth and these always manage to get out particles that my floss misses.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good product and service was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;the price is reasonable even on top of cost we have to pay for international courier charges.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, thank you replacement accessories for my system.  They fit like new and are in use.  Hopefully there will be more when these were out.</li>
            <li> These replacement tips work fine with my Waterpik. They were reasonably priced, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  Shipping was a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> great for gums.&lt;br /&gt;I used ithis and improved my pockets.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend having this item for healthy teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Perfect fit!  Excellent extra parts for both myself and my family for my existing Waterpik unit.  Too bad they don&#x27;t sell these in traditional stores.</li>
            <li> For clarity - the retailer that provided this item did a great job of getting the product to me and there are no negative issues with them.  The issue that I have with the WaterPik Jet tips (the JT-100E) is that they are designed in a way that makes them fail at a high rate.  Specifically there is a groove 360 degrees around it about 5/8\\&quot; from the bottom.  This groove is deep into the plastic and is designed with right angles at the bottom of the groove.  This right angle causes a reduction in strength, thus is easy to fail.  There is no operational reason for the bottom of the groove to be at right angles - it can be made with a curvature. Instead of paying for expensive tips over and over again, I will be looking for a brand that isn&#x27;t designed with tip problems.</li>
            <li> Good product... Works as advertised. For me, I thought that the something with a finer tip would be better. Just needed something to get under the gums better!</li>
            <li> just like the ones they replaced.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for OEM tip</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of my dentist.  I had put it off for too long, thinking regular dental floss was sufficient.  Now that I have been using this for several months, I realize how wrong I was and how glad I am that I finally purchased it. It is easy to use and works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I never though I would purchase a Waterpik, but it has most certainly done the job.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Went around several local stores, but no luck finding a small inexpensive item like this (don&#x27;t get me started).  Amazon had it for a good price and it came promptly.  And it was the right part for my unit.</li>
            <li> I love this.  When my originals flamed out, I was using a noisy large replacement and I forgot how effective and how much more quiet this one is.  Would definitely reorder these gems1!!</li>
            <li> Because I like my Water-Pik WP100 very much, when I needed replacement jet tips, I checked several suppliers, chose Amazon, and the 2 packs of jet tips were sent by OneCountryShop. Although 7-day delivery was estimated, the small package arrived the very next day after I ordered them. Wow!</li>
            <li> Love my Waterpik and these tips.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share a WaterPik Pro. Everything is color coded to be blue. When I ordered the two extra tips, I was happy to find one of them was white (the little collar at the base of the pik). Now I am stuck with using fingernail polish or finding some model car paint that I can use to paint the collar of the other one. We really don&#x27;t need to be exchanging germs, now, do we?</li>
            <li> Nothing better than healthy gums and teath!!! Will definately order replacements in the future. Great Price. Recommend for all users.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my waterpik, once opened I can&#x27;t return it, so I just wasted my money. Not happy</li>
            <li> I bought the new Waterpik Waterflosser Ultra, and the tips work perfect with it!  I ordered two sets, and they were cool enough to send me two sets that all had different colors in the band!  I am very pleased with the product and the shipper!</li>
            <li> i love the water pic. its way easier than getting my little guy to floss or having to do it my self. if you have ever tried to fit your fingers inside a little ones mouth with floss wrapped around them you know exactly what i mean. he likes doing it more than flossing too so less fights for us.</li>
            <li> This is the tool to help you clean out your water heater. Simple design and will extend the life of your water heater. Twice a year is a good schedule for maintenance of your water heater using this wand. Just stow it in the same compartment that you stow your water hose for drinking water...not in the black water bin!</li>
            <li> Writing a review for a replacement tip is not that exciting. Nevertheless, the WaterPik we purchased (100 series) only had picks for one person ( ... and why is that? I wouldn&#x27;t purchase a machine for each person in my house!), so I needed to find one for myself. I went to countless stores, with no success. Low and behold, Amazon has replacement tips! Now I can use the WaterPik too :D</li>
            <li> It is what you would expect it too be, a replacement waterpik tip.  Arrived quickly and works as advertised.  Not too sure why anyone would rate less than a four on here, been using this replacement for about 2 months and have not had one problem.</li>
            <li> Great addition to dental hygiene.  Easy to use.  Adding a little mouthwash gets two objectives done at once  Definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> They work and the price was good.</li>
            <li> These proved just as good as the originals that came with the waterpik.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s exceedingly difficult to know whether the tip you are ordering is actually the same one as the original in the box.  They do a really lousy job of differentiating between all the various types of replacements available and whether they fit all the models, etc. I got lucky when I ordered these and they were the proper replacement, but it was a crap shoot when ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Waterpik for years to prevent food build-up around my crowns.  I haven&#x27;t had to replace any tips yet, but it&#x27;s reassuring to know I have extra ones on hand for both health reasons and possible breakage.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the exact same that come with the Waterpik WP 100 so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I don&#x27;t know how much more I can tell you about a replacement tip for a Waterpik but it&#x27;s the exact same brand (not a cheap knock-off) as the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Quality Waterpik (OEM) manufacture; same basic tips as those that come with the Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> My teeth have food, food stuck in teeth, water blow food, no food in teeth, it floss my teeth, my teeth now clean.</li>
            <li> Prior to selecting any of these tips for your Waterpik, be sure to go to the Waterpik site and lookup the correct tip model for your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model number is on the bottom of your Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you select the wrong tip it will not work and may be impossible to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new tip restores the jet intensity to its original spec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and the tip fit perfectly--each one is good for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all our lives ? Thank goodness our Dentist recommended it. Just keep settings at 8 otherwise you might as well use it as a pressure washer.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement tips for my WaterPik, - and had looked in stores but the price was too high to my thinking.  This was exactly what I needed and at the \\&quot;right\\&quot; price.  The product arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to describe these except to say they do exactly what they are supposed to do. They fit the machine well and help keep my daughters teeth clean between her braces.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  Ordered them.  They came.  We like using the waterpik itself.  These are just replacements.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li> Always great could not find replacements in rite aid so just dialed you up</li>
            <li> Original waterpik product. It came in two colors (blue and white), facilitating the differentiation of the jet for share Waterpik with the family. Fit perfectly in WP-100.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love my Waterpik and these replacement tips are great to have. My only criticism is for the seller and that is that they did not send my total order. Amazon took care of everything, which is why I did not rate it down.</li>
            <li> It doesnt throw the water current as strong as the original one.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for this in stores and cannot find any, so as a last resort, I looked on Amazon and found them. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit and I ended up buying a water flosser. So much better.</li>
            <li> I made a false move with my waterpic and broke the original Jet Tip&lt;br /&gt;I have the battery powered unit and was a little worried it might be more of a custom fit?&lt;br /&gt;But no, it fits fine and my teeth are happy. No worries.</li>
            <li> If your tips somehow wear out or break these are a great replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought these so my girlfriend and I could share the waterpik and have different color tips to tell them apart. They work great and are the same as the original ones that come with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these tips to go along as spares for our new Waterpic Flooser.  They fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS. Perfectly.  They also fit our Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W which we have for traveling.  The price was right too.</li>
            <li> replaced the broken one and it works like new.  Love my waterpic have had one for years.  Wouldn&#x27;t live without one</li>
            <li> It was not the plastic tip, it has a rubber tip. It was not what I thought or wanted. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my damaged one.</li>
            <li> exactly the same as the ones that came with my unit. Good product and reasonable price. color coding would be a nice additional feature but is not offered.</li>
            <li> There were the ones I wanted. But I think your stance on the Confederate Flag is rediculous</li>
            <li> When I ordered new brushes I also ordered he jet tips.  I had inherited the waterpik machine &amp; there were no jet tips included.  Just hwat I wanted.  When I want to order more I now know where to order them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe how much these things cost, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money for something that will last.  We tried the &#x27;bargain store&#x27; versions and they barely lasted a month.  The real thing lasts a year or more with frequent use, if one is careful.</li>
            <li> First I ordered at the Water Pik store but the price was more and the shipping charges were extreme.  Ordering through Amazon was quick and economical.  I received the product in two days.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement tips for the Waterpik flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t use them yet, as I still have several of the original tips.</li>
            <li> Wife and I share a waterpick-great tool by the way.  Haven&#x27;t had to replace the jet tips over the couple months we&#x27;ve had it, so not sure you need to have extras laying around.  But I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to have it covered for when you do...your call.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong size for my waterpik. Didn&#x27;t realize there were more than one size. For the cost, it&#x27;s too time consuming to seek a replacment/refund.</li>
            <li> The box was broken when I got it right out of the mail, the plastic was broken on one of them and half the class jet tip was dangling out. Then I found pieces of the plastic that popped from the mini box was in the mail. Was disappointed in this but other then that it was fine.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time as promised and is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old heads with these. Not certain why they recommend replacing them when nothing but water runs through them, but I did and all is well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i buy this item for my sister, she uses it frequently, and she didn&#x27;t complain about it before, therefore its the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My old ones were really really old and I couldnt remember to replace them (or remember to write down the #) when i went to WalMart.  So late one night I found these on the internet.  Quick delivery.  Happy to have them.</li>
            <li> As they get older, the hole in the tip seems to get larger due to the water pressure, so the effectiveness lessens.  The new tips work very well, and it&#x27;s easy to notice the difference when replacing an older one.</li>
            <li> i need it for my waif and maybe buy more for my cheilder , its ok i u have family</li>
            <li> These are the same as the originals and work just like the originals do.  no sense buying a knock off because these are priced right</li>
            <li> I bought these Water Pik Jet Tips because they direct the water stream directly between the teeth.  Great jet tips.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month.  My teeth do feel better.     Small irritants:  The lid on top of the water tank is unstable and often when I try to put it back in place, it drops in to the water tank. It has to be removed to fill water and it is not hinged.    I wish there was a separate holder/stand to keep the piks.  We bought extra piks for other family members and they are still being stored in the paper conainter it came in.    I stopped removing the water tank to fill it ( concerned that its fit to the bottom might wear-out over time).  I just use a water bottle to fill it.    Anyway waiting for dentist&#x27;s comments at the next visit.    Tom ..</li>
            <li> teeth never felt so clean.  buying this as gifts for friends and family</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new WaterPik because these WaterPik heads fit perfectly in my machine , thank you so much</li>
            <li> fit my old waterpik, so I can still use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the Waterpik flosser! Teeth and mouth feel super clean after using it. Use it to have great dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning my teeth. The waterpik cleans in between my so so well and they feel so clean after.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works with my waterpic as promised.  I bought these replacement heads so that my husband and I could share a waterpic, but it was so hard to find additional pic.  Crazy that drugstores and bed and bath stores don&#x27;t carry replacements for waterpic, but carry lots of replacements for other brands/types of dental hygiene electronics. Glad to have found these.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a backup for the ones that came with the waterpik. Got here quick, packaged well and was exactly as advertised. Jet tips are color coded.</li>
            <li> Fits and works. That is all I ask. And delivery is almost overnight.</li>
            <li> Fits my junior water pik perfectly!</li>
            <li> So, they are tips for the water pik, what&#x27;s to say. They fit my water pik and do that job. I was unable to find these at any regular store so resorted to the internet. These were $5 cheaper than my dentist wanted.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Waterpik! Very convenient to be able to order replacement tips on amazon as well. Very happy with this product - fits perfectly :)</li>
            <li> Work great.  I had no idea I needed to replace my tips, but these new ones gave my water pik renewed force.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect. What more can I say. The water comes out great</li>
            <li> Finally got the right tips for my waterpik. I love my waterpik.</li>
            <li> Great price on an item I use regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on this rating,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s entirely possible the tip would have worked fine if WATERPIK HADN&#x27;T CHANGED THE DIAMETER OF THE TIPS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These tips won&#x27;t fit my older unit, so I&#x27;m out the entire cost, my teeth are rotting and my wife will no longer kiss me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It would have been helpful if Waterpik alerted customers that their unit has been arbitrarily made obsolete.</li>
            <li> These are original parts still in original pkg so of course they work awesome! I would highly recommend these tips.</li>
            <li> A good product.  The jet tips came in good condition.  I would buy these again from amazon.  They come with different color indicators for identification.</li>
            <li> replacement tips are the same as the originals</li>
            <li> great value for replacement tips</li>
            <li> Great clean. I don&#x27;t always floss, so this is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> When I moved, I lost my waterpik tips.  These replacements work as good as the original tips.  MADE IN CHINA.  I recommend this product and will buy them again if I ever need to replace them.</li>
            <li> my dental hygenist recommended i start water flossing due to my receding gumline.  i didn&#x27;t know if i could keep the commitment to water floss every day, but now i&#x27;m hooked!  my mouth feels even cleaner now.  &amp; all you need are these regular tips; when you initially purchase the water flosser, it comes with all kinds of different tips; but all you need is this one.  it works great!</li>
            <li> i like it ,but  i find  it is too expensive,  i find it was more cheap  in  coaso.  Waterpik Replacement Jet Tips - JT-100E - 2 Pack</li>
            <li> After-market parts sometimes don&#x27;t fit because they&#x27;re knock-offs but these seem to be the genuine article. They seem to work just like the ones that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, compact size &amp; really makes a difference in look &amp; feel of your teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it.  The order was wrong, and woundn&#x27;t work on my Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend if it would  work.</li>
            <li> original pieces lasted alittle over a year&lt;br /&gt; i bought 3 of them, thinking the new ones will last about the same, this product by ffar outlasts orignal&lt;br /&gt;i still am using the one nozzel for cles to a year</li>
            <li> These Waterpik Replacement Jet Tips go on and off in a couple of seconds.  Everyone has their own color tip.  Probably healthier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lenny Baby</li>
            <li> Purchased this as an extra. Usually by the time I need extra parts for the products I buy they are no longer made, so this time I am prepared.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say, other than they fit perfectly, just like the original tips that came with this excellent Waterpik unit..</li>
            <li> I find these are good replacements for your waterpik, I think they work extremely well, and feel that the value is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit replacement for your Waterpik jet tips.  Much more convenient than trying to find in local stores, which don&#x27;t carry all models.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik, it is easy to use and it does a very good job, I always had trouble flossing because my fingers hurt,&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> You will feel the difference in your mouth when you use new Waterpik Jet tips.  Remember to replace them every 3-4 months or as needed.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good condition and worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> This water pic is great, it gets between areas were the toothbrush miss and helps to massage your gums, you get a great feeling from that.</li>
            <li> i have not used it yet so i really can not give my opinion.  I am sure that it will be fine.</li>
            <li> These tips were just replacements for the waterpic that I use almost every day.  I was unable to find them in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> Didnt fit my machine.</li>
            <li> I Love my waterpik...I just returned from my dentist and she said my gums are looking so much healthier. Yippee!</li>
            <li> product good - fast shipping</li>
            <li> My dentist said that Waterpik would get out food that flossing and brushing just misses.  I tried flossing with a tape floss, brushing and then use the Waterpik.  I was amazed and how many food particles came out between my teeth with the Waterpik.  My gums are so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> Could be cheaper and available at a local store. product worked fine.</li>
            <li> the correct refill.  Would order again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was questioning whether or not you would need these extra tips.  But I guess over time you need them.  They spritz water out and it keeps my teeth cleaned.  I got this in place of using floss, water flossing is more effective.</li>
            <li> Nothing really extraordinary about these tips.  I think that they do what they are supposed to do and I find myself wondering why in the devil I am wasteing my time writing anything about these replacement tips.</li>
            <li> if you have many users buy at list one replacement pack&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t know how to mark each jet tip to each user</li>
            <li> I had some gum pain, most likely as a result of gingivitis. After 3 days of using this, the pain disappeared and my teeth feel much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t say this totally replaces flossing, as the Waterpik didn&#x27;t get all of my particles out. However, it&#x27;s an excellent complement to brushing/flossing as it gets deep into your gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to add hydrogen peroxide or salt to make this an even more effective treatment.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I just wanted replacement tips and these fit perfect so I don&#x27;t have to go out and buy a whole new system.</li>
            <li> I immediately had improvement with my gum tissue. My teeth have never been whiter. The Dentist wanted me to spend 1700.00 on a series of treatment to the receding of my gums. A friend of mine who is a Hygienist told me to get a water pik. If you have gum recession or disease get one!</li>
            <li> Works fine in my machine and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> What can I say? they work on my od water pick</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for original tips. Use it with my wife every day for last 4 months, no problem. Nice color coding.</li>
            <li> excellent value, these are very hard to find locally.  Fit perfectly.  I was surprised to know that these wear out over time with useage.</li>
            <li> I had long-lasting gingivitis that was cured, in part, by removing tartar underneath the gum line and, in part, by scrupulously using the WaterPick device and its attachments. It took me a few days to be completely comfortable using the device but now I thoroughly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really like the waterpik.  Have trouble trying to floss, so this is very helpful - and easier for me. Happy that we got it  works very well.</li>
            <li> great to have to replace &amp; is a great asset to keeping teeth clean &amp; free of debris, especially id&#x3D;f have crowns or a bridge</li>
            <li> The new pick is easier to use and seems more powerful than the older one .I gave one to my grandaughter because she has braces and she really loves it.</li>
            <li> The switch is on the main unit, not the handle, which makes this extremely difficult for kids to use without spraying water everywhere.  The adult versions are much better.</li>
            <li> Great to have extras on hand. We haven&#x27;t used the WaterPik in years. Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!</li>
            <li> My new waterpik flosser with jet tips work great!  I feel like my teeth have just been cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office when I&#x27;m done flossing. The process is really effortless and you do a better job than string flossing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So perfect it seems they weren&#x27;t really necessary.  Bought them with a new Waterpik thinking they were a wear item but these things dont wear out</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement tips when I purchased my waterpik flosser so that my fiance and I could both use the unit.  I like that there are different color bands on each tip so that we can differentiate between his and mine.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll purchase these again when we need more.</li>
            <li> It also cleans very nicely along the gum line.  Nice for people who can&#x27;t floss.  Takes up some counter space on counter top.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a backup and have only tried them once. so far we have no issues with these and the work as stated.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a 2nd one!</li>
            <li> perfect replacements for my water pick, I use my daily and this worked perfect</li>
            <li> The replacement tips are just as good as always</li>
            <li> Great item.  Recommended by my dentist and  would recommend it.  I&#x27;M sure my next checkup will be super.  Thanks alot.</li>
            <li> fits perfect where many replacements don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is our first time using a waterpik and we have had it for over a month now.  My daughter has braces and the ortho says it has improved her cleaning a ton.  We have really enjoyed the waterpik and the kids enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I love my Waterpik WP-100!  The Waterpik is really great for cleaning between the teeth where other products fail, and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for a truly clean mouth!  Problem is, the original product only has tips for one person, so \\&quot;replacement tips\\&quot; are necessary so it can be shared by other family members.  I purchased both the Waterpik WP-100 and the replacement tips on Amazon.  Amazon is always the FIRST place I check for anything I need -  best prices and best selection, and best source for hard-to-find items at a great price!</li>
            <li> worked, fit fine. My parents will look to buy again in the future. Two colors help to tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li> These replacement tips work for the kids waterpik.  The one that is green with the reusable decals.  We got extras so now each kid has their own tip, and can share the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Was as described and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have bought these from more than one seller, they wear out very fast. The rubber tip splits easily. If you look closely they come with the split already started to help them along. Marketing ploy? Probably. I have a couple of deep gum pockets and HAVE to have these to keep infections out. They work great. I&#x27;d pay more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Waterpic makes the mouth feel great.  Great for teeth with crowns.</li>
            <li> Expensive with shipping but works well.</li>
            <li> Saved money and here in no time</li>
            <li> Product worked well and fit well but it would have been nice to have color choices so we could differentiate between family members personal tips.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Speedy Delivery, A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I love these tips. I have crazy teeth and these always manage to get out particles that my floss misses.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are okay.  They break very easily and you can not buy them at any of the stores where I bought my waterpiks.  CVS, Walmart, Wegmans, etc.  Do not carry the replacement jets, but sell the waterpiks.</li>
            <li> Now I can share the fountain with my boyfriend. I came just like described. Happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> These work as they should for some models of the Waterpik water flossing system, but be very careful when ordering that you know which model of flosser you have as some of the stems, which insert into the flosser&#x27;s handle, are different diameters and lengths. When I upgraded to a newer Waterpik model, the previous tips did not fit the new machine.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my Periodontal Hygenist and has met all of my expectations. Very pleased with this product and the transaction.</li>
            <li> works as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I just got the waterpick a few months ago and although it came with a bunch of other (mostly useless) tips, it only came with one of the main tips, so I had to order an extra set of regular tips so that my husband could use it too.</li>
            <li> these are the same as what comes with the waterpick so being a prime member no shipping and no trip to the store</li>
            <li> Compatible; works as expected.</li>
            <li> The basic system is wonderful, it saves time and does a better job than flossing, and these replacement parts were exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my teeth and this jet tip is great and I am able to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Great replacement tip for my travel Water Pick</li>
            <li> Work will with our Waterpik -- best price I could find.  Gives other family members a chance to use the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a replacement piece.  No big deal.  Works fine.  Love my waterpik though.  Use it all the time. Bye</li>
            <li> I ordered the water pic as well as extra tips.Item was as described with fast free shipping. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I am very happy with the waterpik jet flosser, and the additional tips I purchased are nice to have on hand in case one is broken or misplaced.</li>
            <li> I received what I expected.  The items were received in a timely fashion.  I tried to purchase the item at several stores, but no one had them.  The stores had the waterpik, but none had the replacement tips.</li>
