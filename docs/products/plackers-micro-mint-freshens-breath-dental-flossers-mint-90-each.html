    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent flosser!</li>
            <li>They are perfect for kids and adults.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent!!!!</li>
            <li>Plackers are the best flossers out there, with a sturdy flossing thread and study frame design.  </li>
            <li>Even with that move, they&#x27;re still the best flossers out there.  </li>
            <li>Best flossers on the market!</li>
            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>(see my Amazon.com review) are a great combination:</li>
            <li>but these things are great.  </li>
            <li>I can do a good job flossing with the help of Plackers.</li>
            <li>Good product....</li>
            <li>Nice we have amazon with their great shipping.</li>
            <li>but I have good toothpicks</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I always keep a couple of these in my purse and it helps a lot in many situations!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to be honest.  </li>
            <li>One brand of the the stick flossers now has an indication that the product is as effective as wound floss.  </li>
            <li>I can work them and not bite my own finger and can reach to floss.</li>
            <li>The bag says it is the same material as bullet proof vests, this is great, great product!</li>
            <li>but honestly i could use it</li>
            <li>Even if it were not quite as effective, I&#x27;d still recommend it because a floss product I use is better than a product that I don&#x27;t end up using.</li>
            <li>This is the best designed flossers I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>These are the best flossers on either side of the Mississippi, with each use your mouths smells of mint and if you have sensitive gums they will thank you for choosing this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good deal!</li>
            <li>These flossers are the best thing to happen to general home dentistry.</li>
            <li>Mostly just rolls of dental floss.</li>
            <li>What more could you want in a flosser?</li>
            <li>They are pretty good for what for.  </li>
            <li>They glide with ease between all teeth and leave your mouth feeling clean and minty!</li>
            <li>The floss is strong and does not break.</li>
            <li>So far all of these type (not just this brand) have been good.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a clean swipe between each tooth.  </li>
            <li>After exhaustive cross comparisons I believe Plackers are the best out there by far.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are pretty close together, so I tend to tear floss easily.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shred, but sometimes I need to grab another since the floss comes undone (rare).  </li>
            <li>Flossing isn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
            <li>These are terrific, keep your fingers from getting inundated with your own spit.  </li>
            <li>I floss much more frequently than I used to because of this product.  </li>
            <li>a million more times I bet!  because the plastic is so tough it does not make the best toothpick on the other end</li>
            <li>Great for getting to hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>but  great flosser is hard to find and this is it.</li>
            <li>I started using these, and flossed daily, sometimes more often.  </li>
            <li>I like these MUCH better than traditional dental floss that you wrap around your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t been able to find Plackers as frequently as I used to at CVS, RiteAid or other drug stores and often end up walking out empty handed when I look for them, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find them online -</li>
            <li>I usually used the reach mint flavored ones, which work way better than these, plus they have a strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Not sure how anyone could say these are good.  </li>
            <li>flosser is easy to grip and provides enough floss to get around every tooth.</li>
            <li>Item as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They deserve about a 3.5 star rating in my book; buy the US made ones if you are fortunate enough to find any.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain to much.</li>
            <li>They are much stronger, and have yet to break, compared to others I&#x27;ve tried from grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>They are high quality and don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them if you&#x27;ve been looking for a stronger and easier to use product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they moved production to China and their quality has suffered greatly.  </li>
            <li>Seems like most brands I get through half my teeth and the string breaks!  </li>
            <li>The wax string has a slight minty flavor, and the toothpick part works just fine.</li>
            <li>Probably every 20th one the floss will tear off on my first tooth.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s pretty gross.  </li>
            <li>there really aren&#x27;t any American made alternatives I can find</li>
            <li>Live in Alaska, so we do not have a selection of personal items.</li>
            <li>They used to be a little better (and would have gotten five starts from me), when they were still made in the US, but manufacture has been moved to China with a slight decline in quality.  </li>

            <li> Item as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My teeth are pretty close together, so I tend to tear floss easily. This particular brand is the only floss sticks I&#x27;ve used which are difficult to break. The wax string has a slight minty flavor, and the toothpick part works just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to be honest.  I didn&#x27;t floss enough when I used wound floss. I hated how it felt around my fingers.  I almost always wound it too tight. It was awkward for me to get in my mouth.    I started using these, and flossed daily, sometimes more often.  My dentist and hygienist have both noticed a difference in my gums.      One brand of the the stick flossers now has an indication that the product is as effective as wound floss.  Even if it were not quite as effective, I&#x27;d still recommend it because a floss product I use is better than a product that I don&#x27;t end up using.</li>
            <li> Plackers are the only flosser I found that does not end up stuck in my very tight teeth.  Unfortunately they moved production to China and their quality has suffered greatly.  It takes about 2.75 of these to get through my teeth now (used to be about 1.25).  At least they dont shred like the others I have tried, the floss just pulls out of an end.    They deserve about a 3.5 star rating in my book; buy the US made ones if you are fortunate enough to find any.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and arthritis. I can do a good job flossing with the help of Plackers. A friend has some and I tried one. I can work them and not bite my own finger and can reach to floss. Good product....</li>
            <li> Excellent flosser! I buy these for the family. They are perfect for kids and adults. The floss is strong and does not break. Great for getting to hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone could say these are good.  They are an awkward shape and the \\&quot;micro mint\\&quot; ones I bought at wally world have the grossest mint flavor ever.  I usually used the reach mint flavored ones, which work way better than these, plus they have a strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Live in Alaska, so we do not have a selection of personal items. Mostly just rolls of dental floss. Nice we have amazon with their great shipping. This product is excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for what for.  I like carrying one around at all times for dental needs that might arise</li>
            <li> I like these MUCH better than traditional dental floss that you wrap around your fingers.  I rinse the thread after each insert so it&#x27;s a clean swipe between each tooth.  They don&#x27;t shred, but sometimes I need to grab another since the floss comes undone (rare).  So far all of these type (not just this brand) have been good.  I keep a pack at home and one at work.</li>
            <li> Love these! I always keep a couple of these in my purse and it helps a lot in many situations!</li>
            <li> I keep a package of Plackers Dental Flossers at home and another in my shaving kit for overnight trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser is easy to grip and provides enough floss to get around every tooth. This is the best designed flossers I&#x27;ve found so far. The floss string is durable; I haven&#x27;t had one break yet. I also like the pick end of the flosser, which I use to hook food particles from behind my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These flossers and Brush Picks (see my Amazon.com review) are a great combination: no cavities found in my last four dental visits.</li>
            <li> Plackers are the best flossers out there, with a sturdy flossing thread and study frame design.  They used to be a little better (and would have gotten five starts from me), when they were still made in the US, but manufacture has been moved to China with a slight decline in quality.  Even with that move, they&#x27;re still the best flossers out there.  I have very tight teeth, and can usually use only one for my whome mouth.  Other flossers require me to change out the thread or use a new one after a few teeth because they shred or bend or the thread becomes detached from the ends.  I also haven&#x27;t been able to find Plackers as frequently as I used to at CVS, RiteAid or other drug stores and often end up walking out empty handed when I look for them, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find them online - I ordered 6 bags!</li>
            <li> These flossers are the best thing to happen to general home dentistry. I have a horrific time flossers, they always break. These have not, I am very very very rough in using them, and they hold up. The bag says it is the same material as bullet proof vests, this is great, great product! 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good deal!</li>
            <li> Probably every 20th one the floss will tear off on my first tooth. Probably the decline in quality others have mentioned, but I pick them up (a 50 pack for $1) so I can&#x27;t complain to much. I do get a little nervous sticking something from China in my mouth with the toothpaste, lead paint and dog food scandals but there really aren&#x27;t any American made alternatives I can find and I HATE rapping floss around my finger and making it turn blue.</li>
            <li> Flossing isn&#x27;t fun.  In fact it&#x27;s pretty gross.  These are terrific, keep your fingers from getting inundated with your own spit.  They are high quality and don&#x27;t break. I floss much more frequently than I used to because of this product.  What more could you want in a flosser?</li>
            <li> After exhaustive cross comparisons I believe Plackers are the best out there by far.  Seems like most brands I get through half my teeth and the string breaks!  Plackers I will admit I use several times.  I know some people will say thats gross but I use it and throw it on my desk or in my dash and keep using it for days till I just throw it out but honestly i could use it a million more times I bet!  because the plastic is so tough it does not make the best toothpick on the other end but I have good toothpicks but  great flosser is hard to find and this is it.</li>
            <li> Best flossers on the market! Mint taste does not last long but the string is sturdy and does not break.</li>
            <li> These are the best flossers on either side of the Mississippi, with each use your mouths smells of mint and if you have sensitive gums they will thank you for choosing this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been tougher for me to floss the traditional way with my fat little fingers and I&#x27;m not a big fan of getting slobber all over the place...maybe I just did it wrong but these things are great.  They are much stronger, and have yet to break, compared to others I&#x27;ve tried from grocery stores.  I highly recommend them if you&#x27;ve been looking for a stronger and easier to use product.</li>
            <li> These are great! They glide with ease between all teeth and leave your mouth feeling clean and minty! It takes WAY less time to floss with these. Totally worth the price!</li>
