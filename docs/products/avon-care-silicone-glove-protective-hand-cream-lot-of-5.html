            <li> Best hand cream ever!</li>
            <li> Seems like a different formula. Not as emollient.</li>
            <li> Great buy and really like this product.  It works better on my hands than any other lotions I have tried.  It rubs in and does not leave my hands feeling slimy afterward.  It also does not wash off right away when I wash my hands.  I use it at night and in the morning regularly as my hands tend to dry out due to the amount of paper and hand washing i have to do in my job.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 20 years, was nice to not have to go looking for it .</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just as I had hoped! Silicone glove is the best for moisturizing old hands like mine! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using Silicone Glove lotion for many years. While I have tried other hand creams, I have never found any that compare to Silicone Glove. I wash my hands nonstop, so I have a bottle at every sink in my house and work. It leaves my hands feeling soft without the greasy feeling that other lotions do.  I have a hard time finding an avon consultant so I was extremely excited to find it on Amazon! I honestly don&#x27;t think I could survive without this lotion!</li>
            <li> Great hand lotion, and the bundle price is very good.  Will order again when needed.  Not always on sale with Avon</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery of as-described item ~ Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hand cream for years.  It keeps my hands from cracking open around the finger tips.  I have always bought it from Avon but decided to check the price at Amazon and figure I saved about $10.00 on the five tubes.</li>
            <li> This cream makes it so much easier to get dirt, grease and even paint off your hands, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just as great as I remembered from Mom&#x27;s house. Great moisturizer without oily feeling.</li>
