            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this day cream for my husband and he like it very much</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I tried a sample. I have oily skin. when I use this, I feel a layer covering the face but not oily. It works for me so far.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is superior protection for my face.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the Shiseido line.  It does not break out the skin, and has a nice fragrance.  It is expensive, but not as expensive as La Prairie or Revive, a nice alternative.  The NutriPerfect line is relatively light weight.  You can use this under sunscreen and under makeup with no issue.  It is for mature skin (my wife is 53).&lt;br /&gt;This particular purchase was disappointing, because despite the other reviews, my wife received this product unboxed.  She questioned whether it was the real product, so beware - different sellers do not necessarily provide a sealed product.  My wife emailed the seller, Shiseido-Store, expressing her disappointment, and specifically said, &amp;#34;I have been using this product for years. It has a pinkish thin appearance. The product you sent me is a thick white cream. Can you please explain? I don&#x27;t think it is real, and I going to take it to Nordstrom and have them provide an opinion.&amp;#34;  They responded &amp;#34;Hi, I&#x27;m so sorry to hear that.  My products are 100% authentic.  I got them from Shiseido warehouse.  You can take in to any store to make sure it is authentic, If you want to return it I&#x27;ll take it back.  I just want to let you know that I sell original products.Thanks&amp;#34;  So, having used the product itself in the past, my wife really likes it, hence the 5 stars for the product itself, but as to receiving it unboxed and questioning its authenticity, not so happy.&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Do not hesitate to buy any product in the NutriPerfect line, but check the seller carefully and see their feedback before making your purchase.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. Clean and does not irritate sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and got introduced to Shiseido products when I lived in Seattle.  Their day and nightcreams are simply the best.  Not only does the cream feel great on my skin, it really helps with fine line wrinkles.  In fact I often have people think I&#x27;m in my early to mid 30, and I credit these Shiseido products for helping that impression.  They are expensive, but a small amount goes a long way and is worth the cost.  IMHO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. The Cream is fresh and it is in a new condition, like never open. But another cream ( Bio Per. advance Super restoring cream) I ordered the same place( DiscountPerfumes) is made me disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great cream, nice to know I can get it at a discount.</li>
            <li> Shiseido works. Period. But if you go to a department store, it just costs too much. This vendor supplies super-fast delivery, authentic product...and it&#x27;s Shiseido - of course it works!!</li>
            <li> makes my skin a little red.  it does work very well.  just use a very small amount as it does cause redness on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Not too heavy a cream but goes on well and provides super protection.&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes with a small palette knife which is not needed until one wants to get the very last bit from the bottom.</li>
