            <li>smell good</li>
            <li>Gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas, and everyone sitting around the tree just loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly..</li>
            <li>Classic, everlasting and very very attractive to women.</li>
            <li>my husband has been wearing this for years - I love it, the price and shipping were amazing</li>
            <li>this product is outstanding and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>Stronger fragrance than Dreamer, which I love.</li>
            <li>and I love it would buy it again</li>
            <li>Many people have asked me what product I am using and where can they purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Then magic happens:  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, for this price I am ordering another one after I finish writing this review:-)</li>
            <li>Smells like something a grand father would wear.</li>
            <li>and I am very familiar with what its supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more easily available.</li>
            <li>it smells cheap</li>
            <li>Highly recommended~~~!!!!</li>
            <li>i miss this original Cologne by Versace, Beats all the perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>Used to wear this back in college and almost forgot how much I liked L&#x27;Homme&#x27;s smell on me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because this fragrance is a little stronger and will make a great winter smell.</li>
            <li>The notes on this cologne just give a sweet rush to your nose.</li>
            <li>A little fresh, very good for a gentlemen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect summer scent and always is a hit wherever I go whether it&#x27;s the Hamptons, French Riviera, the Italian Riviera, Miami, or Mexico.</li>
            <li>But more importantly than appearances, the smell of the cologne from the new bottle has a much more powdery aroma than that of the old bottle.</li>
            <li>It absolutely worth any penny.</li>
            <li>&quot; one good spray of this accross the chest and neck (Do Not over due the spray, just one good one two MAX) will last the whole day and night...</li>
            <li>This perfume is characterized by quiet and luxury and suitable for businessman.</li>
            <li>My standard go to for many years.</li>
            <li>you will not find a better price or quality in product such as this one anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I have been using Versace L&#x27;Homme products for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>I got my first bottle as a gift while in Italy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After wearing this perfume for the first time, my reaction was -- yuk.</li>
            <li>I have received many complements from complete strangers walking or sitting near me.</li>
            <li>pure genius.  </li>
            <li>I have a bottle of the real stuff which I have had for years</li>
            <li>I reccommmend to everybody to please purchase all your needs and wants here</li>
            <li>It really is two scents in one.</li>
            <li>I own several Versace fragrances, so I took a chance on this because the price was in the low $20s.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and for the past couple of years Dunhill Pure and &amp;#34;d&amp;#34; which I still like, but it is great to come back to Versace.</li>
            <li>For the first hour, this smells loud and hissy.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that clued me into this though, before I even sprayed it was that the logo printed on the new bottle does match identically to the old bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid as high as $65 for this...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Seems to be one of those high end scents that appeals to both men and women, but for different&lt;br /&gt;reasons.</li>
            <li>On paper it smells like urinal cake; on skin, it&#x27;s a little more industrial cleaning product.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to buy an original one</li>
            <li>A classic smell that seems to adjust well to my body natural goodness.</li>
            <li>The only problem is making it through the first hour.  </li>
            <li>Smells EXACTLY like a urinal cake for the first few hours then turns very feminine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this as my signature scent for nearly 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>and it never gets old.  </li>
            <li>that my daughter is going to let him wear this fragrance unless she is with him - the scent is just far too sexy&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>It simply does not smell identical to that of the old bottle.</li>

            <li> A great purchase of versace!!</li>
            <li> Quite honestly.. I believe the product I received is a fake, imposter cologne. I have a bottle of the real stuff which I have had for years and I am very familiar with what its supposed to smell like. The first thing that clued me into this though, before I even sprayed it was that the logo printed on the new bottle does match identically to the old bottle. But more importantly than appearances, the smell of the cologne from the new bottle has a much more powdery aroma than that of the old bottle. My girlfriend confirms this suspicion as well. I actually was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, but she insists its not real. It simply does not smell identical to that of the old bottle. I&#x27;m very disappointed and will never purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> very good quality and affordable price. this product is outstanding and the price is amazing. you will not find a better price or quality in product such as this one anywhere else. I reccommmend to everybody to please purchase all your needs and wants here, you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad........</li>
            <li> I like this spray, not very intense but lasting long, no smell of alcohole nor smoke which I don&#x27;t like. A little fresh, very good for a gentlemen.</li>
            <li> Stronger fragrance than Dreamer, which I love. I own several Versace fragrances, so I took a chance on this because the price was in the low $20s. I&#x27;m glad I did because this fragrance is a little stronger and will make a great winter smell.</li>
            <li> Every man should try this cologne</li>
            <li> smell good and I love it would buy it again</li>
            <li> THEE, best, sexiest men&#x27;s cologne ever created on the planet...pure genius.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this as my signature scent for nearly 20 yrs. and it never gets old.  After a shower just \\&quot;walk into\\&quot; one good spray of this accross the chest and neck (Do Not over due the spray, just one good one two MAX) will last the whole day and night...UNTOLD amounts of compliments from women. Creates an unbeleivable attraction by others.  I&#x27;ve paid as high as $65 for this...this price is a steal, get two!  Amazing scent. For a man, its perfection.</li>
            <li> I have been using Versace L&#x27;Homme products for more than ten years.  The products I have used, After Shave Lotion, After Shave Balm and Stick Deodorant are excellent.  They hold their scent all day.  Many people have asked me what product I am using and where can they purchase it.  The only complaint I have with this product is that it is hard to find.  It requires searching to obtain the products, especially the Balm and Deodorant Stick.  I wish it were more easily available.</li>
            <li> This perfume is characterized by quiet and luxury and suitable for businessman.</li>
            <li> I bought it out of curiosity. it smells cheap (lemonlike), i just use it as a everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> For the first hour, this smells loud and hissy.  On paper it smells like urinal cake; on skin, it&#x27;s a little more industrial cleaning product.  Then magic happens:  an hour later comes the dry-down where it softens into a wonderful man&#x27;s scent with hints of leather and spice.  Very nice.  The only problem is making it through the first hour.  It really is two scents in one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this men&#x27;s fragrance for years. It&#x27;s the perfect summer scent and always is a hit wherever I go whether it&#x27;s the Hamptons, French Riviera, the Italian Riviera, Miami, or Mexico. It&#x27;s one I wear all summer at least a few times a week. Highly recommended~~~!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for several years now. I got my first bottle as a gift while in Italy. I have received many complements from complete strangers walking or sitting near me. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my favorites.  A classic smell that seems to adjust well to my body natural goodness.</li>
            <li> I received the Versace not only on time but I am so happy. i miss this original Cologne by Versace, Beats all the perfumes out there. Love it</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas, and everyone sitting around the tree just loved the smell. In fact, I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;think that my daughter is going to let him wear this fragrance unless she is with him - the scent is just far too sexy&lt;br /&gt;for the rascal! Seems to be one of those high end scents that appeals to both men and women, but for different&lt;br /&gt;reasons. A winner.</li>
            <li> Taste of perfume varies from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing this perfume for the first time, my reaction was -- yuk. It reminded me about Grey Flannel. It felt like a perfume from 60&#x27;s. I will not suggest this perfume to anyone in my age group.</li>
            <li> Used to wear this back in college and almost forgot how much I liked L&#x27;Homme&#x27;s smell on me! I have tried others and for the past couple of years Dunhill Pure and &amp;#34;d&amp;#34; which I still like, but it is great to come back to Versace. I am not sure what the other reviewer got in the mail because this EDT lasts for at least 10-12 hours strong which I can&#x27;t say the same for Dunhill. As a matter of fact, for this price I am ordering another one after I finish writing this review:-)</li>
            <li> This crap truly smells horrible! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Smell very good. It great gift for a man. It absolutely worth any penny. Be careful to buy an original one</li>
            <li> The notes on this cologne just give a sweet rush to your nose. Classic, everlasting and very very attractive to women.</li>
            <li> Smells EXACTLY like a urinal cake for the first few hours then turns very feminine.  Just terrible....</li>
            <li> The smell is disgusting. Smells like something a grand father would wear. Not for teens guys</li>
            <li> Great product,  I love it!</li>
