            <li>All of them have kept their effectiveness for many years.  </li>
            <li>most oils come in in health food stores.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with years ago.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a better process or plant source.</li>

            <li>the tea tree oil tends to float on top of the water.</li>
            <li>the tea tree oil tends to float on top of the water.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my fever blisters at bay, in my washer to freshen winter hats and gloves, and many skin problems including bug bites and rashes.  </li>
            <li>Bottle size is perfect and I carry smaller 1/2 dram bottles in my handbag at all times.  </li>
            <li>While researching, i have discovered many uses.</li>
            <li>I immediately saw results after using it and by day two I was more than 75% blemish</li>
            <li>So so much better.</li>
            <li>Great price and delivered fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I can see how it would bother most.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my cystic acne on my chin and around my mouth and it has reduced swelling/redness for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love what this is doing for my face and my acne</li>
            <li>I have read up on more uses for tree tea oil  </li>
            <li>Too soon to say I love it.</li>
            <li>fold it 2 times and apply the oil to it by covering the bottle opening and just inverting it real quick.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper top.  </li>
            <li>Love the product line though.</li>
            <li>2 or 3 times per month, I really love using appx 1/2 teaspoon of tea tree oil in a 16 oz bottle of water to flush my vagina as well as anus.  </li>
            <li>favorite use of it is for my face.  </li>
            <li>So so many uses for this.  </li>
            <li>I always love Tea Tree Oil....</li>
            <li>I love this tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>My wart is gone, my mozzie bite is relieved, my son&#x27;s acne is getting better.</li>
            <li>Because I had it I also decided to try it on some toenail fungus I had that had not been able to get rid off.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>ears already feel better in one day.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you read directions and the warnings.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Great for colds and coughs, settling digestion and treating skin issues - particularly itchy feet.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty good</li>
            <li>Although strong, it has a very fresh lingering scent which is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, and antiseptic-smelling for sure.</li>
            <li>Many other brands I can find out and about are &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; with mineral oils, whereas this has that biting delicious scent and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>So I got this not realizing that if you&#x27;re using it topically, it should ideally be diluted.</li>
            <li>It does not have a dropper pour spout so it is easy to pour out if you need to.</li>
            <li>and you will find that it is most useful in so many ways.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong, but some folks like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is strong</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I found the  the strong smell of the oil to linger as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but you get use to it.</li>
            <li>everywhere I went and the smell was strong.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.  </li>
            <li>This pharmaceutical oil is a strong grade.</li>
            <li>The price was right, the delivery was swift, the packaging fine, so I am pleased and do not have much more to tell about tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But keep in mind that the tree tea oil has a very strong scent and may not be right for those who use it.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice, fresh, and clean on my face.</li>
            <li>I have a nose piercing and with any piercing, it&#x27;s important to maintain it well.</li>
            <li>I put some in a mister filled with water and spray their bedding.)</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my skin, I did not feel any of the light tingling that always occurs after the application of tea tree oil to skin.  </li>
            <li>Consult with your physician or primary health care provider before using tea tree oil on yourself or your family.e shampoos)  -  </li>
            <li>Consult with your physician or primary health care provider before using tea tree oil on yourself or your family.</li>
            <li>Smells like turpentine but works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Maybe we caught it early but as far as we know it works great!!</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to find something that really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>I use this full strength (a drop or two is good) on my scalp when dandruff or itchy isn&#x27;t helped by normal dandruff or tea tree</li>
            <li>I am ordering some more right now.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic to mosquito bites (Epi pen, hospital, that kind of allergic)</li>
            <li>and it will be a friendly product.  </li>
            <li>first read about tea tree oil online for it&#x27;s many uses, and had to try it out for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how this is gentler in scent and vapor than other tea tree oils yet seems to be more effective.</li>
            <li>I put this on a Q-tip and clean of the site and my ring and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li>Then they feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mold is then gone and the area has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny clean and scalp feels so soothed--</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to clean your vaporizer</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to clean your vaporizer</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that this bottle does not come with a dropper, so you may want to invest in a glass dropper specifically for this, as it would be very easy to pour out too much.</li>
            <li>good quality, last long&lt;</li>
            <li>REMEMBER YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE, TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>parents have a boat and Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for helping remove any musty mildew smell that can be common after winter storage.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the floral fragrance you may come to expect, this is full strength oil</li>
            <li>Beware when mixing this with anything, as the smell is overpowering, it&#x27;s not a bad smell,</li>
            <li>I have used it on my eyelid, without any real problems, but use sparingly, because the oil creeps over the skin/eyelid and will cause temporary discomfort to the eye in a eucalyptus or menthol type effect, easily stopped by lightly wiping excess oil away with a kleenex or Q-tip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found tea tree oil to be great for dandruff, acne and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>The seller responded quickly, but told me they were unwilling to refund any portion of the purchase price after 30 days, and suggested I contact the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>the seller is great for actually having premium grade tea tree oil, this stuff really works</li>
            <li>I knew not to pull it off, as it was already attached, so I quickly grabbed this and squeezed some drops from a cotton ball onto the tick.</li>
            <li>This tea tree oil is great for my occasional psoriasis outbreaks but buy yourself a glass bottle and dropper to go with it for much, much easier use and applications.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I have found that a combonation between this and castor oil is the trick for my acne.</li>
            <li>You can buy the Spring Valley brand at Walmart, I also dicsovered, pretty cheaply.</li>
            <li>aroma is very invasive do not buy if strong odors will be an issue for you</li>
            <li>I really needed it!!  </li>
            <li>Still, you get a good amount of product for a decent price and it seems to work mostly like my other brand.</li>
            <li>and I dab a little on my toothpaste since I have heard it&#x27;s great for gums.</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and pleasant to me - it smells odd at first, but I&#x27;ve tried several tea tree oils before, and this certainly smells very fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of tea tree oil for warts, as they seem to be the only thing that can get rid of the most stubborn ones.</li>
            <li>but if you suffer from external hemorrhoids this stuff works amazing as an anesthetic.</li>
            <li>I kind of like it, actually.</li>
            <li>It is particularly useful in helping to restore ph levels after menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li>I used tea tree oil in my body soap and my shampoo for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of tea tree oil, and found this bottle to be particularly strong and potent, which I like.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>I put it on twice a day: in the morning and at night right after I shower.</li>
            <li>It starts healing things right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user and promoter of tea tree oil for its ability to naturally and safely kill and prevent bacteria, viruses, fungus, toxins and irritations on the skin and in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Not as great as a couple of other brands I have tried but decent for the price.</li>
            <li>So you need to have your own dropper or you will have a huge mess on your hands.</li>
            <li>If you are not sensitive to VERY strong smells, you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Once I removed it it instantly felt better.</li>
            <li>At first my dog wanted no parts of this smelly stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most definitely pharmaceutical grade.</li>
            <li>Used it for my sitz bath after having my first baby and it works well in the pain relief and healing process</li>
            <li>Finally ran out and needed more.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>#34;oil&amp;#34; from WW.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a week and my skin is already responding pretty well.</li>
            <li>Probably more psychological than anything, but it makes me feel like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>and I applied it for the first time without realizing it needed to be diluted.</li>
            <li>I  have used it so many different ways</li>
            <li>and it has never failed me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Apparantly, it didn&#x27;t like it and willingly unattached itself in an effort to get away from the tea tree oil, where it proceeded to get squashed in a tissue and flushed).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I took the advice of one of the reviewers and applied it to a couple of tags that were starting to appear and am glad to report they went away.</li>
            <li>Really clears up my acne!  </li>
            <li>and since then I hadn&#x27;t been able to hear much in my left ear.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it would be time to try a more natural approach since I also have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about the many uses for tree tea oil and finally ordered me a bottle</li>
            <li>This is a high quality yield at a long lasting portion for a great price.</li>
            <li>It is great for using topically on the skin and has a bunch of other uses.  </li>
            <li>I know exactly how much I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>So easy to order this stuff online instead of having to go to five different stores to try and find it.</li>
            <li>Luckily the market near my home carries it</li>
            <li>I then went to sleep and woke up to a numbing effect and noticed it was starting to heal very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in a dark glass jar to preserve the oil and keep it fresh and potent for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>Mix one cap of oil in large spray bottle then fill with water.</li>
            <li>It can be toxic and poisonous in certain quantities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product seems to be pure.</li>
            <li>it works at a fraction of the cost of drugstore products which may have great applicators but are weak.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I asked for at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend diluting it on first use (I used olive oil) until you know if it will irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I really like the way Tea Tree Oil smells.</li>
            <li>It gave me a headache, but I would have continued using it, because it did seem to be working VERY well.</li>
            <li>POTENT STUFF BE CAREFUL, DILUTE WITH LOTION AND MIX WELL,</li>
            <li>but this mixed with some shampoo and your bug free.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has a very pungent odor.</li>
            <li>Countless over priced marine products (gels, sprays etc.) are available.  </li>
            <li>I have just now started using for acne areas and gently apply with Q-tip.</li>
            <li>Stunk his whole truck up.</li>
            <li>I discovered after receiving my order that it was twice as much $ as it is at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>In both cases it works very well</li>
            <li>It really works well on sun and acne spots though you must be patient and diligent when using.  </li>
            <li>I found that the Spring Valley Tea Tree Oil is MUCH weaker than the Mason Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>I have a Dr. prescribed cream for my outbreaks that never does much on</li>
            <li>Mixing the oil with the ointment keeps the oil on your skin longer and really helps it absorb.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s very healing to my body.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what else to put here.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this oil out after I used a whole bottle of KIS brand Tea Tree oil that came in a sampler set.  </li>
            <li>Once I unwrapped safety plastic from bottle cap, the whole cap broke apart.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It really cleans any lingering bacteria.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the prompt service</li>
            <li>Very affordable Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really cleared up my skin</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>and I really miss that</li>
            <li>Good, once you get past the smell!</li>
            <li>Had been using other over the counter wart products and even had been frozen off by the doctor, but this is what finally took care of it for good.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with cystic acne for most of my teen and adult life, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for it, but it was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This site has a list of what each oil does, what you can and can&#x27;t use it with, and oils to stay away from if you have certain conditions like high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but not worth double the price.</li>
            <li>I was using prescription topicals for the incredible itch and inflammation of the scalp that only help a little and in two days of use, the itching stopped and the constant shedding of hair throughout the day went away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As long as this thing is available, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>yes...worked much better than that oiled down &amp;</li>
            <li>Unlike cheaper versions, this is less camphorous but somehow more concentrated.</li>
            <li>Then I did a research online and learned that tea tree oil is the best treatment for cold sores, plus it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Will not purchase this particular brand/product ever again.</li>
            <li>In theory I&#x27;m sure you could damage or ruin a humidifier if you don&#x27;t properly remove any residue left by tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>In theory I&#x27;m sure you could damage or ruin a humidifier if you don&#x27;t properly remove any residue left by tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>Second favorite use is for bug bites or rash, it instantly soothes the are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a day I could hear better and the gunk that was in my ears loosened enough to finally use an ear wax removal tool to try to remove it.  </li>
            <li>High grade oil.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t use it full strength on your skin the first time and use extreme caution when using this on children.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy smell of many tea tree oils</li>
            <li>slow but effective without</li>
            <li>and he has been wart free for over a month now after spending about 3 months trying other methods.  </li>
            <li>I live in flip flops so reading some holistic reviews i opted for tea tree oil to speed up the process.</li>
            <li>I have purchased MANY brands of tea tree oil in the past.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon, and they were only willing to refund me a small percentage of the purchase price, since more than 30 days have passed.  </li>
            <li>If applied 2-3 times a day with a Q-tip on tags, I&#x27;ve found it to eventually (1-2 months) eliminates the tag without the need for a Dr to remove, which is not usually covered by insurance (it&#x27;s considered cosmetic surgery).</li>
            <li>It also numbs a little, so I could see how this would feel great on a small cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>note, this is available as Wal-Mart for half the price</li>
            <li>You can buy this exact bottle of Tea Tree oil in the pharmacy section of your local Walmart near the vitamins.  </li>
            <li>All other acne treatments are full of chemicals that can harm your skin.</li>
            <li>NOT very good or smart to not to seal these in a simple cheap zip-lock bag!</li>
            <li>it smells very strong, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t clear up the toe fungus as I had thought</li>
            <li>and with our east coast rains... the woodline I had to clear was bug bite land.</li>
            <li>The nail is growing out clear.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for a variety of things in my home from treating blemishes, adding this to my homemade cleaning/disinfecting sprays, adding a few drops to questionable laundry, antiseptic purposes, boil/abcess treatment, cleaning brushes and makeup brushes with a few drops of this, some water and a drop of liquid handsoap, and most recently, I put some of this on a tick that was on my husband&#x27;s foot after doing some yard work.</li>
            <li>I can completely attest to the oil helping since I was also washing it with antibacterial routinely</li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural</li>
            <li>I have tried different kinds of medicine for those, like Abreva, but nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has natural antiviral and antibiotic properties.  </li>
            <li>CAN BURN SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>This is a very low-quality essential oil and, even though it claims it isn&#x27;t, I think it is diluted.</li>
            <li>who could be sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the smell, of course there is one, it is an oil derived from a plant, chances are it will have a natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>You may want to dilute with water if your skin is really sensitive, I don&#x27;t because it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>My medicine cabinet just wouldn&#x27;t be complete without this product.</li>
            <li>I tried Spring Valley because the price of Mason went up considerably.</li>
            <li>It fixed the problem and it felt medicated</li>
            <li>Larger (cystic) blemishes, not so much so.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes, or lips.</li>
            <li>far it is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A natural medicine article recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Natural PRoduct.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 16 year old niece for warts.</li>
            <li>During this time, the product was sealed and kept in an airtight bag in a dark, cool place.  </li>
            <li>I store mine in a cool dark place (in the cabinet under my sink) for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard there are many other uses for Tee Tree Oil (such as treating dandruff), but I&#x27;ve only used it on acne.  </li>
            <li>Given that it&#x27;s supposed to be diluted, a little goes a long way, but it is potent.</li>
            <li>but if I put some of it on a little dish and then muddle it together with a dropper full of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I used a few drops tea tree oil and half a cup of warm water and used a[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Price was about average, the size was right</li>
            <li>I would not wear anything on my feet while getting ready in the morning to let it dry.  </li>
            <li>It spills easily if you are old and shaky like me.....</li>
            <li>but,  for some medical problems you can putt this on full strength (however for home use you want to cut it down</li>
            <li>Applied several times/day for first week and then tapered off to several times/day on only one day per week.</li>
            <li>In my case, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very useful purchase.</li>
            <li>Put it on 3 times daily and over the course of 3 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil can irritate the skin, especially in those who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you choose to add some tea tree oil to your vaporizer or humidifier water be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li>If you choose to add some tea tree oil to your vaporizer or humidifier water be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to completely heal the infection and see if I&#x27;m finally going to get rid of this</li>
            <li>I honestly would be skeptical of an odorless tea tree oil, because to me that would scream processed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On some persistent tags, I&#x27;ve put a band-aid over the tag and then used an eye dropper to put a couple of drops on the pad of the band-aid to give a much longer, stronger effect, but it can be a bit temporarily irritating to surrounding skin, but it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>Particularly, some cystic pimples that never seem to fully go down have almost completely flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On day 3 of such severe pain that i could barely even talk</li>
            <li>That nasty toe fungus you get when you get older, well tea tree oil will take care of it, and it also great as a topical wound antiseptic that is all natural!</li>
            <li>we having purchased in the past products off the drug store shelf with zero results over yes years, This product works not fast but slowly and in weeks good results .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to have multipurpose, natural products on hand that last quite a while, as it only takes a few drops per</li>
            <li>Have had trouble finding that pure tea tree oil</li>

            <li> Because I had it I also decided to try it on some toenail fungus I had that had not been able to get rid off.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> ears already feel better in one day.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you read directions and the warnings.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for colds and coughs, settling digestion and treating skin issues - particularly itchy feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good</li>
            <li> Although strong, it has a very fresh lingering scent which is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, and antiseptic-smelling for sure.</li>
            <li> Many other brands I can find out and about are &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; with mineral oils, whereas this has that biting delicious scent and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> So I got this not realizing that if you&#x27;re using it topically, it should ideally be diluted.</li>
            <li> It does not have a dropper pour spout so it is easy to pour out if you need to.</li>
            <li> and you will find that it is most useful in so many ways.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong, but some folks like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is strong</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I found the  the strong smell of the oil to linger as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but you get use to it.</li>
            <li> everywhere I went and the smell was strong.</li>
            <li> Strong smell.  </li>
            <li> This pharmaceutical oil is a strong grade.</li>
            <li> The price was right, the delivery was swift, the packaging fine, so I am pleased and do not have much more to tell about tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But keep in mind that the tree tea oil has a very strong scent and may not be right for those who use it.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice, fresh, and clean on my face.</li>
            <li> I have a nose piercing and with any piercing, it&#x27;s important to maintain it well.</li>
            <li> I put some in a mister filled with water and spray their bedding.)</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my skin, I did not feel any of the light tingling that always occurs after the application of tea tree oil to skin.  </li>
            <li> Consult with your physician or primary health care provider before using tea tree oil on yourself or your family.e shampoos)  -  </li>
            <li> Consult with your physician or primary health care provider before using tea tree oil on yourself or your family.</li>
            <li> Smells like turpentine but works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Maybe we caught it early but as far as we know it works great!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to find something that really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> I use this full strength (a drop or two is good) on my scalp when dandruff or itchy isn&#x27;t helped by normal dandruff or tea tree</li>
            <li> I am ordering some more right now.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to mosquito bites (Epi pen, hospital, that kind of allergic)</li>
            <li> and it will be a friendly product.  </li>
            <li> first read about tea tree oil online for it&#x27;s many uses, and had to try it out for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how this is gentler in scent and vapor than other tea tree oils yet seems to be more effective.</li>
            <li> I put this on a Q-tip and clean of the site and my ring and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li> Then they feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mold is then gone and the area has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny clean and scalp feels so soothed--</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to clean your vaporizer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to clean your vaporizer</li>
            <li> It is worth noting that this bottle does not come with a dropper, so you may want to invest in a glass dropper specifically for this, as it would be very easy to pour out too much.</li>
            <li> good quality, last long&lt;</li>
            <li> REMEMBER YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE, TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> parents have a boat and Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for helping remove any musty mildew smell that can be common after winter storage.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the floral fragrance you may come to expect, this is full strength oil</li>
            <li> Beware when mixing this with anything, as the smell is overpowering, it&#x27;s not a bad smell,</li>
            <li> I have used it on my eyelid, without any real problems, but use sparingly, because the oil creeps over the skin/eyelid and will cause temporary discomfort to the eye in a eucalyptus or menthol type effect, easily stopped by lightly wiping excess oil away with a kleenex or Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found tea tree oil to be great for dandruff, acne and other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> The seller responded quickly, but told me they were unwilling to refund any portion of the purchase price after 30 days, and suggested I contact the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> the seller is great for actually having premium grade tea tree oil, this stuff really works</li>
            <li> I knew not to pull it off, as it was already attached, so I quickly grabbed this and squeezed some drops from a cotton ball onto the tick.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is great for my occasional psoriasis outbreaks but buy yourself a glass bottle and dropper to go with it for much, much easier use and applications.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I have found that a combonation between this and castor oil is the trick for my acne.</li>
            <li> You can buy the Spring Valley brand at Walmart, I also dicsovered, pretty cheaply.</li>
            <li> aroma is very invasive do not buy if strong odors will be an issue for you</li>
            <li> I really needed it!!  </li>
            <li> Still, you get a good amount of product for a decent price and it seems to work mostly like my other brand.</li>
            <li> and I dab a little on my toothpaste since I have heard it&#x27;s great for gums.</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and pleasant to me - it smells odd at first, but I&#x27;ve tried several tea tree oils before, and this certainly smells very fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of tea tree oil for warts, as they seem to be the only thing that can get rid of the most stubborn ones.</li>
            <li> but if you suffer from external hemorrhoids this stuff works amazing as an anesthetic.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it, actually.</li>
            <li> It is particularly useful in helping to restore ph levels after menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil in my body soap and my shampoo for my own personal use.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of tea tree oil, and found this bottle to be particularly strong and potent, which I like.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I put it on twice a day: in the morning and at night right after I shower.</li>
            <li> It starts healing things right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user and promoter of tea tree oil for its ability to naturally and safely kill and prevent bacteria, viruses, fungus, toxins and irritations on the skin and in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Not as great as a couple of other brands I have tried but decent for the price.</li>
            <li> So you need to have your own dropper or you will have a huge mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> If you are not sensitive to VERY strong smells, you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Once I removed it it instantly felt better.</li>
            <li> At first my dog wanted no parts of this smelly stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most definitely pharmaceutical grade.</li>
            <li> Used it for my sitz bath after having my first baby and it works well in the pain relief and healing process</li>
            <li> Finally ran out and needed more.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> #34;oil&amp;#34; from WW.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and my skin is already responding pretty well.</li>
            <li> Probably more psychological than anything, but it makes me feel like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> and I applied it for the first time without realizing it needed to be diluted.</li>
            <li> I  have used it so many different ways</li>
            <li> and it has never failed me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Apparantly, it didn&#x27;t like it and willingly unattached itself in an effort to get away from the tea tree oil, where it proceeded to get squashed in a tissue and flushed).</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I took the advice of one of the reviewers and applied it to a couple of tags that were starting to appear and am glad to report they went away.</li>
            <li> Really clears up my acne!  </li>
            <li> and since then I hadn&#x27;t been able to hear much in my left ear.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it would be time to try a more natural approach since I also have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about the many uses for tree tea oil and finally ordered me a bottle</li>
            <li> This is a high quality yield at a long lasting portion for a great price.</li>
            <li> It is great for using topically on the skin and has a bunch of other uses.  </li>
            <li> I know exactly how much I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> So easy to order this stuff online instead of having to go to five different stores to try and find it.</li>
            <li> Luckily the market near my home carries it</li>
            <li> I then went to sleep and woke up to a numbing effect and noticed it was starting to heal very quickly.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in a dark glass jar to preserve the oil and keep it fresh and potent for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Mix one cap of oil in large spray bottle then fill with water.</li>
            <li> It can be toxic and poisonous in certain quantities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product seems to be pure.</li>
            <li> it works at a fraction of the cost of drugstore products which may have great applicators but are weak.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I asked for at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend diluting it on first use (I used olive oil) until you know if it will irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I really like the way Tea Tree Oil smells.</li>
            <li> It gave me a headache, but I would have continued using it, because it did seem to be working VERY well.</li>
            <li> POTENT STUFF BE CAREFUL, DILUTE WITH LOTION AND MIX WELL,</li>
            <li> but this mixed with some shampoo and your bug free.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a very pungent odor.</li>
            <li> Countless over priced marine products (gels, sprays etc.) are available.  </li>
            <li> I have just now started using for acne areas and gently apply with Q-tip.</li>
            <li> Stunk his whole truck up.</li>
            <li> I discovered after receiving my order that it was twice as much $ as it is at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> In both cases it works very well</li>
            <li> It really works well on sun and acne spots though you must be patient and diligent when using.  </li>
            <li> I found that the Spring Valley Tea Tree Oil is MUCH weaker than the Mason Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> I have a Dr. prescribed cream for my outbreaks that never does much on</li>
            <li> Mixing the oil with the ointment keeps the oil on your skin longer and really helps it absorb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s very healing to my body.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what else to put here.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this oil out after I used a whole bottle of KIS brand Tea Tree oil that came in a sampler set.  </li>
            <li> Once I unwrapped safety plastic from bottle cap, the whole cap broke apart.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> It really cleans any lingering bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the prompt service</li>
            <li> Very affordable Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really cleared up my skin</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li> and I really miss that</li>
            <li> Good, once you get past the smell!</li>
            <li> Had been using other over the counter wart products and even had been frozen off by the doctor, but this is what finally took care of it for good.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with cystic acne for most of my teen and adult life, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for it, but it was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This site has a list of what each oil does, what you can and can&#x27;t use it with, and oils to stay away from if you have certain conditions like high blood pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but not worth double the price.</li>
            <li> I was using prescription topicals for the incredible itch and inflammation of the scalp that only help a little and in two days of use, the itching stopped and the constant shedding of hair throughout the day went away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As long as this thing is available, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> yes...worked much better than that oiled down &amp;</li>
            <li> Unlike cheaper versions, this is less camphorous but somehow more concentrated.</li>
            <li> Then I did a research online and learned that tea tree oil is the best treatment for cold sores, plus it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Will not purchase this particular brand/product ever again.</li>
            <li> In theory I&#x27;m sure you could damage or ruin a humidifier if you don&#x27;t properly remove any residue left by tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> In theory I&#x27;m sure you could damage or ruin a humidifier if you don&#x27;t properly remove any residue left by tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> Second favorite use is for bug bites or rash, it instantly soothes the are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a day I could hear better and the gunk that was in my ears loosened enough to finally use an ear wax removal tool to try to remove it.  </li>
            <li> High grade oil.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use it full strength on your skin the first time and use extreme caution when using this on children.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy smell of many tea tree oils</li>
            <li> slow but effective without</li>
            <li> and he has been wart free for over a month now after spending about 3 months trying other methods.  </li>
            <li> I live in flip flops so reading some holistic reviews i opted for tea tree oil to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> I have purchased MANY brands of tea tree oil in the past.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon, and they were only willing to refund me a small percentage of the purchase price, since more than 30 days have passed.  </li>
            <li> If applied 2-3 times a day with a Q-tip on tags, I&#x27;ve found it to eventually (1-2 months) eliminates the tag without the need for a Dr to remove, which is not usually covered by insurance (it&#x27;s considered cosmetic surgery).</li>
            <li> It also numbs a little, so I could see how this would feel great on a small cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> note, this is available as Wal-Mart for half the price</li>
            <li> You can buy this exact bottle of Tea Tree oil in the pharmacy section of your local Walmart near the vitamins.  </li>
            <li> All other acne treatments are full of chemicals that can harm your skin.</li>
            <li> NOT very good or smart to not to seal these in a simple cheap zip-lock bag!</li>
            <li> it smells very strong, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t clear up the toe fungus as I had thought</li>
            <li> and with our east coast rains... the woodline I had to clear was bug bite land.</li>
            <li> The nail is growing out clear.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for a variety of things in my home from treating blemishes, adding this to my homemade cleaning/disinfecting sprays, adding a few drops to questionable laundry, antiseptic purposes, boil/abcess treatment, cleaning brushes and makeup brushes with a few drops of this, some water and a drop of liquid handsoap, and most recently, I put some of this on a tick that was on my husband&#x27;s foot after doing some yard work.</li>
            <li> I can completely attest to the oil helping since I was also washing it with antibacterial routinely</li>
            <li> This stuff is all natural</li>
            <li> I have tried different kinds of medicine for those, like Abreva, but nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has natural antiviral and antibiotic properties.  </li>
            <li> CAN BURN SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> This is a very low-quality essential oil and, even though it claims it isn&#x27;t, I think it is diluted.</li>
            <li> who could be sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the smell, of course there is one, it is an oil derived from a plant, chances are it will have a natural smell to it.</li>
            <li> You may want to dilute with water if your skin is really sensitive, I don&#x27;t because it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> My medicine cabinet just wouldn&#x27;t be complete without this product.</li>
            <li> I tried Spring Valley because the price of Mason went up considerably.</li>
            <li> It fixed the problem and it felt medicated</li>
            <li> Larger (cystic) blemishes, not so much so.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes, or lips.</li>
            <li> far it is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A natural medicine article recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great Natural PRoduct.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 16 year old niece for warts.</li>
            <li> During this time, the product was sealed and kept in an airtight bag in a dark, cool place.  </li>
            <li> I store mine in a cool dark place (in the cabinet under my sink) for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard there are many other uses for Tee Tree Oil (such as treating dandruff), but I&#x27;ve only used it on acne.  </li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s supposed to be diluted, a little goes a long way, but it is potent.</li>
            <li> but if I put some of it on a little dish and then muddle it together with a dropper full of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I used a few drops tea tree oil and half a cup of warm water and used a[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Price was about average, the size was right</li>
            <li> I would not wear anything on my feet while getting ready in the morning to let it dry.  </li>
            <li> It spills easily if you are old and shaky like me.....</li>
            <li> but,  for some medical problems you can putt this on full strength (however for home use you want to cut it down</li>
            <li> Applied several times/day for first week and then tapered off to several times/day on only one day per week.</li>
            <li> In my case, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very useful purchase.</li>
            <li> Put it on 3 times daily and over the course of 3 days it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil can irritate the skin, especially in those who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you choose to add some tea tree oil to your vaporizer or humidifier water be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> If you choose to add some tea tree oil to your vaporizer or humidifier water be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to completely heal the infection and see if I&#x27;m finally going to get rid of this</li>
            <li> I honestly would be skeptical of an odorless tea tree oil, because to me that would scream processed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On some persistent tags, I&#x27;ve put a band-aid over the tag and then used an eye dropper to put a couple of drops on the pad of the band-aid to give a much longer, stronger effect, but it can be a bit temporarily irritating to surrounding skin, but it clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> Particularly, some cystic pimples that never seem to fully go down have almost completely flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On day 3 of such severe pain that i could barely even talk</li>
            <li> That nasty toe fungus you get when you get older, well tea tree oil will take care of it, and it also great as a topical wound antiseptic that is all natural!</li>
            <li> we having purchased in the past products off the drug store shelf with zero results over yes years, This product works not fast but slowly and in weeks good results .</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to have multipurpose, natural products on hand that last quite a while, as it only takes a few drops per</li>
            <li> Have had trouble finding that pure tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Also use on scalp to help clear and clean and on random blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have found that if you have a small pimple it works really well with clearing up the blemish within a day or so.  </li>
            <li> Suffering with tinea versicolor for ten years and this this only thing, other than Rx antiboditics that has cleared my chest and back and only after using it twice.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for a couple of different things like my hair for stimuulating my scalp and my new peircings to help them heal and add a little moisture so they won&#x27;t be so dry....</li>
            <li> I purchase from Spring Valley when I need larger bottles of my essential oils as they are cheaper here than other providers in these sizes.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a lice repellent and it works great</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product</li>
            <li> If you have plantar warts that won&#x27;t respond to treatments that even the dermatologist throws at them, try a long regiment of tea tree oil on a band aid.</li>
            <li> I hate putting poisons on my body, Tea Tree Oil is non toxic to humans and even good for you.  </li>
            <li> Then I read about this and mixed it 4 parts mineral oil to 1 part tea tree oil (as directed) and put this in my ear and rubbed it down the side of my neck and the back of my ears.  </li>
            <li> Oil and water don&#x27;t mix and the tea tree oil will typically float on the water so you need to constantly stir and agitate the mixture to keep things mixed</li>
            <li> I do not know if that is typical, or simply because it uses lower grade oil, since this the only bottle I have purchased.</li>
            <li> SOme said it almost made them throw up and sick, some liked it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my acne in check, worked on other skin condition...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Takes the itch away from dry skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the oil for her acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with coconut oil and lavendar for my hair, skin and dry feet.</li>
            <li> Only need a few drops so the 2 fl oz will last months for me.</li>
            <li> We also mix a small amount (3-5 drops) of tea tree oil in a smaller spray bottle with some water and spray directly on teak, wood and other areas that seem to hold any aroma.</li>
            <li> Thick nail stopped growing and a new nail is growing along right behind it.  </li>
            <li> The product smelled STRONGLY of fish oil and only very faintly of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> After applying a small dab for one week, it completely came off.</li>
            <li> , a couple drops goes a long way when mixed in a little bit of shampoo or in a spray bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it did give me some peace of mind that I was hitting it from a few different bacterial killing angles.</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times on my husband.</li>
            <li> bottle has no dropper feature on it, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> wet a cotton swab then dabbed the teal oil on it.</li>
            <li> I do take out my garbage everyday, but the oil&#x27;s smell stayed in the house until I took the garbage outside.  </li>
            <li> Then just hold the wet tissue on the affected area for about 20 seconds and discard.</li>
            <li> I assume it was roughly handled during mail.</li>
            <li> I have heard that people also put a few drops in shampoo or body wash for prevention of any undesirable thing such as lice or mersa.</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil after doing careful scoping online about the \\&quot;best\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li> so be careful not to spill it on carpet or anything you can&#x27;t wash thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working just fine, but I had to stop using it because my sister, who lives with us, became violently ill from the smell!</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops by adding it myself to my shampoo and other items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different from the previous brand I purchased before.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so be careful with dosage!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand</li>
            <li> The smell is extremely pungent, but this stuff works miracles.</li>
            <li> After it got small enough it fell off.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the musty smell is due to the 60% &amp;#34;whatevers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> had an infestation of shelf bugs and a little tree tea oil, vinegar and water sprayed and cleaned with a dry cloth</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked well for me, especially because I don&#x27;t like the chemicals in many repellent sprays.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t have any way of applying the product.</li>
            <li> You can also pour the mixture on a rag and wipe surfaces down.  </li>
            <li> I use this product with my horses and my dogs also in their soaps, I found it helps to cut down on brain rot with my horses</li>
            <li> , it pours down the sides of the bottle and my fingers when I use it</li>
            <li> The item arrived with the cap slightly unscrewed and half the product gone.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> I think it cut the healing time in half and plus added a numbing effect to it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably pay half of what it is listed here.</li>
            <li> I typically take one square of tp</li>
            <li> that was black Jamaican oil</li>
            <li> It can leave a sticky gummy mess in things if it dries up.</li>
            <li> It can leave a sticky gummy mess in things if it dries up.</li>
            <li> and it was tight.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve found some tea tree oil poured in a bottle cap will slowly evaporate and dry up over time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not nearly as strong as the KIS brand, and it has a sour smell to it.  </li>
            <li> &gt; a little goes</li>
            <li> Tingled a little but didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Just a little on the skin</li>
            <li> Within seconds it creates a cooling sensation that lasts for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My skin does look a little better/</li>
            <li> Wife and kids were almost crying because of the scent</li>
            <li> This Dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday, it made my keloid go away.</li>
            <li> She uses everyday and says it works.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil reminds me of turpentine, with a very slight green plant smell, in case you have never smelled it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything (debrox, olive oil, mineral oil, plain  peroxide, OTC products for ear wax) for weeks to loosen whatever was in my ear, but it never would work.  </li>
            <li> so I put it in small plastic bottle I had.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately, I did not open it until 02/2015.  </li>
            <li> Had a terrible scent (&amp; I love the way tea tree smells).</li>
            <li> We improvised, but this one small change would make this a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> No more bugs and haven&#x27;t seen a recurrence of them.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if they have cut it with something</li>
            <li> That is hard to believe when you smell it</li>
            <li> For me it crusted up and got hard, then I peeled the keloid layer by layer over time.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you&#x27;re sensitive to bad smells.</li>
            <li> I just put some on, and to my surprise, the cold sores are already drying up an hour later.</li>
            <li> Putting a drop or two of tea tree oil in a humidifier or vaporizer also seems to help soothe and prevent sinus infections and colds that used to be common for us in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this time and time again and always keep at least one bottle in reserve.</li>
            <li> no more itching!</li>
            <li> It seriously works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously amazed.  </li>
            <li> The smell is horrible but the results are worth if.</li>
            <li> I have a weak stomach but</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with item.</li>
            <li> My ance is almost gone, and the oil production is decreased.</li>
            <li> The cap of the bottle was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of tea tree oil on my face</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer on my face every day</li>
            <li> Then I put a thin layer of castor oil on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is that bad like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> This is not a good quality of tea tree oil!</li>
            <li> I even had to put the applicator pads (purchased separately) in a zip-up plastic baggie before I threw it away, because the smell of the pad coming from the trash can made her ill.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Spring Valley.</li>
            <li> From now on that&#x27;s the only remedy I will use for those nasty cold sores.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I got a really bad cold sore.</li>
            <li> It Was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It burned so bad.</li>
            <li> but then I got bad break out again..</li>
            <li> It smells really, really bad.  </li>
            <li> is bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad fungal ear infection months.  </li>

            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as hand sanitizer rather than the crap to try to sell at stores.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it smelled like crap to me.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be amazed at the crap that came out of my ear.  </li>
            <li> My ears itch terribly and one day I stupidly used q-tips on my ear</li>

            <li> I have a nose piercing and with any piercing, it&#x27;s important to maintain it well. Some people will rely on a saline solution, but I feel an extra bit of reliability using tea tree oil. I put this on a Q-tip and clean of the site and my ring and have never had any issues. If you have kids, put a couple of drops in shampoo to prevent or get rid of lice. Put some on your pet beds to get rid of fleas (it&#x27;s an oil, so I put some in a mister filled with water and spray their bedding.) I&#x27;m highly allergic to mosquito bites (Epi pen, hospital, that kind of allergic) so I mix it with water and spray it on if I&#x27;m in an area where I might encounter problems and it&#x27;s worked well for me, especially because I don&#x27;t like the chemicals in many repellent sprays.Tea tree oil has so many uses, but I&#x27;m just mentioning how it works for me. In my case, a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s a very useful purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil to soothe an infected nose piercing. I can completely attest to the oil helping since I was also washing it with antibacterial routinely but it did give me some peace of mind that I was hitting it from a few different bacterial killing angles.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to use cleaning around the house and in the wash. Only need a few drops so the 2 fl oz will last months for me.</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived the cap was cracked. It wasn&#x27;t packaged well.</li>
            <li> So easy to order this stuff online instead of having to go to five different stores to try and find it. I guess grocery stores can&#x27;t carry everything. Glad Amazon has stuff like this. I used this oil to treat some skin irritations and it worked. Takes the itch away from dry skin. Plus, I really like the way Tea Tree Oil smells. It&#x27;s nice and refreshing. Will order again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years and tried everything from Proactiv to prescriptions from the dermatologist. I thought maybe it would be time to try a more natural approach since I also have sensitive, oily skin. I use this in conjuction with grape seed oil and lavander oil. Grape seed oil is a carrier oil and is also a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. The lavander oil helps control sebum production. I use about 6 drops of grape seed oil with 2 drops each of tea tree oil and lavander oil. This has dramatically helped my skin and acne. My ance is almost gone, and the oil production is decreased. Before using essential oils, you should check out aromaweb.com. This site has a list of what each oil does, what you can and can&#x27;t use it with, and oils to stay away from if you have certain conditions like high blood pressure. It&#x27;s also good to talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the delivery.  The item arrived with the cap slightly unscrewed and half the product gone.</li>
            <li> Used this for my sons jock itch &amp; after two days he said it was gone. Day one he didn&#x27;t have itch or pain. Day two, gone! Maybe we caught it early but as far as we know it works great!!</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my acne in check, worked on other skin condition...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Simply a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I used this only a few times on my husband. It seemed to be working just fine, but I had to stop using it because my sister, who lives with us, became violently ill from the smell! I even had to put the applicator pads (purchased separately) in a zip-up plastic baggie before I threw it away, because the smell of the pad coming from the trash can made her ill. It gave me a headache, but I would have continued using it, because it did seem to be working VERY well. If you are not sensitive to VERY strong smells, you might want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for a couple of different things like my hair for stimuulating my scalp and my new peircings to help them heal and add a little moisture so they won&#x27;t be so dry.... Love this oil it is awesome!,,,!,,,!,,</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good but beware, it stinks!  The cap of the bottle was broken when I received it so I put it in small plastic bottle I had.  It eventually ate thru it!</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you&#x27;re sensitive to bad smells. This stuff made me want to vomit as soon as I opened the bottle. I have a weak stomach but deer pee smells better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> That nasty toe fungus you get when you get older, well tea tree oil will take care of it, and it also great as a topical wound antiseptic that is all natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING for my acne, but nothing helped. I put a thin layer of tea tree oil on my face and I saw a difference overnight. It feels nice, fresh, and clean on my face. All other acne treatments are full of chemicals that can harm your skin. This stuff is all natural so it&#x27;s a lot healthier and better for your skin. If you struggle with stubborn blemishes, I would try this!</li>
            <li> we having purchased in the past products off the drug store shelf with zero results over yes years, This product works not fast but slowly and in weeks good results . For toenail fungus it works at a fraction of the cost of drugstore products which may have great applicators but are weak.</li>
            <li> Very good product! It works!!! I put a thin layer on my face every day and I seen good improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  Mixed together on my hair edges worked well but I ran out.  I purched already mixed but couldn&#x27;t find in on Amazon.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t clear up the toe fungus as I had thought</li>
            <li> Good product it came hoop they recommended for blisters in road marching.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I got a really bad cold sore. I have tried different kinds of medicine for those, like Abreva, but nothing really helped. Then I did a research online and learned that tea tree oil is the best treatment for cold sores, plus it is all natural. I just put some on, and to my surprise, the cold sores are already drying up an hour later. I cannot believe my eyes!!! From now on that&#x27;s the only remedy I will use for those nasty cold sores. I heard it helps acne too!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!  I purchased this product in 11/2014 and unfortunately, I did not open it until 02/2015.  During this time, the product was sealed and kept in an airtight bag in a dark, cool place.  The expiration date is 09/2017.  When I needed it, I opened the seal and used it. The product smelled STRONGLY of fish oil and only very faintly of tea tree oil.  When I applied it to my skin, I did not feel any of the light tingling that always occurs after the application of tea tree oil to skin.  I have purchased MANY brands of tea tree oil in the past.  All of them have kept their effectiveness for many years.  Tea tree oil has natural antiviral and antibiotic properties.  There is no reason for the product to &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34; in three months.  I contacted Amazon, and they were only willing to refund me a small percentage of the purchase price, since more than 30 days have passed.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller responded quickly, but told me they were unwilling to refund any portion of the purchase price after 30 days, and suggested I contact the manufacturer.  This product was defective, and the seller was unwilling to back up the purchase.  I recommend that you buy a different brand.  I will be avoiding all products by this manufacturer forever.</li>
            <li> Mix one cap of oil in large spray bottle then fill with water. Spray dog close to skin, OUTSIDE as the fleas will jump off. Leave on dog like a dip for 10 minutes then rinse. Repeat as needed. Very effective</li>
            <li> This was just as described, and packaged well. It is a larger bottle relative to bottles most oils come in in health food stores. It does not have a dropper pour spout so it is easy to pour out if you need to. Smells good--like tea tree oil should. Using as anti-fungal and seems to be working. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> good quality, last long&lt;br /&gt; a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;nice tea tree smell&lt;br /&gt;you should dilute with a carrier oil for skin such as olive oil</li>
            <li> Works well as skin moisturizing antiseptic.  I use on my arms or anywhere I get a blemish.  Smell is strong, but some folks like it I guess.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has no dropper feature on it, so be careful.  It spills easily if you are old and shaky like me.....</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle had a dropper/stopper or anything besides just an opening. Works for acne and unclogging stuffy noses.</li>
            <li> Have had trouble finding that pure tea tree oil I fell in love with years ago. Many other brands I can find out and about are &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; with mineral oils, whereas this has that biting delicious scent and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Unlike cheaper versions, this is less camphorous but somehow more concentrated. Great for colds and coughs, settling digestion and treating skin issues - particularly itchy feet. I love how this is gentler in scent and vapor than other tea tree oils yet seems to be more effective. How is that?? Perhaps a better process or plant source.</li>
            <li> Pure essential oil - I did a blot test.  Product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> After reading online about Tea Tree Oil, I was amazed at the uses so I decided to purchase it for myself. Luckily the market near my home carries it and I bought the Spring Valley Tea Tree Oil along with cotton balls and Q-Tips to try for health reasons for myself. This product has amazed me! So below I am listing some of the great uses that I have found with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Ears - For me, I have ears that seem to clog up. What I tried is to place about three drops of Tea Tree Oil onto a Q-Tip. NOTE: I do not poke it deep into my ear for safety reasons. Just rub it on the outer parts of my ears. Then they feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Mold Removal - So I added 2 teaspoons of the oil to 2 cups of water. I put this mixture into spray bottle and spray it on the mold area and wipe with a paper towel. The mold is then gone and the area has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Toothbrush Cleaner - After I rinse my toothbrush, before I put it away, I add one drop and rub into the bristles. Now the toothbrush smells great and it is fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Clothes Wash Aid - I add 2 teaspoons to a regular load of clothes on the WASH CYCLE. Result: The clothes came out fresher smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Scalp Treatment - I have an itchy scalp sometimes so I add about 6 drops into my shampoo and mix well. Result: My hair is shiny clean and scalp feels so soothed--no more itching!</li>
            <li> good product; as described</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe how this oil changed my life!  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for my yeast infection.  It seriously works.  I doubted before buying this and doubt no more.&lt;br /&gt;It is strong so be careful with dosage!</li>
            <li> So many great uses for this. Definately recommend as an antiseptic or apply to blemishes to kill bacteria. Has anti fungal properties as well. The price is right too.</li>
            <li> POTENT STUFF BE CAREFUL, DILUTE WITH LOTION AND MIX WELL, REMEMBER YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE, TOO MUCH CAN BURN SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> Really good to make your skin cleaner than even!</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has so many great uses, I love it for my ace though works awesome and gives good results</li>
            <li> Love this product I find myself using it a lot</li>
            <li> Good quality oil.  Used it for my bees sugar water.</li>
            <li> Had a terrible scent (&amp; I love the way tea tree smells). Will not purchase this particular brand/product ever again. This is a very low-quality essential oil and, even though it claims it isn&#x27;t, I think it is diluted.</li>
            <li> I hate canker sores! I haven&#x27;t had one in years but I just got a nickle sized canker just inside my lip. It burned so bad. Hurt to eat, hurt to drink. On day 3 of such severe pain that i could barely even talk I remembered I had tea tree oil. I dabbed some on a q tip then placed directly on the canker for about 30 sec. Tingled a little but didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Once I removed it it instantly felt better. I then went to sleep and woke up to a numbing effect and noticed it was starting to heal very quickly. Put it on 3 times daily and over the course of 3 days it was completely gone. I think it cut the healing time in half and plus added a numbing effect to it.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with shampoo, I works great..I will purchase this product again. I wish they sold it in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> and with our east coast rains... the woodline I had to clear was bug bite land. I really needed it!!  I keep tea tree soap on hand (a very good natural disinfectant)  but when you know you were exposed to ticks and chiggers for days...... this is the product you want around.  Sure it smells horrid... but this mixed with some shampoo and your bug free.  I hate putting poisons on my body, Tea Tree Oil is non toxic to humans and even good for you.  That is hard to believe when you smell it but,  for some medical problems you can putt this on full strength (however for home use you want to cut it down, a couple drops goes a long way when mixed in a little bit of shampoo or in a spray bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this wisely and it will be a friendly product.  Never get it in your eyes.  I mix some up in a atomizer spray bottle then carefully work it into my dogs fur  by hand (avoiding sensitive skin). .. Do that outside and the fleas dive off. At first my dog wanted no parts of this smelly stuff but she now knows it helps her and deals with it.  It is way better than putting poisons on any animal .</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the oil for her acne and dry skin. I am glad I was able to find something that really works.</li>
            <li> Whoooo! It&#x27;s most definitely pharmaceutical grade. Beware when mixing this with anything, as the smell is overpowering, it&#x27;s not a bad smell, just very...medicinal... Given that it&#x27;s supposed to be diluted, a little goes a long way, but it is potent.</li>
            <li> Used this to remove skin tag on my face. After applying a small dab for one week, it completely came off. The skin tag was not very big , but was rather bothersome. Tea tree oil has a very pungent odor. Used only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canoga Park</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this brand of Tea Tree Oil. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand so I can&#x27;t compare it. But I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user and promoter of tea tree oil for its ability to naturally and safely kill and prevent bacteria, viruses, fungus, toxins and irritations on the skin and in the mouth.  I&#x27;ve cured many things with it from poison ivy to acne, to dandruff, to ringworm, to infected cuts, to bug bites and it&#x27;s the most effective gnat and mosquito deterrent I&#x27;ve ever used.  Just a little on the skin and they stay away.  This is a high quality yield at a long lasting portion for a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this Tea Tree Oil all the time.  It is great for using topically on the skin and has a bunch of other uses.  Tea Tree Oil has  many antimicrobial/anti-bacterial and anti fungal properties.  I&#x27;ve found tea tree oil to be great for dandruff, acne and other skin conditions.  Putting a drop or two of tea tree oil in a humidifier or vaporizer also seems to help soothe and prevent sinus infections and colds that used to be common for us in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents have a boat and Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for helping remove any musty mildew smell that can be common after winter storage.  Countless over priced marine products (gels, sprays etc.) are available.  We&#x27;ve found some tea tree oil poured in a bottle cap will slowly evaporate and dry up over time.  Doing this in a few areas around the boat really makes a difference.  We also mix a small amount (3-5 drops) of tea tree oil in a smaller spray bottle with some water and spray directly on teak, wood and other areas that seem to hold any aroma. You can also pour the mixture on a rag and wipe surfaces down.  Oil and water don&#x27;t mix and the tea tree oil will typically float on the water so you need to constantly stir and agitate the mixture to keep things mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-  A little bit goes a long way. This bottle should last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  You can buy this exact bottle of Tea Tree oil in the pharmacy section of your local Walmart near the vitamins.  You&#x27;ll probably pay half of what it is listed here. (I think I paid around $8)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Do NOT swallow or ingest tea tree oil. It can be toxic and poisonous in certain quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Tea tree oil can irritate the skin, especially in those who have sensitive skin.  Please don&#x27;t use it full strength on your skin the first time and use extreme caution when using this on children. who could be sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Keep it out of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I use this full strength (a drop or two is good) on my scalp when dandruff or itchy isn&#x27;t helped by normal dandruff or tea tree shampoos)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Regarding using tea tree oil in a humidifier/vaporizer.  Oil and water don&#x27;t mix so the tea tree oil tends to float on top of the water. You do need to stir/agitate/mix the water every so often.  If you choose to add some tea tree oil to your vaporizer or humidifier water be careful to not use too much.  It can leave a sticky gummy mess in things if it dries up. You need to keep an eye on things. Don&#x27;t use too much and be sure to clean your vaporizer/humidifier to remove any residue that can harden over time if not removed.

            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Tea tree (melaleuca) can be used for almost anything.  We have put a few drops in our shampoo and my hair is growing longer and stronger and my scalp is much healthier.  I use it to keep my fever blisters at bay, in my washer to freshen winter hats and gloves, and many skin problems including bug bites and rashes.  Bottle size is perfect and I carry smaller 1/2 dram bottles in my handbag at all times.  I&#x27;ve used it as hand sanitizer rather than the crap to try to sell at stores.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!!!</li>
            <li> While researching, i have discovered many uses. I use it with coconut oil and lavendar for my hair, skin and dry feet. keeps bugs away (lice for children in school or day care). it smells very strong, a little goes a LONG way. I have just now started using for acne areas and gently apply with Q-tip. The inflamation was gone, one day to the next.</li>
            <li> Product was perfectly packaged and sealed. I&#x27;ve been using it every day and it&#x27;s a great product ...... ...... ......</li>
            <li> Tag removal...slow but effective without a Dr. says what I know about the use of Tea Tree Oil. If applied 2-3 times a day with a Q-tip on tags, I&#x27;ve found it to eventually (1-2 months) eliminates the tag without the need for a Dr to remove, which is not usually covered by insurance (it&#x27;s considered cosmetic surgery). On some persistent tags, I&#x27;ve put a band-aid over the tag and then used an eye dropper to put a couple of drops on the pad of the band-aid to give a much longer, stronger effect, but it can be a bit temporarily irritating to surrounding skin, but it clears up quickly. I don&#x27;t ever &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the tags come off, they just seem to disappear. I have used it on my eyelid, without any real problems, but use sparingly, because the oil creeps over the skin/eyelid and will cause temporary discomfort to the eye in a eucalyptus or menthol type effect, easily stopped by lightly wiping excess oil away with a kleenex or Q-tip. As for odor...it does have a noticeable smell to me, similar to turpentine. I just try to use it when I&#x27;m at home, or not going out smelling like I&#x27;ve been painting with varnish! All these remarks are for informational use only and not intended to be medical advice to anyone.</li>
            <li> Effective treatment for some types of acne.  Good deal.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> Used it for my sitz bath after having my first baby and it works well in the pain relief and healing process</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and did not see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product for over a month on my toe nails, and I don&#x27;t see a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is not a good quality of tea tree oil! It smells like pinesol...... I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and am still waiting to see results on my toenails. I put it on twice a day: in the morning and at night right after I shower. The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Will update my review if I see some changes.</li>
            <li> We have used Tea Tree oil on our border collies and our selves for decades. Finally ran out and needed more. Price was about average, the size was right but the bottle arrived with 30% leaked out, and even the mail man was cussing the box and threaten to report it. Stunk his whole truck up. NOT very good or smart to not to seal these in a simple cheap zip-lock bag!</li>
            <li> Been using Tea Tree Oil for years.. never had a cut get infected.   Recommended!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Spring Valley. Got exactly what I asked for at a decent price. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Cured my toenail fungus. Applied several times/day for first week and then tapered off to several times/day on only one day per week.</li>
            <li> Seems good but then I got bad break out again.. So.. Im scared to use it</li>
            <li> was trying out to make my own homemade deodorant.  this was essential to make it for the bacteria.  works great.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and handling was great as always.</li>
            <li> I used this for two weeks to see if it worked for skin tag removal . I followed directions and after  2 weeks I observed no change or any indication off it working. I found the  the strong smell of the oil to linger as well. Not very impressed with item. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it, I do like the additional woodsy smell. It&#x27;s a little different from the previous brand I purchased before.</li>
            <li> all I can say is that this product is simply AWESOME. the seller is great for actually having premium grade tea tree oil, this stuff really works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to because this is a miracle in a bottle. Suffering with tinea versicolor for ten years and this this only thing, other than Rx antiboditics that has cleared my chest and back and only after using it twice. I immediately saw results after using it and by day two I was more than 75% blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet a cotton swab then dabbed the teal oil on it. I rubbed it on my skin and let it stay overnight. The smell is horrible but the results are worth if.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. It is the only thing that has stopped the constant shedding of hair that I have. I was using prescription topicals for the incredible itch and inflammation of the scalp that only help a little and in two days of use, the itching stopped and the constant shedding of hair throughout the day went away. When I run my fingers through my hair I don&#x27;t end up with anything on my hand! This hasn&#x27;t happened in months. Plus, I&#x27;ve used some on some eczema that wouldn&#x27;t go away and that stuff was gone in ONE application and hasn&#x27;t come back, no repeat application. I am ordering some more right now.</li>
            <li> I buy a tea tree oil from wally world (well used to)&lt;br /&gt;It is in the hair section. Think it&#x27;s around $3-4 a bottle. I would use it for scalp treat once in awhile. Because of the reviews I thought I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;Um.....holy smokes!!! So so much better. I now going to have to buy some shower caps for when I use it. Wife and kids were almost crying because of the scent I  room...after 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;And yes...worked much better than that oiled down &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; from WW.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> aroma is very invasive do not buy if strong odors will be an issue for you</li>
            <li> loved the tee tree oil. We used it for ring worm and it worked wonderfully. Quick shipping excellent quality</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my skin at all.  Says it&#x27;s uncented but it smelled like crap to me.</li>
            <li> I discovered after receiving my order that it was twice as much $ as it is at Walmart. It&#x27;s a good product, but not worth double the price.</li>
            <li> It is working on toe fungus. That is why i bought it.  Great price and delivered fast. Made by Walmart, but easier to order it. I recommend it as a topical treatment.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have been using this as part of a homemade face wash and as an acne spot treatment. I have been using it for about a week and my skin is already responding pretty well. Particularly, some cystic pimples that never seem to fully go down have almost completely flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell, of course there is one, it is an oil derived from a plant, chances are it will have a natural smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I can see how it would bother most. Someone described the smell as camphor, I guess that&#x27;s close. I have actually grown to like it, but like any scent, that is subjective. I honestly would be skeptical of an odorless tea tree oil, because to me that would scream processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it gives your skin a menthol feeling. Probably more psychological than anything, but it makes me feel like it&#x27;s working. It also numbs a little, so I could see how this would feel great on a small cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I dab a little on my toothpaste since I have heard it&#x27;s great for gums.</li>
            <li> This Dried out my skin. It Was very uncomfortable. I had Tried to use this for tinea versicolor treatment. No luck</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of others that used this to treat acne, I decided to try it. I had tried everything else:egg yolk, sulphur cream, Proactive,  apple cider vinegar. ....I dip a Q tip in this and rub it on my cyst acne. Happily, my dace is the clearest it has been since I was twelve.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works for all kinds of things.  I used for ingrown toe nail fungus, but it is great for all sorts of things.  Tt is actually cheaper at Walmart.com. and cheaper shipping, FYI</li>
            <li> i mix with water and spry to some area of kitchen and bathroom for rotch~bug,it&#x27;s work! also my sons pimple.Geat item.</li>
            <li> Bought this in hopes to cure toe nail fungus. Went to GP and he recommended  I take a pill that could potential damage my liver. No bueno. So i checked with my dermatologist and she prescribed a topical nail polish like medication. I live in flip flops so reading some holistic reviews i opted for tea tree oil to speed up the process. And great news! The nail is growing out clear. I def attribute the healing to the tea tree oil. Also use on scalp to help clear and clean and on random blemishes.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great on toe nail fungus. I don&#x27;t think the smell is that bad like some other reviewers. I kind of like it, actually.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my cystic acne on my chin and around my mouth and it has reduced swelling/redness for the most part. It&#x27;s doing a good job so far. The smell is very strong though. Keep it away from pets, I&#x27;ve heard it can be poisonous to some animals, especially cats. You may want to dilute with water if your skin is really sensitive, I don&#x27;t because it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> So I got this not realizing that if you&#x27;re using it topically, it should ideally be diluted. This is a 100% concentration and I applied it for the first time without realizing it needed to be diluted. The smell is extremely pungent, but this stuff works miracles.</li>
            <li> This item is made of quality materials. It will make a great stocking stuffer this season for the pet groomer in the family</li>
            <li> I love the smell of tea tree oil. I use it as a burn soother and recently my fiance has been using it to reduce his rosacea. In both cases it works very well and I&#x27;m glad I bought this brand!</li>
            <li> My medicine cabinet just wouldn&#x27;t be complete without this product. It&#x27;s the topical version of an aspirin!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product a great value ! I will buy again !</li>
            <li> Very good product. Timely service.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  It really works well on sun and acne spots though you must be patient and diligent when using.  Very pleased at the fast shipping and think the price was GREAT!  If you are thinking of buying Tea Tree Oil...buy here and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with it, use it in a bubble bath, massage my feet when they ache......&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong but it is a great product. I use it before waxing my eyebrows because my hair follicles tend to clog up it works for me.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for acne spot treatment and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much information on all the wonderful uses for tea tree oil.  I had an incident of toe fungus on one of my big toes.  I tried this product and it did not work for me.  It smells really, really bad.  In fact, I used a Q-tip to apply the oil and that tiny, discarded Q-tip made my entire kitchen smell after I put it in the garbage can.  I do take out my garbage everyday, but the oil&#x27;s smell stayed in the house until I took the garbage outside.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good product and seems to do the job. I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of tea tree oil for warts, as they seem to be the only thing that can get rid of the most stubborn ones. If you have plantar warts that won&#x27;t respond to treatments that even the dermatologist throws at them, try a long regiment of tea tree oil on a band aid. It&#x27;ll work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t have any way of applying the product. A dropper or spout would be perfect. We improvised, but this one small change would make this a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love what this is doing for my face and my acne</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about the many uses for tree tea oil and finally ordered me a bottle and I love it!  I  have used it so many different ways and it has never failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an infestation of shelf bugs and a little tree tea oil, vinegar and water sprayed and cleaned with a dry cloth did the trick.  No more bugs and haven&#x27;t seen a recurrence of them.  I have used tree tea oil on scratches, sores, blisters, etc. and it works  great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keep in mind that the tree tea oil has a very strong scent and may not be right for those who use it.  Although strong, it has a very fresh lingering scent which is quite nice.  I have read up on more uses for tree tea oil  and I plan on trying some of them.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is wonderful for a variety of things in my home from treating blemishes, adding this to my homemade cleaning/disinfecting sprays, adding a few drops to questionable laundry, antiseptic purposes, boil/abcess treatment, cleaning brushes and makeup brushes with a few drops of this, some water and a drop of liquid handsoap, and most recently, I put some of this on a tick that was on my husband&#x27;s foot after doing some yard work. I knew not to pull it off, as it was already attached, so I quickly grabbed this and squeezed some drops from a cotton ball onto the tick. (Apparantly, it didn&#x27;t like it and willingly unattached itself in an effort to get away from the tea tree oil, where it proceeded to get squashed in a tissue and flushed). I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes to have multipurpose, natural products on hand that last quite a while, as it only takes a few drops per use.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil reminds me of turpentine, with a very slight green plant smell, in case you have never smelled it. It is strong, and antiseptic-smelling for sure. However, I can deal with it for all of the benefits it provides. It is worth noting that this bottle does not come with a dropper, so you may want to invest in a glass dropper specifically for this, as it would be very easy to pour out too much.</li>
            <li> Like the brush in it.  It makes it easier to use the product.</li>
            <li> Been using this tea tree oil mixed with oil of lavender for 4 months as a cure for toe nail fungus. It works and the problem is almost solved. Tryed all medications and even perscripitions and none worked as well. I am happy to say my 10 year struggle is almost over.</li>
            <li> I found that the Spring Valley Tea Tree Oil is MUCH weaker than the Mason Tea Tree Oil. I tried Spring Valley because the price of Mason went up considerably. You can buy the Spring Valley brand at Walmart, I also dicsovered, pretty cheaply. There is a reason for the difference in price between Mason and Spring Valley.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is great for my occasional psoriasis outbreaks but buy yourself a glass bottle and dropper to go with it for much, much easier use and applications.  I have a Dr. prescribed cream for my outbreaks that never does much on it&#x27;s own but if I put some of it on a little dish and then muddle it together with a dropper full of tea tree oil my outbreaks are gone in one or two days.  Mixing the oil with the ointment keeps the oil on your skin longer and really helps it absorb.  I&#x27;ve bought this time and time again and always keep at least one bottle in reserve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s very healing to my body. It&#x27;s great and I will purchase it always! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use this as a lice repellent and it works great</li>
            <li> I use this to treat my acne. I have never had acne until my mid 20&#x27;s and then boom.... here they were. Luckily I have found that a combonation between this and castor oil is the trick for my acne. I scrub my face and get all my makeup off and them use a cotton ball with the tea tree oil on it all over my face. It does sting but its a good sting. The smell is strong but you get use to it. Then I put a thin layer of castor oil on my face as a moisturizer. This has been so good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be pure.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s kind of embarrassing to talk about it but if you suffer from external hemorrhoids this stuff works amazing as an anesthetic. I typically take one square of tp fold it 2 times and apply the oil to it by covering the bottle opening and just inverting it real quick. Then just hold the wet tissue on the affected area for about 20 seconds and discard. Within seconds it creates a cooling sensation that lasts for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great as a room deodorizer (2 drops on a cloth and hang from heat duct).</li>
            <li> this is tea tree oil.  It works as such.  Strong smell! I really don&#x27;t know what else to put here.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil product is most effective on removing the brown skin keratosis from my skin. This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this oil out after I used a whole bottle of KIS brand Tea Tree oil that came in a sampler set.  I am so disappointed.  The scent is not nearly as strong as the KIS brand, and it has a sour smell to it.  Also, the bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper top.  So you need to have your own dropper or you will have a huge mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> I got the industrial piercing, which is on your cartilage, and saw a keloid forming. I used this everyday, it made my keloid go away. For me it crusted up and got hard, then I peeled the keloid layer by layer over time. After it got small enough it fell off. This didn&#x27;t happen in a week it takes time, but it gets the job done. As for my itchy scalp, it worked but smelled, everywhere I went and the smell was strong. I got braids and it was tight. I started to itch non stop so I decided to put some in a bottle and put it between my braids. It fixed the problem and it felt medicated I got a tingle sensation. THe only con is not everyone loves the smell of tea tree oil. SOme said it almost made them throw up and sick, some liked it.</li>
            <li> The price was right, the delivery was swift, the packaging fine, so I am pleased and do not have much more to tell about tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Worked on one toenail.  Thick nail stopped growing and a new nail is growing along right behind it.  Used once a day in morning during summer for about 3-4 months.  You can use a Q-tip to apply on nail.  I would not wear anything on my feet while getting ready in the morning to let it dry.  Strong smell.  Smells like something I&#x27;ve smelled in Pier 1 Imports before.</li>
            <li> Nice product. S/H was off. Big box. Not enough paddung of glass container. Once I unwrapped safety plastic from bottle cap, the whole cap broke apart. I assume it was roughly handled during mail. Love the product line though.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Tea tree oil is very good for acne. Makes the inflammation disappear over night. I use it every night before bed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Tea Tree Oil after hearing that it was good for treating acne.  I have suffered with cystic acne for most of my teen and adult life, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; for it, but it was highly recommended.  I have found that if you have a small pimple it works really well with clearing up the blemish within a day or so.  Larger (cystic) blemishes, not so much so.  I highly recommend diluting it on first use (I used olive oil) until you know if it will irritate your skin.  I&#x27;ve heard there are many other uses for Tee Tree Oil (such as treating dandruff), but I&#x27;ve only used it on acne.  I have used Spring Valley products before, and it is a brand name that I trust.</li>
            <li> Highly potent but awesome oil product. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of tea tree oil, and found this bottle to be particularly strong and potent, which I like. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and applied it to a couple of tags that were starting to appear and am glad to report they went away. But I must say I did employ another method along with it and that was black Jamaican oil so I would recommend the combo, however as a anti fungal preparation it is unparalleled it has a host of uses, just google and you will find that it is most useful in so many ways. I recommend.</li>
            <li> It has an intstant burning effect. Don&#x27;t get it near your eyes, or lips. My skin does look a little better/</li>
            <li> Really clears up my acne!  I have heard that people also put a few drops in shampoo or body wash for prevention of any undesirable thing such as lice or mersa.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cleaning and for the laundry and front facing washing machine (they start to really stink after a while from bacteria build up).  We use a formula to make a spray...sort of an all purpose cleaning product.  This works wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 times per month, I really love using appx 1/2 teaspoon of tea tree oil in a 16 oz bottle of water to flush my vagina as well as anus.  It really cleans any lingering bacteria.  It is particularly useful in helping to restore ph levels after menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li> As advertised. High grade oil. Works great. Arrived promptly. I am very happy with the purchase and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> Awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil is great, I especially love how much you get for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read about tea tree oil online for it&#x27;s many uses, and had to try it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use of it is for my face.  Second favorite use is for bug bites or rash, it instantly soothes the are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as this thing is available, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> So so many uses for this.  check out reviews and uses on you tube</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil for a face wash and also in a homemade sugar scrub. I like this product. It leaves my face feeling very clean and fresh. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> use it all the time....</li>
            <li> Used it for about 45 days and nothing happened. I stopped using it as i felt no work was being done</li>
            <li> I always love Tea Tree Oil....it works on my dog&#x27;s hot spots wonderfully!  It works as a wonderful antiseptic, I put on my dog&#x27;s hot spots a couple of times day, put a cone on him and in two days everything is usually better!</li>
            <li> IT is oil so it willabsorb on cuts and scraps and they heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Tea Tree Oil for over 5 years .  A natural medicine article recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my athletes foot that nothing I tried would work.&lt;br /&gt;It worked.  I put it on my toe nails and finger nails and they are healthier you can notice after 3 or 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;I only do that with Q tip once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in Afghanistan and the foot rot here is bad so I use it all the time and my feet are surviving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not put near your eyes and be careful if you put on your fingernails it is an oil and will sting if you rub your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Just like Jalopenos on your finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Natural PRoduct.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but it looks like what I ordered. It will be used around the house for various mold issues. Thank you so much for the prompt service</li>
            <li> I love this tea tree oil. I am using it on my skin and have noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good for smelly feet..&lt;br /&gt;If you can overlook the strong smell, this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> smells great and peacful, great on external cuts/ lips</li>
            <li> I purchase from Spring Valley when I need larger bottles of my essential oils as they are cheaper here than other providers in these sizes.  As to quality, I only use Spring Valley oils for diffusion, so for me, they work.</li>
            <li> I used tea tree oil in my body soap and my shampoo for my own personal use. It&#x27;s a good antibacterial agent. It only takes a few drops by adding it myself to my shampoo and other items. I know exactly how much I&#x27;m getting. I use this product with my horses and my dogs also in their soaps, I found it helps to cut down on brain rot with my horses and it helps with hotspots on my dog, but this is only my opinion.</li>
            <li> Has been great... &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;*thumbs up*&lt;br /&gt;...and been able to have great shipping response as well.</li>
            <li> Very affordable Tea Tree Oil. It does smell medicinal. I detected two smells -- the fragrant smell of Tea Tree, and then an undertone medicinal musty makes-me-feel-sick smell. I do not know if that is typical, or simply because it uses lower grade oil, since this the only bottle I have purchased. The purity of this Tea Tree oils is 5% cineole and 35% terpinen -4-ol. Perhaps the musty smell is due to the 60% &amp;#34;whatevers&amp;#34;. It works though. My wart is gone, my mozzie bite is relieved, my son&#x27;s acne is getting better.</li>
            <li> I bought this tea tree oil after doing careful scoping online about the \\&quot;best\\&quot; brands. I like that this is a pharmaceutical grade tea tree oil, and more effective for disinfecting wounds (what I use it for). The smell is very fresh and pleasant to me - it smells odd at first, but I&#x27;ve tried several tea tree oils before, and this certainly smells very fresh and nice. I like that it comes in a dark glass jar to preserve the oil and keep it fresh and potent for a longer period of time. I store mine in a cool dark place (in the cabinet under my sink) for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I have never used tee tree oil before so have nothing to compare to, but worked great.  I bought to help get rid of a wart on my son&#x27;s foot.  Had been using other over the counter wart products and even had been frozen off by the doctor, but this is what finally took care of it for good.  Used for about a week and he has been wart free for over a month now after spending about 3 months trying other methods.  Because I had it I also decided to try it on some toenail fungus I had that had not been able to get rid off.  After about 2 weeks of using, that is also good.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells like turpentine but works fantastic.  Don&#x27;t expect the floral fragrance you may come to expect, this is full strength oil so be careful not to spill it on carpet or anything you can&#x27;t wash thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s really cleared up my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad fungal ear infection months.  My ears itch terribly and one day I stupidly used q-tips on my ear and since then I hadn&#x27;t been able to hear much in my left ear.  I&#x27;ve tried everything (debrox, olive oil, mineral oil, plain  peroxide, OTC products for ear wax) for weeks to loosen whatever was in my ear, but it never would work.  I gave up trying for awhile.  Then I read about this and mixed it 4 parts mineral oil to 1 part tea tree oil (as directed) and put this in my ear and rubbed it down the side of my neck and the back of my ears.  Within a day I could hear better and the gunk that was in my ears loosened enough to finally use an ear wax removal tool to try to remove it.  I used a few drops tea tree oil and half a cup of warm water and used a[[ASIN:B000SOJXGA Ear Wax Rmvl Syr]] in my ear.  You&#x27;d be amazed at the crap that came out of my ear.  Now I can finally hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ears already feel better in one day.  I&#x27;m seriously amazed.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product to completely heal the infection and see if I&#x27;m finally going to get rid of this ongoing problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, this is available as Wal-Mart for half the price and yes, it smells bad... but I don&#x27;t really care.  It does feel good and tingy on the skin.  And a little goes a very long way.  Make sure you read directions and the warnings.  And DO NOT ingest this!</li>
            <li> After trying Monistat to no avail, I researched tea tree oil and decided to give it a try. I love this stuff. Just a tiny amount clears up a YI within a day or two - sometimes overnight.</li>
            <li> awesome therapeutic grade oil but it does not come with a dripper and I really miss that, it pours down the sides of the bottle and my fingers when I use it</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 16 year old niece for warts. She uses everyday and says it works.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Not as great as a couple of other brands I have tried but decent for the price. This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy smell of many tea tree oils and I&#x27;m not sure if they have cut it with something or if there is another oil contained within. Still, you get a good amount of product for a decent price and it seems to work mostly like my other brand.</li>
            <li> Good, once you get past the smell!</li>
            <li> This pharmaceutical oil is a strong grade. It starts healing things right away.  I would recommend its effectiveness to buyers.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price</li>
