    <ol>
            <li>Once you figure it out it is so easy!!!!</li>
            <li>And then everybody was always telling you how awesome you looked</li>
            <li>This clip is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>And it looked great!  </li>
            <li>This pin is really perfect.</li>
            <li>and they are awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>This works perfect and I am very pleased with it.(Youtube</li>
            <li>My hairstylist did tell me to try the Goody Spin Pin, so I did, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I was supper happy when it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many things, and none of them have worked....until now!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the support I received and thought I should let others know that they are a great company.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in an updo as I want it, but good to use at home, when just want to hold hair away from my neck</li>
            <li>good for updo hairstyles</li>
            <li>I got the brunette colour, and my hair matches it fairly well.</li>
            <li>However, possibly the best part is that you can take it out and have beautiful wavy hair!</li>
            <li>Looks so wonderful that the first day I used it I was asked by 6 gals at work how I did my hair and where can they get this clip.</li>
            <li>It looked fabulous and held all day!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, holds my hair all day, and creates a great looking &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>This pin is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great idea, but you either rip your hair out putting it in securely or it falls out.  </li>
            <li>As I have no skill whatsoever in doing my own hair, I figured this had to help.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of this product</li>
            <li>And, as I mentioned, I can&#x27;t do my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Feel where it kind of dips off?</li>
            <li>has some excellent demos instructing use which were very helpful).</li>
            <li>Nice concept.</li>
            <li>that they show in the package insert, but the main look is so great that I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li>Very easy to do and works well.</li>
            <li>Looks really nice and is very comfortable once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it in place all day, and I&#x27;ve been busy doing gardening and running around, and yet my hair still looks perfect!!!  </li>
            <li>It allows for a classy up-do, perfect for a change.</li>
            <li>It works and it is easy if you practice it a couple of times!</li>
            <li>This one is EASY!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair and this holds ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>It feels very secure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>The instructions are ok-</li>
            <li>I have many of these.  </li>
            <li>I even looked at several videos at youtube to see if it was my technique as the illustration on the box isn&#x27;t the greatest....</li>
            <li>Actually, my first successful updo was the bun with the spin pin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first successful non-bun updo.</li>
            <li>i can be able to do more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on some hair bands.</li>
            <li>When I am able to get it to work I never have had it stay for more than like 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it looks respectable in my kit, the finish doesn&#x27;t flake, and with practiced placement it holds like a blast shelter.</li>
            <li>Need I say more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to be able to make this thing work.  </li>
            <li>I wish better directions were included though.</li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not for me, maybe if you have shorter hair and more patience</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>this is my go to clip :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tomboy, but I&#x27;m going into a profession for which I need to look elegant.</li>
            <li>Everything went much better when I followed my instincts with it.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and is more comfortable than any of the other two prong hair pins that I own.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to headaches make sure it feels comfortable of you may experience some side effects.</li>
            <li>but I loved it so much that I got another one.</li>
            <li>I now use it effortlessly, it keeps hair super secure, and I love love love it.</li>
            <li>#34;oh, cool!</li>
            <li>It seemed easy for others, but it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I can put my hair up easily.</li>
            <li>But this was so easy to use -</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this simple clip, it holds my hair (medium length) securely and looks great, people always ask how I did my hair.</li>
            <li>Once you get it, its simple and the style are beautiful.</li>
            <li>It feels like I could easily use a rat-tail comb to pull tendrils if I wanted, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Easiest and fastest way ever to get a super sophisticated up-do.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t been able to master this, but to be honest, I gave up on it after seeing how easy the spin pins were.  </li>
            <li>My hair is huge, I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work on all of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have found that two prong hair pins work great for my hair, but are a total pain in the butt to find.</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy the feeling of having your hair pulled, don&#x27;t get this thing.</li>
            <li>I have to say my hair looks fantastic when I use my updo pin.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have a nicer, faster result using a set of good old fashioned hair pins.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly as described and it is great for a new hairstyle</li>
            <li>Goody does make great products that last a long time, but I do suggest if you find an item they make, that really works wonderfully for you --- make the investment and stock pile</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to make an updo for myself that doesn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just play around a bit with this and have fun with it!  </li>
            <li>I originally found this product in a Walgreens and bought it...</li>
            <li>Great for quickly pulling up long hair without any damage.  </li>
            <li>One stylist told me I have 3 times as much hair as most people.</li>
            <li>I just had to order a couple more of these things since I now cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>Luckily they have a channel with how-to videos on You Tube.</li>
            <li>Quick arrival.</li>
            <li>I can quickly put my hair up</li>
            <li>Looks great for my daughters hair, however in mine I have too much to have it hold properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this smooth brass-tone wire is exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty and wavy.</li>
            <li>and you felt even MORE awesome because you only spent $2 on the whole outfit (literally!)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the modern updo.</li>
            <li>I can do a French twist with a long-tooth plastic comb, but the commercials made these products look so easy and so much better that I wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for casual and even more formal updos!</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think my hair ended up looking like this picture, it looked nice enough to be considered formal.</li>
            <li>I had to watch youtube demos to figure out how to use this, but it was well worth the $6.00.  </li>
            <li>I fixed my hair with it today and got many compliments and inquiries from my students.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the damp hair look, as it is more professional.</li>
            <li>i could use it for french twist or any kind of twist or up-</li>
            <li>Not the best product for the French twist, but can be useful for other updos, hold hair in place well.</li>
            <li>I plan on getting more to keep in different bags and at work for a quick put up when my hair makes me hot.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that will help me to have an easy and professional looking updo.  </li>
            <li>If I leave the very ends free and shape them into finger curls, then when I take the whole thing out at the end of the day</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, just turn upside down, insert into hair, then scoop upward to secure!</li>
            <li>and then I realized you need only put it through the top 1/3 of your bun</li>
            <li>Bought this to put my hair up for an outdoor Florida wedding where it was to be extremely hot.</li>
            <li>Would work very well for nurses or women in the military who need a comfortable, invisible way to keep their hair up for many hours.</li>
            <li>LOL I did sent one to a friend in LA with shorter but still thick hair.</li>
            <li>ok so I actually have this product in my hair now</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I sort of have a shopping problem and am particularly fond of this bun-technology trend - twisty bobby pins, donut-whachamachalits, etc.</li>
            <li>point of the moral of the story is, I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot.</li>
            <li>It actually holds the hair pretty securely!</li>
            <li>I can look pretty without spending hours trying to fix my sad-looking hair!&amp;#34; ....</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with the bun spinners made by same company.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out and just about got it to work for me.</li>
            <li>Or, I can get a simple updo for a cute date-night hair</li>
            <li>I plan on wearing it to classes at college all the time, it&#x27;s so fast!   </li>
            <li>I have ordered several :)</li>
            <li>Of course I lost the first one I had</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in constant search of products that can help my hair look with more style.</li>
            <li>this will not leave marks and will actually make more waves if you decide to take it</li>
            <li>I TWIST MY HAIR FIRST.  </li>
            <li>the  best way to hold you fake ponny tail in place.</li>
            <li>Since my twists are always different, it may take a couple of tries to get just the right one, but I always get a very nice updo that looks elegant, yet only takes under a minute to do!  </li>
            <li>but in general this is a cool product!</li>
            <li>but since people stopped going, nobody realized that along with the super-crazy-low sale prices, Old Navy was also starting to make pretty amazing clothing?</li>
            <li>I really liked the spin pin, so I thought I would give this other goody invention a try.</li>
            <li>After I watched the video, it took me less than two minutes to create a beautiful French twist!!!  </li>
            <li>I lost my original clip a few months ago and just found it on Amazon and ordered another, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for months</li>
            <li>I use mine several times a week as a quick way to tidy my long hair.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy enough to redo.</li>
            <li>The instructions were much clearer, and watching someone do</li>
            <li>Goody really ought to link to the videos on their website, or even do \\&quot;how to\\&quot; commercials.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this modern updos by mistake</li>
            <li>so I thought I would try the modern updo maker.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll check out YouTube to see if I can master this Modern up do maker.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the easiest way to get a \\&quot;real\\&quot; hairstyle when I don&#x27;t have time to do the whole blow dry/straighten/style routine.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not an unusual race to find in America</li>
            <li>Medium length, medium thickness, fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this modern updo pin after borrowing my sister&#x27;s spin pins.  </li>
            <li>I really like the updo.  </li>
            <li>I have medium thickness hair that is almost bra strap length, that used to be straight but has some wave now.</li>
            <li>and they always say how much hair I&#x27;ve got)</li>
            <li>but I can take some pain given the fact that it holds my hair in a very stilish</li>
            <li>real directions on the package</li>
            <li>this might be because I have so much</li>
            <li>I could not get this to work properly; I even watched some youtube videos and couldn&#x27;t get it to stay securely in my hair.</li>
            <li>Really</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only been able to do one style, hopefully after I play with it for a while</li>
            <li>With help from the internet and other Amazon reviewers, I was able to make it work.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft, fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t last all day with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably sized, very well-made (used, abused, stepped on, jammed around—they never bend or break), comfortably follows the curve of the head</li>
            <li>It takes less than a minute to put my hair up this way and it is in the updo so securely!</li>
            <li>It takes me less than a minute to make a pretty bun or updo with this, and it holds my fine, wavy, mid-back-length hair in place</li>
            <li>I took it to my friend who has short very, very thin hair and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and I have super dark brown hair, but if you place it right, you can&#x27;t see it anyway.</li>
            <li>With a little luck I&#x27;ll be able to figure it out after seeing it done.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair but the strands are all really fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t typically hold pins really well.  </li>
            <li>I am giving 5 stars and am going to buy few more to keep them around.</li>
            <li>Great for casual wear or dressier occasions.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars because it&#x27;s well worth it to simply buy a new one when this happens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really easy way to get a professional look with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>It has been years since this product has been on the market and they have not introduced new sizes.</li>
            <li>The pictures I&#x27;ve uploaded are my first try after watching the how to video for the French twist, on hair washed and flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>My money($5.99 to be exact) is on on the latter.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I lent it to my sister and she plans on buying one too for work as it is a classy look if you take time to do it neatly!  </li>
            <li>Not expensive and something different.</li>
            <li>I surprised!</li>
            <li>It took a little practice, but I finally got a similar result and am happy overall.</li>
            <li>When i first bought it and tried to use it I was completely lost,and my husband actually showed me how to use it(sad</li>
            <li>I know the folds in the back look so elegant that I don&#x27;t want to take it down, and I&#x27;m sitting here in shorts and a t shirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have used it side to side as well to vary the look.[[ASIN:B003FV82VA Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker, Assorted Colors, Dark and Light]]</li>
            <li>I used it on my sister&#x27;s fine hair, and a friend&#x27;s medium thick hair, and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if I&#x27;m too rushed to do my hair, I leave it in this for a few hours and then have beautiful hair for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear they don&#x27;t test their instructions.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback with this product is that over time, the smooth surface wears off a bit and it&#x27;s harder to push the pin into the hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Spin Pin over the Modern Updo maker.</li>
            <li>Although it seems securely nestled in my hair within a few minutes it is pulling away from my scalp and my hair starts</li>
            <li>I am completely hair do challenged.  </li>
            <li>This can be avoided if you don&#x27;t use it at the complete bottom of your bun.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had long hair to work with.</li>
            <li>People think it&#x27;s taken me much time to get such a style, I don&#x27;t let on that it&#x27;s the easiest and quickest thing I could have done.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this item makes it very easy for me to put my hair up into a french twist, its fast, I dont feel it, and it stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was really confused the first time I tried to use this product, simply because the instructions not well written!  </li>
            <li>I actually plan to use this updo for when I get married next month!</li>
            <li>I forgot about it and today out of blue or maybe because of hot weather, I remembered having it, and  found it in the back of my drawer to retry.  </li>
            <li>When you first receive it, it may take a tiny bit of practice to get the proper tension.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so busy, I barely have time to change my sheets or shower.</li>
            <li>Am I missing an important step in actually forming the bun that no one is thinking to mention?</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but will not hold if you have extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned, if you check out some tutorials online or follow the instructions that other reviewers left, you&#x27;ll have better results.  </li>
            <li>Having fine hair, there is not a lot to work with so you must pull your small bun around 180 degrees and have the prongs stick into the back of your neck, where they are visible and</li>
            <li>I got the general idea and then had to try about 12 times to get my hair the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Others have commented on my hair, telling me it looks fancy and labor-intensive, and I&#x27;m basically getting the same responses I got when I started wearing the cheap-but-awesome clothes from Old Navy.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE AND USE THEM FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that they mention assorted colors, this contraption is not good for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Holds my long/fine hair up all day and looks professional with only a couple of minutes of time to get pulled back.</li>
            <li>The hairstyle on the box is not cool - and because I&#x27;ve never seen a tool like this, I naturally assumed this was THE style you&#x27;d get with this particular tool.</li>
            <li>Was super sad the hair style was pretty.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy, shoulder length hair and the spin pins work so easily and stay put for as long as I want.  </li>
            <li>I received the updo pin today, and at first I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it, and thought it was yet another waste of money as it wasn&#x27;t holding my hair up.  </li>
            <li>It would work better with blunt cut long hair, as opposed to the slight layers I have (which is the reason it looks messy).</li>
            <li>Even with the awkward learning process, I love it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li>The color really doesn&#x27;t matter (since blond is more expensive than dark), as you cannot see it while it&#x27;s in.</li>

            <li> Once you figure it out it is so easy!!!!</li>
            <li> And then everybody was always telling you how awesome you looked</li>
            <li> This clip is awesome!</li>

            <li> I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This works perfect and I am very pleased with it.(Youtube</li>
            <li> My hairstylist did tell me to try the Goody Spin Pin, so I did, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was supper happy when it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many things, and none of them have worked....until now!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the support I received and thought I should let others know that they are a great company.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in an updo as I want it, but good to use at home, when just want to hold hair away from my neck</li>
            <li> good for updo hairstyles</li>
            <li> I got the brunette colour, and my hair matches it fairly well.</li>
            <li> However, possibly the best part is that you can take it out and have beautiful wavy hair!</li>
            <li> Looks so wonderful that the first day I used it I was asked by 6 gals at work how I did my hair and where can they get this clip.</li>
            <li> It looked fabulous and held all day!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, holds my hair all day, and creates a great looking &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> This pin is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but you either rip your hair out putting it in securely or it falls out.  </li>
            <li> As I have no skill whatsoever in doing my own hair, I figured this had to help.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this product</li>
            <li> And, as I mentioned, I can&#x27;t do my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Feel where it kind of dips off?</li>
            <li> has some excellent demos instructing use which were very helpful).</li>
            <li> Nice concept.</li>
            <li> that they show in the package insert, but the main look is so great that I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> Very easy to do and works well.</li>
            <li> Looks really nice and is very comfortable once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in place all day, and I&#x27;ve been busy doing gardening and running around, and yet my hair still looks perfect!!!  </li>
            <li> It allows for a classy up-do, perfect for a change.</li>
            <li> It works and it is easy if you practice it a couple of times!</li>
            <li> This one is EASY!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair and this holds ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> It feels very secure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> The instructions are ok-</li>
            <li> I have many of these.  </li>
            <li> I even looked at several videos at youtube to see if it was my technique as the illustration on the box isn&#x27;t the greatest....</li>
            <li> Actually, my first successful updo was the bun with the spin pin.  </li>
            <li> This is my first successful non-bun updo.</li>
            <li> i can be able to do more.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on some hair bands.</li>
            <li> When I am able to get it to work I never have had it stay for more than like 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it looks respectable in my kit, the finish doesn&#x27;t flake, and with practiced placement it holds like a blast shelter.</li>
            <li> Need I say more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to be able to make this thing work.  </li>
            <li> I wish better directions were included though.</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not for me, maybe if you have shorter hair and more patience</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> this is my go to clip :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy, but I&#x27;m going into a profession for which I need to look elegant.</li>
            <li> Everything went much better when I followed my instincts with it.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and is more comfortable than any of the other two prong hair pins that I own.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to headaches make sure it feels comfortable of you may experience some side effects.</li>
            <li> but I loved it so much that I got another one.</li>
            <li> I now use it effortlessly, it keeps hair super secure, and I love love love it.</li>
            <li> #34;oh, cool!</li>
            <li> It seemed easy for others, but it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I can put my hair up easily.</li>
            <li> But this was so easy to use -</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this simple clip, it holds my hair (medium length) securely and looks great, people always ask how I did my hair.</li>
            <li> Once you get it, its simple and the style are beautiful.</li>
            <li> It feels like I could easily use a rat-tail comb to pull tendrils if I wanted, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Easiest and fastest way ever to get a super sophisticated up-do.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t been able to master this, but to be honest, I gave up on it after seeing how easy the spin pins were.  </li>
            <li> My hair is huge, I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work on all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have found that two prong hair pins work great for my hair, but are a total pain in the butt to find.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy the feeling of having your hair pulled, don&#x27;t get this thing.</li>
            <li> I have to say my hair looks fantastic when I use my updo pin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have a nicer, faster result using a set of good old fashioned hair pins.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as described and it is great for a new hairstyle</li>
            <li> Goody does make great products that last a long time, but I do suggest if you find an item they make, that really works wonderfully for you --- make the investment and stock pile</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to make an updo for myself that doesn&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just play around a bit with this and have fun with it!  </li>
            <li> I originally found this product in a Walgreens and bought it...</li>
            <li> Great for quickly pulling up long hair without any damage.  </li>
            <li> One stylist told me I have 3 times as much hair as most people.</li>
            <li> I just had to order a couple more of these things since I now cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Luckily they have a channel with how-to videos on You Tube.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival.</li>
            <li> I can quickly put my hair up</li>
            <li> Looks great for my daughters hair, however in mine I have too much to have it hold properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this smooth brass-tone wire is exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty and wavy.</li>
            <li> and you felt even MORE awesome because you only spent $2 on the whole outfit (literally!)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the modern updo.</li>
            <li> I can do a French twist with a long-tooth plastic comb, but the commercials made these products look so easy and so much better that I wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for casual and even more formal updos!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think my hair ended up looking like this picture, it looked nice enough to be considered formal.</li>
            <li> I had to watch youtube demos to figure out how to use this, but it was well worth the $6.00.  </li>
            <li> I fixed my hair with it today and got many compliments and inquiries from my students.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the damp hair look, as it is more professional.</li>
            <li> i could use it for french twist or any kind of twist or up-</li>
            <li> Not the best product for the French twist, but can be useful for other updos, hold hair in place well.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting more to keep in different bags and at work for a quick put up when my hair makes me hot.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that will help me to have an easy and professional looking updo.  </li>
            <li> If I leave the very ends free and shape them into finger curls, then when I take the whole thing out at the end of the day</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, just turn upside down, insert into hair, then scoop upward to secure!</li>
            <li> and then I realized you need only put it through the top 1/3 of your bun</li>
            <li> Bought this to put my hair up for an outdoor Florida wedding where it was to be extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Would work very well for nurses or women in the military who need a comfortable, invisible way to keep their hair up for many hours.</li>
            <li> LOL I did sent one to a friend in LA with shorter but still thick hair.</li>
            <li> ok so I actually have this product in my hair now</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I sort of have a shopping problem and am particularly fond of this bun-technology trend - twisty bobby pins, donut-whachamachalits, etc.</li>
            <li> point of the moral of the story is, I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot.</li>
            <li> It actually holds the hair pretty securely!</li>
            <li> I can look pretty without spending hours trying to fix my sad-looking hair!&amp;#34; ....</li>
            <li> I had much better luck with the bun spinners made by same company.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out and just about got it to work for me.</li>
            <li> Or, I can get a simple updo for a cute date-night hair</li>
            <li> I plan on wearing it to classes at college all the time, it&#x27;s so fast!   </li>
            <li> I have ordered several :)</li>
            <li> Of course I lost the first one I had</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in constant search of products that can help my hair look with more style.</li>
            <li> this will not leave marks and will actually make more waves if you decide to take it</li>
            <li> I TWIST MY HAIR FIRST.  </li>
            <li> the  best way to hold you fake ponny tail in place.</li>
            <li> Since my twists are always different, it may take a couple of tries to get just the right one, but I always get a very nice updo that looks elegant, yet only takes under a minute to do!  </li>
            <li> but in general this is a cool product!</li>
            <li> but since people stopped going, nobody realized that along with the super-crazy-low sale prices, Old Navy was also starting to make pretty amazing clothing?</li>
            <li> I really liked the spin pin, so I thought I would give this other goody invention a try.</li>
            <li> After I watched the video, it took me less than two minutes to create a beautiful French twist!!!  </li>
            <li> I lost my original clip a few months ago and just found it on Amazon and ordered another, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for months</li>
            <li> I use mine several times a week as a quick way to tidy my long hair.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy enough to redo.</li>
            <li> The instructions were much clearer, and watching someone do</li>
            <li> Goody really ought to link to the videos on their website, or even do \\&quot;how to\\&quot; commercials.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this modern updos by mistake</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try the modern updo maker.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll check out YouTube to see if I can master this Modern up do maker.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the easiest way to get a \\&quot;real\\&quot; hairstyle when I don&#x27;t have time to do the whole blow dry/straighten/style routine.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not an unusual race to find in America</li>
            <li> Medium length, medium thickness, fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this modern updo pin after borrowing my sister&#x27;s spin pins.  </li>
            <li> I really like the updo.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thickness hair that is almost bra strap length, that used to be straight but has some wave now.</li>
            <li> and they always say how much hair I&#x27;ve got)</li>
            <li> but I can take some pain given the fact that it holds my hair in a very stilish</li>
            <li> real directions on the package</li>
            <li> this might be because I have so much</li>
            <li> I could not get this to work properly; I even watched some youtube videos and couldn&#x27;t get it to stay securely in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only been able to do one style, hopefully after I play with it for a while</li>
            <li> With help from the internet and other Amazon reviewers, I was able to make it work.  </li>
            <li> I have very soft, fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t last all day with me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably sized, very well-made (used, abused, stepped on, jammed around—they never bend or break), comfortably follows the curve of the head</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to put my hair up this way and it is in the updo so securely!</li>
            <li> It takes me less than a minute to make a pretty bun or updo with this, and it holds my fine, wavy, mid-back-length hair in place</li>
            <li> I took it to my friend who has short very, very thin hair and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and I have super dark brown hair, but if you place it right, you can&#x27;t see it anyway.</li>
            <li> With a little luck I&#x27;ll be able to figure it out after seeing it done.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but the strands are all really fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t typically hold pins really well.  </li>
            <li> I am giving 5 stars and am going to buy few more to keep them around.</li>
            <li> Great for casual wear or dressier occasions.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars because it&#x27;s well worth it to simply buy a new one when this happens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really easy way to get a professional look with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> It has been years since this product has been on the market and they have not introduced new sizes.</li>
            <li> The pictures I&#x27;ve uploaded are my first try after watching the how to video for the French twist, on hair washed and flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> My money($5.99 to be exact) is on on the latter.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I lent it to my sister and she plans on buying one too for work as it is a classy look if you take time to do it neatly!  </li>
            <li> Not expensive and something different.</li>
            <li> I surprised!</li>
            <li> It took a little practice, but I finally got a similar result and am happy overall.</li>
            <li> When i first bought it and tried to use it I was completely lost,and my husband actually showed me how to use it(sad</li>
            <li> I know the folds in the back look so elegant that I don&#x27;t want to take it down, and I&#x27;m sitting here in shorts and a t shirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used it side to side as well to vary the look.[[ASIN:B003FV82VA Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker, Assorted Colors, Dark and Light]]</li>
            <li> I used it on my sister&#x27;s fine hair, and a friend&#x27;s medium thick hair, and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if I&#x27;m too rushed to do my hair, I leave it in this for a few hours and then have beautiful hair for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear they don&#x27;t test their instructions.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback with this product is that over time, the smooth surface wears off a bit and it&#x27;s harder to push the pin into the hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Spin Pin over the Modern Updo maker.</li>
            <li> Although it seems securely nestled in my hair within a few minutes it is pulling away from my scalp and my hair starts</li>
            <li> I am completely hair do challenged.  </li>
            <li> This can be avoided if you don&#x27;t use it at the complete bottom of your bun.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had long hair to work with.</li>
            <li> People think it&#x27;s taken me much time to get such a style, I don&#x27;t let on that it&#x27;s the easiest and quickest thing I could have done.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this item makes it very easy for me to put my hair up into a french twist, its fast, I dont feel it, and it stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was really confused the first time I tried to use this product, simply because the instructions not well written!  </li>
            <li> I actually plan to use this updo for when I get married next month!</li>
            <li> I forgot about it and today out of blue or maybe because of hot weather, I remembered having it, and  found it in the back of my drawer to retry.  </li>
            <li> When you first receive it, it may take a tiny bit of practice to get the proper tension.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so busy, I barely have time to change my sheets or shower.</li>
            <li> Am I missing an important step in actually forming the bun that no one is thinking to mention?</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but will not hold if you have extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, if you check out some tutorials online or follow the instructions that other reviewers left, you&#x27;ll have better results.  </li>
            <li> Having fine hair, there is not a lot to work with so you must pull your small bun around 180 degrees and have the prongs stick into the back of your neck, where they are visible and</li>
            <li> I got the general idea and then had to try about 12 times to get my hair the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Others have commented on my hair, telling me it looks fancy and labor-intensive, and I&#x27;m basically getting the same responses I got when I started wearing the cheap-but-awesome clothes from Old Navy.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE AND USE THEM FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that they mention assorted colors, this contraption is not good for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Holds my long/fine hair up all day and looks professional with only a couple of minutes of time to get pulled back.</li>
            <li> The hairstyle on the box is not cool - and because I&#x27;ve never seen a tool like this, I naturally assumed this was THE style you&#x27;d get with this particular tool.</li>
            <li> Was super sad the hair style was pretty.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, shoulder length hair and the spin pins work so easily and stay put for as long as I want.  </li>
            <li> I received the updo pin today, and at first I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it, and thought it was yet another waste of money as it wasn&#x27;t holding my hair up.  </li>
            <li> It would work better with blunt cut long hair, as opposed to the slight layers I have (which is the reason it looks messy).</li>
            <li> Even with the awkward learning process, I love it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> The color really doesn&#x27;t matter (since blond is more expensive than dark), as you cannot see it while it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> get that when a company introduces a new product they create it based on specs for the average person.</li>
            <li> So my only complaint here is that instead of sending me the light colored one they sent the dark one.</li>
            <li> I still have yet to get my hair in this took to several of my friends short medium and long hair.</li>
            <li> not a single strand of hair would fall loose!</li>
            <li> Remember when Old Navy sucked, and people stopped shopping there, so they were always putting half the store on sale -</li>
            <li> This tool works as well as any chignon pin, better than some, but when the rubber wears off the two ends it becomes useless as the ends are rough and tear your hair going in and then dig into your head.</li>
            <li> part is that this is just a slim metal clip that will not break like the numerous other clips that my daughter and I have plowed through in the last year.</li>
            <li> I have spent in recent memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every person with long hair needs one of these.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and have been trying to mix it up from my go-to bun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either my hair is too long- belt length long layers, or I just can&#x27;t figure this thing</li>
            <li> My hair is about.....20 inches long.</li>
            <li> At first, I was confused by the instructions, but with the help of Lindz&#x27;s review on amazon it totally works!</li>
            <li> I bet it would eliminate a lot of frustration I&#x27;m seeing about this and the other Simple Styles products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re going out for the evening or just at home wanting to get your hair off your neck in the summer heat, this little hook will do the trick, and is sturdy enough to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this clip can hold it all no problem.</li>
            <li> Also, dry hair tends to pop out and look spiky/messy, if that is what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company out of frustration for lack of products designed to be worn in thick hair, they promptly responded forwarding my complaint to their product design department and offered to send me another of their products free of charge.  </li>
            <li> the use the tongs of the pin to pull the base of the bun up, forming a french twist kind of look.  </li>
            <li> They had blonde, brunette, and dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had long hair since I&#x27;ve been growing it out, so I&#x27;m a little clueless with hairstyles.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thickness, fine/straight texture, hangs about 3 inches below my collarbone, and is only slightly layered.</li>
            <li> myself, my hair needs to be in a semi-tight bun, From here I inserted the pin, except that instead of starting at the bottom I placed it about half way up the bun for my hair.</li>
            <li> If you do your bun too tightly and it pokes against your head, it does hurt, so it takes a bit of practice to get a bun that is loose enough to not hurt and tight enough to stay.</li>
            <li> My hair is longer than the average long hair, it goes halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair expert, but ponytails can cause damage to your hair especially when they are wrapped tightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like a French twist, it looks like a messy bun.</li>
            <li> I can even twist up my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Then, when the ends are just barely poking out of the top of your bun, then you can flip up the base of the pin while pressing the two prongs against and then down your scalp.  </li>
            <li> The clip is too long to be hidden in hair and sticks out on both ends.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and wire of wearing it either in a bun or down for work every day, i bought this thinking</li>
            <li> After reviewing multiple you-tube videos, wasting 3 hours of my life, and scratching my scalp raw, I still couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work.</li>
            <li> I use this for the standard bun style, and I insert it when my hair is about half air dried.</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair grips or hair ties</li>
            <li> So far, I get it to work, but the hair looks messy and it pulls hard on the roots.  </li>
            <li> and holly cow was</li>
            <li> I catch a small amount of the bun with the pin upside down, then flip the pin over and push it back through the bun trying to lift the ends of the pin slightly</li>
            <li> Easy to use, make a bun then push the narrow end up through the base of the bun then flip it over and down though the bun or use it side ways for a french twist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, and I spent the 80s shellacking it into place with [[ASIN:B001E5E26I Aussie Instant Freeze]], often to ridiculous amounts of poofiness.</li>
            <li> I was sent one for dark hair.</li>
            <li> I also thought I specified that I wanted the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; colored updo maker, and the dark one was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> For my wedding, I wore my hair down because I couldn&#x27;t find anyone to do my hair</li>
            <li> This will press against the under-curve of your scull (run you hand down your head.</li>
            <li> Then, push it down.</li>
            <li> You end up with the curved part up and the two prongs pointing down towards your neck and well hidden by your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble doing anything other than the ponytail.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to stay for the half up look</li>
            <li> put one less star just because after a while of using it it scratches your head (almost getting to your skull)...</li>
            <li> I can do my hair for work in less than 5 minutes with this product, and it stays all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After watching a few videos and looking through pictures of strangers on the internet, I realized this tool might be like the Old Navy thing - everybody thinks it&#x27;s useless or uncool because our experience is limited to this one uncool picture on the box (and in our brains).</li>
            <li> I just twist my hair and then let the tightly twisted hair kink back and form a tight coiled up bun on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> was a frazzled mess.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t quite work for my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> this item doesn&#x27;t work well with thick long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; thick.  </li>
            <li> This will hold thick long hair without  breaking.  </li>
            <li> it kept wrapping my hair wayyyy too tight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can use this without making it so tight, but pain aside, my hair stayed in place for over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I found myself making it too tight.</li>
            <li> It holds tightly that way.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how I feel about this little hair tool situation.</li>
            <li> There was literally no difference between brunette and dark!    </li>
            <li> Give a little room for give.</li>
            <li> Then you push the pin down into the style and it stays put!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, longish hair and this held, but I do have a bump/bruise on the back of my head where one of the pin ends was digging into my head all night.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a little classier than the messy round buns that I struggled with.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble figuring this out.</li>
            <li> This is a waste.</li>
            <li> My hair is to my collarbones and has a few layers in it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve put in in a few times when I didn&#x27;t care what it looked like and it made my head hurt when the medal pushed against my scalp-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> that girl has short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair [to my waist] and it is my opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is just not long enough, if I&#x27;m just too dumb to figure it out, or if Goody created a too complicated product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and down to the middle of my back and putting this thing and getting sleek results is impossible.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair down to my bra strap; your length, cut and texture may cause your mileage to vary.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, course and long (goes past my bottom).  </li>
            <li> Also, since the color selection sent is random, I ended up with the blonde one</li>
            <li> Not only is it thick but it is also very slick!!</li>
            <li> For someone who has thick curly hair, there are not many hair clips around that can hold everything in.</li>
            <li> I can put my hair up with one of these and it will hold all day even as I work hard on my farm.  </li>
            <li> I have medium (3 inches below shoulders) thick hair</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I figure my hair must be too thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told by just about every stylist that my hair is thick, and it is not just in the strands</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is considered long and thick, but not like crazy long or crazy thick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, have you tried those twisty bobby pins?</li>
            <li> The instructions were a little vague, but I looked it up on YouTube &amp; figured it out.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, and are time-challenged, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stupid contraption.</li>
            <li> Taking it out of the package, I was shocked that it was just one simple curved piece of metal!</li>
            <li> Varying degrees of thin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times and it ends up slipping or stabbing me in the base of my head/neck after awhile.</li>
            <li> I was really afraid that even if I did get this to to work it would come down during the day from all the weight of my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this if you have very thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> I get tired of ponytails and buns</li>
            <li> (I really mean a LOT: hair dressers get their arms tired of cutting and washing my hair</li>
            <li> Did you manage to get your hair into the messy, painful bun?</li>
            <li> What a savior from a boring old bun with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li> just pressed the wrong button here.]</li>
            <li> They just send out random colors?</li>
            <li> Shipping is so expensive though</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get it to hold, the hair has to be twisted.</li>
            <li> No more ponytails or &amp;#34;messy buns&amp;#34; on bad hair/lazy days!</li>
            <li> No idea how it would keep my crazy hair in place.</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted this thing to work.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t said anything bad about the updo pin, but she could just be trying not to hurt my feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have given it up as a bad purchase</li>
            <li> When I got this pin, I tried to follow the directions on the box to create an updo like the picture of the front of the box, but failed miserably.</li>
            <li> What works for my hair is to make a bun, and then insert the pin through the bun (not the base like the instructions say), so you will catch the twists in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to play with my hair and watch tutorials to figure out how to use this, and the instructions on the package are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> Very Difficult to even try to use!</li>
            <li> Worst five dollars</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble figuring this out. it kept wrapping my hair wayyyy too tight. But as I was going to toss it out/write it off, I consulted YouTube. A lot of videos on there, and then I realized you need only put it through the top 1/3 of your bun and then twist--- not all the way to the scalp and then twist. I now use it effortlessly, it keeps hair super secure, and I love love love it. No more ponytails or &amp;#34;messy buns&amp;#34; on bad hair/lazy days!</li>
            <li> Bought this to put my hair up for an outdoor Florida wedding where it was to be extremely hot. As I have no skill whatsoever in doing my own hair, I figured this had to help. It did. While I don&#x27;t think my hair ended up looking like this picture, it looked nice enough to be considered formal. The instructions are ok- I got the general idea and then had to try about 12 times to get my hair the way I wanted it. I have very thick, longish hair and this held, but I do have a bump/bruise on the back of my head where one of the pin ends was digging into my head all night. I don&#x27;t know if you can use this without making it so tight, but pain aside, my hair stayed in place for over 8 hours. Also, since the color selection sent is random, I ended up with the blonde one and I have super dark brown hair, but if you place it right, you can&#x27;t see it anyway.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this product but it doesn&#x27;t quite work for my long thick hair.  When I contacted the company out of frustration for lack of products designed to be worn in thick hair, they promptly responded forwarding my complaint to their product design department and offered to send me another of their products free of charge.  I am very pleased with the support I received and thought I should let others know that they are a great company.</li>
            <li> I have many of these.  I use them every day.  My hair is very thick, course and long (goes past my bottom).  I can put my hair up with one of these and it will hold all day even as I work hard on my farm.  I just twist my hair and then let the tightly twisted hair kink back and form a tight coiled up bun on the back of my head.  I catch a small amount of the bun with the pin upside down, then flip the pin over and push it back through the bun trying to lift the ends of the pin slightly so the ends won&#x27;t ride against my scalp.  Once you figure it out it is so easy!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to go out for the evening tomorrow, and I&#x27;m no genius when it comes to hair... I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, and I spent the 80s shellacking it into place with [[ASIN:B001E5E26I Aussie Instant Freeze]], often to ridiculous amounts of poofiness. I can do a French twist with a long-tooth plastic comb, but the commercials made these products look so easy and so much better that I wanted to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just following the written instructions in the box were not enough for me... I was having trouble doing anything other than the ponytail. The Goody website has the same diagrams, and that wasn&#x27;t helping either. Luckily they have a channel with how-to videos on You Tube. The instructions were much clearer, and watching someone do it was just the thing I needed. Goody really ought to link to the videos on their website, or even do \\&quot;how to\\&quot; commercials. I bet it would eliminate a lot of frustration I&#x27;m seeing about this and the other Simple Styles products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this smooth brass-tone wire is exactly what it says on the tin. I have thick hair down to my bra strap; your length, cut and texture may cause your mileage to vary. The pictures I&#x27;ve uploaded are my first try after watching the how to video for the French twist, on hair washed and flat-ironed. It feels very secure, but it doesn&#x27;t pull. It feels like I could easily use a rat-tail comb to pull tendrils if I wanted, and it looks fantastic. I know the folds in the back look so elegant that I don&#x27;t want to take it down, and I&#x27;m sitting here in shorts and a t shirt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re going out for the evening or just at home wanting to get your hair off your neck in the summer heat, this little hook will do the trick, and is sturdy enough to last a lifetime. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had to watch youtube demos to figure out how to use this, but it was well worth the $6.00.  Looks really nice and is very comfortable once you get the hang of it.  I fixed my hair with it today and got many compliments and inquiries from my students.  Would work very well for nurses or women in the military who need a comfortable, invisible way to keep their hair up for many hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried using this multiple times and even had my husband try using on my hair, thinking there was a trick to it I couldn&#x27;t do without seeing the back of my head. It still didn&#x27;t work.  The clip is too long to be hidden in hair and sticks out on both ends.  It doesn&#x27;t hold hair up on the head (and bobby pins can&#x27;t solve the problem).  Also, it digs into the head when trying to rotate the pin to create the hair style.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was really confused the first time I tried to use this product, simply because the instructions not well written!  What works for my hair is to make a bun, and then insert the pin through the bun (not the base like the instructions say), so you will catch the twists in your hair.  Then, when the ends are just barely poking out of the top of your bun, then you can flip up the base of the pin while pressing the two prongs against and then down your scalp.  You end up with the curved part up and the two prongs pointing down towards your neck and well hidden by your hair.  Since my twists are always different, it may take a couple of tries to get just the right one, but I always get a very nice updo that looks elegant, yet only takes under a minute to do!  I also like that it STAYS! I actually plan to use this updo for when I get married next month!</li>
            <li> I ordered this modern updos by mistake but I TRIED to use them anyway. I&#x27;m always looking for items that I can use in my hair....have quite a collection. I have very thick long hair [to my waist] and it is my opinion this item doesn&#x27;t work well with thick long hair. I even looked at several videos at youtube to see if it was my technique as the illustration on the box isn&#x27;t the greatest.... Nope and NOPE! This items did not work for me, while the spin pins do [that was what I wanted in the 1st place.....just pressed the wrong button here.] Goody does make great products that last a long time, but I do suggest if you find an item they make, that really works wonderfully for you --- make the investment and stock pile the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, anyone need 2 updos??? LOL I did sent one to a friend in LA with shorter but still thick hair. She hasn&#x27;t said anything bad about the updo pin, but she could just be trying not to hurt my feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did try....hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thickness, fine/straight texture, hangs about 3 inches below my collarbone, and is only slightly layered. After reviewing multiple you-tube videos, wasting 3 hours of my life, and scratching my scalp raw, I still couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work. Every time I could actually get it to actually stay the result was a frazzled mess. Am I missing an important step in actually forming the bun that no one is thinking to mention? Does Goody even test these things before sending them out the door? It&#x27;s clear they don&#x27;t test their instructions.  If you have hair like mine, save your money. You&#x27;ll have a nicer, faster result using a set of good old fashioned hair pins.</li>
            <li> I have found that two prong hair pins work great for my hair, but are a total pain in the butt to find. When I saw this one I just had to try it. It works wonderfully and is more comfortable than any of the other two prong hair pins that I own. I hope they come out with versions that are decorated, but I will definitely be using this one for years to come!</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B004R7PE0S Goody Simple Styles Updo Spin Pin]] worked so well, I was hoping for luck with this Simple Styles updo pin.  It wasn&#x27;t so simple.  The instructions that were included were unclear.  With help from the internet and other Amazon reviewers, I was able to make it work.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to make an updo for myself that doesn&#x27;t fall out.  Actually, my first successful updo was the bun with the spin pin.  This is my first successful non-bun updo.</li>
            <li> My hair is longer than the average long hair, it goes halfway down my back. I get tired of ponytails and buns so I thought I would try the modern updo maker. Unless you enjoy the feeling of having your hair pulled, don&#x27;t get this thing. My hairstylist did tell me to try the Goody Spin Pin, so I did, and it works great. I definitely recommend the Spin Pin over the Modern Updo maker.</li>
            <li> My hair is huge, I just couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work on all of my hair. I used it on my sister&#x27;s fine hair, and a friend&#x27;s medium thick hair, and it worked really well. It is easy to use, but will not hold if you have extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very Difficult to even try to use!</li>
            <li> I got this when I bought my spin pins, also from Goody.  So far I haven&#x27;t been able to master this, but to be honest, I gave up on it after seeing how easy the spin pins were.  I have thick, wavy, shoulder length hair and the spin pins work so easily and stay put for as long as I want.  I guess I&#x27;ll check out YouTube to see if I can master this Modern up do maker.  With a little luck I&#x27;ll be able to figure it out after seeing it done.  If not, I&#x27;ll just stick to my spin pins.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  It&#x27;s easy to use, holds my hair all day, and creates a great looking &#x27;do.  What a savior from a boring old bun with a rubber band.  I now carry one in every bag.</li>
            <li> ok so I actually have this product in my hair now and I like it.  When i first bought it and tried to use it I was completely lost,and my husband actually showed me how to use it(sad I know.  So far I&#x27;ve only been able to do one style, hopefully after I play with it for a while i can be able to do more.</li>
            <li> Remember when Old Navy sucked, and people stopped shopping there, so they were always putting half the store on sale - but since people stopped going, nobody realized that along with the super-crazy-low sale prices, Old Navy was also starting to make pretty amazing clothing? Remember that? And then everybody was always telling you how awesome you looked and you felt even MORE awesome because you only spent $2 on the whole outfit (literally!)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s how I feel about this little hair tool situation. The hairstyle on the box is not cool - and because I&#x27;ve never seen a tool like this, I naturally assumed this was THE style you&#x27;d get with this particular tool. Lucky for me, I sort of have a shopping problem and am particularly fond of this bun-technology trend - twisty bobby pins, donut-whachamachalits, etc. Seriously, have you tried those twisty bobby pins? They&#x27;re amazing. After watching a few videos and looking through pictures of strangers on the internet, I realized this tool might be like the Old Navy thing - everybody thinks it&#x27;s useless or uncool because our experience is limited to this one uncool picture on the box (and in our brains). Finally, for whatever reason(s), I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of the moral of the story is, I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot. Others have commented on my hair, telling me it looks fancy and labor-intensive, and I&#x27;m basically getting the same responses I got when I started wearing the cheap-but-awesome clothes from Old Navy. Nobody is the wiser...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find something that will help me to have an easy and professional looking updo.  I&#x27;ve purchased so many things, and none of them have worked....until now!!  I received the updo pin today, and at first I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it, and thought it was yet another waste of money as it wasn&#x27;t holding my hair up.  So I went to youtube and watched a short video.  [...]  After I watched the video, it took me less than two minutes to create a beautiful French twist!!!  I&#x27;ve had it in place all day, and I&#x27;ve been busy doing gardening and running around, and yet my hair still looks perfect!!!  LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> I have to say my hair looks fantastic when I use my updo pin. It&#x27;s the easiest way to get a \\&quot;real\\&quot; hairstyle when I don&#x27;t have time to do the whole blow dry/straighten/style routine. Great for casual wear or dressier occasions. It actually holds the hair pretty securely! The only drawback with this product is that over time, the smooth surface wears off a bit and it&#x27;s harder to push the pin into the hair. However, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars because it&#x27;s well worth it to simply buy a new one when this happens. I had to replace mine after about eight months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not laughing. I&#x27;m so busy, I barely have time to change my sheets or shower. I thought, &amp;#34;oh, cool! I can look pretty without spending hours trying to fix my sad-looking hair!&amp;#34; .... NOT!  If you have long hair, and are time-challenged, don&#x27;t waste your money on this stupid contraption. I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to play with my hair and watch tutorials to figure out how to use this, and the instructions on the package are completely worthless. You&#x27;d be better off spending your money on some hair bands.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that they mention assorted colors, this contraption is not good for fine hair. Mine is just below shoulder length. The prong is way too big. Having fine hair, there is not a lot to work with so you must pull your small bun around 180 degrees and have the prongs stick into the back of your neck, where they are visible and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like a French twist, it looks like a messy bun. If I tilt my head up to look up, the prongs push on my neck and the contraption sticks out of the hair. Did you manage to get your hair into the messy, painful bun? Do not shake your head, it will come undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus this listing says assorted colors. I am blonde. I did not see anywhere that it let me indicate what color I wanted. It seemed luck of the draw. Maybe I was going to be sent two? One of each color? I was sent one for dark hair. They just send out random colors? Worst five dollars I have spent in recent memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why can&#x27;t you choose your color preference? I have bought items on Amazon with multiple color offerings and you always have a place to choose your preference. This is a waste. Please save your money, it is no miracle worker. You can get a neater effect with a rubber band around your neat bun.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is considered long and thick, but not like crazy long or crazy thick. It&#x27;s not even coarse (it&#x27;s opposite). I&#x27;ve tried this several times and it ends up slipping or stabbing me in the base of my head/neck after awhile. Will follow one reviewers advise and see if customer service can help; will update once I here from them. I had much better luck with the bun spinners made by same company.</li>
            <li> I have medium (3 inches below shoulders) thick hair and I toyed with this for a solid hour. Did not do a thing except get stuck... so stuck that I ended up having my mother help me pull the darn thing out of my hair! She almost had to take scissors to it! I don&#x27;t recommend buying this if you have very thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in an updo as I want it, but good to use at home, when just want to hold hair away from my neck</li>
            <li> I really liked the spin pin, so I thought I would give this other goody invention a try. I tried using the instructions on the box (all three updos) and I even looked at the how to videos on youtube. It seemed easy for others, but it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me. My head is still sore from trying to flip the pin! I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is just not long enough, if I&#x27;m just too dumb to figure it out, or if Goody created a too complicated product. My money($5.99 to be exact) is on on the latter.</li>
            <li> This clip is awesome! I can put my hair up easily. It stays all day. Looks so wonderful that the first day I used it I was asked by 6 gals at work how I did my hair and where can they get this clip. I plan on getting more to keep in different bags and at work for a quick put up when my hair makes me hot.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is that this is just a slim metal clip that will not break like the numerous other clips that my daughter and I have plowed through in the last year. Also it takes up literally no room in my purse, so I can always have one handy.&lt;br /&gt;Once you have used it a couple of times, you don&#x27;t even need a mirror!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it side to side as well to vary the look.[[ASIN:B003FV82VA Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker, Assorted Colors, Dark and Light]]</li>
            <li> So far, I get it to work, but the hair looks messy and it pulls hard on the roots.  I will keep practicing.  It would work better with blunt cut long hair, as opposed to the slight layers I have (which is the reason it looks messy).</li>
            <li> good for updo hairstyles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year, and bought it when my hair was a bit longer than my shoulders.  The included instructions weren&#x27;t helpful at all, so this sat in a drawer until I recently dug it out and decided to give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, if you check out some tutorials online or follow the instructions that other reviewers left, you&#x27;ll have better results.  It takes me less than a minute to make a pretty bun or updo with this, and it holds my fine, wavy, mid-back-length hair in place really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just play around a bit with this and have fun with it!  It&#x27;s great for casual and even more formal updos!</li>
            <li> Every person with long hair needs one of these.  Easiest and fastest way ever to get a super sophisticated up-do.  I keep one in my desk drawer at work for surprise meetings and client visits.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Quick arrival. The item is exactly as described and it is great for a new hairstyle</li>
            <li> I love this simple clip, it holds my hair (medium length) securely and looks great, people always ask how I did my hair. I lost my original clip a few months ago and just found it on Amazon and ordered another, can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive, haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for months I hope they are still making this clip! Easy to use, make a bun then push the narrow end up through the base of the bun then flip it over and down though the bun or use it side ways for a french twist</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out and just about got it to work for me. When I am able to get it to work I never have had it stay for more than like 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I recently found it among stuff I forgot about but never got around to returning so I gave it another try. Just doesn&#x27;t work for me any which way I try it.&lt;br /&gt;I figure my hair must be too thick. 1) It hurts (like hell at times) when I AM able to flip it up and push it through my twisted hair. 2) Although it seems securely nestled in my hair within a few minutes it is pulling away from my scalp and my hair starts unraveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told by just about every stylist that my hair is thick, and it is not just in the strands but I have plenty of strands per square inch. One stylist told me I have 3 times as much hair as most people. I am part Hispanic (Puerto Rican) so that is where that comes from. Not an unusual race to find in America so why has Goody not come around to create hair accessories that work with such hair types?&lt;br /&gt;I get that when a company introduces a new product they create it based on specs for the average person. Medium length, medium thickness, fairly straight hair. It has been years since this product has been on the market and they have not introduced new sizes.</li>
            <li> On a whim I ordered this. OMG where has this been all my life???? I love it!!! I can quickly put my hair up and I don&#x27;t need any bobby pins!  This is an awesome product! I am going to order a second to keep in my work bag!</li>
            <li> Great for quickly pulling up long hair without any damage.  You can put in place and remove in seconds.  I use one almost every day.</li>
            <li> This tool works as well as any chignon pin, better than some, but when the rubber wears off the two ends it becomes useless as the ends are rough and tear your hair going in and then dig into your head.</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair and this holds ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I am completely hair do challenged.  For my wedding, I wore my hair down because I couldn&#x27;t find anyone to do my hair and I wasn&#x27;t going to wear a pony tail (the extent of my \\&quot;updo\\&quot; abilities).  I bought this today because I wanted to give it a try and I was hoping that it would work.  I have a lot of hair but the strands are all really fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t typically hold pins really well.  And, as I mentioned, I can&#x27;t do my own hair.  But this was so easy to use - you form a bun (idiot-proof), the use the tongs of the pin to pull the base of the bun up, forming a french twist kind of look.  Then you push the pin down into the style and it stays put!  It literally took me 30 seconds to do.  And it looked great!  Finally, I can quit spending over $100 to get an updo.  Or, I can get a simple updo for a cute date-night hair do change.  Thank you Goody!</li>
            <li> I bought it last year but could not figure out how to make it work for me. I forgot about it and today out of blue or maybe because of hot weather, I remembered having it, and  found it in the back of my drawer to retry.  Wow!  It works and it is easy if you practice it a couple of times! I am giving 5 stars and am going to buy few more to keep them around.</li>
            <li> Still CANNOT figure out how to use this tool and make my hair stay.</li>
            <li> I bought this modern updo pin after borrowing my sister&#x27;s spin pins.  I got the brunette colour, and my hair matches it fairly well. I bought it at Superstore (Canada) for 6.99+tax. They had blonde, brunette, and dark. There was literally no difference between brunette and dark!    Taking it out of the package, I was shocked that it was just one simple curved piece of metal! No idea how it would keep my crazy hair in place. It is sturdy wire piece, I&#x27;m not worried that it will snap or anything.  At first, I was confused by the instructions, but with the help of Lindz&#x27;s review on amazon it totally works! I really like the updo.  My hair is to my collarbones and has a few layers in it. It takes less than a minute to put my hair up this way and it is in the updo so securely! It doesn&#x27;t fall out, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my head at all like buns secured with ponytail elastics do! I&#x27;m no hair expert, but ponytails can cause damage to your hair especially when they are wrapped tightly. This feels better as your hair is just twisted into a bun and secured with a metal piece through it.  Also, it&#x27;s a little classier than the messy round buns that I struggled with. I&#x27;ve only had long hair since I&#x27;ve been growing it out, so I&#x27;m a little clueless with hairstyles. This one is EASY! I plan on wearing it to classes at college all the time, it&#x27;s so fast!   I lent it to my sister and she plans on buying one too for work as it is a classy look if you take time to do it neatly!  I strongly recommend the modern updo. I know I will be getting lots of wear out of it.</li>
            <li> Not the best product for the French twist, but can be useful for other updos, hold hair in place well.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE AND USE THEM FREQUENTLY.  SIMPLE AND QUITE FUNCTIONAL.</li>
            <li> This pin is really perfect. It&#x27;s reasonably sized, very well-made (used, abused, stepped on, jammed around—they never bend or break), comfortably follows the curve of the head (I can sleep in it) and the ends don&#x27;t snag or or scratch, it looks respectable in my kit, the finish doesn&#x27;t flake, and with practiced placement it holds like a blast shelter. The only reason I have to replace them is when I misplace them.</li>
            <li> It do!esn&#x27;t hold in place. I&#x27;ve tried 40 times</li>
            <li> Need I say more.  The instructions were a little vague, but I looked it up on YouTube &amp; figured it out.  My hair is long &amp; thick.  This thing puts into a French twist in no time.  I always get tons compliments.  I have used the twists as well, but nothing holds my hair like this.</li>
            <li> This pin is amazing. I have medium thickness hair that is almost bra strap length, that used to be straight but has some wave now. I use this for the standard bun style, and I insert it when my hair is about half air dried. It looks chic and knotty while it is in. However, possibly the best part is that you can take it out and have beautiful wavy hair! No crimps or funky looking wrong-way hair like you get from a plastic clip or a scrunchy or a hair elastic. Seriously, if I&#x27;m too rushed to do my hair, I leave it in this for a few hours and then have beautiful hair for the rest of the day. The color really doesn&#x27;t matter (since blond is more expensive than dark), as you cannot see it while it&#x27;s in. If you do your bun too tightly and it pokes against your head, it does hurt, so it takes a bit of practice to get a bun that is loose enough to not hurt and tight enough to stay. Also, dry hair tends to pop out and look spiky/messy, if that is what you&#x27;re going for. I prefer the damp hair look, as it is more professional. I can&#x27;t get it to stay for the half up look that they show in the package insert, but the main look is so great that I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this item makes it very easy for me to put my hair up into a french twist, its fast, I dont feel it, and it stays in place all day. For someone who has thick curly hair, there are not many hair clips around that can hold everything in. THIS is one of them. I have ordered several :)</li>
            <li> I was buying another hair tool and came across this - thought I would give it a try. Very easy to do and works well. I have very soft, fine hair, so it doesn&#x27;t last all day with me. But it&#x27;s easy enough to redo. I would recommend getting it. Not expensive and something different. I use it now and then and always get compliments when I do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to be able to make this thing work.  I have given it up as a bad purchase</li>
            <li> I ordered this updo pin because I have a couple of the Goody Spin Pins and they are awesome. I have long hair and have been trying to mix it up from my go-to bun. When I got this pin, I tried to follow the directions on the box to create an updo like the picture of the front of the box, but failed miserably. It took a little practice, but I finally got a similar result and am happy overall. I wish better directions were included though.</li>
            <li> Of course I lost the first one I had but I loved it so much that I got another one. I have very long hair and this clip can hold it all no problem. It is easy to use, just turn upside down, insert into hair, then scoop upward to secure!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (I really mean a LOT: hair dressers get their arms tired of cutting and washing my hair and they always say how much hair I&#x27;ve got) and I&#x27;m in constant search of products that can help my hair look with more style. I originally found this product in a Walgreens and bought it... but I never figured out how to use it (I think that at that time there were no instructions embedded in the box) and I just put it in a drawer and forgot about it. After maybe a year or so, I saw this in Amazon and read about the reviews and remembered I had one in my drawer... there is a picture with instructions on how to wear it here in Amazon and I gave this thing another try... and holly cow was I surprised! I could not believe that I could do headbanging and not a single strand of hair would fall loose! I just had to order a couple more of these things since I now cannot live without it! Unlike other hair grips or hair ties this will not leave marks and will actually make more waves if you decide to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;I put one less star just because after a while of using it it scratches your head (almost getting to your skull)... but I can take some pain given the fact that it holds my hair in a very stilish way!&lt;br /&gt;Beauty hurts... what can I say... but in general this is a cool product! Just learn how to use it!</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted this thing to work.I have very long hair and wire of wearing it either in a bun or down for work every day, i bought this thinking i could use it for french twist or any kind of twist or up-do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either my hair is too long- belt length long layers, or I just can&#x27;t figure this thing out-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real directions on the package, I&#x27;ve put in in a few times when I didn&#x27;t care what it looked like and it made my head hurt when the medal pushed against my scalp- this might be because I have so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not for me, maybe if you have shorter hair and more patience it would work for you.</li>
            <li> I still have yet to get my hair in this took to several of my friends short medium and long hair. Varying degrees of thin and thick hair. No one has managed to get this to work correctly. Was super sad the hair style was pretty.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. this is my go to clip :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy, but I&#x27;m going into a profession for which I need to look elegant. The extent of my hair-dressing skills is a pony-tail. However, pony-tails loosen with time, and I wanted something I can just throw in and not worry about.</li>
            <li> I could not get this to work properly; I even watched some youtube videos and couldn&#x27;t get it to stay securely in my hair. Would not recommend. I also thought I specified that I wanted the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; colored updo maker, and the dark one was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I cannot figure mine out. I don&#x27;t see how they got the style on the front of the packaging. Mine never looks like any of the styles listed.</li>
            <li> So my only complaint here is that instead of sending me the light colored one they sent the dark one. Shipping is so expensive though so I&#x27;m not going to bother sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work. My hair is about.....20 inches long. Not only is it thick but it is also very slick!! I was really afraid that even if I did get this to to work it would come down during the day from all the weight of my hair. I was supper happy when it didn&#x27;t. This product does take a while to get used! It took me about 15 minuets to figure out how to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, my hair needs to be in a semi-tight bun, From here I inserted the pin, except that instead of starting at the bottom I placed it about half way up the bun for my hair. It looked fabulous and held all day!! Really happy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**One thing to note. This will press against the under-curve of your scull (run you hand down your head. Feel where it kind of dips off? That&#x27;s the area where the pin sets.) If you are prone to headaches make sure it feels comfortable of you may experience some side effects.</li>
            <li> It was a challenge to figure out the directions. Everything went much better when I followed my instincts with it. Once you get it, its simple and the style are beautiful. It allows for a classy up-do, perfect for a change. I found myself making it too tight. This can be avoided if you don&#x27;t use it at the complete bottom of your bun. Give a little room for give. Even with the awkward learning process, I love it and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can do my hair for work in less than 5 minutes with this product, and it stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get it to hold, the hair has to be twisted. The principle is the same as twisting your hair into a bun then sticking a pencil through it - the hair is trying to untwist, it presses against the item in your hair, and that tension is what holds the style in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, twist up the hair. Then put the ends of the pin into the twist. The pin should be pointing at your scalp. Push it into the twist. Then, angle the pin up like a lever. Then, push it down. The trick is to catch some twists of hair in there. The tension as those twists try to untwist is what&#x27;s going to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it really easy to use. The push-and-lever move I described is the same thing you would do with bobby pins, and is demonstrated in a bunch of youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really easy way to get a professional look with minimal effort. I can even twist up my wet hair. It dries in the twist. If I leave the very ends free and shape them into finger curls, then when I take the whole thing out at the end of the day it&#x27;s very pretty and wavy. No effort!!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Holds my long/fine hair up all day and looks professional with only a couple of minutes of time to get pulled back.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but you either rip your hair out putting it in securely or it falls out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This will hold thick long hair without  breaking.  Made sturdy not to break.  I TWIST MY HAIR FIRST.  THEN WRAP INTO A FRENCH SIDE BUN.  Using the pin, you slide  it forward ...then in opposite  direction. It holds tightly that way.  I use mine all the the time for a bun or  frechtwist or side do. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I like it but I&#x27;m having problems keeping it in my hair. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had long hair to work with.</li>
            <li> I need my hair up for swimming exercise. This works perfect and I am very pleased with it.(Youtube has some excellent demos instructing use which were very helpful).</li>
            <li> Looks great for my daughters hair, however in mine I have too much to have it hold properly. Nice concept.</li>
            <li> It makes putting your hair up as simple as can be.  I use it all the time over hair ties.</li>
            <li> Simple! I use mine several times a week as a quick way to tidy my long hair.  I often get complimented when I&#x27;ve used it. People think it&#x27;s taken me much time to get such a style, I don&#x27;t let on that it&#x27;s the easiest and quickest thing I could have done. When you first receive it, it may take a tiny bit of practice to get the proper tension.</li>
            <li> If you have any hair this thing doesn&#x27;t work.  My hair is thick and down to the middle of my back and putting this thing and getting sleek results is impossible.  I&#x27;ve tried to follow the \\&quot;directions\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve watched the youtube videos and nothing.  I took it to my friend who has short very, very thin hair and it worked perfectly.  It&#x27;s the same as in the goody youtube video for the product...that girl has short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> the  best way to hold you fake ponny tail in place.</li>
