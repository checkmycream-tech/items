            <li>Amazing purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;People, mostly women, stop me all the time to ask what I&#x27;m wearing and tell me how wonderful it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved it &amp; will reorder when out.</li>
            <li>how much I loved it ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Well, I still love it and it smells great on me, too.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I found a place that has it.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>I believe that all women must have two things in life--nice lingerie and nice perfume.  </li>
            <li>I think Burberry in general smells wonderful on men, but I have yet to find a perfume of theirs that I would wear.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge too!</li>
            <li>Now I have gotten too many compliments on that fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>(there are so many Burberry fragrances).  </li>
            <li>However, found it and hope to keep using it  Love it.</li>
            <li>Better for me.</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent of this perfume and have had many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing when I go out with this on.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is one of the perfumes I get the most compliments on from just about any demographic.</li>
            <li>Tracking was very easy and worrie free.</li>
            <li>Never bought a fragrance without trying it on myself first, but it smelled so good</li>
            <li>but I enjoy it more.</li>
            <li>I like more sweet smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but the scent doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li>so I know the original scent.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, not too strong.</li>
            <li>, it is sweet without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>what they say is true--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Giant bottle for super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding, too, that its Asian light floral aura transitions nicely from the colder winter months to the heat of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I adore smelling the powdery fresh scent on her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first choice for a daily scent, but when I want something different -- it&#x27;s a great go to scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I did not totally fall in love with this fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>First purchased this in Aruba years ago, and then couldn&#x27;t find it</li>
            <li>Funny thing is that Amazon can ship fragrances but won&#x27;t let you return it because of hazard issue</li>
            <li>The notes were extremely masculine to me, and frankly I didn&#x27;t feel there was anything too unique about it.</li>
            <li>I really like Burberry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very woodsy.</li>
            <li>I got this item for a much cheaper price than it is sold in stores.  </li>
            <li>It was a speedy delivery with free shipping, and came in only two days!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for this perfume at all.</li>
            <li>almost* every time I go out, so in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t run out fast...</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this and won&#x27;t be the last.  </li>
            <li>I received this heavenly scent as a gift from someone special last Christmas and have worn it almost daily ever since.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How far off could they be?</li>
            <li>Item came as expected, very prompt delivery!</li>
            <li>To me it smells way to masculine to be a female perfume.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the bigger bottle because I had smelled the perfume in a department store prior to this purchase and new</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazon is less expensive than a department store. My wife and I like the scent, it is sweet without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it &amp; will reorder when out. Shipping was very fast. Very happy with amason.com</li>
            <li> I really like Burberry The Beat for women and wanted to try Touch. How far off could they be? Night and day. I like more sweet smelling perfumes. This one totally reminds me of Axe deodorant. It&#x27;s very woodsy. To me it smells way to masculine to be a female perfume. Nauseating.</li>
            <li> I did not totally fall in love with this fragrance at all. It is just not my cup of tea, I guess.  I prefer the Burberry London fragrance.  Now I have gotten too many compliments on that fragrance.  If given a choice, I prefer Burberry London over Burberry Touch anyday. Just my opinion, though.</li>
            <li> Found out about this scent from a co-worker who was wearing it in the cube next to me and had to have it IMMEDIATELY!  Never bought a fragrance without trying it on myself first, but it smelled so good I HAD to have it... Well, I still love it and it smells great on me, too.  Not at all heavy as some other reviewers have suggested if applied with a lighter hand. It does last a long time which I like.</li>
            <li> I got this item for a much cheaper price than it is sold in stores.  It was a speedy delivery with free shipping, and came in only two days! Amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years. It is my preferred fragance of all. The pricing is very attractive too.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this perfume at all. The notes were extremely masculine to me, and frankly I didn&#x27;t feel there was anything too unique about it. I think Burberry in general smells wonderful on men, but I have yet to find a perfume of theirs that I would wear.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent, very good price. This fragance smells awesome on girls between ages of 20 to 35. I bought it for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> First purchased this in Aruba years ago, and then couldn&#x27;t find it (there are so many Burberry fragrances).  However, found it and hope to keep using it  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife and she immediately noticed that this was a fake. I would never buy any type of fragrances from Amazon again. Funny thing is that Amazon can ship fragrances but won&#x27;t let you return it because of hazard issue lol.</li>
            <li> Our daughter got the Burberry Touch in Paris for my wife.  I am very glad I found a place that has it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my wife for last 5 years. I adore smelling the powdery fresh scent on her. It&#x27;s subtle and lasts all day. to boot she also gets compliments at her work. She enjoys it but I enjoy it more. Better for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent of this perfume and have had many people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing when I go out with this on. I decided to go with the bigger bottle because I had smelled the perfume in a department store prior to this purchase and new how much I loved it ahead of time. I use perfume *almost* every time I go out, so in hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t run out fast...the bigger bottle was mandatory. GREAT purchase, and price!!</li>
            <li> I believe that all women must have two things in life--nice lingerie and nice perfume.  Burberry Touch is a wonderful scent without being overpowering.  It&#x27;s not my first choice for a daily scent, but when I want something different -- it&#x27;s a great go to scent.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the awesome deal i got.&lt;br /&gt;Giant bottle for super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to perfume &amp; this is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I received this heavenly scent as a gift from someone special last Christmas and have worn it almost daily ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an iridescent scent that works from day to night, from casual to elegant, from office to an evening out.

            <li> I love this perfume!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I always get compliments on it.  Smells clean and fresh, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Item came as expected, very prompt delivery! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this burberry perfume...i would definitely recommend it to anybody. This bottle is huge too!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my purchase. Got it on time with no worries. Package was very good. Tracking was very easy and worrie free.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s light but the scent doesn&#x27;t disappear. I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on it. The company shipped on time and everything was just as described. I will use them again.</li>
            <li> Burberry is always a great scent for either men or women.  This is not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this and won&#x27;t be the last.  This is one of the perfumes I get the most compliments on from just about any demographic.</li>
            <li> Looks like real bottle and real packaging but the perfume inside is 100% FAKE! There were other reviews claiming it to be fake and I thought its amazon, how can it be fake. Well it is. I have used Touch so I know the original scent. Don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
