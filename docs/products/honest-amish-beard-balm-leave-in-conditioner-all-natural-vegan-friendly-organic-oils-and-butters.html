            <li>And I have a fairly sized beard.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>

            <li>Smells good. -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;what the heck is that smell?!\\&quot; I use a lighter pine smelling conditioner during the day but when my beard needs a really good conditioning I use this before bed.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good.</li>

            <li>Like a healthy an earthy smell almost!</li>
            <li>I find that rubbing my fingers in a circular motion within the tin to melt the balm and then applying with my fingertips after a hot shower works the best.  </li>
            <li>- I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>

            <li>Beard will look puppy-free and looking nice for the beard loving ladies.    </li>
            <li>nice smell..</li>
            <li>Conditions the beard nicely, and after using it on my beard</li>
            <li>excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>He loves it, uses it every day now...and it kind of has a manly herby scent without being overpowering or smelling like patchouli.</li>
            <li>she made me look to see if Honest Amish had soap with the scent (they don&#x27;t--hint, hint).  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t honestly expect anything to work 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although another fragrance would be nice.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t even go a week before I had to order Honest Amish again.</li>
            <li>It just feels soothing and nice.  </li>
            <li>I have an amazingly unruly beard and although this product does a perfect job of softening the hair and making it much easier to come, it does not help my beard keep shape.  </li>
            <li>However, it does melt nicely with some rubbing.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s promo&#x27;ed Honest Amish to his bearded buddies as I have to my girlfriends with bearded menfolk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using Honest Amish for about 4 months</li>
            <li>It has tamed my unruly beard and turned me from a hillbilly to a trendy hipster.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and doesnt leave my beard greasy.</li>
            <li>Has a nice beard man scent and provides nice shine and softness to the beard.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish has a customer for life.</li>
            <li>This smells sooo good, I love when my husband uses it.</li>
            <li>My husband says it feels nice</li>
            <li>Nice feel to skin and mustach.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>While shopping on Amazon, I happened upon Honest Amish Beard Balm and decided this stuff needed to be in his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li>As a bonus it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard nice.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish has saved me from the grips of the persistent itch.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish</li>
            <li>I would suggest using some kind of stiff-bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>and I can notice my beard has a nice shimmer now.</li>
            <li>For the most part it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I did not see many good results.</li>
            <li>Since I started using Honest Amish:</li>
            <li>If you have a longer beard, you might want some kind of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>It helps my beard look, feel, and smell nice.</li>
            <li>It has the added benefit of leaving your hands smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and my kids don&#x27;t complain about my kisses being too scratchy now.</li>
            <li>: this stuff smells really nice, but not overpowering or cologne-y.</li>
            <li>It smooths and softens your beard, gives your hairs a nice shine, and makes it easier to comb and style.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but the fragrance fades in an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I bought Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-</li>
            <li>This beard balm smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>You need to warm up your hands by rubbing them together before putting some on.</li>
            <li>My dog apparently really liked it and started chewing on the tin.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended the Honest Amish beard balm since I was letting my beard grow out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda of a lavender/licorice smell that I find to be nice and soothing.</li>
            <li>Since I began using Honest Amish</li>
            <li>Ever since I began tending my whisker-crop with Honest A</li>
            <li>his beard has been softer and healthier looking with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have found something that makes it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you, Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, like the smell and how my beard feels.</li>
            <li>This was part of a shipment that was sub par, but once I overlooked the damage, the product stood on its own.  </li>
            <li>Also it puts a nice shine on it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It melted and he has to keep it in the fridge, but that&#x27;s the way it goes with warm temps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know honestly.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds shine to your beard which is nice and</li>
            <li>If you cringe at the thought of wearing even the weakest scent, as some men do, Honest Amish makes an unscented version of this balm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the Honest Amish Beard Balm for my boyfriend and he LOVES it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and has really helped my beard looking and feeling great</li>
            <li>Wish I had found Honest Amish years ago.</li>
            <li>My beard never looked so good, &amp; seems to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use beard oils and honest amish beard balm.</li>
            <li>This product honestly works the way it says.</li>
            <li>Enter Honest Amish Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone has their own opinion as to the smell.  </li>
            <li>The honest Amish residue on the comb serves as a nice touch up without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about a month of using Honest Amish</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a shot and liked the results.</li>
            <li>for the smell, it smells nice and is not overpowering, so</li>
            <li>it all, has a smell that you would kind of expect from a product like this.</li>
            <li>Nice for moisturizing beard/skin.</li>
            <li>He really liked it.</li>
            <li>I now use it in conjunction with Honest Amish beard wax (wax in the morning and balm and night).  </li>
            <li>the smell is rugged, work type and it does smell nice</li>
            <li>absolutely the best product I have used on my beard.</li>
            <li>Will always get Honest  Amish for my beardly needs.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to take it someplace that it might be sideways or upsidedown and warm.  </li>
            <li>Like a bag in a warm car or luggage...</li>
            <li>That took me to an Amazon search which led me to Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t rocket science, and you can tweak your own creation to suit your preferences.</li>
            <li>I would have really liked if it had an added cooling/menthol time of feeling to it.</li>
            <li>My husband love it, smell good</li>
            <li>make sure you rub it in good.</li>
            <li>I liked but this one cannot be shipped to Angola my country.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of the balm and it was not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>After weeks of application my beard now has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Aftermath: leaves you beard kind of shiny but doesn&#x27;t actually...mold your beard</li>
            <li>I even tried the Honest Amish Wax in an attempt to try to get my beard to relax a bit, and that it did not work.</li>
            <li>Heck, he&#x27;s started to talk about wanting to go on a fox hunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish, you&#x27;ve helped us start to rebuild our failing relationship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Honest Amish beard</li>
            <li>He says it feels nice and does help soften it while growing it out.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>before I gave Honest Amish a try.</li>
            <li>That said, Honest Amish melts in my hand a lot faster and easier than Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>It makes her smell nice.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Honest Amish beard wax as well.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t provide much control, it makes up for it w/ great conditioning power and shine!</li>
            <li>People would for sure talk about your good smell and your beard got shine and beatiful.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and hit is with my wife&#x27;s hair dryer and then put it in the fridge, now its a nice consistancy.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like liquorice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Basically it would start to look kind of &amp;</li>
            <li>Goes on kind of greasy however throughout the day my beard hairs absorb the product so by the end of the day when I feel my beard</li>
            <li>do not work for Honest Amish</li>
            <li>I will have a tin of Honest Amish in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and I have found the Honest Amish is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, keeps my beard and skin conditioned.  </li>
            <li>This seemed nice, but everything I touched afterwards became greasy.</li>
            <li>So I ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm from Amazon.</li>
            <li>But, I think none of them could probably match the conditioning of all the ingredients in Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>It just kind of sits on the hair.</li>
            <li>I am not one to buy into cosmetic products nor trendy things like this.  </li>
            <li>A nice experiment, this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on October 24, 2014 and honestly could not be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it keeps his beard nice and manageable.</li>
            <li>Has a nice woodsy/licorice smell that&#x27;s not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is good for your hands</li>
            <li>Nice Valentine&#x27;s gift for my husband.</li>
            <li>HONEST</li>
            <li>Honest Amish has tamed my ethnicities quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and blends well.  </li>
            <li>I gave Honest Amish an honest month of use and honestly can say I this product was objectionable for me and my family.</li>
            <li>I have to warm it up before using and it is a pain.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and softens my beard nicely.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and he loves it.</li>
            <li>My goatee is softening up nicely.</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to have a choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice</li>
            <li>Honest Amish did the trick.</li>
            <li>Help soften the hairs and give it a nice look.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, too.</li>
            <li>But since I started using Honest Amish</li>
            <li>Then I heard about Honest Amish and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>It was nice stuff.</li>
            <li>The balm isn&#x27;t too greasy and it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>Which is nice.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>but it softens and keeps everything nice looking.</li>
            <li>I liked it alot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a conditioner for my beard, it worked nice there...</li>
            <li>Honest Amish has made an impression on me.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised with a nice spicy scent.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice shine, which brings out your highlights.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work well, smells nice and lasts longet than i would have thought.</li>
            <li>and it makes a nice oil.</li>
            <li>So I am a fan of the Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li>It just seems to had a nice conditioned sheen.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>rest of the reviews are spot on - this stuff makes my beard feel nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a Great Product!!</li>
            <li>Honest Amish RUles</li>
            <li>Thank you Honest Amish, we will purchase this time and time again.</li>
            <li>Plus the emails checking in on their customers are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m telling all my friends about Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>My husband liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really liked this beard balm for his grizzly winter beard.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell and it did make his beard softer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>A year or so ago I ordered Honest Amish Beard conditioner from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>would and have recommended Honest Amish Beard Balm to friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing to know is that this is NOT some kind of shaping or styling balm.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of a non- factor.  </li>
            <li>Well packaged, good instructions for use, top value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is grainy but not that kind of grainy that you have to rub and rub to disappear.</li>
            <li>Now, let&#x27;s be honest ( Amish )</li>
            <li>Why did I select Honest Amish ?</li>
            <li>My Beard loves Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;Beard™ approved.</li>
            <li>I ended up finding Honest Amish here and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does a good job of taming most stray hairs.</li>
            <li>smell is nice &amp; mellow.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>After some research online I was led to beard balms and eventually to Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>and also it has a nice honey vanilla to it,,, its an absolute the best beard balm</li>
            <li>Not too oily with a nice, woody aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, it makes my beard nice and full.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of like a wood shop.</li>
            <li>He said the quality was great and I&#x27;m happy with the fast shipping</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for a great product!</li>
            <li>Nice work</li>
            <li>Honest</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of keeping your beard in check.</li>
            <li>I was recommended Honest Amish</li>
            <li>, I also liked the presentation.</li>
            <li>A nice leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in good health.</li>
            <li>Me personally, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have the issue of grittiness that some have commented on, just have to warm it up in your hands before applying.</li>
            <li>Makes it looks nice, conditioned and well-maintained.</li>
            <li>Nice odor and does the trick, though it leaves his beard a bit too shiny for his liking.</li>
            <li>We went on to order beard and body soap and beard oil from Honest Amish after this purchase.</li>
            <li>I alternative between this and my own beard oil.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say the product matched the reviews and recommendations.</li>
            <li>That was a nice side-effect.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s beard is so nice because of use of this product.</li>
            <li>I also noticed recently it is really nice even after I shower at the gym and then blow-dry it.</li>
            <li>, i cannot recommend this Honest Amish beard balm</li>
            <li>I use it on my face too, and it keeps it nice and moisturated.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>and she gets a nice dab of oily residue on her face &amp;</li>
            <li>Very nice helps my beard feel smooth and helps soften it.</li>
            <li>It gives my beard a pleasant sheen, helps calm my unruly whiskers, and adds a pleasant smell that I&#x27;ve had described as &amp;#34;Man.</li>
            <li>It has a strong nutty scent which some find medicinal in nature but is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and not too strong and organic in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty pleasant!</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>awesome, best product for my beard, use when your beard is wet, smells good and is a great natural product</li>
            <li>But Honest Amish is amazing and sent me a full refund because I didn&#x27;t like the scent!!</li>
            <li>No one product is perfect for 100% of users but we highly recommend you try this stuff.</li>
            <li>this, along with a good shower beard routine will help your beard grow nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>Good product, smell is kind of strong</li>
            <li>If it is like the first i would happily change the star rating because the first was excellent</li>
            <li>looks full, and feels great.</li>
            <li>It corralled all of the fliers into a tidy order and leaves a fine sheen that looks quite good with my darker beard.</li>
            <li>This Balm is great, I love the way it works in the beard and has a fantastic smell</li>
            <li>However this product does work great, and it&#x27;s hassle free, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>Great product, as advertised it is greatly reducing itch and making my beard soft and helping it grow fuller.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a great product and for having great customer service so far.</li>
            <li>my beard balm was delivered quickly and was everything as advertised, extremely happy and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing and smells great.</li>
            <li>We both enjoy the scent - it&#x27;s pleasantly mild.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>i think that the smell is light and quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Works good, strong odor</li>
            <li>Great mild licorice smell, absorbs in fully, no greasy beard feel at all.</li>
            <li>and i can not say enough good about Honest Amish products!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth going on and leaves you feeling good.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will finish off my beard with just a bit of beard oil for good measure, but this stuff really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your hands and it does a good job of softening the beard.</li>
            <li>It goes in easy, smells good</li>
            <li>quick delivery and great product.  </li>

            <li>Very impressed, makes my beard very soft.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s just what you get when you use a balm rather than oil), is that it melts very very easily.</li>

            <li>It spreads very easily among my beard.</li>

            <li>Then I bought the Honest Amish Beard Balm, which almost immediately made it better.  </li>
            <li>I had more than one person tell me to get some Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective for a full day and a tin lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>Helps keeps the fly aways down, conditions the beard and makes it shiny (not greasy looking, but awesome looking).</li>
            <li>The smell is one of a kind and very unique, I enjoy it a good bit.</li>
            <li>I did my research and settled on Honest Amish, Very glad I did, smells great, easy to use, not greasy, and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Save beard balm for special occasions when you want your beard to look and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very nice after a hot shower, my beard really liked this stuff</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, apply it right after a shower or washing my face and it does well to condition my beard.</li>
            <li>This stuff has just the right consistency, and it does do a great job at holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
            <li>And easy to comb!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, like sweet pine.</li>
            <li>But, my beard is already more manageable, softer, cleaner - just looks more healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY too strong!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this very much,  keeps my beard healthy and well conditioned and looking good!</li>
            <li>I was recommended Honest Amish by a friend, further realizing it was the #1 best seller on Amazon</li>
            <li>Beard is soft, sexy, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my beard soft as ever, helped hold it in a good position all day.</li>
            <li>plan on expanding into the Honest Amish product line as time goes on, for now I&#x27;m sticking to the conditioner and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works great, definitely recommend</li>
            <li>I quickly got used to it and found it to be a pleasant</li>
            <li>Has a great scent; and when I don&#x27;t have time to use the Original wax it does a pretty good job of shaping my beard.</li>
            <li>Nice and smells clean!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent when you first put it on, and it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Very nice , great smell , does not hold as much as I expected but defiantly makes the beard looks much much better!</li>
            <li>First of all, the scent is great.</li>
            <li>The first order was a great product.  </li>
            <li>I dig it, because it smells pretty great.</li>

            <li>First and foremost, the ordering process was great.</li>

            <li>The one good thing was their satisfaction guarantee, which I took advantage of to return the remainder of the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a full week now and already have good results from it.</li>
            <li>but they were excellent in sending me the right stuff right away.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The container comes in a mini burlap sack, I&#x27;m sure hand-sewn by underprivileged youth.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that, so far so good, it seems to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this product at all - the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I have to think there is probably much better products on the market.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.....</li>
            <li>My beard looks healthy and manly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do I love it?</li>
            <li>and he loves the smell. :)</li>
            <li>Just work it from the bottom of your beard, going against the &#x27;grain&#x27;, towards the top.  </li>
            <li>In about an hour you won&#x27;t be able to stop touching it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received a lot more compliments on my beard for sure.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More manageable.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but I wasn&#x27;t wooes.</li>
            <li>Makes man-thing&#x27;s beard even more glorious than it already is.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my favorite, though.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok and works ok.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and shine it gives to my beard.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li>had me try some of his which I instantly found perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my brother as a gift, he likes the smell and feel of it more than the beard oils that he has been using.</li>
            <li>more then I do, but</li>
            <li>Its one of the more softening balms.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on well and seems too light to be effective at conditioning and taming a beard.</li>
            <li>I got this for my love and he likes it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this selection, as it does all that I&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;would expect from a top quality moisturizer and softner.</li>
            <li>It does just what is advertised, protects and helps with a healthy beard.</li>
            <li>I think that this product gives a nicer visible result, but what separates them more than anything is THE SMELL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with nothing but the exotic oils, herbs and spices of Amish lore    </li>
            <li>It smells like a handsome man.</li>
            <li>but you wont be able to style it with this stuff</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I gave this only one star because I don&#x27;t think its the best product for me.</li>
            <li>because I know people that use it and love it</li>
            <li>My favorite beard product is Beard Grease from The Beardsmith.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>In 3 days my beard has a softer feel better management.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>The clove is quite prominent.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and gets the job done, my dad really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li>I love the look.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Both are outstanding.</li>
            <li>and she still said, &amp;#34;Eww.&amp;#34; Even more than that, when it goes on your mustache</li>
            <li>So I guess my problem is mostly with the answers that were given by others that have bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The best feature I have discovered about this product is that it is receptive of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I thought as a balm it would have more holding and molding power to keep stray hair from stickout out 90 degrees from your face - it</li>
            <li>I was hopping it would help manage the &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; and the itch, but this stuff was so much more.</li>
            <li>Then a beardless coworker mentioned that he&#x27;d love to have a beard like mine, one that doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li>(The great beard results lasted much longer than some &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li>(I get a lot more kisses now).</li>
            <li>He still uses it on the weekends and will use it more often in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Makes my beard smooth!</li>
            <li>many years, I&#x27;ve had a soul patch that was my identifying feature.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten fill use of the product yet, but I have read many reviews before I bought this.</li>

            <li>The love the smell of this product and have gotten a number of compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i will continue  to use this more and more thankyou</li>
            <li>I have also found if I use it more than one day in a row, I will get acne on my face.</li>
            <li>My beard feels better on my face.</li>
            <li>Makes beard feel softer and more manageable, and gives a bit of a shine.</li>
            <li>Not only the best beard product I&#x27;ve tried, but the best male care product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my face and beard very moisturized and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>Riveting.</li>
            <li>One of the better beard care products I have used and my girlfriend digs the smell so that&#x27;s always a plus</li>
            <li>On my second tin, Works great!</li>
            <li>It has a smell to it, but I have found that most people love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Makes your bear look better, period.</li>

            <li>so cute</li>
            <li>My son says it&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t make his beard as manageable as he would like.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is phenomenal.</li>

            <li>The aspects I find most appealing about this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realized that I had to take care of my Garibaldi beard to keep it healthy</li>
            <li>After trying more products this maybe the product for me</li>
            <li>til I try more</li>

            <li>So, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.)</li>
            <li>I bought this product at the urging of my vegan co-worker and I am pleased to say that I am glad that I caved in to the nudging.</li>
            <li>but it does make the beard more manageable).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased as going in</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments about my beard</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Love this beard balm.</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I have tried many beard products offered on Amazon and in my home town.  </li>
            <li>It made it more manageable and it feels healthier/softer.  </li>
            <li>Balm does help get a better beard</li>
            <li>Someone recommended that i try a beard oil, but i saw the reviews for this product and it sounded better for my needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, i&#x60;d say Give it a try, youll love it.</li>
            <li>My beard has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>The skin on my hands looks better.</li>
            <li>Interesting texture, wax that you melt in your hands</li>
            <li>Okay, stop looking.  </li>
            <li>Stray hairs are more controlled.</li>
            <li>I, however,  was more concerned about how a beard product would smell.</li>
            <li>It is a great product it does make your beard be nice and soft and shiny , but....</li>
            <li>But, like anything you care about, you should invest in it and get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and leaves your beard feeling great.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beard balm.</li>
            <li>This is more of a conditioner rather than a balm/wax to hold your beard in place.</li>
            <li>If your ok with having a &#x27;vaseline&#x27; type texture on your face, then no problem.</li>
            <li>but it does keep your beard healthy-</li>
            <li>Okay okay.</li>
            <li>An interesting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>it forms the beads, it is more of a bother to melt in your hand and apply and seems to penetrate less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway since I don&#x27;t have a beard, I can&#x27;t tell you more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I love this product.</li>
            <li>The thing I love most about it is it does help manage your beard.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works best if used daily.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try out a beard comb and a beard oil, because of the reviews this brand came to the top of my list.</li>
            <li>but I prefer more of a Pine smell.</li>
            <li>, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This balm has helped take away most of the &amp;#34;been living under a bridge in my shopping cart&amp;#34; smell ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels, smells, and makes my beard look.</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>And stray hairs even became more stray.</li>
            <li>I use it on my beard more than once a day.</li>
            <li>he says, &amp;#34;leaves my beard more shiny and manageable...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy for sure</li>
            <li>My beard is a bit curly and this seems to hold it all day in a more relaxed way.</li>
            <li>The scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>(I think she would like it more if I did not force her to smell it when I get out of the shower.)</li>
            <li>ordering more</li>
            <li>It is Awesome, and I have actually talked friends of mine into purchasing some, and every one of them agree.  </li>
            <li>The rest was great, delivered fast and fulfilled its promise.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li>Gross, I know, but bear with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Honest Amish beard balm for almost a month now and the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but there are two things to know;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and its just getting better.</li>
            <li>The balm is magic.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>the more I used the better it got.</li>
            <li>My wife and kids love the smell.</li>
            <li>It also helps me mold my beard into more of a V-shape rather then</li>
            <li>The customer service as well as the product itself is outstanding, and my beard has never felt softer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to read the instructions, as you may need to remelt the conditioner if the oils have separated.</li>
            <li>This stuff is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>so I need something more than what this has to offer.</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>and if you wear cologne it will cause a mixture of overwhelming sense of smell.</li>
            <li>softens my beard and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>OK I suppose, it can be a bit of a nuisance to apply it evenly.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments.</li>
            <li>And as for the scent, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my husbands beard look.</li>
            <li>Overall a great gift!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easier to shape, and feels better on my face.</li>
            <li>This has made my beard more manageable and given it some softness.</li>
            <li>I should have bought the unscented though, as the clovey-ness of the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Some people would love it though.</li>
            <li>I love the smell; it smells like peppermint pine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with the scent, however the wife is not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It applies great on my beard and leaves a nice shine and keeps my beard moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>After it cooled is when I was able to notice the shine it give my beard and how it shapes it.</li>
            <li>I love the product but please lower the price a tad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that reason alone, I sometimes prefer to use it at night, because it does soften the bristles for sure.  </li>
            <li>My daughters now love to fall asleep</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Interesting product, I like it.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that annoys me the most is no matter what I tried</li>
            <li>I find that I use a bit more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, works really well into my beard.</li>
            <li>I thought I would not like the scent on me, but after an hour or so, you get used to it, and it starts to smell more like root beer.</li>
            <li>However, my beard is scarcely more disciplined than before.</li>
            <li>I just found something better.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard fuller and takes the itch out for most the day.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, but no itching or flaking.</li>
            <li>ADORE the Grandson, not so sure about the beard.....</li>
            <li>It truly made my beard look and grow better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not for sure if I&#x27;m using it the way most do.</li>
            <li>My husband love this.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great procuct and will be buying lots more.</li>
            <li>Friend says it works great to calm stray hair and keep beard smooth.</li>
            <li>fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend&#x27;s beard smells and looks WAY better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I like the beard balm more than the wax.  </li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;ll ever bother trying another brand if these guys keep producing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my decision.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s refreshing when I smell it on him.</li>
            <li>Great stuff really softens your beard and helps control the curls 😃</li>
            <li>i got some to give as gifts to our friends, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting composition too.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff: it&#x27;s got a nice smell (though my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t love it), and it makes your beard smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and the way it smells.</li>
            <li>The product does make my beard softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>She seems to love it.</li>
            <li>More women seem to be joining that group.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just a fantastic beard product!</li>
            <li>This product helped for the better.</li>
            <li>Most mornings I wake up and it feels like my face is covered with straw.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, going to buy a tin for my brother.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this Product..</li>
            <li>This makes my beard feel smooth all day!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but . . .</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s more healthy then ever.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>They make my beard softer and more manageable and it has a healthy sheen, almost a glisten.  </li>
            <li>, my beard looks better than it ever has: fuller, thicker, softer and way easier to manage.</li>
            <li>If you wear cologne made by wealthy Frenchists or you get your hair cut once a week and shop for underwear in catalogs, then you probably won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone will be able to tell you whether you will like it or not.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my beard is coming along in leaps and bounds in a controlled fashion.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, my beard has grown better, felt better, and looked better.</li>
            <li>I thought it was OK.  </li>
            <li>Been using for a week now and am pleased.</li>
            <li>Some love it</li>
            <li>I wish I could use it more.</li>
            <li>I will for sure order more.</li>
            <li>, appearance has not been the top of the priority list when beards frequented my life, wash, comb, go.........</li>
            <li>I will order more soon</li>
            <li>Love the feel and</li>
            <li>as can I.....softer :-)</li>
            <li>The smell is not something I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>It just feels softer and cleaner and it&#x27;s more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Love the look and feel of my beard more than before.  </li>
            <li>Well, after using this for the better part of 2 months, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>It smells manly, not like cologne but more of a woodsy, plant type smell.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE and</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, kind of seasonal like fresh cloves and honey.</li>
            <li>After using many beard oils, I was worried about trying another one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well and can soften your beard</li>
            <li>Husband loves that it seems to make his beard softer and more conditioned.</li>
            <li>It does seem to immediately make the beard more manageable.  </li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t found a beard balm he enjoys more.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon, ever.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok but tends to linger all day...</li>
            <li>A leave in hair conditioner works much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and have been thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It got even better after a week of use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this balm.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my beard soft, smelling good and does a fair job of keeping under control.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really does keep your beard conditioned when you decide to grow it out.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff-</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never been as satisfied with a product before.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>My husbands all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging too.</li>
            <li>Even if I have to order more I won&#x27;t be upset in the slightest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t feel brittle anymore but closer to &#x27;top of the head&#x27; type hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a beard balm but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>what more could I want?</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, just dont use too much or it will make your beard too shiny and somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li>My son love this on his beard</li>
            <li>This stuff is really satisfying.</li>
            <li>but I like this a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and really softens my beard.</li>
            <li>Smells great but very greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it has undertones of clove with is almost therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Could ask for any more</li>
            <li>Its an okay product.</li>
            <li>enjoying it for now but might try something else (a gel or liquid maybe?)</li>
            <li>Love this Bard Balm ...</li>
            <li>This product seems to be more for styling, rather than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Compared to the &amp;#34;beard oil&amp;#34; that I purchased at the same time, I like this stuff the best.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 months now (still on can number 1), and I love it.</li>
            <li>After one application his beard was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>also, I love the packaging and tin that it comes in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Okay product to soften your beard, but it is not everything it&#x27;s advertised to be.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better beard product.</li>
            <li>Love what it does to the beard.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, but a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li>The products themselves smell incredible and my fiance (who has extremely dry skin) is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Smells good and shipped to us right on time.</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling , very greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fond of the scent and it hasn&#x27;t really softened my husband&#x27;s beard but the shine is very nice</li>
            <li>As of today, I&#x27;m 14 days without shaving my face and have a nice beard that feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>As of today, I&#x27;m 14 days without shaving my face and have a nice beard that feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light aroma that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>This product works well, but as I said about the beard wax (Honest Amish Original Beard Wax) - - the texture leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard soft in a hurry, which is good for the lady folk!</li>
            <li>I bought this as well as the Honest Amish Original Beard Wax as I could not decide which to buy.</li>
            <li>First time really growing my beard out and wasn&#x27;t sure how to best &#x27;keep&#x27; it.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely impressed with how soft and full it has made my beard.</li>
            <li>a suitable replacement for my families home made balm that my grand parents made (Trust me that is a huge complement from</li>
            <li>Pretty good product just wish you would get more than what was delivered.</li>
            <li>not only keeps it fairly tamed, it also smells great and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe the scent as light and earthy/woodsy; I don&#x27;t find it to be very strong at all.  </li>
            <li>Light, yet woodsy but definitely not a strong odor at all, pleasant would be the best way to describe it.</li>
            <li>I am super glad I did!</li>
            <li>His beard is so much softer and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing balm that makes your beard soft, comfortable and smells great.</li>
            <li>Great smell, and leaves a beard much more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li>My beard is soft, looks well groomed, has a nice light shine and smells great.</li>
            <li>My wife loves to play with it when I have the conditioner in, and that is a good thing ;-)</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Product was good, did the job, customer service is really fast!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good .</li>
            <li>The packaging was sweet, came with instructions and advice, nice bag and the sorts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty well and provides good conditioning to your skin that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to let my beard grow out without it becoming unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Its got a pretty good smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I like Amish Beard Balm pretty good</li>
            <li>But, that it really a minor drawback to this awesome, funky product.</li>
            <li>The smell is good and it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>It has made his beard grow nice and full.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>The stuff works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Scent aside, this is a pretty good product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel better about my appearance, and since it is right on my face, I feel better about myself!</li>
            <li>Very nice conditioner, leaves my beard feeling very soft, but not oily as many beard balms tend to do.</li>
            <li>Great product love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, nice packaging.  </li>
            <li>Plus it was easy to use and didn&#x27;t have any offensive scent or texture to it, just moisturizing love for my beard.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is a bit strong and not my favorite (not offensive tho).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it more strongly or fervently.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and came with nice packaging .</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it, but found it to be a bit strong at times.  </li>
            <li>My bearded men love it and the consistency of the product is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Nice mild aroma that dissipates in an hour.</li>
            <li>Directions say beard should be damp, but I have the best results when applying to my beard dry.</li>
            <li>OK, I guess has a rather strong medial order ...can&#x27;t use on my mustache....</li>
            <li>I ended up shaving that beard and starting over because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the shape, and this time I used Honest Amish Beard Balm from day 1.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, more importantly my wife does too.</li>
            <li>and I actually ripped my shirt, which previously fit perfectly, while flexing during the move.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish make nothing short of great products.</li>
            <li>More importantly, the ladies love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell as much as all the guys do, but it does smell good.</li>
            <li>so I dont really have a good opinion, its ok.</li>
            <li>Kind of light but smooth for the beard.</li>
            <li>He has also been able to grow his beard much longer with this balm since it keeps a good level of moisture in the hair and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li>In fact he loved it so much we just purchased 2 more tins of this balm and 2 containers of the beard oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is also not unpleasant (though, not overly pleasant) and goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had heard good things about beard balms in general and wanted to try one, adn this was listed as one of the most popular varieties on Amazon with a lot of reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps beard soft and shinny !</li>
            <li>it smells great and is soft!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly to wrangle in those loose strands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with Honest Amish so far (AFTER JUST ONE USE!)</li>
            <li>My grave before shave beard oil smells great, they also bring back the original color of my hair better than honest amish does.</li>
            <li>I had read several very good reviews about this product.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and does a good job of taming wild hairs.</li>
            <li>1st time i used it, i didnt think it was anything special, but since then i actually think its one of the best products out there&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is great for the early stages of beard growth as it reduces itching</li>
            <li>Now I have about 2 inches of beard, and I can&#x27;t wait to put this stuff on to make it more comfortable.  </li>

            <li>Smells great and feels soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, keeps my beard soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes his beard soft and the fact that it is a balm and not an oil that will spill is great.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft to the touch and provides a great shine to my beard.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, but my husband doesn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of cloves.</li>
            <li>I only want authentic ingredients to mix in with my beautiful bearded hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally tried BlueBeards Original Beard Saver and that stuff made my beard flake which I never had before, so i ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm..</li>
            <li>It smells so natural, and feel great.</li>
            <li>was traveling for the most important date of my life; the day I would marry my sweetheart of 4 years.</li>

            <li>Great product with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but so far my beard is happy.</li>

            <li>Smells great and is all natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this balm and a boar hair bristle brush and now it is really soft and smells great too.  </li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; leaves my beard soft &amp; manageable all day.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it more after it has been in for about an hour and the smell mellows out a bit.</li>
            <li>So far this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>This balm almost completely eliminates the itch and greatly softens the beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great natural product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and keeps everything soft and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>And it feels soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and the scent is awesome!</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY, The SCENT.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard smelling great and feeling fantasticly soft..</li>
            <li>I enjoy it even more than beard oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works wells and is great toknow its natural, my beard seems to like it</li>
            <li>The balm will keep your beard and more importantly, the skin underneath well hydrated.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I enjoy the scent of the product and that it does a good job conditioning my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, my beard feels soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I assumed this was a balm, a smooth, maybe creamy concoction of oils that would make his beard illustrious and much more supple.  </li>
            <li>After all my beard hairs were becoming rebellious and had to use the balm.</li>
            <li>It leaves your beard very shiny and smells good.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I don&#x27;t mind the oily consistency which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price but definitely not the best for it&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>good over all product, works really well</li>
            <li>Arrived fast with good packing.</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell that I would describe as pleasant and leaning toward a cocoa butter flavor.</li>
            <li>I looked around on amazon a bit and this one really stood out to me and seemed to have a good reputation.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit too much like wax, but good stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice product with a clean clean scent.</li>
            <li>Something like cedar, rosemary, and citrus would be more pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>I am unsure after using it for 2 weeks that it is worth the price paid, but it smells nice, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Conditions very well, smells good and applies easy.  </li>
            <li>I have found a new lease on life through the use of this of this this remarkable product.</li>
            <li>My new beard balm beat the bothersome itch and allowed me to successfully grow my whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it melts right in your hand and blends nicely into the beard...</li>
            <li>but this scent is unique and pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Originally got this as a gift for my son and he loved it so much (&amp; his wife!)</li>
            <li>After a couple of days i&#x27;m liking how I&#x27;m able to brush my beard and it compliments that fresh side-part lumberjack looking haircut!</li>
            <li>Packaging is perfect for a high-quality, cute little gift.</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed this beard balm two days after I started using it and thought it was okay.  </li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the smell of Cocoa Butter, then you will instantly be able to pick it up.</li>
            <li>I have tried other beard leave-in conditioners and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>Cool stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>Other than that mishap, This product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product as any of the other reviews will tell you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It still works great and smells good, but the products consistency is a little off putting to me.</li>
            <li>He was also impressed with the packaging, from the little bag it came in to an appropriate size box for the product.</li>
            <li>Was super excited when I got my package from honest Amish till I opened it to find a dog harness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel to oily.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Orders from this place process very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can get a brush through it quite easily.</li>

            <li>With a container that bends easily</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is very mild and reminds me of Juicy Fruit chewing gum.</li>
            <li>and it looks clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use container</li>

            <li>Smell is very mild and container is deeper than how it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be a bit strong, many have said this oil is also good for the skin and sooths irritation, and while I didn’t have any problems it did burn a bit if it got anywhere near my eyes.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>I also did not care for the strong licorice notes it has.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong.</li>
            <li>It smells of Anise, and some people think is too strong a smell.</li>
            <li>On the product page there were nine answers to the question of whether or not this had a strong odor or not.</li>
            <li>The smell remained strong all day.</li>
            <li>The smell was strong under my nose all day</li>
            <li>I think the company should mention a bit about the strong scent.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, not to strong, have gotten no complaints from the ladies.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it might be too strong</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong and after reading reviews I was worried about it.</li>
            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
            <li>The scent was not to strong and it didn&#x27;t stick around all day.</li>
            <li>Is it a strong scent?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone who uses a stronger soap for face cleaning as a strong soap</li>
            <li>It looks and feels healthy thanks to Honest Amish Beard.</li>
            <li>The strong note is anise--black licorice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t deal with strong smell, so I&#x27;ve had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>The scented version is way too strong for me and my wife.</li>

            <li>I know there are some sissy&#x27;s saying the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended, even for beard newbies like myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going 3 months strong and there is not one flake</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so strong that I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>Scent is that of licorice, not overly strong though.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong at all...</li>
            <li>This dryness happens after the strong urge to itch ~ which I also can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold but will straighten out rogue hairs</li>
            <li>My wife thinks it&#x27;s too strong, smells like herbs rosemary</li>
            <li>It turns out I am allergic to this beard balm because the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>The odor is too strong for an office environment.</li>
            <li>I will tell you up front that some people think there is a strong smell to this.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and seemed to work right away; after the first use his beard was softer!</li>
            <li>The smell is very soft and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my beard very soft and shiney after application, and the smell is pleasant and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Really good product, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband wanted something special for the beard hair to make it more manageable over the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li>My beard feels and looks better most all day after applying this in the morning right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a fairly strong scent the first time I applied the balm, but I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice scent, a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>The product has made my beard so lush and strong  that it successfully helped defend my face from a grizzly bear attack, I don&#x27;t have a scratch</li>
            <li>When first applying it, it smells kind of strong.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, my beard is growing fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I bought this, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Great product, my husband loves how it makes beard feel and personally we both love the light scent.</li>
            <li>Made my beard feel amazing from the first time I used it .,,.</li>
            <li>First product of its kind that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have been using Honest Amish consistently for over a year now</li>
            <li>This doesn’t provide hold, but I loved the product so much that I purchased their original beard wax as well.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal!</li>
            <li>The day I received my delivery it was a pretty warm day so the product had separated.  </li>
            <li>I liked it on the first application.</li>
            <li>But with this beard balm, it&#x27;s nearly as soft as the hair on my head, which is just remarkable.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s going to be cool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of Jager smell (you know the liquor), sweet an lemony with a hint of spice.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li>your growing a full beard, do yourself a favor and try this product--you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>Smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>First time using any kind of products on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Its strong for a couple of minutes after you put it on but fine after that.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have a coarse hair to begin with, but this product makes it look almost like a beautiful lion&#x27;s mane, and feel like domesticated cat fur (except that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it doesn&#x27;t get EVERYWHERE, like cat hair does).  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell but not a bad smell..</li>
            <li>Smell is interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li>Keeps beard nice and healthy highly recommended</li>
            <li>To be fair, there are other great beard balms, oils, etc, worth checking out, but this one is a home run.</li>
            <li>WOULD BUY AGAIN IF THE NEW PRODUCT IM GOING TO TRY ISNT AS GOOD.</li>
            <li>I am new to this type of beard care, but this seems like a really good product.</li>
            <li>Upon applying the product I have noticed very pleasant scent; it is a natural not overpowering and very refined.</li>
            <li>Amazing product after first use noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Both work fine.  </li>
            <li>pleasing aroma is half the point, and this balm has a delicious scent; my wife loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Excellent and the pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li>While this product moisturizes and smells fine, I haven&#x27;t noticed either of the effects I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Turns a mangy mutt of a beard into a fine gentleman&#x27;s pride in</li>
            <li>The smell is fine.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted no results, I could easily get that for free.</li>
            <li>Then I comb it in with a fine comb.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>Fine product but the scent is something that needs to be worked on.</li>
            <li>Smells just fine.</li>
            <li>Just began growing another beard bout one month ago, this conditioner smells great and really prevents the intense itching that has stopped me before!</li>
            <li>All in all the product is fine.</li>
            <li>The scent is fine...</li>
            <li>The scent is actually light, not as strong as some make out to be.  </li>
            <li>The company was able to quickly and efficiently correct a shipping order that I had made.</li>
            <li>It is easier to apply, smells good and hold my beard nicely all day long.</li>
            <li>very soft beard..smells good and earthy</li>
            <li>Which is good because I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>But it absolutely moisturizes and keeps the hair looking and feeling healthy!  </li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the Beard Balm!</li>
            <li>Works really well if you love a greasy beard!</li>
            <li>This product really does work to soften the beard and make it more manageable!</li>
            <li>It helps prevent itch from new growth and it helps keep my beard healthy and looking nice.</li>
            <li>This product simply works, it&#x27;s easy to use and,  smells great.  </li>
            <li>Keeps his beard super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>The product itself has a mild scent that is neither pleasant nor particularly objectionable.</li>
            <li>my beard grows in fairly coarse and this stuff helps make it 100x more comfortable and with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a large supply of this stuff, it makes my beard look amazing, gives it a bit of a sheen, and tames my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - my beard does feel softer and more manageable just after the first use!  </li>
            <li>He loves how easy it goes on and has been very happy with how it helps tame his beard and condition it.</li>
            <li>The anise/licorice smell is nice but not too strong, and it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It feels great, gives a nice glossy look and does hold a little.</li>
            <li>it is a bit greasy, and has a unique pleasant odor, but holds the wild hairs in check.</li>
            <li>My husband says he can tell a huge difference since using it.</li>
            <li>I think the combination of the two has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s making a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It sort of smells like bees wax, which is OK, but I would prefer a nice masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great and left my beard smooth, but after two uses, I realized I&#x27;m probably allergic to it.</li>
            <li>But anyone out there who has neglected their beard or just shampoos and conditions it will probably see huge improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in the feel of my beard.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell as well, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny and then more.</li>
            <li>Its grainy when you spoon it into your plam but melts to a smooth oil when you rub it up.</li>
            <li>All you have to do now is comb or smooth your beard.  </li>
            <li>It really feels nice.  </li>
            <li>but after it, smooth.</li>
            <li>The Honest Amish Beard Balm works very well.  </li>
            <li>I must say I really enjoy it</li>
            <li>I have used this on my beard for a few months now and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic; can&#x27;t imagine NOT using it</li>
            <li>Made my beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I strangely enjoy the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li>Works great to soften and relax my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I read those reviews AFTER I ordered the product</li>
            <li>All of this was important to me.  </li>
            <li>I can now fully enjoy my beard in all its heavenly fullness.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have used various mustache and beard care products, Honest Amish is simply the best.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong, I think its a clean smell but nothing I can even notice after a hour or so.</li>
            <li>Now I enjoy the looks of my beard.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, and silky</li>

            <li>/&gt;1.) Light, pleasing scent&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin under my beard free from drying out after a shower.</li>
            <li>Thanks Honest Abe</li>
            <li>It is a great product that I would recommend to all of my male friends.</li>
            <li>One issue is the Honest Amish is a butter, so you have to guess how much to use and rub it till it liquifies.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought me this stuff for Christmas and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I think its fantastic...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important when it&#x27;s sitting under my nose all day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff allows me to relax because I know its smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I would buy again if available in an &amp;#34;economy&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>Leaves ur beard feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>I love looking at the tin and label sitting on my bathroom counter, it makes me smile.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my beard looking civilized</li>
            <li>Thanks Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>One thing I have noticed is it has added a great dear of lustrous shine to my red beard!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>above all the product works great, the hairs of my beard became softer.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li>The wax is great, the initial scent is almost that of medicine cabinet, but wears off.</li>
            <li>I would have rather seen a smooth balm.</li>
            <li>So here I am now day 3 of using honest Amish, I gotta say it has really tamed my beard</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic..</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard silky smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, the important stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, warm packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that does what it promises.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the feel of my beard after using Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>but of course fragrance is subjective as others may enjoy it</li>
            <li>Great Balm especially used in conjunction with Beard Oil and a beard brush.</li>
            <li>It has a nice shine and really brings out the color while smoothing it.</li>
            <li>this was scent free.  </li>
            <li>It does leave an after smell - which I enjoy, but my wife doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a perk to having your beard &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; except maybe to draw people&#x27;s gaze to the amazing piece of art on your face known as a beard.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple beard conditioners and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>(so the ladies say), and I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>I like it and my lady friends enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard glisten and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The oil has a light smell to it that i actually enjoy, and I think my lady friend did as well.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, but it really doesn&#x27;t condition my beard.</li>
            <li>My wife cannot smell any distinct scent, even when her nose is touching my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for twenty one days and my beard is great to the point where people are starting to think they havent seen me for months.</li>
            <li>I rather enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve grown to like it), and really enjoy using it when I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, use it daily to soften and moisturize my beard.  </li>
            <li>luck will turn around with this product and you may be just as fortunate as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was recommended Honest Amish by a friend of mine and after much debating</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I use it daily no matter the situation.</li>
            <li>Fantastic smell, non-greasy, and leaves your beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and enjoy the soothing comfort both my beard and face feel.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I notice a big difference in the smoothness and softness in my beard when I use this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing really helps with the beard itch and for those complaining about the smell you must have a problem with smelling like a man</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things just buy it</li>
            <li>My beard is wonderfully smooth, and the beard dander is but a memory.</li>
            <li>I stared using coconut oil and it works just as well and is cheap.  </li>
            <li>It has softened my really coarse beard, has a really great scent, and my wife loves it too.</li>
            <li>Never used a salve like this, liquifies as described, relieves itch, keeps skin and hair smooth.</li>
            <li>If you could capture the fragrance of heart crushing defeat and mix it with soul</li>
            <li>Thanks Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Gives my beard a nice shine and makes it feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Thanks honest Amish guy</li>
            <li>I actually use this for my hair instead and it seems to moisturize great.</li>
            <li>Light scent.</li>
            <li>The customer service is absolutely fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that actually works!</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I like Honest Amish so much that my urge to try another balm or oil has been subdued.</li>
            <li>Keeps it smooth and in-shape.  </li>
            <li>Provided a nice shine to the beard, but did not provide much control.</li>
            <li>Reduces itch better than moisturizer, though I rarely am bothered by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly I enjoy that my bathroom now smells like it all the time.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction from start to finish and reply to any concerns.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s generally extremely light unless you apply a lot of the balm.</li>
            <li>It does give some extremely light hold, but on &amp;#34;bad beard days&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not up to the task of taming stray hairs.</li>
            <li>and I totally feel I made a great purchase with this.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard feel great and not so coarse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the application, it rinses easily and clean from the hands.  </li>
            <li>Rustic yet precise.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they make the bestimate beard products available.</li>
            <li>and now I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all at Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more intense hold you&#x27;ll need something with more wax.</li>
            <li>Beard is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>It makes my hubby&#x27;s beard soft and smell really good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it two stars because of the smell, but I can see many others like the smell, and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to give it too low of a rating because of my aromatic preferences.  </li>
            <li>Works well, smells good, makes my beard feel soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard nice and soft and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>It leaves his beard soft and smooth, easier to control, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this gift and I love that he actually uses it.</li>
            <li>makes the beard shiny and soft and has a good scent.</li>
            <li>It makes your beard soft and also has a nice sheen to it, I love the way it feels after being applied.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of brands so far and Honest Amish is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t take much for each use, perfect example of &amp;#34;a lil&#x27; dab will do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The conditioner definitely does its job by allowing me to better control my beard although I think I need a bit longer whiskers for optimum manageability.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the can as sort of soft sandy texture, and you get it good and melty in your palms, and then rub in.</li>
            <li>This, combined with a nice oil leaves my beard shiny, soft, and all extremely sexy.</li>
            <li>Smells good, a bit chunky, but dries clear ...</li>
            <li>This product keeps my beard soft and looking good.</li>
            <li>makes my beard soft and smells good.  </li>
            <li>1st can arrived this week and so far so good.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Honest Amish to anyone with a full beard!</li>
            <li>At first I thought the smell was kind of funky, but it quickly became something I stopped noticing.  </li>
            <li>and and I find that the [nice] smell fades away pretty quickly after application.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>When you need to condition the beard, make sure you have the right gear.</li>
            <li>it was to tame a wiry beard, and it works great there!</li>
            <li>awesome product..helps tame an unruly beard (or hair)</li>
            <li>The container will go relatively quickly if applied daily, but it smells great and is easy to apply, unlike the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use it after every shower and my beard is very soft and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>the included instructions (in case it happened) were very useful.</li>
            <li>BTW, the smell is fantastic in my opinion, however it dissipates fairly quickly, so don&#x27;t worry about it being overbearing or too strong.</li>
            <li>With bi-daily use (alternating with mountaineer oil), I find that my beard is becoming more and more soft as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>Awsome really makes your beard soft, left it on over night and results where cool, will be ordering more, great customer service and really nice people!</li>
            <li>Scent is very mild and goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not overly strong and fades relatively quickly (maybe 2 hours)</li>
            <li>This is a good product but in my opinion would be better if less expense was applied to the packaging and more to the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product rubs in quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Looking for a quick easy way to condition your beard?</li>
            <li>The scent it has is very pleasing and very easy to rub in to my beard.  </li>
            <li>The scent didn&#x27;t really bother me, but, honestly, its fairly strong, and you&#x27;re putting it right on your face, so it smells stronger to you than it does to anyone else.</li>
            <li>Helps with the itch, and it keeps my beard looking fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>the Smell can be a bit strong, although not particularly unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps the curly part of the beard in check - nice and soft and no beardruff!!</li>
            <li>Honest Amish conditions my beard nicely and gives me a little more control over what it does.</li>
            <li>after a good washing and conditioning in the shower, I rub a little Honest Amish around on the palm of my hand and smooth it through my beard and</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to grow a strong manly and healthy beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on the nose, doesn&#x27;t linger for hours, and is actually quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only makes my beard very soft, but it smells great too!</li>
            <li>This was the first product I have ever bought for my beard and love it.</li>
            <li>Originally I had a beard and a friend</li>
            <li>so I thought I would give the original a try.</li>
            <li>I feel satisfied with what I got for the higher price</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Originally I was concerned about the smell that others were leaving that it smelled like licorice or anise</li>
            <li>works great for long beards</li>
            <li>it starts to smell pretty ok.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Since my first tin I was promoted at work, my wife got hotter, car got faster, the kids are better behaved, I got six-pack abs overnight</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far with this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in the burlap bag, adds a touch of rugged manliness to it. ;)</li>
            <li>After visiting the gym, which I should mention was my first time, we concluded that my muscles had gained about 20% more strength.</li>
            <li>Scent is OK - not over powering, and fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have worn a beard for most of my life, in fact my wife and I were married but five years before she ever saw my face without it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when the first canister runs out.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>My husband was both suprised and excited on fathers day.</li>
            <li>and my wife actually comments on how nice it smells!</li>
            <li>It does not have any significant hold, so don&#x27;t count on it</li>
            <li>Even better would be not buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>of these products are fantastic, I just wonder what the true diffrence is between both the Beard Balm and the Beard Oil.</li>
            <li>Smell is unique.</li>
            <li>My first beard balm and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure at first, give this product some time to work its nourishing magic.</li>
            <li>Has a unique aroma.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference since he started using this balm.</li>
            <li>He was so excited he had to share it with all of his guy friends.</li>
            <li>and I started a friendly competition</li>
            <li>For the balm, the &amp;#34;wet sand&amp;#34; meets tapioca pudding consistency was interesting if not weird.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li>It is &amp;#34;congealed&amp;#34; in the tin at normal room temps, so you need to warm it up in your hands before applying.</li>
            <li>Would be 5 stars if it smelled better, but smell fades after the first 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to get this balm all buttered up in my brown strands.</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use or apply (my first substantial beard).</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not sensitive to the medicinal odor, it&#x27;s probably great stuff.</li>
            <li>It had a unique smell</li>
            <li>The licorice smell was not my favorite at first, but it really is mild and light and fades as the hours pass.</li>
            <li>Their scents are great, the oil is light and easy to apply, and the mustache wax is light and soft and comes in an applicator similar to chapstick that can run across the &#x60;stache and eyebrows easily.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a clean dirty-hippie.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard soft and shiny, and the scent is okay, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also had one lady compliment my beard and tell me how clean it looked literally</li>
            <li>It also works great on dry skin on any part of your body.</li>
            <li>This product feels great and could probably be used for dry areas of skin for the rest of your body.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the product and just ordered more.</li>
            <li>The product does have a light anise scent but it quickly dissipates once the product is rubbed in to your beard.</li>
            <li>Genuine surprise greeted my psyche after I began using a beard conditioner (this is the only brand of beard conditioner I have ever used, so take my review with a grain of salt, for there could be something equally good on the market -</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this review isn&#x27;t about how awesome my beard is, the focus is on Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with the Leven Rose Beard Oil and my beard is soft and scratch free.</li>
            <li>In the future, I think I&#x27;ll get him one of the Honest Amish products better suited for control.</li>
            <li>This helps fill it out and make it more manageable while bring out more of the natural coloring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great and also helps with my dry skin that tends to come out of growing beard that can lead to &amp;#34;beardruff.&amp;#34; This stuff takes care of all that</li>
            <li>Makes my beard look more alive and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean, and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Will totally buy more products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Simple, natural, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it, so I need to towel off my cheeks after applying.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves it because it keeps my beard looking clean.  </li>
            <li>you have a dry beard with plenty of stray hairs, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, leaves my beard shiny and manageable, definitely a man&#x27;s man product.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish is a great company and Beard Balm will put the moisture and health into your beard that it always loses.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, pleasant initial smell that dissipates, controls beard and softens it as well.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell blends in well, easy to apply beard not as dry and helps with the&lt;</li>
            <li>thing to note is that the smell, while pleasant, definitely lingers for a bit.</li>
            <li>The smell is somewhere between inoffensive and pleasant -- definitely nothing that detracts from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has a nice scent and is very easy to apply but as far as conditioning and didnt see much difference with my beard</li>
            <li>It is a decent beard balm, the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>The directions that come on the bag very clearly advise that you warm the product up in the palm of your hand until it melts, and then work it in to your beard with your fingers and a comb.</li>
            <li>:) Everyone is happy with the results, and less complaints of scraggly beard now!</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how a beard balm can make such an amazing difference so quickly, but the results are right on my face for everyone to see.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was happy with it and wore it daily to keep his beard feeling nice, so apparently it worked.</li>
            <li>If you want it soft and to stay healthy you will order this product!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t amazed, or wowed, I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes right away honestly.</li>
            <li>Very good product for taming a unruly beard like mine, leaves beard a little too shiny for my taste.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly strong right after I put it on, but after an hour or so it wares off.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, easy to apply, fragrance is natural and not heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant exactly, but it smells like anise, which is somewhat like licorice - not my favorite smell but tolerable.</li>
            <li>Not the special day that my wife had hoped and dream</li>
            <li>People with large beards need more product.</li>
            <li>Use as directed and you&#x27;re certain to be satisfied.</li>
            <li>It does add shine to my beard specially in sunlight which others may not want.</li>
            <li>Certainly beats stinkbeard :)</li>
            <li>Apply to a damp beard, by rubbing it in gently and then comb for a more styled, clean look.  </li>
            <li>The balm easily turns into oil after rubbing it gently between your fingers, and it works into your beard just as easily as a liquid oil based product.</li>
            <li>working pretty good so far.....</li>
            <li>smells amazing, keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be surprised if my beard becomes much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen videos on YouTube and read great reviews about it, but for the short time being, I must say I&#x27;m really liking it alot!</li>
            <li>After one full week people have complimented me on my beard</li>
            <li>:) And I don&#x27;t much believe in ordering things for it.</li>
            <li>All around does a good beard proper.</li>
            <li>It makes your beard more manageable and much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ok its not a mirmiracle worker, but did work really well for me.</li>
            <li>your beard/mustache is exceptionally coarse or damaged, you may need to give it a good trim to remove the hair that is beyond repair by a product like this.</li>
            <li>But my five minutes of research concluded that this was one of the best-reviewed beard balms on Amazon so it had to be good enough for me.    </li>
            <li>Many thanks to you my bearded brothers.</li>
            <li>A bit gritty but looks good on my beard.</li>
            <li>and it makes his beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, my only complain is the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the smell, there is a really nice scent that lasts for an hour or two</li>
            <li>Being the Beatnik, hippie type of dude, I liked the fact it was an all natural conditioner with organic oils and fruit and nut butters.  </li>
            <li>Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell here, but everyone that has been around me while the smell is still noticeable have commented that it&#x27;s a nice earthy, natural smell</li>
            <li>Good product overall, it does what is says is does in conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li>He has since had a trim and looks a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>Its cool to have a product for your beard</li>
            <li>It was so much softer and much more tamed with those unruly stray hairs.</li>
            <li>I use the excess oil in my hair, and it gives it a nice natural shine/keeps the friz away.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard look full.</li>
            <li>The smell is manly, without being overpowering, and it leaves your beard with a nice sheen and a soft feel.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard nice and soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I scrape out about a pea sized amount with my nail, so a can will last a good while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s made out of quality natural ingredients and</li>
            <li>He says it smooths and tames it which is cool...</li>
            <li>This, along with some good conditioner, helps put things back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Well, the answer is a direct result of using Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-</li>
            <li>It just simply feels good on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This makes my beard soft and has a nice manly scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only good on the beard but got rid of my bearddruff.</li>
            <li>Husband loves it and it makes his beard nice and soft...</li>
            <li>I have always had a full beard and mustache but it has not always been my friend.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s definitely a beard man, and was looking for something of good quality.</li>
            <li>Made his beard nice and soft</li>
            <li>Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li>beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Also it makes your skin and the hair itself nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, the product does work very well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The next day was good as well.</li>
            <li>That said, I have a fairly wiry and curly beard - not much short of shellac will probably straighten it out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a nice but masculine smell.</li>
            <li>This year, I started researching ways to help me maintain a pristine and full beard, while avoiding the itchiness, and came across this product as a result of reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched over to Beard Brand for beard oil and mustache wax and realized caring for your facial can be downright pleasurable for you and your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Not only does it shine but it feels good as well after getting out of the shower and drying your beard off and putting in the beard balm feels like heaven.</li>
            <li>I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really good, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t blow me away.  </li>
            <li>The true benefit comes over time.  </li>
            <li>8/10th of full beard.</li>
            <li>After purchasing honest Amish beard balm and a boar bristle brush, my beard is soft to the touch and has a uniform look.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a healthy looking beard.  </li>
            <li>Giving it a five because it’s awesome, nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li>If you are into having a sweet looking beard, this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cool burlap bag and a retro styled tin.</li>
            <li>Helps with the beardruff and makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>close friend of mine loved the smell, she encouraged I strictly use this only from now on.</li>
            <li>and I have re-ordered since growing a full beard.</li>
            <li>and so do I. Smells nice, makes beard soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard silky smooth and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>GET A BOAR BRISTLE BRUSH AND WORK A TINY BIT OF THIS GOOD SMELLUM INTO YOUR FACE BUSH.</li>
            <li>but the jar wasn&#x27;t completely full</li>
            <li>If your going to grow a beard, you&#x27;ll need a good beard oil to manage it properly.</li>
            <li>It really does make my beard much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li>Rub some between your palms for two seconds and it completely melts in to a nice uniform oil.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really cool...</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and at times it seems to have mind of</li>
            <li>But hey.... when you are sporting a sweet beard what is money?</li>
            <li>The good news is that I am going to make it REALLY simple for you to decide whether you will like it or not!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and keeps my beard much softer.</li>
            <li>Still, I give it full marks.</li>
            <li>I loved using it, it seems the one is enough for 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>When my boyfriend decided to let his beard go full Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li>Gives a nice natural shape.</li>
            <li>makes my beard nice and soft...</li>
            <li>It works really well, I&#x27;m just not so sure about it&#x27;s scent...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff and this grease.</li>
            <li>Bluebeards beard saver is a better all-around product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really worked for my beard and that&#x27;s probably more me than the product.</li>
            <li>Product is good for the beard, personally prefer the oil.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves it :).</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard looking fresh and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Man Beard Oil&amp;#34; which was good but definitely didn&#x27;t improve the health of my beard.  </li>
            <li>experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  </li>
            <li>One month in, not bad.</li>
            <li>BUT FOR THE PRICE OVER ALL ITS NOT BAD, WISH IT WAS CHEAPER.IM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER PRODUCT.I</li>
            <li>but it no not bad in any way</li>
            <li>But, it is not bad and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for in a beard oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but because its just below your nose you can always smell it.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>I loved my beard but felt it wasn&#x27;t achieving its true potential</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and it comes in a cute little burlap tie-bag.</li>
            <li>Best balm I used hands down, keeps beard conditioned all day long, I will continue to buy products from honest amish</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll never go back to leaving my beard untreated, the scent is a nice easy earthy treat</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to product scents but she loved this so much</li>
            <li>Since you apply it right beneath your nose, this is an important feature.</li>
            <li>nothing makes her purr like a face full of fur) and does a tremendous job of softening the hair and eliminating split-ends.  </li>
            <li>You can easily smell it within the first hour or so, fades after that.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to wash off your hands too compared to others.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and does not linger long.  </li>
            <li>is a real positive addition in the morning after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I suppose to the untrained nose with no other reference to go by, licorice could be the most accurate description, but I assure you, anise is not the primary smell.</li>
            <li>Sent this to my boyfriend as a little surprise gift and it shipped quick and he loved it!</li>
            <li>it was easy to apply and soaked into the hair pretty quickly, but it did leave the skin of my face oily for a couple hours after application.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care much for the price which leads me to look for cheaper alternatives or making my own in large batches.</li>
            <li>Other scents, or even an unscented option would be great.</li>
            <li>This on the other hand works great.</li>
            <li>Smells good and gives my beard a little more &amp;#34;pizaz&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a rather pleasant smell, which isn&#x27;t overbearing and doesn&#x27;t linger for very long in any case.</li>
            <li>He has a very long beard and this product does much to keep it healthy and looking good.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best stuff!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, keeps the hairs softer and more conformed to your desired shape, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any distinct dandruff from dry skin</li>
            <li>I love it, I feel ten times more Amish.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;grit&#x27; will fall off your fingers if you rub too quickly before it starts to melt.  </li>
            <li>He says it can make his face kind of greasy, so he uses only a light amount.</li>
            <li>I do like this product, but go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>A quick tousle</li>
            <li>Smells great, keeps the beard soft and makes it soft if it already isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The main thing that I love about it thought is that it does not make my face break out.  </li>
            <li>Stuff super legit.</li>
            <li>Super conditioning and goes on well.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will be back for more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Then again my beard is much more coarse than many people.  </li>
            <li>He says the smell is pleasantly mild.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and not too strong, his beard is noticeably softer and less wiry and bushy after two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Love it, smells decent, makes beard look</li>
            <li>The smell is not overbearing and fades quickly and won&#x27;t be noticeable after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I think that the scent will be the main point that will separate people who love this product and people who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband and his super curly beard.</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, I love this product and plan to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>We received it quickly and my husband loves the way his beard feels now that he&#x27;s been using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li>But the recipient&#x27;s beard has seemed particularly glorious lately, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this purchase.</li>
            <li>This softened the hairs quickly and was not over oily.</li>
            <li>and the smell is fairly mild.</li>
            <li>It smells not girly in the slightest and the scent fades rather quickly even if you don&#x27;t dig it.</li>
            <li>, I get lots of compliments, I love looking at it, and combing it, and washing it, I could actually go on all day about how much I love my beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeably more effective if you use it once you get out of the shower, while your beard is still wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish Beard Balm for over a year now, and it makes the difference between my growing a &amp;#34;homeless beard&amp;#34; or a fluffy beard that has a character all its own.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products, including most oils on the market.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this product I was losing because my beard more resembled that of a homeless person rather than sophisticated bourgeois.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terribly bad smell, I enjoy fishing, but it&#x27;s not a smell I want to follow me for the first hour or two of my day.    </li>
            <li>, many of my friends now want this product and i will deffinatly be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>Just a supposed conditioner, leave it in and just makes my hair look super oily and still doesnt make it softer.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was as advertised</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean, good smelling, not super strong.  </li>
            <li>I think its going by quick though.</li>
            <li>This is super stuff for a beard</li>
            <li>I bought this for more boyfriend, who is growing a giant beard but wanting something to soften it up and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>The smell on this stuff can get super bothersome when it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li>It helps me shape my beard properly as well as adds a nice sort of light sheen to mine.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, it smelled great and made my beard softer almost instantly</li>
            <li>I noticed a softening of his beard hairs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>And it does dissipate rather quickly.</li>
            <li>A mild, earthy smell.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected Thank You Kindly.</li>
            <li>So I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my facial hair using this.</li>
            <li>It would have been helpful to have more complete information about the variety of products  available</li>
            <li>Now it feels soft and so much more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It smells like mild licorice and herbs...</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the scent, but that two disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>A great, not-overbearing smell that only really lingers for a couple hours tops</li>
            <li>I read comments about the odor smelling like licorice, but it&#x27;s a mild smell</li>
            <li>As a final thought, though, I would like to note that the way it conditions my skin and the feel of my skin after a week is actually the best part of using the product.  </li>
            <li>After three days, the difference is tremendous.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda funky but the smell wears off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the highly rated oils on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent or product very much</li>
            <li>I use the palm of my hand to smooth it out and it works very very well.</li>
            <li>While the product did a great job keeping his beard healthy and neat, the smell was a little bit much for me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for options to tame my unruly face mane when I stumbled across Honest Amish&#x27;s amazing line of products.</li>
            <li>First, this product does a great job of conditioning a dry beard and skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try other Honest Amish products for sure.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to order some more of the other products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much !</li>
            <li>and this stuff tamed it in the very first application.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li>I have been using other products for years and this one is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>My beard has never been more full and soft after just one tin of this stuff!</li>
            <li>But after using this product for a short while I don&#x27;t feel any better and realize that a freshly washed and groomed beard is better than a pungent hippie beard.</li>
            <li>Its been around a year and while my husband really enjoyed his Honest Amish Beard Balm, he has moved on to other Balms.</li>
            <li>The product smells &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; but certainly not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I found a different product that was much smoother and more effective for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the full monty, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I carry a handkerchief, because I&#x27;m going to need it with this product all day long.</li>
            <li>Has great smell, and make mustache lay down well..</li>
            <li>It melts quickly and easily when you&#x27;re ready to use it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft all over and under my beard, my beard is soft, easy to maintain, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>but I will say its a high quality product worth trying out backed up by a reputable company.</li>
            <li>She really seemed to have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>I live in a town where organic rules, and I&#x27;ve smelled this smell many times.</li>
            <li>Great scent, makes my beard shine, conditions as advertised, comb glides through with less pulls ...</li>
            <li>Smells great, slight herbal/lemon scent.</li>
            <li>All great except it smells like black licorice.</li>
            <li>My beard is much softer and this is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product to use, especially in the winter as it leaves not only your beard nice soft and smooth, but your skin moist as well.</li>
            <li>Say good by to dry itchy skin under your beard.</li>
            <li>The first hour it seems greasy but after that is leaves a nice aroma and a soft beard.</li>
            <li>It helps control dry skin and smells good.</li>
            <li>She was really against me having a beard at first but now is enjoying it with me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cool idea, but the container is TINY for the price you pay and the balm is kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine arrived, some of the ingredients had separated, but the instructions tell you how to re-mix them (basically heat and shake, I chose to heat it under hot running water, but the instructions also suggest just leaving it on a windowsill, which would also work, it has a very low melting</li>
            <li>so should last a good while on my first canister purchased.  </li>
            <li>It does tame my beautiful beard.</li>
            <li>Really softens up coarse beard and give it s nice shine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really just echoing what pretty much most people have said.</li>
            <li>but my hands could use a good rubbing on dry skin or a wipe with a paper</li>
            <li>Although if feels a bit gritty at first, it quickly melts into a nice, smooth oil.  </li>
            <li>I can put my normal face lotion on and then this Beard Balm in my beard and it feels great, leaves it in control and a little shiny (a healthy look)</li>
            <li>This is the first beard balm/oil I have ever used so I cannot compare it to other brands, but I can say that it smells good, works its way into your beard easily and does not feel greasy or look greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a very large, full beard and this stuff</li>
            <li>; This stuff is the real deal!!  </li>
            <li>Hydrating, wonderful smell, but a weak hold.</li>
            <li>And over brushing or combing will still cause split ends - it is best to run through liberally with your fingers first and then only brush or comb briefly after the balm has been applied to get everything into place/shape.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>FAST Shipping!!</li>
            <li>But the best thing about this conditioner is it really tames his long beard hairs and makes it look shaped and professional, without an oily or glossy look.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Thank you for the stellar product!</li>
            <li>So much softer!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this line!!!</li>
            <li>The product seems easy enough to apply, it keeps my goatee more manageable and it has helped in softening a wee bit</li>
            <li>I use a couple different Honest Amish products, sometimes they ship extremely quick and some times it takes a while.  </li>
            <li>I visibly have less wrinkles under my eyes and a nice healthy sheen on my face.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and, although initially greasy, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It does have a scent, though it&#x27;s much more complex than anise (way to go to all the savvy dudes who knew how to describe licorice); it smells like chai and cedar, which I find rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>As you more gifted beard growers may know, this results in a itchy, dry, flaky beard.</li>
            <li>My beard is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions, especially if you live in a warm climate.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keeps my beard healthy, smells amazing, and is great for keeping a few stubborn beard hairs down.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling once applied and absorbed to my beard, and my beard has never felt more soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 30 years, and have struggled on and off to find a good leave-in conditioner that does what I want: help keep my beard healthy, doesn&#x27;t add unnecessary complications like styling wax or strong perfume, and helps stop skin flakiness.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it goes on easy and works on softening  right away</li>
            <li>makes my beard feel great, makes my skin a little greasy when i sleep with it in.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit provides a great result.</li>
            <li>It comes in a great little burlap bag.</li>
            <li>Gets a little soupy in the Arizona summers but works great.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly in a little burlap bag, which was great because this was a gift.</li>
            <li>Like I said, the longer the more you&#x27;ll need; if shorter like mine, just the back of your nail is fine.</li>
            <li>My beard is so soft, I feel like i have a kitten wrapped in satin wrapped around my face!!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure magic, my beard is so much softer already.</li>
            <li>Personally I love the smell of this stuff, nice earthy scent that fades after a little while.</li>
            <li>I realized that the beard balm softened my beard gradually, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference day to day, but when I stopped I realized just how much of a difference this stuff makes.</li>
            <li>enjoy using the product and doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li>overall effect this has on a beard is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product (I am writing this mostly from my opinion, with a few from him directly).</li>
            <li>Really like the light scent of the oils used and the fact that they don&#x27;t overpower and don&#x27;t linger all day.  </li>
            <li>Works great to keep my rough beard feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell alone is fantastic and the results are fast and outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it smells amazing and it softens your beard almost instantly...</li>
            <li>This has a good amount of hold, but it isn&#x27;t quite enough for my very curly beard.  </li>
            <li>So far he seems to love it.</li>
            <li>just got my Honest Amish last weekend</li>
            <li>leaves my beard nice and soft----and that is a really big change from before when I was not using it.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>Smooths it and makes it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Its nice, and I actually like the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it smooths out your facial hair</li>
            <li>Makes for a soft, sexy beard.</li>
            <li>Has a distinct smell, but it fades as it dries.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>He went to a local barber shop and had it trimmed nicely -</li>
            <li>I love how soft and controlled this makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over beard wax any day, feels a lot more natural.</li>
            <li>and no I am stuck with a pretty full container I will not use</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to putting the Honest Amish Conditioner  in my  beard after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did, my beard is soft, and even a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li>Love the all natural smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I rarely have tangles after using this balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been interested in growing a full grown beard</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold it in larger containers for people with longer beards</li>
            <li>The balm gives a nice sheen/shine to your beard also, which makes it look healthier to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  </li>
            <li>This smells masculine and works better than both.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even know it existed or that it would be useful.  </li>
            <li>, my face-bear is soft and manageable, grows thicker and more lustrously luxurious, it looks roughly 62% more dashing and 100% MORE MANLY.</li>
            <li>came separated, the instructions stated to leave in a window to let warm up and it would reconstitute, this works but only for about a day</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed the beard dandruff go away completely, but it does alleviate it for the most part.</li>
            <li>catastrophe can be traced back to my decision to pack Honest Amish in my luggage.</li>
            <li>Finally I found a beard balm called Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>worth the expense and maintenance.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Not really crazy about the scent</li>
            <li>I love this item and so far it has lasted 2 months</li>
            <li>Get the beard balm, its worth it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard feeling extremely soft, more so then any oil I have used.</li>
            <li>She said she also thinks it would have useful application in controlling fly-aways while braiding.  </li>
            <li>She said she also thinks it would have useful application in controlling fly-aways while braiding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for about two months, then hitting the rest button just to keep things fresh.</li>
            <li>Honest Amish will always be part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li>I noticed that my voice had gotten deeper and much more masculine.</li>
            <li>I don’t have so many of those wild beard days.</li>
            <li>No applicator needed, and it makes your hands soft too (another added bonus that your lady friend is sure to notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks a lot for making such a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more masculine smelling then it sounds though.</li>
            <li>I really liked that one but only tried this because it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>of the Bay Lime beard conditioning oil for about the same price as the two-ounce Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li>Also, the contents is kind of a gritty balm.</li>
            <li>Definitely a must own</li>
            <li>I decided to try ordering again during the cooler weather and have been happy with this product, so I&#x27;m adjusting my review score accordingly, but still... not worth buying online during hot weather.</li>
            <li>adds moisture and makes the beard more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the beard soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>After using these products my beard is twice as soft and much more tamed.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but its much more comfortable on my face, which has resulted in me growing my beard out to a longer</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Really nice natural oils aroma and feel, not sticky, a real must for the bearded soul.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well, okay then, let&#x27;s try putting some oily stuff that smells like tea ( according to a surprised co-worker).</li>
            <li>I currently have the Honest Amish Bread Oil as well, and I noticed that once you rub the Beard Balm into your hands that it basically turns into the liquified Beard Oil.</li>
            <li>It does keep your beard looking more professional.</li>
            <li>Not rotten, not rancid, just like fresh fish out of the lake being cleaned and gutted.</li>
            <li>And you could probably achieve the same results with a good store bought conditioner (with a smell you really like) without the messiness.ness.</li>
            <li>Apply after shower and gives a great, soft feeling for beard entire day.</li>
            <li>The tin that it comes in is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>I would say this is more for beard/skin conditioning, with a minimum amount of corralling wild</li>
            <li>After reading such rave reviews about the Honest Amish Balm, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though it can sometimes make my face shine a bit, and I&#x27;m using have a fingertips worth.  </li>
            <li>billy goat I&#x27;ve been coaxing to stay groomed this last year and after finding Honest Amish I gotta say</li>
            <li>Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>When I was younger, there was a popular practice of bronzing baby shoes.</li>
            <li>I saw this product and decided it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li>I rarely do reviews, but this stuff warranted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a cross between vanilla and cloves which is relaxing.  </li>
            <li>My beard is red salted with a bit of white and the Honest Amish does a really nice job on it.</li>
            <li>When you scoop it out, it seems kind of gritty and rub it together in your hands</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it and leaves his beard looking very well-kept and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>But overall, a nice product.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I did have some difficulties with on rare occasion is melting the product.</li>
            <li>Starting to become a fan of Honest Amish products ...</li>
            <li>I have been using Honest Amish Conditioner for about 4 months now daily!</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard fresh and looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>As someone who constantly plays with his beard, this kind of got me to stop doing that.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who enjoys the smell of mud and greasy car parts or who inhales deeply the burning lawn debris of your neighbor, then you will probably like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Will update if it is worth fighting the smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural love it</li>
            <li>I think maybe it kinda does, but more of a natural spicy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, minus the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second tin now and it really does improve the condition and shape of a good 2&amp;#34; or longer beard and keeps 1&amp;#34; beards from getting split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard rarely itches since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>The instructions that are included in the product are a useful guide to having a softer, cleaner beard.  </li>
            <li>Works nicely, bear is definitely softer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I will only use Honest Amish Beard Balm from now on.</li>
            <li>After a week, his beard is really soft, his skin feels much better.</li>
            <li>Also love the fact that it is all natural and made in the U.S.</li>
            <li>I like when he uses the&amp;#34; hsi argan oil&amp;#34; I bought for my hair, that made it soft and smells way better.</li>
            <li>I tried different beard oils and conditioners but the Honest Amish Beard balm beats them all.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;ve got some split ends in your beard &amp; it feels more wiry than soft, think about using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I can’t honestly recommend this product based on the price, quantity and lasting effect (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>If the right amount is used, then it will present a nice softness to the skin that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a grainy consistency which no one else seemed to have mentioned in the comments and had a very distinct licqorice odor, which again want really mentioned in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but quickly melts as long as your hand is warm.</li>
            <li>I would give this product a higher rating except that it really has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>But then again, why mess with the integrity of a good product, right ?!</li>
            <li>I respectfully disagree with other reviewers who have stated that the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been super impressed with the product, and two months after buying, and using it daily for a month and a half, I&#x27;m still not halfway done with the tin.  </li>
            <li>The scent fades pretty quickly anyway, so it shouldn&#x27;t noticeable to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have their nose buried in your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well it was too hot when it was delivered, but luckily they warned me before opening</li>
            <li>First week, there was a tremendous amount of growth.</li>
            <li>it melts pretty quick</li>
            <li>It is a noticeable (but not overpowering) scent when first applied, but that wears off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have kind of an an unruly yet thin and patchy beard at the best of times, and it is usually pretty scratchy and coarse.  </li>
            <li>The Honest Amish smells like a spicy gumdrop at first, and then later on it kind of reminded me of a ripe fruit scent of which I&#x27;m not a big fan.</li>
            <li>I am considering some of their other products since this one has been so good.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get too excited and use too much.</li>
            <li>Very dude friendly stuff.</li>
            <li>The tin came in a cool little burlap sack packed with beard care instructions (which I particularly loved, I think that&#x27;s a class act thing to include).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crunchy granola at all and don&#x27;t give a rip about its ingredients other than it has the butters and oils I read are good for beards.</li>
            <li>It smells great; It is easy to apply with no messy, oily fingers afterwards; It lasts a long time in the beard itself, even after a shower; You don&#x27;t need a lot of the balm to apply to your beard; And it makes my beard super soft.</li>
            <li>Out right majestic.  </li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>, it melts right in your hands, and it gets rid of the beard itch.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a day right after I shower with a beard comb to help even out the application of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Treat your face pubes right and get this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right below your nose.</li>
            <li>So that part of this product is right on the money.</li>
            <li>and I could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>so a post service beard was just so right for me.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived melted, but don&#x27;t do what I did and use it right away.</li>
            <li>softens my beard right up.</li>
            <li>This has just the right amount of hold to let me style it like I want.</li>
            <li>Once I applied it to my disheveled beard I knew right away that things were going to start looking up for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is right for you, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, a beard massage.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>then right out of the shower</li>
            <li>I put it on right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>then maybe this isn&#x27;t the right beard balm for you.</li>
            <li>He noticed a difference right away with his beard softening and not being as scraggly.</li>
            <li>You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a very light hold, just enough to reign in some of the wild hairs that pop up from time to time and allows for some very light shaping.</li>
            <li>Product separates easily -- came separated even when new.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; makes the beard look great, but I&#x27;m not Amish yet :(</li>
            <li>It smells pretty much like every Amish crafty type store I&#x27;ve ever been</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance but really after the first couple times I didn&#x27;t notice the smell and you can&#x27;t notice from a distance, just up close.</li>
            <li>First off when my honest Amish beard balm came in it was all melted and gross.</li>
            <li>First and last time I buy from Honest Amish,.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt or seen an long term benefits to using this cream, but it works great for a clean and healthy look for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Honest Amish was the first beard balm I used when I started my beard several months ago.</li>
            <li>Beard very soft, easy to manage and comb</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using balms on my beard for about 3 years now and there is a really distinct line between a balm that smells good and a balm that gives the guy 2 cubicles down from you a headache.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice, smooth beard and keeps the hairs down after I brush it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this and the fact that it is all natural is a huge selling point for me, but I found a local company that I think is better.</li>
            <li>I use this by itself daily and it really keeps my beard nice, controls split ends and gives a nice shine especially when outdoors.</li>
            <li>Softer beard, less tangles, and nice and smooth surface.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different beard oil and was less than impressed and it gave me a rash in fact.</li>
            <li>The dry skin/dandruff is gone and my beard feels a lot more smooth than before.</li>
            <li>Its great on my sensitive skin as well, doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything for that matter.</li>
            <li>after regular use my beard looks and feels super healthy.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell and so do the woman lucky enough to get close to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li>I was looking at other beard oils to get and this had the most reviews and most positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend, I will likely get more but just use in moderation and when your beard is wet and seems good to use.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, but if you dont like scents in general, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>It works great (once I get past the graininess).</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for a first time buy.</li>
            <li>In short, it has made my beard look a whole lot better and healthier!</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell really and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I chose Honest Amish and after a week of use I&#x27;ve been wondering why I took so long to start using a beard balm.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more once I run out, which is taking surprisingly longer than expected.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little unusual, but not unpleasant and fades quickly, leaving your beard looking and smelling good.</li>
            <li>A must-have for a long, strong, full beard!</li>
            <li>has a pleasant smell right after application that dissipate in a few minutes...</li>
            <li>What was once a mesh of strange hair now looks healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li>You can actually use certain oils (like all the ones contained in Honest Amish) on your face to moisturize (it wont cause breakouts) instead of lotions with who knows what in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the natural feel and scent, but it certainly is a pain to fully rub in.</li>
            <li>product is practically solid when it arrives -- like a bunch of very fine pellets pressed into the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A little more production, since it is a salve, not an oil, but the results were phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Works ok, but was hoping it would condition a little better.</li>
            <li>I only use enough to fit on one fingertip, and it successfully covers my whole goatee once it melts.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting texture and the smell is nice but hard to describe and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice and subtle, not too strong!</li>
            <li>They certainly made a customer for life!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, really makes the beard softer with a non-greassy sensation always you dont abuse during daily application</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, keeps my beard moist, manageable and almost completely flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all as the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine without being overpowering, and also has a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li>I like the scent of the Heavy Duty balm better and the control is better.  </li>
            <li>all natural, organic BS, this just means that the product separates easily, so you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of oil everywhere.</li>
            <li>I am prime so shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, we saw a nice difference in texture by the second day</li>
            <li>It helps tame hubbies beard and smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Expensive but worth the price, quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>Has a very earthy but mild smell.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard incredibly soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>If course I was not expecting strong smell seeing how this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>or so I decided it would be best to just toss it and work on regularly combing it everyday.</li>
            <li>I give it two stars because it&#x27;s made from all natural materials which is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice and the packaging neat, but it left a very greasy feel to my beard that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Well i&#x27;ve always had facial hair and it really didnt cause a problem, but since using Honest Amish Beard Balm my moustache has gotten softer and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>My beard is very coarse, and Honest Amish really did the trick.</li>
            <li>- Honest Amish tops the list.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well - even easier to use on daily basis than the beard wax.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Great stuff for the smallest to the biggest of beards, When I put in the second time my friend finally notice it and said damn that beard is shinny.</li>
            <li>and I really like the mild anise smell.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and really helps to bring out the colors and nuances of the beard.</li>
            <li>This was my second balm that I&#x27;ve tried, after being quite happy with Irish Beard Balm, but wanting to see what all the scuttlebutt was with the Amish brand.</li>
            <li>The aroma made me think of a sawmill, not unpleasant, but not as nice as some other balms.  </li>
            <li>I Like the way it makes my whiskers feel, and also a very subtle aroma that is most pleasant.</li>
            <li>got the best of me, so I ordered this a few days prior to this review.</li>
            <li>A good product, you have to work it between your fingers to break it down to a oil/lotion consistency as it is a bit clumpy at first.</li>
            <li>Calms down the wiry hair around the edges, smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Honest Amish beard lube is like taking Moby Dick by the cojones and single handedly felling the tallest redwood in California.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite obvious to people near you where the smell is coming from, and overall I do not think it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat disappointed as I really like the Honest Amish Beard Wax: great stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is addictive, the conditioning is just right, and my beard looks and feels better than ever.</li>
            <li>I purchased more right away - the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version this time to see if there is a big difference..</li>
            <li>Have used several of their balms/waxes and they are clean, and do the trick to keep your beard looking fine.</li>
            <li>This delivers as advertised - light but effective at helping to control your beard without looking slicked down  - manly smell, softens beard and really helps reduce itching.</li>
            <li>If my beard ends up dry from some reason I will run hot water over the side of the can to warm it up to liquid then put a lot in.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s sort of a spice-like scent when I first put the balm in my beard; it fades fairly quickly (or my nose gets used to it fast).</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with no mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint but smells so masculine, clean woodsy, and just wonderful manliness to this sensitive schnoz!</li>
            <li>I like this beard balm very much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what people say, the scent is very very</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell very much but the conditioning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for that very much.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell with a little bit of licorice thrown in.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products for my beard and this one is the easiest and most comfortable of all.</li>
            <li>You beard will instantly look more vibrant, clean, and refined.  </li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Just a little of the balm and a good comb</li>
            <li>It does smell interesting - nothing strong that would be noticed by others, but a slight anise scent is in the balm.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have a full beard.</li>
            <li>It has the best smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Was able to grow one and did early in high school and have had one ever since, I&#x27;m 58 now.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t  until my youngest son started growing his bread, very thick and full, father&#x27;s proud moment, and we started talking about it care</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, really like how it makes the beard feel (has a slight hint of black licorice scent to it, which I typically don&#x27;t enjoy, but for this concoction it has grown on me)</li>
            <li>You only need a little dab and it works great to make your beard smooth.</li>
            <li>I live in southern California, and when I first received the product, it included a warning about the products consistency due to shipping temperatures which made perfect sense to me.</li>
            <li>After my first use my beard was a lot softer and looked thicker.</li>
            <li>My dog really loves me!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, on my second can.</li>
            <li>Got this and a bottle of Beard Oil via Amazon for my first ever beard.  </li>
            <li>First time growing beard, and</li>
            <li>This winter is the first time I grew a beard.</li>
            <li>and it definitely makes the hair look and feel healthy as you gain some length.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard conditioner</li>
            <li>This balm does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>first time beard grower..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried beard oils after I ran out the first time; nothing compares.</li>
            <li>Holds very Well!  </li>
            <li>This is my first use off a beard conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>This is my first adventure with a beard balm.</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis and because of this product have received many compliments of how well maintained my beard is.</li>
            <li>This would be the first beard product I have used, I like it.</li>
            <li>(Its my first beard since youth and 20 years of never shaving it off, so of course</li>
            <li>What exactly is a &#x27;balm&#x27; anyway?  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see how this would infuse into my beard.  </li>
            <li>I can think of is because of the straightness, thickness, and blackness of my beard, the balm can make it glisten in direct light.</li>
            <li>7 days, 14 days, 6 weeks, all soft and itch free with just a dab of beard balm.</li>
            <li>I could see if you were prone to acne this could exacerbate it, since it is pretty oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have the tangles and the constant drying hair and breaking any more.  </li>
            <li>have multiple items from them and satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>but while it looked handsome, I still found it to be closer to a Brillo pad than something I wanted to cuddle up next to.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this balm!</li>
            <li>The first time I&#x27;ve used this brand.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I bought this to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into purchasing beard product, and I almost gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li>Love this stuff on my second can</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on my beard</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I used the unscented first</li>
            <li>At first I did not attribute the beard balm to the cause of the break out</li>
            <li>It made his beard oily and funny smelling but neither of us could feel a difference  even with months of continued usage.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Just freaking stellar.</li>
            <li>Thanks you Amish fools!</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I could tell a difference in how my beard felt.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, but it grew on me a bit.</li>
            <li>I grew my first beard this winter and the itch was killing me.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see him like his &#x27;ol uncle waxing up his big beard. :)</li>
            <li>importantly, the fragrance is fanning from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>There are no fake fragrances or colorants in this beard balm.  </li>
            <li>Repeated this test a third time to make sure it was the balm.</li>
            <li>I was extremely skeptical about dropping $15 on a beard product, however, after using this balm for 2+ weeks, I am happy I did!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; it won&#x27;t make curly hair straight!  </li>
            <li>We tried the process of elimination to determine the cause and sure enough, it&#x27;s the balm.  </li>
            <li>My first order of this product was an accident, one click oops.</li>
            <li>No itching and softens very well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do for your beard or mustache.</li>
            <li>It is a abrasive to my SO, so I thought I would try a beard care product to see if it would soften my beard and possibly promote some more even growth.</li>
            <li>, it just don&#x27;t have the consistently for hold,  its not waxy,  </li>
            <li>you wont know how much your manly face beard needed this until you go without!  </li>
            <li>Can be a bit oily for the first hour</li>
            <li>First off, my wife is not a fan of my beard.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it.</li>
            <li>First, backstory.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely going to purchase this again!</li>
            <li>you buy it during hot temps place it in the fridge for 30 min before use.</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t willing to admit to a stranger that this was a product for my &#x27;beard&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Be careful when opening the container for the first time, it may have melted and be in liquid form if it was delivered on a warm day.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>Spreads pretty evenly on a semi-damp beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A noticeable benefit in both &#x27;feel&#x27; and appearance from first use.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit funky at first ...</li>
            <li>Given how simple and cheap it is to make your own, I will probably be going that route for future beard balm needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first product for my beard</li>
            <li>This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely made my beard smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My beard is pretty curly and this helps flatten it out.</li>
            <li>Will leaving your beard looking shiny and healthy, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;m smelling his beard all the time ;)</li>
            <li>Give this balm a go ;)</li>
            <li>First, the scent.</li>
            <li>I think, personally, the top note is clove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same tin for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same tin for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this beard balm quite extensively.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but definitely not something you want in your nostrils all day</li>
            <li>This product was my first crack at a beard conditioner/oil</li>
            <li>My first beard balm</li>
            <li>First time using beard balm.</li>
            <li>my beard simply looked thicker and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I realized women seem to be following me around more.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be buying more</li>
            <li>You will notice the beard improvement on the first application.</li>
            <li>I think I would like it better with short beard, but if your longer than a couple inches you need something heavier.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, and I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes it feel softer and it&#x27;s more manageable to comb through.  </li>
            <li>First time purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my first shot at having a beard and after 4 months without shaving</li>
            <li>This is the first beard product that I have bought and so my review isn&#x27;t a comparison but just on my experience.</li>
            <li>First of all my wife loves the smell and texture of my beard now that I am grooming it with this product.</li>
            <li>This balm took my beard from Hobo to Hero in my first application.</li>
            <li>My beard also grows more evenly and fuller when I&#x27;m using this daily.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future..</li>
            <li>For first time beard oil / balm buyers I would pick up some for sure or something similar like cornwall beard oil.</li>
            <li>Now, roughly a month into my Honest Amish experience, I can&#x27;t imaging using anything else.  </li>
            <li>Has a barely detectable natural kind of scent once worked into beard.  </li>
            <li>For my circle-beard, I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li>be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have a really rough beard and this stuff does a nice job of making it soft, holding it in place and giving a light shine.  </li>
            <li>I grew my first beard this winter.</li>
            <li>I received my first tin of this stuff yesterday and applied it after showering.</li>
            <li>only wish the manly scent lasted longer because I love it</li>
            <li>I figured there was no way this stuff would last me more than two weeks, a month max, so I used it</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li>Hey Guys, So I would consider myself an avid beard grower.</li>
            <li>At first, I was drawn to the novelty of the brand, packaging and description.  </li>
            <li>In fact, his drinking and smoking has cut back and he&#x27;s being a lot more polite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made of butters and oils, so if you overdo it, you&#x27;ll be a bit oily, but it absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li>The price was on the higher end, but with the size of the can given the amount used per apply, it is well</li>
            <li>Non of the people around me commented on its existence even when I asked if I smell funny</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it exists once you</li>
            <li>Or, just apply balm daily till your beard soften at a longer length allowing better combing</li>
            <li>Thanks guys...good stuff!</li>
            <li>Admittedly, this complaint is nit picking a great product.</li>
            <li>Takes most of the itch out of initial growth.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>&quot; -- pretty girl in mid-kiss    </li>
            <li>Thanks for coming through, Amazon!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for extra control and sculpting power, I recommend their Extra-Grit product which is more like a wax.</li>
            <li>When I received it, it was a hot day, so the jar was a puddle of goo.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product; the fact that it is hand made with natural product is very appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Not only does his beard feel softer, it also looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>and I have only been able to use it once</li>
            <li>I just recently retired from the United States Marine Corps and as most veterans do, I am growing my post service beard.</li>
            <li>First, I am funny about smell.</li>
            <li>the age of 53, this is my first beard.</li>
            <li>It reduces itch, makes my beard softer and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I will be sure to post about it here for any future buyers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The oils don&#x27;t really seem to be absorbed by the hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have actually been able to grow my Beard out.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the most moisturizing beard product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li>I really like this beard balm!</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse, wiry beard and nothing I&#x27;ve used has been able to get it under control.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend thinks it smells funny</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and upon first use</li>
            <li>After using the product my beard responded to a brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference after the first couple applications.</li>
            <li>I wish I could have some of this that was never too hot.</li>
            <li>I think if you order this in the middle of winter it may be OK.  </li>
            <li>The first issue is the &#x27;balm&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I suppose it could use a higher beeswax content.</li>
            <li>That was my first impression.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the container the oil had separated from the cream which gave the product the consistency of grits.</li>
            <li>but its changing chemistry and messiness will most likely keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again!</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more of this.</li>
            <li>Even next day you are still OK.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my beard look and feel fuller and shinier!</li>
            <li>I just started growing my first beard this winter and realized as it grew that I would like to maitain it a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say about a dime sized amount should be more than enough.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>He digs it, because it makes his beard pretty.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is one of the first beard products I have purchased or used.</li>
            <li>Makes his beard very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into beard balm.</li>
            <li>It makes a creamy oil when warmed up in your hands and leaves your beard pretty oily throughout the day and builds up even more so during a week of use unless you shampoo your beard daily.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;i alternate between this and beard bomb.</li>
            <li>I picked this at random and am pleasantly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>im sure you were in the same boat I was.</li>
            <li>So i got this and the first time i used it</li>
            <li>My beard is shorter and my hair pretty course.</li>
            <li>if you want a simple, one product beard care regimen, you won&#x27;t find any better than this.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Smells very organic!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of work to get it all melted and consistent, but when you finally have, it&#x27;s probably my favorite beard product out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 40 and have never had more than a 3 day growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ran out of my favorite shave soap before and had to fall back on bay rum scented shave soap.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from this product and it has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from this product and it has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get through that itchy phase finally.  </li>
            <li>It DOES smell great, at least to me.</li>
            <li>The described scent had me interested.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>last thought is is an oil so make sure</li>
            <li>My first beard conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li>This was given as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It also, after extended use, leaves your beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It got delivered on a hot day here in co-cal</li>
            <li>SILKY, SMOOTH, SOFT, MANAGEABLE, NO TANGLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference the first day I put this balm in my beard.  </li>
            <li>When both of those were used up I ordered more of the regular beard conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I run out, I will absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Helped me grow my beard fast!</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>I first tried it</li>
            <li>It smells EXACTLY like that.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>Fantastic sale, all the ingredients except the kitchen sink, and, a money back guarantee, not to mention the cool packaging.</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>And I thing my stubble beard feels the same too. :)</li>
            <li>its my first beard balm</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>From the first time I applied it, the itching issue disappeared.</li>
            <li>Definitely does what it says by making your beard smooth and soft, and appear much more groomed.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve grown a beard and it helped ease the itchiness at first.  </li>
            <li>I had never grown a beard long enough to require any maintenance, but I must say this stuff worked great.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommending :-)</li>
            <li>It has a pretty organic smell.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of any type of balm.</li>
            <li>far as I can tell the balm doesn&#x27;t even achieve its primary purpose of being a conditioner - beard is still course and wiry,</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff</li>
            <li>was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re growing a beard for the first time I recommend you buy a beard comb along with your balm.</li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t just stand out, it explodes in the sun light and has completely caught some people off guard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I get stopped on the street, ogled on the train and put in precarious situations by the opposite sex more often than not (to my wife&#x27;s vexation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>packaging it came in is pretty</li>
            <li>I keep a short beard (most would consider it stubble)</li>
            <li>; beard is definitely softer and more manageable after I use it.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first time in my life I grew a beard with no itching at all.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a product for my beard.  </li>
            <li>I love my beard, have had it for over 1 year, but it was getting to the point that I was fed up enough to consider shaving it off.  </li>
            <li>My son also told me I smelt funny.</li>
            <li>Conditions very well!</li>
            <li>I was given my first container by a friend.</li>
            <li>We will definitely order more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I ordered this recently, and was really pleased with how it felt in my beard.</li>
            <li>I personally also enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>That said, this is my first time growing a beard - and I am 38.</li>
            <li>For a better value and similar experience you may want to consider Burts Bees salve.</li>
            <li>First, the scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a four star review and not a five star review simply because I am not in love with the scent and the consistent coarseness of my beard even after a week of application.  </li>
            <li>when I wore it around her for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased this product</li>
            <li>I will know more later.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a good month everyday.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the heavy duty version.</li>
            <li>but all I did was place it in a cup with a little hot water and then let cool and was good as new.</li>
            <li>Makes my Large Goatee soft &amp; easy to run my comb thru.</li>
            <li>more than three and a half stars reason behind it is because after a while it would start smiling more like popcorn in the Apple Cinnamon that I got but it stays with you all day s and during the shipping it did not get watery which was great.</li>
            <li>Always arrives quickly after order, one can lasts about 2 months for me, l highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely clove fragrance that is masculine and clean without being too strong and which fades to a barely noticeable scent not long after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard is definitely more comfortable and less itchy.  </li>
            <li>It gives your hair a slight sheen and has a great masculine</li>
            <li>However, it has more of a scent than expected and  did not dissipate as quickly as hoped.</li>
            <li>Just the right consistency for applying it to my beard without putting on too much.</li>
            <li>I looked to Amazon and ordered the two beard oils/balms with the highest ratings to compare and can say that I prefer Honest Amish balm over the other product I ordered that had very slightly higher</li>
            <li>I have tried commercial beard oil (it was ok) and a cream hair conditioner that I actually leave in (works the best but doesn&#x27;t last long).  </li>
            <li>but I actually like it for the soft hold and use it on the hair on top of my head!</li>
            <li>I have tried other beard balms and this one is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good , not strong smelling</li>
            <li>It smells good but is not a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of softening your beard but won&#x27;t help tame it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product that left my beard feeling very soft in less than a week.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of responsibility immense enough to wield the great power this product will bestow upon you and your front-mullet.  </li>
            <li>It does at least smell very nice</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d say is be careful using too much, but this stuff is by far the best beard balm I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Being that my beard is right under my nose, I anticipate it only smells strong to</li>
            <li>Would recommend for any true man with a wild beard!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like some other products and I&#x27;ve received plenty of comments about how nice my beard looks ever since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It contains natural oils and butters to create a unique moisturizing balm that moisturizes well without making my beard too greasy like beard oil.</li>
            <li>10/10 will be buying again along with other products by Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>soft facial hair allows longer growth which causes more full beards</li>
            <li>Also, check out the Honest Amish Etsy page for all of their other products.</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand over the other popular brand I bought for its smell and texture.</li>
            <li>Perhaps in time the occassional itch/dryness will be completely gone and my beard will become more full, as the balm indicates it should do, but only time will tell</li>
            <li>I was worried the smell would be strong after reading the other reviews, but I would say it is very mild and shouldn&#x27;t keep anyone from using it unless they&#x27;re very seneitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Now it is smooth to the touch, exudes a rich but not overpowering scent of majestic herbs and lavish oils while flaunting a sumptuous shine to complete the mesmerizing trifecta of beard splendor that falls just short of hypnotizing any whose gaze may fall upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great - light fragrance, not cloying, faintly of anise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle but great.</li>
            <li>I have a very curly and wiry beard, this product makes it soft, smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>It makes my beard look fuller, clean, and brings out all my natural colors (I have a rainbow beard).</li>
            <li>Leaves beard soft and clean feeling not greasy or slimy</li>
            <li>My beard is just soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard soft and clean looking throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Does a lot to keep my beard soft and clean, as well as keeping skin moisturized underneath.</li>
            <li>Currently in the process of purchasing a second tin for my husband, who LOVED this beard balm.</li>
            <li>His beard is not only stronger but more gentle on my face😀</li>
            <li>After you put it on, it does seem to soak up very well such that you don&#x27;t have any meaningful residue on your beard.  </li>
            <li>It keeps his beard soft and his skin underneath the beard healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>Conditions well, and the absolute only knock is he wishes there were more scents..</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it, and will definitely getting more, when he runs out.</li>
            <li>Second, it really does condition your hair, and even more, your skin.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the product-it definitely made his beard softer, although he didn&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they stuffed cherub angels in the tin that blow kisses to the strands of my beard all day long.</li>
            <li>for several hours my beard looks very shiny and healthy...</li>
            <li>It is a good little product to enhance his beard!</li>
            <li>Before I was using pure jojoba oil, and that worked pretty well too.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time not leaning in to get closer right after he uses it because he smells and looks so dang good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
            <li>While it certainly does have a unique smell to it, the smell is natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves my husband beard super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and keeps my beard soft and tame.  </li>
            <li>What was dry grey beard now shines fluffs out makes skin feel great and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My girl likes the feel and smell of my beard now and constantly likes to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and I noticed a difference immediately after the first application.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was surprised by the size of the container, but quickly learned size isn&#x27;t everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a couple hundred dollars trying to find the perfect products to tame the beard.</li>
            <li>The reviews about this product are insanely positive.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I thought I had found the cure with this balm.  </li>
            <li>After seeing all the positive feedback about this product I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>Agree with pretty much every positive thing that&#x27;s been written.</li>
            <li>All you need to do is gently rub it between your first two fingers of each hand for about 10-15 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever grown a real beard</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, with my first application, I am immediately awakened by the intense woodsy, manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help pretty well, and I do really like the feeling of putting it on each morning.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s mixed in with a bunch of other really great manly smells</li>
            <li>Love the smell and will continue to buy this product for as long as I have a beard</li>
            <li>i love it and will continue using it for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very*) picky about scents</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used way too much and my beard was greasy.</li>
            <li>and I really like knowing just what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will continue to use it, as long as I keep my beard.</li>
            <li>I pretty much think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li>I put a surprisingly small amount in my beard in the morning and am good the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells good, not sure why people are complaining about that shiz.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard feel soft, moisturized and non greasy for a full day.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice but subtle musk scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great - only takes a little to add more volume and control for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it feels nice once rubbed in and the scent wears down after a couple of hours (or</li>
            <li>It still seems effective but I have to work at the chunky bits to break them down.</li>
            <li>This is not a substitute for beard wax and will not make truly rogue hairs lay down however Honest Amish makes beard wax as well.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about my beard oil to arrive and I am excited to put it on everyday.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and though the container is small, you don&#x27;t need to use much at all unless you have a ZZ Top style beard.</li>
            <li>Anybody willing to do a little research will find lots of info on how to make your own beard oils.</li>
            <li>The Honest Amish canister arrived in a small burlap sack, but the can was pretty well dented!</li>
            <li>scent is hard to describe, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>The bread looked healthier, smelled great and a few days later felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes his usually abnormally coarse bead very soft, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews hearing the smell was amazing and all this other stuff I was expected something much better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this balm for about a month, and it has completely transformed my beard from a frizzy, uncontrollable mess into a beard that gives me confidence and looks pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>got this balm for my boyfriend just for something new and fun to try.</li>
            <li>Seems to make my beard slightly softer but nothing amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and helps with the coarse hairs and the itching of the dreaded neck beard.  </li>
            <li>The mild, natural scent is also a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black with a beard, and let&#x27;s be honest....</li>
            <li>I like having a beard, put I&#x27;m very particular about it.</li>
            <li>It makes his beard super soft and snuggable.</li>
            <li>The result is a beard that feels smooth and soft like normal scalp hear</li>
            <li>It will probably never be super soft, but it&#x27;s gotten to the point where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a Brillo pad.</li>
            <li>I was getting horribly dry skin, mostly on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Less hair breakage and a nice Suttle shine.</li>
            <li>Beard is super soft and it isn&#x27;t greazy as the Chuck Woolery would say.  </li>
            <li>This balm makes my husband&#x27;s beard shine and feel super soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application was easy enough.</li>
            <li>A quick application after a shower made for a soft and manageable beard.</li>
            <li>My wife hasn&#x27;t even mentioned it once; and she&#x27;s super sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>ive had a beard for a while, and used numerous products, this is easily one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combining this with a beard brush has made my beard more manageable, and keeps my face from getting dry underneath my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In less than 5 seconds, the grains will disappear as soon as it gets warm.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice if you like earthy, slightly menthol smells.  </li>
            <li>I can use mustache wax at night and after two nights super soft...  </li>
            <li>Beard is softer, easier to handle and not itchy but what I like the most is that it helped with dry skin on my chin.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell neutral, but had wished at least for some pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use much, which is good because it is a small container.</li>
            <li>The container looks small but it lasts longer than I thought it would, it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to get your beard looking good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dramatic...</li>
            <li>If my husband must have a full beard, at least he uses Honest Amish Balm</li>
            <li>For those of you who may not want something with such a strong scent, they do have an unscented version.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it is a little anise based - but it dissipates quickly if that is a concern of yours.</li>
            <li>With your finger you dig out a bit maybe twice as large as a pea and rub it in between your palms.  </li>
            <li>I wish it also came in a tin about 4 times as large.</li>
            <li>It certainly depends on the type of beard you have.</li>
            <li>If you have a large beard probably 1 or 2 months.</li>
            <li>The natural oils and butters tend to melt very quickly so makw sure its sealed tightly if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li>However, I really like the smell and see this as a positive thing.</li>
            <li>A great smell, make his thick long beard smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Same beard, been trimming it the same for about 4 months now but this balm has started to give the beard a more full look and shine to it.</li>
            <li>I love the Beard Balm, I used oil in the past but so far this product I feel is much better.</li>
            <li>It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  </li>
            <li>and I believe that if I grow this sucker out to a foot it will be healthy and look good for a long time.</li>
            <li>Anyway, was reading about all the new age, organic, botanical, feel good advertisement on all the stuff you can improve your beards health and appearance with and tried a few things at the grocery store and pharmacy.............</li>
            <li>Great product I previously tried hydrating my beard with different types of oils</li>
            <li>It also cured his dry skin, which was REALLY flaky before and now is 100% better.</li>
            <li>One thing I really don&#x27;t like is if you eat food crumbs and salt easily stick to the beard even several hours after applying.</li>
            <li>far as the beard goes, this product really does help with softening and even some mild styling/straightening of the beard</li>
            <li>A little help with the blow dryer and a round brush, a nice coating of the balm makes a huge difference!!</li>
            <li>There two folks commented how nice/trim my new beard looked (after several scraggly months) -- clearly attributable to Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad, but it also isn&#x27;t good, yet still noticeable, I just ordered their &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34; version, which is supposed to be scentless, so I may like that better!</li>
            <li>The next day the product was fine...</li>
            <li>One, simply putting some of the paste into my beard and allowing the heat from my face to melt it for dispersion worked fine, though this can leave one area bit concentrated.</li>
            <li>Mainly, I think this was because I was using too much at first</li>
            <li>Smells decent, too!</li>
            <li>Works really well on large bushy beards.</li>
            <li>The waxy texture mildly tames his beard while the essential oils provide the right amount of moisture that lasts through his workday.</li>
            <li>So, I did a little research and stumbled upon this Honest Amish beard balm.  </li>
            <li>so I melted the balm and added a little scented oil of my own to change the smell.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected; however, fair price, fast shipping, and really cool</li>
            <li>Goes on great after a shower, or later in the day when things are getting a little frazzled.  </li>
            <li>Neutral scent has a good feel and offers a little control.</li>
            <li>within a hour, it has absorbed and has made my beard soft and perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li>He has a very manly set of whiskers where my chin will only support a light goatee.</li>
            <li>Next I&#x27;m gonna try the heavy duty beard balm, heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>so I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t doing much for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, but once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to stop!</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to try another product like this.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>They are cheap enough to get both</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, too; when he uses the beard balm his beard looks much fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li>It really does help.</li>
            <li>It really makes your beard feel softer.  </li>
            <li>This assumption was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li>He says that his beard is much softer.  </li>
            <li>The balm is very &amp;#34;beady&amp;#34; like the texture of grits.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product</li>
            <li>Much to my chagrin, it fades progressively after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this in the past and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Since then I haven&#x27;t really noticed it.</li>
            <li>Product was very grainy upon arrival.  </li>
            <li>Really work it in all over; neck, mustache, cheeks, everywhere.  </li>
            <li>After around three days you&#x27;ll notice a real difference in how your beard lays on your skin and how it feels.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfume-y at all and is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try to use the rest of this can because it costs as much as it does</li>
            <li>But when you rub it into your fingers and beard, you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling, unless you use too much.  </li>
            <li>Use too much and can be greasy start out with a pea size amount and work your way up all depends on beard length</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I do think this softens the beard up a bit, but not that much.</li>
            <li>I intend to regrow it when the weather strts cooling off and this product will be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get how anyone would say it promotes growth.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks to really notice a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Apply gently.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated products would recommend to others and I use it when I&#x27;m not using my wax for my much beard</li>
            <li>I had hopes that this beard balm would help to control a few independent-minded hairs from doing their own thing in my beard, but this product really doesn&#x27;t do much for that.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The real reason for the 2 stars is the scent-</li>
            <li>I do not have to much to compare it to but am not regretting buying it.</li>
            <li>It really helps to soften up my beard and makes it easier to get a comb through it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>Really helps my beard maintain it&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>While he really likes the way his beard feels and looks after using it he feels like he can&#x27;t in the winter.</li>
            <li>Really tames the ole face pubes.  </li>
            <li>Those Amish wizards really know what they&#x27;re doing.)</li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves this product for his beard.</li>
            <li>and since I can&#x27;t stand either of those smells, I was really concerned before it came.  </li>
            <li>This balm really helps soften the beard and eliminate itch.  </li>
            <li>This helps resolve much of that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take as much as you might think.</li>
            <li>Really softens the beard.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I could return this and get a non-scented version.</li>
            <li>But it is very oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of tips - read the instructions and follow them because they really do work.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys the smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But after 2 weeks of this balm, my hair is much softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>will she want to kiss me if I have the whole homeless beard thing going)??  </li>
            <li>It is VERY oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>And the smell is very manly.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use that much of product to condition my beard.</li>
            <li>I gave as a gift, and was told that it works really well.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend not fond of boyfriends beard,but said much softer now.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>my beard comes in very wiry/scratchy, and my skin underneath dries out and itches.</li>
            <li>this really helped with both issues.</li>
            <li>you have to be judicious with how much you use -- too much and you&#x27;ll notice a bit of oiliness.</li>
            <li>Also I really like the smell</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t really a selling point for me although I do prefer fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li>It conditions well and has made his beard very manageable.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much I like it</li>
            <li>It really make beard much softer and stronger.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t seem to do much with my beard except make it oily.</li>
            <li>My lady friend absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>My wife prefers me to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow which would normally be very prickly, with HONESTAmish</li>
            <li>Really tames my beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if you want to help out your beard!</li>
            <li>He also appreciated the beard care instructions included.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really speak from experience</li>
            <li>My beard was much healthier after using this.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use...</li>
            <li>Add a beard oil if you choose, but this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li>and I tried just reguar hair conditioner it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone that wants to keep a well maintained beard.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>My beard and face are much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>i use this once or twice between shaves and it really stops the itching</li>
            <li>, my fiance absolutely hates when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for a longer beard.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using the balm the split ends are gone and my beard is so much softer.</li>
            <li>There is much to-do about the scent in the reviews</li>
            <li>She said that she couldn&#x27;t really smell anything at all.  </li>
            <li>So, I asked her why she likes it so much.  </li>
            <li>So, I asked her why she likes it so much.  </li>
            <li>If your hand is covered in beard balm, you are probably using too much.</li>
            <li>Everyone can notice your beard will be very shiny.</li>
            <li>The consistancy of the material really looks like the conditioner is made from all organic products, like advertised.</li>

            <li>I actually really like the smell</li>

            <li>If you do put on too much,  take a damp towel and wipe over your beard to remove some of the excess then brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much licorice.  </li>
            <li>I had to adjust the appropiate amount to use as to much leads to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Use too much and it can make your beard feel oily.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t seem to really sink in.  </li>
            <li>I was never into using hair care products on my face, never gave it much thought.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice the scent like others are stating.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t freak out the gentle people too much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use that much, but after a week</li>
            <li>Leaves a very greasy residue that never goes away during the day.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t touch beard or your hands get very greasy</li>
            <li>and no, it&#x27;s NOT greasy unless you use too much of it.</li>
            <li>At the begining my fiance didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>It feeds your beard really well and conditions the skin underneath briliantly.</li>
            <li>I really like this beard balm.  </li>
            <li>but he doesn&#x27;t like that it really stays with it.</li>
            <li>It is very woodsy and manly, and--</li>
            <li>When it cooled and hardened it became very granular and using it feels like rubbing oily sand through my beard.</li>
            <li>but it just don&#x27;t do much if anything from what I can tell.</li>
            <li>It came in very quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li>The three together have really helped both issues a lot.</li>
            <li>really helped the texture of my boyfriend&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>Very manly smell.  </li>
            <li>sweetie thought I&#x27;d really like this.</li>
            <li>I need to ask if it is because my manly whiskers are too much for her</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get what they are really supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I was unsure on how much i needed to use.</li>
            <li>I did not know there were such things available, so I have nothing to compare this to except for using no products at all.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, if it is too oily, you are using too much.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face as a moisturizer and to soften my beard.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband for Christmas, he really likes using it on his beard.</li>
            <li>it will really do what they say it will, but it don&#x27;t happen in one application.  </li>
            <li>This has a very pungent smell.</li>
            <li>I wrote them and they sent me the unscented version which is so much better!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t have any real *hold</li>
            <li>but your beard you get really oily</li>
            <li>I really knew nothing about it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Along with a beard brush his beard is now much smoother and neater.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>i guess it does what it says it will do, but i dont really like the way it smells</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much,</li>
            <li>Got this for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Well, two weeks in, and it really works.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>Was really iffy of it.</li>
            <li>This product really softens up and moisturizes my beard and at its cost, is a real value compared to pricier oils and alternative products.</li>
            <li>and it really made a difference in the thickness and look of my once scraggly face moss.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend that needed to ease up his fast growing beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tasted real chartreuse before</li>
            <li>I will use the balm at night after the shower when my beard is wet and use the wax in the morning for more control.</li>
            <li>I also ordered a Kent mustache comb - I highly recommend the combo!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>The fact that it is made in the USA is desired, and greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Product was as advertised works very well with my beard.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference since he&#x27;s started using this product.  </li>
            <li>Alas, I found this great</li>
            <li>Very overpriced</li>
            <li>The scent is very easy-going.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Things have been going very well</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe now much nicer</li>
            <li>Also really helps a lot with the itch when the beard is just beginning to grow.</li>
            <li>And his beard really feels much softer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this product to work as a gel or styling oil, that really isn&#x27;t the purpose.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it and it does make his beard a lot smoother.</li>
            <li>Very scented not as manageable as desired.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and really can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in my beard.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ordering my third can I&#x27;ll be getting the unscented, melting it, and adding a few of my own essential oils to craft my own scent.</li>
            <li>He uses it after he showers and it&#x27;s really made his beard and stache softer, plus I like the smell.</li>
            <li>Really softened up my beard.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amish</li>
            <li>The beard absorbs the balm very well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, i will be purchasing again when i&#x27;m running low</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve refrained from letting it grow out much.  </li>
            <li>so he didn&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really likes this beard balm.  </li>
            <li>I noticed how much thicker my beard looked from photos I had taken of myself the week before,(yes</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>This stuff really conditions my beard.  </li>
            <li>Really like this balm.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way that this helps my beard.  </li>
            <li>but my beard is really curly</li>
            <li>I think if my beard hair was straight this would probably work well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Really made the beard look nicer.</li>
            <li>, my beard is much softer.</li>
            <li>Had some separation issues initially, but after heating product up and remixing it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Works well, costs to much</li>
            <li>/&gt;the product really softens it the hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really makes it that much softer..</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Does not take much.  </li>
            <li>If however I don&#x27;t feel like being greasy, then it really doesn&#x27;t do that much.  </li>
            <li>but I believe your pricing has now gone to high!</li>
            <li>It really helps out with the dryness that can happen under the beard.</li>
            <li>It works after warming it up but too much hassle.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t wear cologne it might not matter as much</li>
            <li>I really like this balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the aroma actually.</li>
            <li>Recommended this to a couple guys at work and they&#x27;ve been really into it as well.</li>
            <li>but this stuff really does improve what I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more my hands wanting to pull at the beard.</li>
            <li>Rad, thanks.</li>
            <li>Works really well, just the smell isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>and I can really notice a difference in my beard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Package came as described, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally scent free</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>but thanks anyway</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine how much someone would have to put on at one time to be bothered by it...</li>
            <li>Really like the product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I have very wiry beard hair and was hoping that this balm would help to soften it up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li>To me, not having that citrus scent really diminishes the pleasure of using the product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The smell is very manly, but my wife is not a fan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell, really guys?</li>
            <li>Word of advice, don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll get oily.</li>
            <li>It will cause your beard to become somewhat oily, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>, i really like the feeling it gives my bear</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>So much so, that every time I use it, I make my wife smell my beard.</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping like everything from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Too much and beard will feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it and I will definitely continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li>My beard used to itch, but not anymore thanks to this balm.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the skin underneath the beard was much of a problem until the irritation went away.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Jaegermeister liquor and the light licorice smell accompanying</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, he really likes it because it keeps it under control and is softer.</li>
            <li>This Beard Balm really works to soften and condition beard hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and neat packaging.</li>
            <li>Too much on the medicine side.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well on my bread.</li>
            <li>It really does make his beard softer.</li>
            <li>His beard looks and feels so , much softer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much styling ability from it, not that it claims to, so if someone is looking for something to style with I would recommend something with a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>It is prickly, but using this product really does soften it up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And you really don&#x27;t use much at all.  </li>
            <li>This product has taken my beard to the next level of smooth, manly, and being well-kempt.</li>
            <li>I really like this balm.  </li>
            <li>Before using this, my beard was very bristly.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t even notice it</li>
            <li>I switched to balm from oil when my beard got beyond 3 inches because balm makes it much easier to manage and work-in with a comb.  </li>
            <li>Product really softens my beard.  </li>
            <li>I was using too much and it was leaving my beard feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>From the time I placed the order, to the time I received it was fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, and I was suspicious that it would do what it said.</li>
            <li>No lady wants a scratchy beard face to snuggle.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my beard feel after applying it.</li>
            <li>very oily.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really help with styling</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying the scent free beard oil drops (from Amazon) next!</li>
            <li>My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>no more soap flakes, just a healthy, full beard.</li>
            <li>I have since picked up Honest Amish&#x27;s Heavy Duty Beard Balm, and am much happier with that product.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner definitely made my beard softer and most importantly to me, completely eliminated any beard dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 different beard products, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the extra strength honest Amish balm or a leave in conditioner you only have to use once or twice weekly.  </li>
            <li>love how soft it makes it no coarse or bristly here..</li>
            <li>My younger brother has been using a beard oil for several years and I convinced him to try the Honest Amish Beard Balm</li>
            <li>It is pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard nice and shiny with out being greasy or heavy and the mustache Wax is a life saver</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others, but they don&#x27;t compare to the Honest Amish Brand.</li>
            <li>There were also a few websites that suggested Honest Amish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sticky or heavy but gives beard a nice feel, texture and conditioning for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool packaging too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - on my 2nd order and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li>Growing my winter beard in and it was real coarse,  this all natural product smoothed it out and made it more manageable</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes my beard soft and manageable, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>or under it), the only place flakes reside now is on my upper lip area, where I didn&#x27;t apply Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>You can, and I do, put a couple of drops of something like Essential Oils into your hands and rub it in after you apply the Honest Amish to give a different scent.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes of application it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling; you can spread the rest on your skin, which has helped keep my face from drying out in the winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coconut oil (the thick waxy stuff in a jar) is just a s good and</li>
            <li>I also use a little tiny bit on my own hair to tame fly aways.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it also has a nice sent to it no too strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a better product for their beard and for a solution to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural &amp; has a pleasant, not overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li>The balm has great texture and feels very nice, but the smell is awful.</li>
            <li>Pretty new to caring for my beard and heard about this stuff.</li>
            <li>He has a pretty good sized beard (maybe 5 inches at the longest point), and using it every other day, he still has more than half left.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but dissipates quickly, and I like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shake it up and put it in the fridge for a minutes (says it clear in the directions by the way).It has a grainy feel to it but dissolves into oil right away.    </li>
            <li>other day, a complete stranger informed me he had &amp;#34;beard envy&amp;#34; so I pointed him in the direction of Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>It works  well, much like many of the  other balms on the market.  </li>
            <li>Honest Amish helps me tame the beast a bit.</li>
            <li>Like most all the other reviews of this product, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely by this and other products from these good folks again.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to any other bearded brother out there.</li>
            <li>Regardless of your tolerance for fragrance it doesn&#x27;t stay strong for long.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve put up with dry frizzy beard for so long!</li>
            <li>I got it mainly because my beard/facial hair is incredibly course and scratchy, and so can be really uncomfortable at times.</li>
            <li>I have other oils, but this one helps a lot better at keeping a tamed look for work</li>
            <li>which makes it a lot easier to put into your beard than most other oils  </li>
            <li>After regular use my beard does not seem significantly softer.</li>
            <li>And a little goes a long way, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other balms but this one just works better.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that they will work as well as their original products.</li>
            <li>My wife love the smell of this one over all my other oils.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading descriptions of many other products.</li>
            <li>Are other products better?  </li>
            <li>Maybe tamer hair will benefit more along the lines of other reviewers;</li>
            <li>After him trying many other products (including my Moroccan hair oil)</li>
            <li>Now, I just rub in a little Honest Amish and it feels normal.</li>
            <li>So most of it leaked out into the box due to the damaged tin.</li>
            <li>Better than other oils that I tried.</li>
            <li>Also felt a bit more oily than other balms that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Smells way better than some of the other balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When opportunity strikes, make sure you&#x27;ve spent the 4 minutes it takes to give you a leg up above the competition and lather that sweet victory in to every follicle.</li>
            <li>Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount, and it makes him smell and feel good.</li>
            <li>This product, at least for me, was purely about keeping my beard soft and pleasant for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A small amount of Honest Amish will keep your beard shiny and manageable (too much and it will get greasy).</li>
            <li>and it went from sophisticated gentleman to Tom Hanks in Castaway, and back with a few easy strokes.  </li>
            <li>Smelled decent, but didn&#x27;t really benefit my beard in anyway?</li>
            <li>my husbands REALLY long beard is now REALLY soft too:)</li>
            <li>simply wasn&#x27;t suitable for use regularly.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice any particular softening of my beard in 3-4 weeks of application, but that may have been again because the product wasn&#x27;t really a gel often when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product -- only wish it were slightly cheaper. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely oily, but smells clean, not chemically.</li>
            <li>First: when you get the product, if it&#x27;s not cold outside - put it into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes - else, it may be melted into a liquid.</li>
            <li>only when I get out of the shower cause it calls for a clean beard.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown a pretty full beard, over an inch long.</li>
            <li>Smells good but still manly and leaves my above average size beard softer and manageable.</li>
            <li>also the smell is not bad, but my girlfriend doesnt really dig it, so next time prbably will go for the option with no smell.</li>
            <li>I was trying to decide between the Honest Amish beard balm or their light-hold beard wax and the balm ultimately won out due to the fact that it had far more benefits than the wax, or it at least listed more in the write-up.</li>
            <li>The Balm smelled nice and worked well keeping the hairs soft, but did not work that well keeping stray hairs down.</li>
            <li>Then take a comb and use the tight side of the comb to gently comb your beard (while combing, make sure you can feel the comb gently raking the skin of your face...</li>
            <li>while expensive, it works like magic, beard looks and smells great, and you use so little it should last a good long while.</li>
            <li>The forst few times you use it, you will use too much, but it&#x27;s easy to make adjustments until you find the right amount for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No, the smell is not strong, yes, it is pleasant, and it makes even my scratchy old beard feel (relatively) soft.  </li>
            <li>a nice smell (that doesn&#x27;t last very long).  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much, as it can become a little too greasy should you put too much in.  </li>
            <li>I can see where some people would be turned off by it, but its very &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smelling, and more of a scent, less of an &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product leaves a very smooth and slightly glossy look to your beard.</li>
            <li>The product packaging is nice and simple; a tin with a single color sticker on it and wrapped in a burlap bag.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my beard isn&#x27;t very long, so the balm at least helps with styling somewhat, but I also have the added bonus of reduced itch and a moderatly pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>A litte goes a long way; also using the heat of your palm rub it around to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>I have a full naturally white beard and this balm</li>
            <li>He has a full beard, usually very coarse, but it has been smoothed and tamed by this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard pretty soft as well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overwhelming which is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this and within the first week not only was my beard much softer, but the skin under my beard felt so much relieved!</li>
            <li>It does have some smell to it, nothing that bothers me but people who are extremely sensitive to odors should be aware of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the shower I take a small dollop,  warm it up in my hands and massage into my beard.  </li>
            <li>The first stuff I found that manages the wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine after a whole van it only gets better looking and stronger looking beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well, but it&#x27;s not worth the smell.</li>
            <li>Ive been researching all these cool ways to maintain your beard and give it the proper moisture, comb it correctly, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Honest Amish Beard Balm for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Since it is a more solid product, I feel like you get lesser coverage than other products that are more liquid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice facial hair conditioner, keeps my facial hair soft and flake</li>
            <li>I applied a small amount of Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Most of my traits are more common with the Italian and Samoan sides of my family.</li>
            <li>It instantly caused the irritation to cool and took away the itchy feeling.</li>
            <li>At first he thought it was a gag gift, but was pleasantly surprised by its usefulness.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice.. kind of weird smell but fades nearly instantly</li>
            <li>I generally use normal hair conditioner on my beard once or twice a week and get the same benefit at a much better cost per application over this product.  </li>
            <li>Very good stuff, just a little pricey, which is why the one star is missing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not your normal &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; retail look, but what bearded man is looking for something that looks like Ed Hardy designed it?&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular beard balm, but I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HJM1Q/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 , and it did more to lay my errant beard hairs down than this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more inclined to lay down and look presentable.  </li>
            <li>there is a mild, not overwhelming scent and is easy to use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, while it is strong at first application, the scent dwindled shortly after but there was still a definite presence of the smell.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for someone with a beard and started a new trend!</li>
            <li>It looks a little shiny right after putting it on but the shine goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It is soft and semi gritty feeling at first, make sure you rub it till it melts into liquid, which only takes about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product so much I plan on trying other products the company offers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I have very little idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I have very little idea what that means.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my hipster boyfriend who is new to the whole world of beards.</li>
            <li>After just one application his beard was like a whole new beard.</li>
            <li>It softens your beard and really helps to alleviate the dryness, itching and irritation of new beard growth.</li>
            <li>It really helped with the itch from new growth.</li>
            <li>This gift along with the beard and mustache comb that I ordered have really helped my boyfriend with his new beard.</li>
            <li>less is more when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a woodsy, slightly smoky smell with a hint of anise, if anything at all.</li>
            <li>A healthy beard makes my wife complain like 5% less.</li>
            <li>I love the slight licorice smell that it has</li>
            <li>What I discovered is less is more.</li>
            <li>I love the woodsy (kinda black licorice)  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a decent value otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s grown on me, my significant other wasn&#x27;t a fan at first, but the reduction in beard rash against her face won her over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is in a solid form, but quickly melts into liquid when you rub it between your hands before application.  </li>
            <li>I would love this stuff like crazy, as it works well and leaves you beard feeling NICE.</li>
            <li>That was my main concern.  </li>
            <li>Only wish the container was larger and held more product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about softer as I don&#x27;t particularly touch my beard</li>
            <li>a whole, worth the price of admission, especially if you are looking to upgrade from &amp;#34;possibly homeless&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;unquestionably magnificent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as spicy and the main note I smell is Cloves.</li>
            <li>It softens and maintains control far better than I expected .&lt;br</li>
            <li>lemon grass and clove are the two main aromas.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep hair growing in the same direction, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>The main reason I needed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really particular when it comes to beard care and products and would pick</li>
            <li>find it neat that it comes out gritty balm, but melts quickly in your hand and you rub in.</li>
            <li>I get the fun of sharing the secret of Honest Amish with all my bearded friends, but my baby-faced friends just know that my beard works and theirs don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Hence my reason for purchasing this particular beard balm.</li>
            <li>I have recently ordered the Extra Grit Beard Wax to see if it will help manage my beard even more.</li>
            <li>Such smell may be appealing to others, but it definitely was not to me.</li>
            <li>The balm starts as a semi solid substance and quickly turns to an oil after rubbing in your hands.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will be ordering more, probably in the bigger tin though.</li>
            <li>All in all, it was decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, but didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li>I kept getting a decent amount of bearddruff.</li>
            <li>Most of my family are either Irish, Italian or Samoan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found out from an older bearded man whom I work with that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like starting a bar fight with chuck Norris and winning after seven double scotches and hog tieing yourself just to make</li>
            <li>Remember this is mainly a moisturizer/conditioner, so dont plan to sculpt with it.</li>
            <li>It initially smells like medicine (think Vicks vapor rub), but the scent goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This will give your beard a decent moisturizing and a bit of a sheen.</li>
            <li>Next, it is kind of gresy, but not a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Left my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About the only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have is that, after application, the scent fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff, smells great, and I generally hate scented things.</li>
            <li>Genetics is the main determiner of your beard growth pattern, not wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent conditioning, but the smell leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li>My wife recently became pregnant after 8 months of unsuccessful (yet relentless) attempts at procreation.</li>
            <li>It took a few months for me to really fall in love with this balm.</li>
            <li>In the tin it seems a little grainy, but once you emulsify it in your hands, it turns out to be very smooth.</li>
            <li>I had the consistent problem of my chin becoming unbearably itchy every time I let the beard grow past a certain length.</li>
            <li>Scent is a little too strong at first</li>
            <li>It has made my beard very soft and manageable, while taming some of the stray whiskers that tend to stick straight out rather than fall with the flow of my beard.</li>
            <li>The only time I noticed it is when I put it on for the very first time.</li>
            <li>Works very well with sensitive skin to boot!</li>
            <li>The can is larger than I anticipated and looks like it will go a LONG way for me, and would last a good while with a beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>My beard is not that long, a good 4 1/2 inches, and I only use the back of my thumb nail for measuring the amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously smells come down to personal preference much of the time, but I think that this product smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>, I use my beard balm to keep it nice, tame, soft, and smelling like</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and container tells you to be careful because it may have turned into a liquid state if it was too hot.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Again, maybe I didn&#x27;t read or see the container size in the info above but other than that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Ive tried other oils and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It emulsified easy enough, but to the same consistency as a very oily butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product, as well as consider other Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried two or three other beard conditioners, but keep going back to the Honest Amish.</li>
            <li>Normally, I am very sensitive to smells and was worried at first that this would bother me, but even being very close to him, I can barely smell it and when I do, it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Wish it worked a little better, and I am not a fan of the scent</li>
            <li>I wish I got a little more for the money, and it doesn&#x27;t handle stray hairs as well as I thought, but that might just be my unruly beard.</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for a little more hold</li>
            <li>lasts all day, not too greasy and the smell is a little like Jaegermeister :)</li>
            <li>It comes in an adorable little tin inside of an adorable little pouch.  </li>
            <li>The packaging could of used a little more thought put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its ok a little greasy for my liking</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ll do that, then put a bit on your palm and add a little water with it then rub your hands together until it becomes more oily, it will do its job.</li>
            <li>smells a little licorice-ish, but if you like that this cream will give your beard a shine she will remember :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and extremely manageable with just a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as other reviews have claimed.</li>
            <li>This has a strong odor that lingers unlike what other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li>A little for a long way of this product which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason for 4-star review is that I am new to beard balms and this is the very first one I have used; I dont think I&#x27;m qualified to rate 5-star.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way as it will be months before I buy more (and I will)</li>
            <li>My beard is a little wiry and the grey is starting to be more prominent.  </li>
            <li>Although it does not smell bad, it does not smell AWESOME either.</li>
            <li>Made my beard real soft.</li>
            <li>When he does use the beard balm, it really does work to keep his beard maintained and soft.</li>
            <li>This really helped keep things conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li>It really helped keep the hair soft and in place during the day.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the unusual nature of this product aroused the suspicion of the TSA agents.  </li>
            <li>People complaining about it making their beard to oily are clearly applying to much.</li>
            <li>So far I am really liking the product though.  </li>
            <li>It is a very manly sent...but a sort of musky old man variety.  </li>
            <li>my beard is now soft and seems to be growing much quicker.</li>
            <li>He uses since Valentine Day (10 days ago) and he told me that he really like it how keeps the beard hair in place, but feels soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would recommend it as it is natural and works very well at softening the beard and protecting the skin underneath.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes my beard soft.  </li>
            <li>Really helps condition the beard, and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I went straight out to my yard and fixed the lawnmower.  </li>
            <li>The beard itself was fairly soft to the touch, but it was very irritated.</li>
            <li>- really helps keep my beard soft.  </li>
            <li>My daughter isn&#x27;t wild about the fragrance, but he really likes it.</li>
            <li>The tiniest bit makes his beard a magnet for concrete dust.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the balm a try, and I am very satisified with how soft my beard feels.</li>
            <li>Even a dime-sized amount would be way too much for me (though my beard is pretty short).</li>
            <li>I love the scent and wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>Compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried, I love the consistency of this.</li>
            <li>then it just separates and never returns to normal (not fridge not room temp house).</li>
            <li>, I like the ingredients, and my beard is definitely healthier, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than two hours before the scent and the feel of the oil are completely gone.</li>
            <li>My beard was soft and manageable after the first application and still is soft.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the beard and skin for instant conditioning.</li>
            <li>If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  </li>
            <li>If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  </li>
            <li>I purchased this a few weeks ago, and after using it for several weeks, am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few more shots too, even after a shower but still didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only critique is that Im not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>It contains a few more ingredients over Beard Balm, like Argan oil.</li>
            <li>this stuff will last you longer than you expect, well worth it.</li>
            <li>What was once a normal scraggly beard is now a majestic bear, on my face.    </li>
            <li>Heavy duty works better on my beard.</li>
            <li>think this will be a staple in my normal beard care routine</li>
            <li>I grew my first beard starting this November, and it took care of the itching and it did make the beard much softer as it was growing in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m contemplating trying the Heavy Duty Beard Balm instead since it sounds like it has better control.</li>
            <li>i love this product is works really well with making sure that my beard does not go all crazy through out the day.</li>
            <li>My one complaint about the honest amish balm, is that it leaves your face a bit oily/greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple and straight forward to apply.</li>
            <li>#5-trimmed beard stays oiled for almost the entire day from about a pea-size worth applied in the morning.</li>
            <li>It slowly fades to a barely there scent that reminds me of a sexy mountain man (think hot stud/not burly &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t shower man&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>so I doesn&#x27;t clash with my normal cologne I use</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are an eco conscious company and I would definitely order more of their product in the future.</li>
            <li>First, do not use too much if you have a short beard.</li>
            <li>Tried a few beard oils, this worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>My own personal overall impression ... middle of the road.  </li>
            <li>First I have to mention how fast the product got to me in my current APO location.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of use, I can&#x27;t say that my beard is any softer, but it&#x27;s more under control.</li>
            <li>I understand that it states on the paper that came with it that skin is fair game too</li>
            <li>Consistency is strange, not bad but too grainy.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and very subtle.</li>
            <li>I would NOT let that stop you, as the scent is very subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Realized that you really have to smooth it out and break down the clumped up parts before applying.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard feeling soft, healthy, and keeps the friz down.</li>
            <li>getting the wild hairs down; trimming does that job better.</li>
            <li>It takes considerable efforts to degrade the sandy viscosity down to something more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about it, my first few applications (once every other day) didn&#x27;t seem to do too much.</li>
            <li>Not hard to liquify in the palm of my hands.</li>
            <li>it made my facial hair super soft.</li>
            <li>In your hands it has a partial sandy texture, but after a quick rub together it&#x27;s ready to be applied.</li>
            <li>My beard was super soft with just one use and the flakes are totally gone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got a great, earthy smell without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s not super heavy.</li>
            <li>Smells like a hippy + licorice and is not pleasant for someone that wants to smell nice to colleagues in the office.</li>
            <li>I received this quickly and after a week of using it regularly, my beard is as soft and majestic as a lion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a dime-sized amount every morning after a shower (make sure your beard is dry before applying), and let it do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a low review because the product has such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Compare all natural ingredients to other popular brands - this is the only product I&#x27;ll put on my beard.</li>
            <li>Softened the goatee right up and, its a short hair goatee at that.</li>
            <li>and I bought it right before I left for a mountain biking trip.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I get out of the shower and my facial hair is noticeably softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely leading us in the right direction.</li>
            <li>My beard feels softer already, and it&#x27;s becoming less itchy/flaky throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I searched all over for a solution including using conditioner, shampoo and more to see if I could tame the itch.  </li>
            <li>is much more tame.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was actually very relieved to receive the product and find that it smells like cloves, and not black licorice.</li>
            <li>but the sent is light enough that it just smells a little sweet.</li>
            <li>He only uses it abt every other day to avoid greasiness and the smell is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>A little dab will do on your fingertip, rub upward into your beard and smooth down with your favorite beard comb</li>
            <li>I know Honest Amish doesn&#x27;t use artificial fragrance, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Smell tones down after 15-20 ...depends on whether you have a strong sense of smell and whether or not you like the smell to start with.</li>
            <li>not only does a bushy beard require only a small amount, but it smells great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need to tame my wild mane into a fine piece of face fur.</li>
            <li>It even gained a little color as the moistened hairs show their color more clearly.  </li>
            <li>Was concerned about the smell after reading other reviews, but I actually enjoy it and it fades after application; not overpowering in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it worked or not,but I&#x27;m sure after use and a complete shave the beard grew much faster.</li>
            <li>honestly, this one is a little gritty for my taste.</li>
            <li>As I have just received the product I can only say honestly that I have used it a little.</li>
            <li>Great to tame a few wild hairs but really noticeably softens the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the smell I like it, it&#x27;s a little strong smelling it straight out of the can.</li>
            <li>so I can live with that.</li>
            <li>If you are growing a new beard like</li>
            <li>We even tried to shave his beard and apply the product as the new hair grew in, but there has been no noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new staple</li>
            <li>My new beard is always getting compliments from both sexes.</li>
            <li>It was a new concept to me, but the effects were noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started seeing new growth in those areas.</li>
            <li>Also I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to quell the dreaded &#x27;new beard itch&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have that itchy new beard feeling anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to having a beard.</li>
            <li>I live in Wyoming and work out side every day.  </li>
            <li>I live in Vegas</li>
            <li>The product, as advertized, helps in grooming my relatively new beard.</li>
            <li>His beard is softer and smells really nice, in a subtle way that doesn&#x27;t overpower or interfere with cologne.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, my main points about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my wild beard soft and much easier to run a comb through.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more</li>
            <li>I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more</li>
            <li>I have just ordered Honest Amish heavy duty beard balm and their extra grit wax.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant earthy spicy smell, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, not only did I not notice much of a change with the beard look, but it didn&#x27;t help with the itch like Beard Balm did, regardless of how much I used.</li>
            <li>Its kind of gritty, greasy, and messy.</li>
            <li>I firmly believe if one is to grow a beard or any Length of facial hair, Honest Amish Balm is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It smells of black licorice, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong black licorice smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is good, very very subtle</li>
            <li>Put less under nose if odor is to strong.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this and it comes in a cute little burlap bag!</li>
            <li>At first it may feel a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; but this quickly passes as the balm soaks into your beard and skin.  </li>
            <li>There were far more positive reviews than negative</li>
            <li>Though my beard curls excessively, I am still able to enjoy the benefits of what this product offers.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking to try other products in the line soon.</li>
            <li>It has a mild odor of clove oil, and my beard hair sucks it right up!</li>
            <li>Mine tend to get very wild, and while this helped some, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>He started using it and his beard is very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my beard very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Makes his beard very soft</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin)...</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this product works well and has made my beard very soft..</li>
            <li>Beard feel very soft</li>
            <li>makes your beard very soft after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It makes it very soft and stay in place.</li>
            <li>My wife Loves the smell and says it has made my beard very soft.</li>
            <li>When you put it on, the pleasant earthly smell doesn&#x27;t last long and for me it was replaced by this slight smell of rancid oil.  </li>
            <li>Plain old lanolin was better.</li>
            <li>my son loves it even more than expected thank you!!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying if your are looking for a new beard balm or something other than a straight beard oil.</li>
            <li>This balm keeps my short beard and the skin underneath it from becoming dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>I found it softens my beard, but I was hoping it would tame the wild hairs a bit better than it did.</li>
            <li>I have long scruffy chin hair and this stuff has made it super soft.</li>
            <li>However, credit where it&#x27;s due: a little goes a long way, and it really adds a great shine to your beard.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer that look and on some beards I&#x27;m sure that it wouldn&#x27;t be so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the smell is not bad, my main complaint is the price, I understand why its expensive, due to all of the great ingredients.</li>
            <li>Very nice, natural product.&lt;br /&gt;Natural beard products are difficult to find</li>
            <li>Beings from another dimension crossed through the time rift, but luckily I was able to use this wax to forge my beard into a great sword that shot laser beams and I banished the evil beings back into oblivion.</li>
            <li>Its hard for us Northern Nigerians to grow beards already, but this product makes it look easy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking to myself, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband who&#x27;s beard had become wild and unruly!</li>
            <li>The smell is different, I suggest using a light/minimal application as I would say the aroma when I first used made my stomache turn a bit.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The 1st time I used it my beard was instantly soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever had that actually eliminated my beard dandruff...or as I like to call it....</li>
            <li>is fine (black liquorish).</li>
            <li>Instantly felt a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old likes my husband to do his hair with it too!</li>
            <li>This small tin lasts me 4-6 months, but I would rather be able to get a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff for one day and my wife commented about how soft my beard has gotten!</li>
            <li>Had my first beard balm experience at my local barber.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to help with the extreme irritation on the moustache area, but it did not  work all that well for me.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft!</li>
            <li>My first container lasted me about a year - and that&#x27;s with daily use!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s now shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>The next thing I noticed was around day two or three of consistent use of the Beard Balm when I was helping my friend move out of his apartment.</li>
            <li>After a day of wearing the stuff, the skin near the edges of my beard started to break out in zits!</li>
            <li>This is a unique conditioner and it works extremely well....</li>
            <li>Started usin this at the begining of the year and the beard is soft, curly and my fiance loves it!</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is light enough to not leave your hands oily, and soft enough that you&#x27;ll want to run your hands through it all day.</li>
            <li>Ok not sure this makes your beard any softer,</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s lemony, but I&#x27;m not so sure, and I don&#x27;t see any citrus fruits listed in the ingredients (though I&#x27;m not sure they listed all of them).</li>
            <li>EPIC!</li>
            <li>Hopefully this helps for people like me who have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I keep a pretty short beard, which is always at the stage of being ultra itchy.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple.</li>
            <li>This paper had a warning about how if it was hot outside when the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; shipped it may be liquid and should be cooled before use.  </li>
            <li>First, when it arrived it had a completely different chemistry</li>
            <li>If you can get past the odor then you will love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day after using this product, complete beard comfort!</li>
            <li>(pea size- amount you put on your tooth brush), rub it in your palms and it melts like a hot knife through butter into what id like to call the ultimate oil to put in your beard</li>
            <li>It seems to do most of what it claims to do, but not sure if I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first application the following happened:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and he&#x27;s been using this for three days now and his beard is already so soft!</li>
            <li>Makes my beard soft!</li>
            <li>If I try other brands of similar products, I&#x27;ll add more to this review.</li>
            <li>This makes my husband&#x27;s beard SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars, but this is the first product I have used on my beard and only have used it for about a week, so want to see how it goes over time.</li>
            <li>being said this product lives up to its claims and unless I am introduced to something better, I will likely buy it again when I grow a beard for next year&#x27;s and future fund-raising campaigns.</li>
            <li>Gives beard a nice gloss but other than that not much conditioning to beard.</li>
            <li>Obviously it was hot when it arrived but</li>
            <li>He said the product helps manage his beard better, but he is not sure about its conditioning abilities.</li>
            <li>only wish I had found it twenty years ago when I first grew my goatee.</li>
            <li>but I rarely let it get soooo long.</li>
            <li>It is a bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side, compared with other similar products and you better like</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty gross.</li>
            <li>No more itchy skin and the beard looks and feels incredibly smooth!</li>
            <li>Within minutes of first application, the difference was ENORMOUS.  </li>
            <li>No more suicidal  thoughts  :-)</li>
            <li>It does, however- soak your beard with nutrients, (and some control) and I have noticed my facial hair much softer, and more controllable in just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready to go full on wax</li>
            <li>I guess if you have a long beard then it would probably look good and work well, but for a short beard it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is stronger than I expected and it does stay fragrant throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Like G.Scott Parkinson says in the other comments, put it in the sun for a day and it was great right after it cooled down and solidified a little.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s on-par with one of those little breath mint tins you can easily carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong to me and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely get some of the heavy duty balm when my beard gets a little longer and needs some more hold.</li>
            <li>not only is not disgusted by its fragrance, but actively enjoys it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, softens my man&#x27;s beard, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cool little bag straight from amish country...</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, not over powering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Therefore a 4 should be beyond what you expect, and a 5 should be reserved for those very few cases when a product or service does something really outstanding and beyond your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish they could offer a few other products that have some kind of send added to them.</li>
            <li>and my wife loves the new beard vs the old brillo beard...</li>
            <li>As far as promoting new growth, we&#x27;re not convinced.</li>
            <li>Strangely I like the smell of licorice but something isn&#x27;t right with this scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy nonsense that says vegan gluten free straight edge organic</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard smooth and gives it a slight sheen - not as shiny as an oil based product though.  </li>
            <li>But not too heavy, easy to work in to beard.</li>
            <li>Goes in easy and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and works, but is not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>At first oily and shiny, the next day the beard feels soft and springy and stays that way until you re-apply the balm.</li>
            <li>Conditions and smells nice, but a LITTLE goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and just what I expected.  </li>
            <li>By the time I get to the office I am barely aware that I have put anything in my facial hair aisde from how pleasantly soft it has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard for years and never did anything special for it other than pert plus shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was concerned with the size of the tin, but like most have said, a little really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>Since this balm is sitting under my nose it makes me very self conscious for about an hour till the scent luckily dies down and nearly vanishes.</li>
            <li>Only started using it, but I love the smell and how it helps the hair lay down.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic and helps make the hairs soft, shiny and keep them down.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed his beard is more tame!</li>
            <li>He grows a pretty thick beard, so this doesn&#x27;t work to keep all of the wirey hairs smooth, but helped it stay soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is weak, but it&#x27;s kind of grassy, and not to my liking.</li>
            <li>Mind you, my beard didn&#x27;t grow new hair, that&#x27;s up to genetics, but just like healthy head hair looks thick and voluminous</li>
            <li>Slightly scented, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Simply regarding the concerns: Yes, it is a bit oily, but less is more.</li>
            <li>After daily use, my husband&#x27;s beard is glossy, healthy, and shows less signs of split ends.  </li>
            <li>I had beard dandruff, my beard was rough like a brillow pad, and I had dry patching skin under my beard and after using this beard balm for about a week my beard has softened, darkened and just looks better.</li>
            <li>Less coarse and more maintained.</li>
            <li>but I found if you just run your finger in a circular motion it melts down to a more fluid wax and that&#x27;s when I twist my horse hair beard brush soft on it and apply.</li>
            <li>beard balm provides a clean, quality ingredient profile that acts fast and provides a shine and smoothness where other products have fallen short.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product, i just wish they would either give you a little more, or charge a little less for it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, CK</li>
            <li>The wax is too stiff for easy application.  </li>
            <li>Cleared my dry skin right up.</li>
            <li>other great thing about this beard balm is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but after I stopped using the balm for 2 days my face cleared up right away with no new acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, warm smell instead of the cold and hateful stink of black licorice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they could tame the strong smell</li>
            <li>a large jar will last for a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain I&#x27;m literally rubbing actual butter into my beard.</li>
            <li>I personally can&#x27;t stand that smell, and I certainly don&#x27;t want my beard smelling like that.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like a large can of shoe polish, but it&#x27;s really tiny for the price.</li>
            <li>I started using this shortly after trying another product that was pure jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>It might sound a little majestic</li>
            <li>I tried this balm for the first time a few weeks ago, and I like it a lot more than any other option I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My beard didn&#x27;t get super soft and smooth overnight, but after a few applications I noticed my facial hair wasn&#x27;t quite as coarse.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole container and didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference with my very dry, very prickly beard.</li>
            <li>If you are constantly itching, especially in the first couple of weeks of growing your hair, I would apply this 2x a day and you will be relieved!</li>
            <li>The only thing I need to watch out for is making sure I rub all the balm in my hands to liquefy it to ensure I don&#x27;t get little chunks of balm in my beard.</li>
            <li>His beard is still a little bit coarse after using it, but better than it was before.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s oilier than the other balm I had (beeswax based), and the smell doesn&#x27;t dissipate that quickly.  </li>
            <li>it should last me a long time mainly because you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>apply Honest Amish Beard Balm daily and comb out my beard and mustache with a little comb made especially for beards.</li>
            <li>While some other reviews have complained about the smell, I find it mildly pleasant</li>
            <li>Works best if a little warm - cold counters leave the product a lot harder and more difficult to work into an oil in your palms.  </li>
            <li>Made my beard feel nice, which only served to make it more tempting to stroke.&lt;br /&gt;Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I also sometimes get some on my lips and it&#x27;s great as chapstick in the cold.</li>
            <li>it is very oily when applying, but my goaty gets soft next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So clearly, people noticed.</li>
            <li>Im getting ready to buy several 4 oz cans</li>
            <li>Beard really isn&#x27;t soft after use.</li>
            <li>If you want a soft beard, use oil - not this.</li>
            <li>Leaves beard really soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting beard dandruff and was pleasantly surprised when it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it has completely gone away</li>
            <li>has helped to grow and kept it soft feeling</li>
            <li>My wife loves how soft my beard feels even on days when her skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as off putting as some reviewers make it out to be.</li>
            <li>No reason to doubt the ingredients list, so the fact that its all natural is an added bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made his beard soft though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cursed with EXTREMELY coarse hair (a downside of my Hispanic heritage) and this product has worked reasonably well in softening it.</li>
            <li>I would use my wife&#x27;s conditioner, but it would only help so much.  </li>
            <li>Completely melted upon arrival, and popped in fridge before opening.</li>
            <li>Found this stuff, and since it uses natural ingredients, thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>my face-fleece grows wonderfully fast; I&#x27;ve donated over 3 feet to Locks-of-Love in the last 90 days</li>
            <li>My beard hair near my chin and the corners of my mouth haven&#x27;t softened up just yet, but I hope they will.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, and appreciate that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Well, if I had understood the actual size of this, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid so much.</li>
            <li>Soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>If you use too much you might feel greasy or waxy especially in the Mustache.</li>
            <li>I switched to a beard oil that was much easier and had the same effect on the softness of my beard.</li>
            <li>amount to use here, naturally.  </li>
            <li>amount to use here, naturally.  </li>
            <li>If you are burning through this tin faster than that, you either have a beard that is old growth forest, or you are using way too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note, one way to tell if you are using too much, brush your hand through your beard prior to bed (mutually pleasing).</li>
            <li>yes soft.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your beard soft and conditions it all day.  </li>
            <li>Neither were sold on using anything &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; and were pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard soft all day without being oily.  </li>
            <li>However I have alternatives that I prefer to use that are also natural, organic and quite cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard stays a bit curly, and still keeps its natural look, but it just tames and softens it a ton.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all and dissipates after about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by somebody who thought they were giving me a \\&quot;gag gift\\&quot; - I&#x27;d long had a beard and never used any sort of product to maintain it.</li>
            <li>so I do really wish I could buy a bigger container of it than have to purchase a bunch of these 2oz tins every time I re-order!</li>
            <li>I started using this when my beard was about 6 months old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 36 year old man.</li>
            <li>I want to use it after showering at the gym, but after my bag has been in my car all day, the balm would be completely liquid.</li>
            <li>This product fixed all of that.</li>
            <li>This product makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes you smell like old cheese.  </li>
            <li>Makes your beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft but not oily</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, its too early to tell if it helps growth.</li>
            <li>It has a natural scent to it.</li>
            <li>Only reason I docked one star is because the price and shipping is a bit much for what you get.</li>
            <li>It has tamed my wild circle-beard (aka goatee).  </li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>BUT this is all part of a natural product&#x27;s characteristics.  </li>
            <li>My itchiness and dryness has completely went away.</li>
            <li>I believe it is some softer, but not as soft as I was hoping it to be.</li>
            <li>I like how soft it made his beard and how glossy, not greasy</li>
            <li>Makes the beard soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft as can be.  </li>
            <li>And as far as the smell...</li>
            <li>I have had FAR fewer stray hairs come out in my comb.</li>
            <li>After about 4 months of solid growth I really started looking into beard oil/balm.</li>
            <li>This time around I have been thinking of really taking the beard to the next level like \\&quot;fear the beard\\&quot; status.</li>
            <li>But, I realized I need some help since I work in a professional environment.</li>
            <li>Once it started getting pretty long</li>
            <li>It is supposed to &amp;#34;tame wild hairs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>He was drinking Wild Turkey out of the bottle and smoking Marlboro Reds all day.  </li>
            <li>Though not often, my job does require a professional appearance</li>
            <li>very woodsy, piney smelling stuff which goes well with a big burly beard.</li>
            <li>My beard was getting pretty long and brittle after 3 months of growth.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was one day late, but the likes happen, so I would say arrives on time more or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product worked well in keeping the beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My wife, not so much which means that I will probably be ordering the unscented tin next time.</li>
            <li>I love the smell some have complained about.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>He puts it on after the shower and it makes his beard soft, shiny, and neat.</li>
            <li>I shall try others in the future, but as a first-round pick, I believe I did very well selecting this product.</li>
            <li>but wow they itched.</li>
            <li>Ive now used this for two beards and wow the itch is gone.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t go near him.</li>
            <li>But, the real difference came a week later.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and helps straighten my hair some.</li>
            <li>It definitely has made my beard softer and eliminated much of the itchiness that I&#x27;ve had as it&#x27;s been growing in.</li>
            <li>What you get from this is a soft and moisturized feeling in your beard</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I&#x27;m leaving stains on the pillow case</li>
            <li>Keeps it soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Keeps wild beard in place</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve said before, my beard is naturally soft.</li>
            <li>In just a short time my folicles have grown much softer and thesmell is both manly and pleasent.</li>
            <li>bowl shave using Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp; a Gilette Fatboy from the 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Use this product daily and would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It does not, however, make it soft at all.  </li>
            <li>It is much nicer to look at and apply when it is solid like this.</li>
            <li>But WOW, does it work.  </li>
            <li>Makes his beard so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes his beard soft and glisteny.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this so much we&#x27;ve bought several cans now!</li>
            <li>I also use a soft bristle</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s soft.  </li>
            <li>has helped considerably with fullness and softness of beard.  </li>
            <li>how much i rub it in my hands, its gritty with a hateful smell.  </li>
            <li>i could tell a big change in how much softer it made my beard feel and</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s soft and stays in place.</li>
            <li>Leaves whiskers and skin feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li>Works well even on my sensitive ginger skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe the Amish aren&#x27;t sensitive to this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients is a plus also.</li>
            <li>The shine goes away after a bit and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>They were stocking stuffers for Christmas for my 23 year old Grandson.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness there, but combine it with a Boar&#x27;s Hair soft brush and you will be the talk of the town.</li>
            <li>It keeps me from looking like a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helps control my husbands wild beard - it makes it look nicer and softer.</li>
            <li>and I served 3 tours in the Middle East, so that&#x27;s really saying something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to cologne smells or chemical smells</li>
            <li>His beard is soft and conditioned without leaving it oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>Slippery and soft stuff.</li>
            <li>My big bearded boyfriend uses this and raves so much about it</li>
            <li>A licorice/spice smell, but it is only really noticeable</li>
            <li>It leaves your beard soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My beard leans toward Moses or bedlam patient in its natural state, their beard wax is my go to beard tamer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells quite masculine, like a mixture of licorice and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally frizzy</li>
            <li>The product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the beard thus, even hours after application, if you stroke your beard you&#x27;ll be left with a greasy hand.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft too.</li>
            <li>So far, I have found no oil residue on my collar shirt or jackets.</li>
            <li>RECOMMENDED FROM AN OLD BEARDO.</li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at a long term beard</li>
            <li>My facial hair is much softer and easier to groom.</li>
            <li>knocked off a star because it hasn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>if I weren&#x27;t using the stuff, though.asn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>(Argin oil, natural shampoos and conditioners and even some home made family recipe balm)</li>
            <li>Only had it for a week, so trying to adjust how much to use.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something masculine he would use.</li>
            <li>This makes it soft and the scent is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like the way it feels on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and organic</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>My beard is so soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff really takes your beard to the next level.</li>
            <li>Feels buttery and natural.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li>for the natural conditioning properties it has...</li>
            <li>While it is still damp I pull out just a bit, rub it in my hands until completely liquidated, and then rubbing it through my beard.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>This is complete nonsense.  </li>
            <li>I use this in addition to another Beard Oil and like it just as much for different reasons.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky is the feel</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use it on the ends of my hair at night sometimes and it makes them soft too.</li>
            <li>have a naturally wirey beard with a defiant personality.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li>No itching, my beard was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Been using this after every shower for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s not baby soft</li>
            <li>My skin was getting very irritated from rubbing my beard to get rid of the big flakes.  </li>
            <li>Because it is 100% natural, it doesn&#x27;t have any aroma&#x27;s added.  </li>
            <li>my beard is so soft and shiny, while not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My wife would not come near me with it on.</li>
            <li>In the end it made my whiskers soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>He loves the smell, says its woodsy and masculine without being over powering.</li>
            <li>It still hasn&#x27;t tammed the wild hairs</li>
            <li>how well I keep up the beard, and how soft it has become.</li>
            <li>keeps my face bush feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>girl who lives with the man with the epic beard</li>
            <li>Seemed to absorb fast, and definitely made my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I started using this oil daily to see if my beard would begin to soften up, and after 2 months my beard doesn&#x27;t feel much softer than before, the exception to this being if the oil is still in my beard.</li>
            <li>Makes your beard soft and shiny....</li>
            <li>Was using Jojoba oil but was clearly missing something, especially now the beard has more growth.  </li>
            <li>After the first few hours of the first application of Beard Balm</li>
            <li>Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying.</li>
            <li>Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying.</li>
            <li>Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both.</li>
            <li>I reapplied it after waiting 5 days of non-use and sure enough my nose started reacting heavily to the scent again.</li>
            <li>and my beard has been growing SO much more evenly and thick, and is way softer.  </li>
            <li>I lose the smell after about an hour, maybe more if i lay it on thick.</li>
            <li>Rub it together in-between your palms until it&#x27;s nice and thin...</li>
            <li>As my beard grows slowly it seems to be getting softer and looking better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After seeing how much this product has helped maintain my beard, I am interested in trying some other products from the company!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After seeing how much this product has helped maintain my beard, I am interested in trying some other products from the company!</li>
            <li>may try ordering again when things cool down a bit here in Virginia.  </li>
            <li>smell but due to only using a little bit at a time, it fades fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It needs to be washed regularly, but it can get dry and wiry unless you have special products to treat it.</li>
            <li>I take a portion of about a dime (much less when my beard is a young and full of dreams), rub it between my hands for about 3-5 seconds to warm/disperse it, then lightly spread it through my beard like I am doing some heavy pondering.</li>
            <li>Can be used for daily purposes (I wash my beard daily even though it isn&#x27;t recommended) because I live in a humid, hot area and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I love this balm, and i actually get annoyed if i cant put it on right after my shower.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a couple of days, but so far everyone has said my fierce beard is more tame.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff a lot, but watch out, because it&#x27;s REALLY oily, so if you can&#x27;t wash your hands right after applying it, you&#x27;ll end up destroying everything you touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an open mind and reserve the right to alter my review in case further experience changes my perceptions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t start to soften your beard right away, but after a few days it is much softer.  </li>
            <li>and it gives it a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; and makes it not look so dull, if you are growing a beard, this is by far one of the best products to use or if you let your beard get kinda long before shaving it will do the same</li>
            <li>It is extremely reasonably priced for what you get, and you use very small amounts for a moderate (4-6&amp;#34;) full beard.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like a lot of grooming (low maintenance) but admitted this stuff helped his beard and mustache be a bit more tame.</li>
            <li>It looks more liquefied other than a sort of solid texture that it should be from the various videos i watched of the product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this and their other products in the future.</li>
            <li>but right now I see no real benefit to using it.</li>
            <li>I am just starting down the journey of growing a beard, this beard balm works well and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My beard is pretty course and always feels dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>It gets quite addicting to put on your facial hair and face due to the fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount is needed and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>The regular scent to me is kind of like a mix of sandalwood with a very small amount of vanilla in it.</li>
            <li>Like most beardsmen (and anyone who knows a little bit about hair at all), I do not wash my beard every day, as doing so strips it of all of the natural oils which can lead to a dry, wiry, and coarse beard, which nobody wants.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, the moist feeling makes your beard feel so soft and enjoyable</li>
            <li>applying you need to rub it vigorously thru your hands until your hands are nice and shiny, then rub thru your entire beard, a little goes a long way in taming the beast!&lt;br /&gt;dont</li>
            <li>They sure put a lot of extra packaging on it to make the claim that they&#x27;re trying to be &#x27;all natural&#x27;, as part of being natural is not using excessive packaging.</li>
            <li>less is more, use too much and your beard is an oily mess, overly saturated and gross.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>What is left on my hands after applying to my beard I rub into the skin on my face and then clean it off rubbing into wet hair and brush it immediately.</li>
            <li>The balm has an interesting floral scent that is not overpowering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Like many people have said before, a little bit (I&#x27;d say about a pea size portion) goes a long way.</li>
            <li>And a little goes a long way :)  </li>
            <li>just make sure that you don&#x27;t apply to much a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Once straighten, they pretty much stay like that while  being soft and no greasy or heavy feeling to it.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad, not especially good either.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came in the mail that I did not read anything (BIG MISTAKE) and went on directly opening the package to find it spilling a good amount on my shirt &#x3D;(</li>
            <li>I personally love there subtle smell of anise that it has.</li>
            <li>Usually my skin is better as the temperature warms but that is actually when my dandruff started.</li>
            <li>I have found this to be as much if not more useful than quality beard oils.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell and it pretty much dissipates within a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li>Not sure why people have complained about the smell, as this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely the main scent that I could detect.</li>
            <li>They both smell exactly the same and achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is decent, which is the only reason i keep putting it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of black licorice/anise, but the smell is tollerable, overall it&#x27;s a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li>a woman who has to smell the after-effects of anything that my significant other wears, I actually like the scent.</li>
            <li>The black licorice smell is noticeable for about 5 minutes but goes away quick.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, very subtle and I have a K-9 nose</li>
            <li>It does tend to separate into what looks little tiny balls of wax, but rub in together in your hands and it melts and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I go against the grain, in circles and then smooth it back down.</li>
            <li>my beard is very coarse and the balm helps smooth it down.</li>
            <li>However, it really hasn&#x27;t done much to help the stray hairs on my beard lay down.</li>
            <li>I know it seems like a little bit spread out over a full beard won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li>Really cool image and neat little tin.</li>
            <li>I tried other very expensive beard oils and came to appreciate Honest Amish beard balm even more.</li>
            <li>Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  </li>
            <li>I want to try other beard products before I find what is right for me.</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>At first it looked like an awfully small can but after using it I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;ll last me quite a while because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only very minor gripe, is that I am not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>definitely softens your beard, shines a little more that I would like, actually got accused of glitter in my beard once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or waxy at all, it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave buildup, and it doesn&#x27;t give an unnatural texture--it just leaves your beard strong, soft, thick, and controlled.</li>
            <li>After a few days you&#x27;re beard will be super duper soft..</li>
            <li>Overall it is comparable to other beard balms, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I was using a beard oil prior to trying this product, and was not one hundred percent satisfied due to still having problem areas with dry skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it has a pretty strong licorice scent, but it only lasts for about 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I felt a little girly getting this(conditioner... for a beard nonetheless), but now I&#x27;m convinced I made a pretty decent choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this happened because it was in a box with huge air bubbles.</li>
            <li>I dont have a beard (real beard, long bushy)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a long beard, still this product softened it and feels very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolute necessity for long beards.  </li>
            <li>It barely has a smell, it has a hint of natural smell.</li>
            <li>Fantastic beard balm!&lt;br /&gt;I grow a beard every November, which usually stays with me through the duration of the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Not to happy that I spent money on something that was in such poor shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes there is a light scent (anise) but it is not overwhelming, or offensive.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and feel but for the price I don&#x27;t want something I have to mess with every few days.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but then again, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The other product that I bought simply labeled as &amp;#34;Beard Oil&amp;#34; will give similar results, but I felt that I had to use more than the recommended amount to get the same results.  </li>
            <li>My beard was pretty rough coming in</li>
            <li>The normal hair conditioners just simply don&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected and needed.</li>
            <li>I was using normal conditioner before, but after having used this I will never go back.</li>
            <li>I expect a conditioner I put in my beard to be absorbed by my beard, not fun all day.</li>
            <li>I needed something to calm it down and bring it under control.  </li>
            <li>This has helped calm down my ADHD hairs.  </li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s easy to use, definitely helps tame the hair and soften it.</li>
            <li>I am sending this back and will stick with a homemade beard oil that is pure jojoba and some essential oils.</li>
            <li>Mine has grown out enough that beard oil doesn&#x27;t tame it any longer, but this leaves my beard soft and civilized looking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell other than it smells like a new 2x4.</li>
            <li>It did make my beard quite soft though, but no more so than a few drops of good extra virgin olive</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, it does smell like licorice BUT a lot more subtle/fresh and slightly sweeter.</li>
            <li>It lasted forever - my husband used it almost daily for about a year before we had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and Beard Balm at the same time as I was new to the beard conditioners, waxes, etc.</li>
            <li>Now at the age of 61 a new beard surfaced and it is presently 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to grow a beard several times, but put an end to my new hirsute look when the itches attacked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would be great for styling crazy beards, but it works well as a regular leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>She may be getting tired of me telling her that, but with such an amazing smelling product in the hairs on my face, I&#x27;m going to keep telling her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well to eliminate dry skin under your beard and make your beard look a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>It helps soooo much with your skin feeling dry under your beard.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li>It felt like my beard was only marginally softer after using almost a whole tin in regular applications.</li>
            <li>It helps to control the wild hairs, and it accentuates the natural waves in my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>This stuff has brought so much life back to my beard definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>The downfall is that I actually could not stand the smell - at all - which really doesn&#x27;t work well when they want to put their face next to yours.</li>
            <li>My beard was driving me crazy and I was ready to shave it off, but after application, the beard softened and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I am sure i can make it last at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The whole can fits entirely inside the palm of my hand with an inch of palm left on all sides.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and slightly of anise, but not overpowering and it does wear off during the day.</li>
            <li>Definitely softens very course facial hair and helps alot with itching.</li>
            <li>But within a few minutes of putting this on the smell quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Honest Amish has the texture of a sugary paste with a light oily base.  </li>
            <li>I got this to tame and soften my full beard.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is something I thought would bother me, but it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>My wife had difficulty smelling it after a few hours of application, and she is a super smeller.</li>
            <li>just got a raise, which I&#x27;d be dishonest if I said was as a result of my strong work ethic and lack of tardiness.</li>
            <li>It goes on rather easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>He is very sensitive to constant smells like deoderant or perfume, so I was nervous to order something like this.</li>
            <li>Every guy that wants to have a beard (or other facial hair) and ended up shaving it for his significant other needs this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product daily in my beard to an almost excessive amount, it leaves the hair feeling soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Left my beard shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>I had MAJOR problems at the airport as a result of my decision to bring this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a third hoping the next one will be like the first not the second.  </li>
            <li>This made my beard feel like a mink i am sold will not use no other product</li>
            <li>Jojoba is usually quickly absorbed and my beard doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but something in this made it a mess.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sort of reminiscent of a fine black licorice but lacking the pungent smell of the actual candy.</li>
            <li>and my whiskers were still pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand, find it smells funny.</li>
            <li>I put off buying this for a while due to the consistent comments about the &amp;#34;licorice smell&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay once you get used to it, but it is extremely greasy no matter how little of it is used.  </li>
            <li>So instead I received the vegan beard balm which initially I was hesitant due to the review about its texture , but after using it for 2-3 weeks every other day I love it.</li>
            <li>He has become obsessed with this balm; which I am ok with!</li>
            <li>Also, major kudos on the packaging.</li>
            <li>My beard looked healthy, thick, and brimming with pride!</li>
            <li>smells good and a little goes a long way, but did not soften or tame the beard.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first week, by the second week the dry, flaky skin under my beard started to go away.</li>
            <li>It is not super oily and soaks right into your beard and skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s daunting to spend that much on so little product, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would last a little longer but appears to be absorbed quickly, haven&#x27;t been using it long so can&#x27;t address the dry skin issue.</li>
            <li>You take a very small amount of the paste and rub it between your fingertips to make a liquid that&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and you learn that the first time you use it and accidentally grab too much.</li>
            <li>I use there beard oil at night time and have switched to there heavy duty beard balm to use in the mornings to control the wild hairs a little better.</li>
            <li>While I was certainly surprised, I can say that a little bit of this product really does go a long way, and it really does help with growth and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I echo the general consensus here</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good for a bad, the smell and texture is more like something you would find in the automotive industry (thick, waxey, greasy texture)-</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t want to smell anything.</li>
            <li>Guys don&#x27;t generally go in for &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; oneself, but go for it with this product.</li>
            <li>Finally she came upon the clear plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>this one really works it last long gets rid of the crunchy crispy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried to grow out my beard in the past but the itching became unbearable and when I inevitably shaved I could see that my skin was genuinely irritated and flaky.</li>
            <li>product comes in a soft, yellowish solid form.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is providing enough control over my wild hairs.  </li>
            <li>Girlfriend says it makes my beard soft, loves it actually.</li>
            <li>definitely helps with the wild hairs and appears to thicken the beard up some.  </li>
            <li>I have a big beard and this balm helps keep it soft and manageable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Definitely keeps it soft.</li>
            <li>An added bonus to it&#x27;s daily use is how soft it&#x27;s made my hands.</li>
            <li>Left my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Only used once so far since I got it, so we&#x27;ll have to see the results.</li>
            <li>Not only does it condition, it also helps wrangle wild beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>For extra kicks, I recommend buying a beard brush made with soft boar bristles so you can brush in the balm as well as neatly brush your beard.</li>
            <li>Be careful how much of it you use.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it before bed at night and wake up with an extra soft beard.  </li>
            <li>My beard naturally grows in 1,000 different directions.</li>
            <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li>lasts forever too - you barely need to use any</li>
            <li>It left my beard soft and under control.</li>
            <li>when applied how everyone on the reviews recommended it barely softened my beard.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd purchase it leaves the beard soft all day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently at 4 or so weeks of growth and this product has tamed the itch and discomfort considerably.</li>
            <li>Only used once so far</li>
            <li>Got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband who&#x27;s had a beard of various styles and lengths for nearly 8 years.</li>
            <li>I have tried the product for the last week and so far it seems to be helping to soften my beard.  </li>
            <li>Goes back to the old days when everyone wore beards.</li>
            <li>Only been using it about a week so far</li>
            <li>barely attached</li>
            <li>I am a male 41 years old</li>
            <li>Once applied, it simply softens the beard and leaves it soft and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li>Been using it since December, and has barely scratched the surface of the product.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful and not apply too much</li>
            <li>It is not wet or greasy.</li>
            <li>Then , you can barely smell it, if at all.</li>
            <li>Guess I don&#x27;t look like a natural red head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a soft, cat hair face beard, then definitely pick up this product!</li>
            <li>As someone with fairly coarse beard hair, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in how manageable and soft my beard feels after just about a week.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews about the scent I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t like most colognes and licorice scents make me nauseated</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not overly scented, has like a stale beeswax kind of smell.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a weird scent</li>
            <li>This is actually kind of a difficult product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your beard will look nice but you&#x27;ll smell like a drunk hobo.</li>
            <li>Less is more (too much is a little greasy).</li>
            <li>Left beard very soft but a little greasy at first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a leave-in conditioner, as the site label asserts, so to really receive the complete benefit of using such a product, it is necessary to put it in sometime in the morning and leave it in for at least eight or nine hours, but I generally leave it there until right before I decide to climb into bed.</li>
            <li>I read that it very much resembles black licorice, which I think is spot on.</li>
            <li>;  I work a tiny amount into my wet hair and it adds just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your hands if you run them through your hair later.</li>
            <li>Second, in either form (oil or solid) the product will coat your fingers and washing does not really get it off right away.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is necessary to moisturize the beard and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does make my beard softer, and as other reviewers have written, the scent eventually fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works, beard feels soft and has a slight scent of licorice.</li>
            <li>However, I discovered that for mysize of beard, I need less than a fingertip&#x27;s worth of balm to work through and condition my entire beard.</li>
            <li>My facial foliage is now so thick and strong</li>
            <li>Takes a few days to get used to the right amount you need depending on your beard&#x27;s thickness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a product like this, despite having a beard for more than 30 years, but lately I&#x27;ve been letting it get a little longer and regular hair conditioners don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had a beard longer than a half inch.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice less itching first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about half way through my first jar.</li>
            <li>for the first half hour or so after applying, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I kept on getting whiffs of a waxy black licorice type aroma...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same tin for a solid near two months and I am a believer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first beard balm I have tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but I hope they do not have such an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>The tin is pretty big compared to two other balms I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Smell is not what some people make it out to be, it is a something different, but it only lasts a little bit and its NOT BAD.  </li>
            <li>If a few hairs decide to pop back out later in the day, or if I just want to bask in the softness and nice aroma, I sometimes pull out the comb and brush it a few times.</li>
            <li>Only tip warm in your hard 1st or the beads wont breaks down.</li>
            <li>Very nice consistency, works well with a faint black licorice scent.</li>
            <li>and putting this stuff on, it gets really soft and much easier to make neat with a little stroking.</li>
            <li>As for the cost being a little expensive, I was happy to see that it is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li>did not expect an odor, and while I don&#x27;t mind it much, I am inclined to try other products.</li>
            <li>The greasiness described by other reviewers hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me, but I would expect that they are just using too much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, a dime sized amount every other day, for this product to work.</li>
            <li>Other than making me oily, I really can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s doing anything for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered in Summer and got a melted mess that didn&#x27;t congeal back right.</li>
            <li>Other reviews are right - this stuff does smell kinda strange.</li>
            <li>It really helps all the wild hairs and areas that grow faster lay down properly.</li>
            <li>When you trim every 3 days its hard to keep it from getting rough and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, no pun intended, I really can&#x27;t tell a whole lot about the product.  </li>
            <li>soft wires thanks to this balm) and only about an inch to an inch and a half in length.</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed with the small amount you get, but after using it for several months Ive become impressed with how long it has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a different in the texture and quality of my whiskers from the initial use, and have continued to use the tin nearly every day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would even get particular patches on my chin where I could almost peel the dry skin off in one big piece.</li>
            <li>The tin arrived really dented on the bottom (almost crushed) but still sealed so not a big deal.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times so far I am definitely liking it.</li>
            <li>beard used to be scraggly and coarse, like an old sailor&#x27;s big toenail.</li>
            <li>Its a very subtle clove scent, you can&#x27;t smell it when you&#x27;re standing by him or he walks by, but when I hug him I can smell it :-)</li>
            <li>I have Firehouse Moustache Wax, live in the high desert, and that stays fairly firm even though I keep it in my pocket all day during the summer.    </li>
            <li>it smells like anise, very strongly, and then faintly.</li>
            <li>its a little greasy when you first put it in.</li>
            <li>Well, at first it is a little moist.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell for the first little bit till it wears off.</li>
            <li>Its a little waxy when it first goes on, but dries a bit over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little off-putting at first if it separates in shipping, but as the info card says - don&#x27;t worry about it.  </li>
            <li>My first impression of the balm itself was a little....</li>
            <li>Its a little oily at first, but after a couple of hours it soaks in.</li>
            <li>However, during the cooling process the ingredients that have a higher melting point congeal together first which requires me to work it a little longer on my beard to get the little wax beads to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long ways, and as a result, I suspect I&#x27;ll easily get another winter season out of my single container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used about a dime&#x27;s worth (for my thick, full beard) and even a few hours later my beard was greasy to touch.</li>
            <li>would not only recommend this, but I&#x27;m certainly buying some as a gift for other beardos.</li>
            <li>I have had a short goatee for a while now, and every time I tried to go for anything longer I wound up trimming it back down to fight those wild hairs that would shoot straight out.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with a strong beard wash, this balm is as much as expected, if not more.</li>
            <li>If you put too much in at once it can make a dark beard look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I had tried basic lotions and other products but this one really  made a difference.</li>
            <li>Over time, the formula has congealed into the more common \\&quot;wax\\&quot; form that you see in their other products.</li>
            <li>I keep my beard 3-5 inches long and this balm just makes it feel so soft and conditioned all day.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only been using this for a few days but so far, he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Makes beard hair soft and keeps the hairs under control when beard is really long.</li>
            <li>she never expected me to call her back.</li>
            <li>I personally have a van dyke, and after a week of using this regularly my beard is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; my wife</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within the first few minutes</li>
            <li>Just grew a beard for the first time a few months ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown out my beard a few times, but this is my first experience using conditioner.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work the first few times you try it don&#x27;t throw it away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using Grandpa&#x27;s black tar soap to wash my beard, but am seriously considering using the Honest Amish soap after trying this product.</li>
            <li>Im curious to see how long exactly this batch will last me and</li>
            <li>but it is still pretty messy.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using it my beard is much softer!</li>
            <li>the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>I think if you can manage it the first few minutes after applying it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>Had some trouble with this stuff at first.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the container was super small for the price tag it holds, but now several months later I&#x27;ve realized a little bit goes</li>
            <li>I do not like though that it does not do much in the way of taming your beard or causing the hair to lay down</li>
            <li>It also make some stray hairs lie down, but does not offer as much control as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>The beard balm helps soften an lays my hairs down, can get greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li>Just like other reviews may have mentioned, this is not to take care of every little stray hair, but more to soften that rough beard and keep your skin from itching.</li>
            <li>I like the aroma it gives off at first when you apply it and that it only takes a little to go along way.</li>
            <li>It is also worth noting that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>using about half of this container which seems to last a rather long time, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price paid, I decided to try a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; beard product also in a can known as &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This does all that - my beard feels soft, if you use the right amount (a very SMALL amount - trial and error helps to find what that amount is for you)</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because I wanted to be able to manage my beard, in particular few of the whiskers which are hard to direct because they grow out instead of down with all the other whiskers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want a pine scent for a 1/2 hour then a soft, supple beard for a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just got to the point where I have full coverage on my face, but I have problems with dryness, itchiness, random stray hairs sticking out in odd directions etc ... after using Honest Amish for a little over a week</li>
            <li>I only give 4 stars because it makes my beard really oily therefor I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure if I&#x27;m using it right, but it seems like it because my beard is luxuriant.</li>
            <li>that out of the way, you&#x27;ll notice right off how small the container is.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is anise, but I don&#x27;t really think it smells like black licorice.  </li>
            <li>previously used oils in my beard and think this is so much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>The product works as advertised leaving the hair feeling much softer and less unruly.</li>
            <li>If too much of the balm is used, it will leave the beard looking slightly oily and over-conditioned in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use too much and it leaves the beard greasy, but any less</li>
            <li>This stuff goes a long way, much longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Im not sure if this is helping to keep the hair in check, and not stick straight out from my face, but this does help to keep the  hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I can smell it for first few min, but wife can not unless she is close enough to kiss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have always been able to grow a thick beard, and having spent 6 years in the military, I was never able to see it come to full fruition.  </li>
            <li>but it dissipates fairly quickly and it (slowly) starts to grow on you.</li>
            <li>I gave the product a chance despite the strong black licorice smell, since I paid a fortune for such a tiny little tin.  </li>
            <li>As far as the claims that it makes the wild hairs lay down....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it is standard that you have to melt the product down every two days to keep it ready for application.</li>
            <li>No more flakes, the beard is softer, a little shinier, and overall in better health than at anytime since I&#x27;ve had a beard, (over ten years now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as I have decided to try growing my beard out, as I normally shave every other week or so.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for the amount you get and doesn&#x27;t last that long after you apply it.</li>
            <li>He uses this conditioner 3-4 times a week and it helps so much by making his beard feel softer and less coarse.</li>
            <li>The tin that holds the conditioner is thin metal and dents easy but not a big deal</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s performance quickly made me overlook this initial singular negative aspect of the product.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty low melting point - which is stated by the company, and they say to just put in the fridge if that happens, but that can be kind of annoying in the summer months when the house is above 70 during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard is coarse but not very long 1/4&amp;#34;-1/2&amp;#34;, however this stuff</li>
            <li>Not too oily, has that odd, not quite herbal, not quite chemical smell shared by dozens of other, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; body products that is neither bad nor good and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different beard conditioners, and while they worked in the short term, this is the only beard balm I have found that leaves my beard feeling soft and itch-free all day long.</li>
            <li>I used to have 6-7 long hairs come off every stroke, now I usually just get the one occassional hair, which means less hair is coming out, and spending more time growing.</li>
            <li>I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much and have a tendency to play with your beard as I do, you will end up making things you touch afterwards a little greasy/smudgy-looking.</li>
            <li>At least post the SMELL ODOR IS HIGH CLOVE OIL!!!</li>
            <li>The balm gives your beard a little shine and leaves it so much softer.  </li>
            <li>My whiskers are a little softer, but I don&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He really likes how little it takes to condition with this product and the smell is spicy, which he likes and so do I...</li>
            <li>Stinks to high heaven!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My beard did feel considerably smoother after about a week of daily applying; but I did also oil my beard with olive oil (balm in the morning, oil at night; my beard is very dry, so I need all the oils I can</li>
            <li>Also, the material doesn&#x27;t melt readily on your fingertips, leaving little tiny bits to melt into your beard.  </li>
            <li>used it for the first time last night and this morning, I have no itch and very little flakes in my beard (</li>
            <li>I do not notice any smell good or bad from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad ;-)</li>

            <li> I have a strong perfume allergy, and I&#x27;m happy to report this doesn&#x27;t set it off.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Amish Beard Balm will make your beard more manageable, smell awesome (but not pungent or strong), and make it look much more well-groomed and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lol Came quick!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and feel like my beard is much healthier and growing better than before I used it!</li>
            <li> What was on one of the pieces of paper that came with the conditioner “made by hand in the U.S.A. for an honest wage” is very important to me to support my fellow Americans, and getting a good product.</li>

            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I ended up shaving my masterpiece, but still use it with a smooth face b/c it hydrates and works great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product out with the sort of amused skepticism one approaches a 5 star rated Amazon product and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting two cans if you own a dog like me.</li>
            <li> Beard will look puppy-free and looking nice for the beard loving ladies.    </li>
            <li> nice smell..</li>
            <li> Conditions the beard nicely, and after using it on my beard</li>
            <li> excellent product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> He loves it, uses it every day now...and it kind of has a manly herby scent without being overpowering or smelling like patchouli.</li>
            <li> she made me look to see if Honest Amish had soap with the scent (they don&#x27;t--hint, hint).  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t honestly expect anything to work 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although another fragrance would be nice.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even go a week before I had to order Honest Amish again.</li>
            <li> It just feels soothing and nice.  </li>
            <li> I have an amazingly unruly beard and although this product does a perfect job of softening the hair and making it much easier to come, it does not help my beard keep shape.  </li>
            <li> However, it does melt nicely with some rubbing.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s promo&#x27;ed Honest Amish to his bearded buddies as I have to my girlfriends with bearded menfolk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using Honest Amish for about 4 months</li>
            <li> It has tamed my unruly beard and turned me from a hillbilly to a trendy hipster.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and doesnt leave my beard greasy.</li>
            <li> Has a nice beard man scent and provides nice shine and softness to the beard.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good, I love when my husband uses it.</li>
            <li> My husband says it feels nice</li>
            <li> Nice feel to skin and mustach.</li>
            <li> Smells nice</li>
            <li> While shopping on Amazon, I happened upon Honest Amish Beard Balm and decided this stuff needed to be in his Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> As a bonus it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard nice.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has saved me from the grips of the persistent itch.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish</li>
            <li> I would suggest using some kind of stiff-bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> and I can notice my beard has a nice shimmer now.</li>
            <li> For the most part it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I did not see many good results.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Honest Amish:</li>
            <li> If you have a longer beard, you might want some kind of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> It helps my beard look, feel, and smell nice.</li>
            <li> It has the added benefit of leaving your hands smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and my kids don&#x27;t complain about my kisses being too scratchy now.</li>
            <li> : this stuff smells really nice, but not overpowering or cologne-y.</li>
            <li> It smooths and softens your beard, gives your hairs a nice shine, and makes it easier to comb and style.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the fragrance fades in an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I bought Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-</li>
            <li> This beard balm smells and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> You need to warm up your hands by rubbing them together before putting some on.</li>
            <li> My dog apparently really liked it and started chewing on the tin.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended the Honest Amish beard balm since I was letting my beard grow out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda of a lavender/licorice smell that I find to be nice and soothing.</li>
            <li> Since I began using Honest Amish</li>
            <li> Ever since I began tending my whisker-crop with Honest A</li>
            <li> his beard has been softer and healthier looking with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have found something that makes it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you, Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, like the smell and how my beard feels.</li>
            <li> This was part of a shipment that was sub par, but once I overlooked the damage, the product stood on its own.  </li>
            <li> Also it puts a nice shine on it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It melted and he has to keep it in the fridge, but that&#x27;s the way it goes with warm temps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know honestly.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds shine to your beard which is nice and</li>
            <li> If you cringe at the thought of wearing even the weakest scent, as some men do, Honest Amish makes an unscented version of this balm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the Honest Amish Beard Balm for my boyfriend and he LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has really helped my beard looking and feeling great</li>
            <li> Wish I had found Honest Amish years ago.</li>
            <li> My beard never looked so good, &amp; seems to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use beard oils and honest amish beard balm.</li>
            <li> This product honestly works the way it says.</li>
            <li> Enter Honest Amish Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone has their own opinion as to the smell.  </li>
            <li> The honest Amish residue on the comb serves as a nice touch up without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a month of using Honest Amish</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a shot and liked the results.</li>
            <li> for the smell, it smells nice and is not overpowering, so</li>
            <li> it all, has a smell that you would kind of expect from a product like this.</li>
            <li> Nice for moisturizing beard/skin.</li>
            <li> He really liked it.</li>
            <li> I now use it in conjunction with Honest Amish beard wax (wax in the morning and balm and night).  </li>
            <li> the smell is rugged, work type and it does smell nice</li>
            <li> absolutely the best product I have used on my beard.</li>
            <li> Will always get Honest  Amish for my beardly needs.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to take it someplace that it might be sideways or upsidedown and warm.  </li>
            <li> Like a bag in a warm car or luggage...</li>
            <li> That took me to an Amazon search which led me to Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t rocket science, and you can tweak your own creation to suit your preferences.</li>
            <li> I would have really liked if it had an added cooling/menthol time of feeling to it.</li>
            <li> My husband love it, smell good</li>
            <li> make sure you rub it in good.</li>
            <li> I liked but this one cannot be shipped to Angola my country.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of the balm and it was not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> After weeks of application my beard now has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Aftermath: leaves you beard kind of shiny but doesn&#x27;t actually...mold your beard</li>
            <li> I even tried the Honest Amish Wax in an attempt to try to get my beard to relax a bit, and that it did not work.</li>
            <li> Heck, he&#x27;s started to talk about wanting to go on a fox hunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish, you&#x27;ve helped us start to rebuild our failing relationship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish beard</li>
            <li> He says it feels nice and does help soften it while growing it out.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> before I gave Honest Amish a try.</li>
            <li> That said, Honest Amish melts in my hand a lot faster and easier than Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> It makes her smell nice.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Honest Amish beard wax as well.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t provide much control, it makes up for it w/ great conditioning power and shine!</li>
            <li> People would for sure talk about your good smell and your beard got shine and beatiful.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and hit is with my wife&#x27;s hair dryer and then put it in the fridge, now its a nice consistancy.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like liquorice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Basically it would start to look kind of &amp;</li>
            <li> Goes on kind of greasy however throughout the day my beard hairs absorb the product so by the end of the day when I feel my beard</li>
            <li> do not work for Honest Amish</li>
            <li> I will have a tin of Honest Amish in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> and I have found the Honest Amish is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, keeps my beard and skin conditioned.  </li>
            <li> This seemed nice, but everything I touched afterwards became greasy.</li>
            <li> So I ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm from Amazon.</li>
            <li> But, I think none of them could probably match the conditioning of all the ingredients in Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> It just kind of sits on the hair.</li>
            <li> I am not one to buy into cosmetic products nor trendy things like this.  </li>
            <li> A nice experiment, this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on October 24, 2014 and honestly could not be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it keeps his beard nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> Has a nice woodsy/licorice smell that&#x27;s not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is good for your hands</li>
            <li> Nice Valentine&#x27;s gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> HONEST</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has tamed my ethnicities quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and blends well.  </li>
            <li> I gave Honest Amish an honest month of use and honestly can say I this product was objectionable for me and my family.</li>
            <li> I have to warm it up before using and it is a pain.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and softens my beard nicely.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My goatee is softening up nicely.</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to have a choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice</li>
            <li> Honest Amish did the trick.</li>
            <li> Help soften the hairs and give it a nice look.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, too.</li>
            <li> But since I started using Honest Amish</li>
            <li> Then I heard about Honest Amish and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> It was nice stuff.</li>
            <li> The balm isn&#x27;t too greasy and it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> Which is nice.</li>
            <li> It feels really nice.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> but it softens and keeps everything nice looking.</li>
            <li> I liked it alot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a conditioner for my beard, it worked nice there...</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has made an impression on me.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with a nice spicy scent.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice shine, which brings out your highlights.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work well, smells nice and lasts longet than i would have thought.</li>
            <li> and it makes a nice oil.</li>
            <li> So I am a fan of the Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> It just seems to had a nice conditioned sheen.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> rest of the reviews are spot on - this stuff makes my beard feel nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Honest Amish RUles</li>
            <li> Thank you Honest Amish, we will purchase this time and time again.</li>
            <li> Plus the emails checking in on their customers are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m telling all my friends about Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> My husband liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked this beard balm for his grizzly winter beard.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell and it did make his beard softer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> A year or so ago I ordered Honest Amish Beard conditioner from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> would and have recommended Honest Amish Beard Balm to friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing to know is that this is NOT some kind of shaping or styling balm.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of a non- factor.  </li>
            <li> Well packaged, good instructions for use, top value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is grainy but not that kind of grainy that you have to rub and rub to disappear.</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s be honest ( Amish )</li>
            <li> Why did I select Honest Amish ?</li>
            <li> My Beard loves Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;Beard™ approved.</li>
            <li> I ended up finding Honest Amish here and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does a good job of taming most stray hairs.</li>
            <li> smell is nice &amp; mellow.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> After some research online I was led to beard balms and eventually to Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> and also it has a nice honey vanilla to it,,, its an absolute the best beard balm</li>
            <li> Not too oily with a nice, woody aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, it makes my beard nice and full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of like a wood shop.</li>
            <li> He said the quality was great and I&#x27;m happy with the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for a great product!</li>
            <li> Nice work</li>
            <li> Honest</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of keeping your beard in check.</li>
            <li> I was recommended Honest Amish</li>
            <li> , I also liked the presentation.</li>
            <li> A nice leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in good health.</li>
            <li> Me personally, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the issue of grittiness that some have commented on, just have to warm it up in your hands before applying.</li>
            <li> Makes it looks nice, conditioned and well-maintained.</li>
            <li> Nice odor and does the trick, though it leaves his beard a bit too shiny for his liking.</li>
            <li> We went on to order beard and body soap and beard oil from Honest Amish after this purchase.</li>
            <li> I alternative between this and my own beard oil.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say the product matched the reviews and recommendations.</li>
            <li> That was a nice side-effect.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s beard is so nice because of use of this product.</li>
            <li> I also noticed recently it is really nice even after I shower at the gym and then blow-dry it.</li>

            <li> The good news is that, so far so good, it seems to work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product at all - the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I have to think there is probably much better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with the results.  </li>

            <li> Do I love it?</li>
            <li> and he loves the smell. :)</li>
            <li> Just work it from the bottom of your beard, going against the &#x27;grain&#x27;, towards the top.  </li>
            <li> In about an hour you won&#x27;t be able to stop touching it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a lot more compliments on my beard for sure.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> More manageable.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but I wasn&#x27;t wooes.</li>
            <li> Makes man-thing&#x27;s beard even more glorious than it already is.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite, though.  </li>
            <li> Smells ok and works ok.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and shine it gives to my beard.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li> had me try some of his which I instantly found perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my brother as a gift, he likes the smell and feel of it more than the beard oils that he has been using.</li>
            <li> more then I do, but</li>
            <li> Its one of the more softening balms.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on well and seems too light to be effective at conditioning and taming a beard.</li>
            <li> I got this for my love and he likes it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this selection, as it does all that I&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;would expect from a top quality moisturizer and softner.</li>
            <li> It does just what is advertised, protects and helps with a healthy beard.</li>
            <li> I think that this product gives a nicer visible result, but what separates them more than anything is THE SMELL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with nothing but the exotic oils, herbs and spices of Amish lore    </li>
            <li> It smells like a handsome man.</li>
            <li> but you wont be able to style it with this stuff</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star because I don&#x27;t think its the best product for me.</li>
            <li> because I know people that use it and love it</li>
            <li> My favorite beard product is Beard Grease from The Beardsmith.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> In 3 days my beard has a softer feel better management.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> The clove is quite prominent.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and gets the job done, my dad really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> I love the look.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it,i&#x27;ll be getting another one soon.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Both are outstanding.</li>
            <li> and she still said, &amp;#34;Eww.&amp;#34; Even more than that, when it goes on your mustache</li>
            <li> So I guess my problem is mostly with the answers that were given by others that have bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The best feature I have discovered about this product is that it is receptive of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I thought as a balm it would have more holding and molding power to keep stray hair from stickout out 90 degrees from your face - it</li>
            <li> I was hopping it would help manage the &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; and the itch, but this stuff was so much more.</li>
            <li> Then a beardless coworker mentioned that he&#x27;d love to have a beard like mine, one that doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li> (The great beard results lasted much longer than some &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> (I get a lot more kisses now).</li>
            <li> He still uses it on the weekends and will use it more often in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Makes my beard smooth!</li>
            <li> many years, I&#x27;ve had a soul patch that was my identifying feature.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten fill use of the product yet, but I have read many reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks, I can truthfully say this stuff works well.  </li>
            <li> Love it...buy it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, my beard is soft and the balm has a nice but not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> It really does make my beard feel great and healthy.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok.</li>
            <li> Got it, tried it, love it.</li>
            <li> I have since gifted it to my brother who also loves it.</li>
            <li> The love the smell of this product and have gotten a number of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i will continue  to use this more and more thankyou</li>
            <li> I have also found if I use it more than one day in a row, I will get acne on my face.</li>
            <li> My beard feels better on my face.</li>
            <li> Makes beard feel softer and more manageable, and gives a bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> Not only the best beard product I&#x27;ve tried, but the best male care product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face and beard very moisturized and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.</li>
            <li> Riveting.</li>

            <li> The aspects I find most appealing about this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realized that I had to take care of my Garibaldi beard to keep it healthy</li>
            <li> After trying more products this maybe the product for me</li>
            <li> til I try more</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a staple in my grooming regimen for sure.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to rub it out into the palm of my hand and then applied to my beard.</li>
            <li> I love my Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> This product works great with a nice natural smell.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have a business beard, so if yours is longer expect to use more than me.</li>
            <li> Love this product and how it softens my beard and controls the flakes.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I think this might be my favorite beard product.</li>
            <li> Yes, and boy was I glad that</li>
            <li> (one of my favs, so gotta love that.)</li>
            <li> For me, I find that it mostly dissipates by mid-afternoon.</li>
            <li> Use wax after for more control.</li>
            <li> Top of the line product.  </li>
            <li> He and his brother love it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m picky about how my beard is groomed and I carry a brush with me at all times to make sure it is.</li>
            <li> My husband is so pleased with this beard balm</li>
            <li> and I can also tell the improvement in his handsome beard.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product so much I ordered the wax by Honest Amish for the days when I need to look presentable.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Even smells better than the one we bought from this company a year ago.</li>

            <li> It is a quality product at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you have a wife or lady friend who doesn&#x27;t mind the beard, but wishes it was better maintained.. this will work magic for you.</li>

            <li> The smell is also quite nice, more of a natural &#x27;outdoorsy&#x27; &#x27;woodsman&#x27; type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mostly because it had so many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> guess I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>

            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> NIce smell, great conditioner and all natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the balm and it feels ok.</li>
            <li> but...it DOES keep you beard hair healthy.</li>
            <li> and I will get more when mine is gone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product....love.</li>
            <li> I love it because its not fruity or flowery or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.)</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the urging of my vegan co-worker and I am pleased to say that I am glad that I caved in to the nudging.</li>
            <li> but it does make the beard more manageable).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased as going in</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments about my beard</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this beard balm.</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many beard products offered on Amazon and in my home town.  </li>
            <li> It made it more manageable and it feels healthier/softer.  </li>
            <li> Balm does help get a better beard</li>
            <li> Someone recommended that i try a beard oil, but i saw the reviews for this product and it sounded better for my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, i&#x60;d say Give it a try, youll love it.</li>
            <li> My beard has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my hands looks better.</li>
            <li> Interesting texture, wax that you melt in your hands</li>
            <li> Okay, stop looking.  </li>
            <li> Stray hairs are more controlled.</li>
            <li> I, however,  was more concerned about how a beard product would smell.</li>
            <li> It is a great product it does make your beard be nice and soft and shiny , but....</li>
            <li> But, like anything you care about, you should invest in it and get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and leaves your beard feeling great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beard balm.</li>
            <li> This is more of a conditioner rather than a balm/wax to hold your beard in place.</li>
            <li> If your ok with having a &#x27;vaseline&#x27; type texture on your face, then no problem.</li>
            <li> but it does keep your beard healthy-</li>
            <li> Okay okay.</li>
            <li> An interesting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> it forms the beads, it is more of a bother to melt in your hand and apply and seems to penetrate less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway since I don&#x27;t have a beard, I can&#x27;t tell you more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I love this product.</li>
            <li> The thing I love most about it is it does help manage your beard.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works best if used daily.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out a beard comb and a beard oil, because of the reviews this brand came to the top of my list.</li>
            <li> but I prefer more of a Pine smell.</li>
            <li> , I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This balm has helped take away most of the &amp;#34;been living under a bridge in my shopping cart&amp;#34; smell ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, smells, and makes my beard look.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> And stray hairs even became more stray.</li>
            <li> I use it on my beard more than once a day.</li>
            <li> he says, &amp;#34;leaves my beard more shiny and manageable...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy for sure</li>
            <li> My beard is a bit curly and this seems to hold it all day in a more relaxed way.</li>
            <li> The scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> (I think she would like it more if I did not force her to smell it when I get out of the shower.)</li>
            <li> ordering more</li>
            <li> It is Awesome, and I have actually talked friends of mine into purchasing some, and every one of them agree.  </li>
            <li> The rest was great, delivered fast and fulfilled its promise.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> Gross, I know, but bear with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Honest Amish beard balm for almost a month now and the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but there are two things to know;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and its just getting better.</li>
            <li> The balm is magic.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> the more I used the better it got.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love the smell.</li>
            <li> It also helps me mold my beard into more of a V-shape rather then</li>
            <li> The customer service as well as the product itself is outstanding, and my beard has never felt softer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions, as you may need to remelt the conditioner if the oils have separated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> so I need something more than what this has to offer.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> and if you wear cologne it will cause a mixture of overwhelming sense of smell.</li>
            <li> softens my beard and makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> OK I suppose, it can be a bit of a nuisance to apply it evenly.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments.</li>
            <li> And as for the scent, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my husbands beard look.</li>
            <li> Overall a great gift!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easier to shape, and feels better on my face.</li>
            <li> This has made my beard more manageable and given it some softness.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the unscented though, as the clovey-ness of the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Some people would love it though.</li>
            <li> I love the smell; it smells like peppermint pine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with the scent, however the wife is not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It applies great on my beard and leaves a nice shine and keeps my beard moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> After it cooled is when I was able to notice the shine it give my beard and how it shapes it.</li>
            <li> I love the product but please lower the price a tad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that reason alone, I sometimes prefer to use it at night, because it does soften the bristles for sure.  </li>
            <li> My daughters now love to fall asleep</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, I like it.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that annoys me the most is no matter what I tried</li>
            <li> I find that I use a bit more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works really well into my beard.</li>
            <li> I thought I would not like the scent on me, but after an hour or so, you get used to it, and it starts to smell more like root beer.</li>
            <li> However, my beard is scarcely more disciplined than before.</li>
            <li> I just found something better.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard fuller and takes the itch out for most the day.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok, but no itching or flaking.</li>
            <li> ADORE the Grandson, not so sure about the beard.....</li>
            <li> It truly made my beard look and grow better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not for sure if I&#x27;m using it the way most do.</li>
            <li> My husband love this.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great procuct and will be buying lots more.</li>
            <li> Friend says it works great to calm stray hair and keep beard smooth.</li>
            <li> fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend&#x27;s beard smells and looks WAY better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I like the beard balm more than the wax.  </li>
            <li> sure if I&#x27;ll ever bother trying another brand if these guys keep producing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my decision.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s refreshing when I smell it on him.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really softens your beard and helps control the curls 😃</li>
            <li> i got some to give as gifts to our friends, love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting composition too.</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff: it&#x27;s got a nice smell (though my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t love it), and it makes your beard smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the way it smells.</li>
            <li> The product does make my beard softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> She seems to love it.</li>
            <li> More women seem to be joining that group.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just a fantastic beard product!</li>
            <li> This product helped for the better.</li>
            <li> Most mornings I wake up and it feels like my face is covered with straw.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, going to buy a tin for my brother.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this Product..</li>
            <li> This makes my beard feel smooth all day!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but . . .</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s more healthy then ever.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> They make my beard softer and more manageable and it has a healthy sheen, almost a glisten.  </li>
            <li> , my beard looks better than it ever has: fuller, thicker, softer and way easier to manage.</li>
            <li> If you wear cologne made by wealthy Frenchists or you get your hair cut once a week and shop for underwear in catalogs, then you probably won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone will be able to tell you whether you will like it or not.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my beard is coming along in leaps and bounds in a controlled fashion.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my beard has grown better, felt better, and looked better.</li>
            <li> I thought it was OK.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a week now and am pleased.</li>
            <li> Some love it</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it more.</li>
            <li> I will for sure order more.</li>
            <li> , appearance has not been the top of the priority list when beards frequented my life, wash, comb, go.........</li>
            <li> I will order more soon</li>
            <li> Love the feel and</li>
            <li> as can I.....softer :-)</li>
            <li> The smell is not something I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It just feels softer and cleaner and it&#x27;s more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Love the look and feel of my beard more than before.  </li>
            <li> Well, after using this for the better part of 2 months, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> It smells manly, not like cologne but more of a woodsy, plant type smell.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> but now I love it.</li>
            <li> ALSO LOVE and</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, kind of seasonal like fresh cloves and honey.</li>
            <li> After using many beard oils, I was worried about trying another one.  </li>

            <li> Not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t feel brittle anymore but closer to &#x27;top of the head&#x27; type hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a beard balm but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>

            <li> enjoying it for now but might try something else (a gel or liquid maybe?)</li>
            <li> Love this Bard Balm ...</li>
            <li> This product seems to be more for styling, rather than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better beard product.</li>
            <li> Love what it does to the beard.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, but a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li> The products themselves smell incredible and my fiance (who has extremely dry skin) is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Smells good and shipped to us right on time.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling , very greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the scent and it hasn&#x27;t really softened my husband&#x27;s beard but the shine is very nice</li>
            <li> As of today, I&#x27;m 14 days without shaving my face and have a nice beard that feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> As of today, I&#x27;m 14 days without shaving my face and have a nice beard that feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, light aroma that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> This product works well, but as I said about the beard wax (Honest Amish Original Beard Wax) - - the texture leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft in a hurry, which is good for the lady folk!</li>
            <li> I bought this as well as the Honest Amish Original Beard Wax as I could not decide which to buy.</li>
            <li> First time really growing my beard out and wasn&#x27;t sure how to best &#x27;keep&#x27; it.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely impressed with how soft and full it has made my beard.</li>
            <li> a suitable replacement for my families home made balm that my grand parents made (Trust me that is a huge complement from</li>
            <li> Pretty good product just wish you would get more than what was delivered.</li>
            <li> not only keeps it fairly tamed, it also smells great and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the scent as light and earthy/woodsy; I don&#x27;t find it to be very strong at all.  </li>
            <li> Light, yet woodsy but definitely not a strong odor at all, pleasant would be the best way to describe it.</li>

            <li> His beard is so much softer and smells amazing!</li>

            <li> Its got a pretty good smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I like Amish Beard Balm pretty good</li>
            <li> But, that it really a minor drawback to this awesome, funky product.</li>

            <li> I feel better about my appearance, and since it is right on my face, I feel better about myself!</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner, leaves my beard feeling very soft, but not oily as many beard balms tend to do.</li>
            <li> Great product love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, nice packaging.  </li>
            <li> Plus it was easy to use and didn&#x27;t have any offensive scent or texture to it, just moisturizing love for my beard.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent is a bit strong and not my favorite (not offensive tho).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it more strongly or fervently.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and came with nice packaging .</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it, but found it to be a bit strong at times.  </li>
            <li> My bearded men love it and the consistency of the product is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Nice mild aroma that dissipates in an hour.</li>
            <li> Directions say beard should be damp, but I have the best results when applying to my beard dry.</li>
            <li> OK, I guess has a rather strong medial order ...can&#x27;t use on my mustache....</li>
            <li> I ended up shaving that beard and starting over because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the shape, and this time I used Honest Amish Beard Balm from day 1.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, more importantly my wife does too.</li>
            <li> and I actually ripped my shirt, which previously fit perfectly, while flexing during the move.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish make nothing short of great products.</li>
            <li> More importantly, the ladies love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell as much as all the guys do, but it does smell good.</li>
            <li> so I dont really have a good opinion, its ok.</li>
            <li> Kind of light but smooth for the beard.</li>
            <li> He has also been able to grow his beard much longer with this balm since it keeps a good level of moisture in the hair and prevents breakage.</li>
            <li> In fact he loved it so much we just purchased 2 more tins of this balm and 2 containers of the beard oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is also not unpleasant (though, not overly pleasant) and goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had heard good things about beard balms in general and wanted to try one, adn this was listed as one of the most popular varieties on Amazon with a lot of reviews.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I originally tried BlueBeards Original Beard Saver and that stuff made my beard flake which I never had before, so i ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm..</li>
            <li> It smells so natural, and feel great.</li>

            <li> MOST IMPORTANTLY, The SCENT.</li>

            <li> Great product, my beard feels soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I assumed this was a balm, a smooth, maybe creamy concoction of oils that would make his beard illustrious and much more supple.  </li>
            <li> After all my beard hairs were becoming rebellious and had to use the balm.</li>
            <li> It leaves your beard very shiny and smells good.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I don&#x27;t mind the oily consistency which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but definitely not the best for it&#x27;s price.  </li>

            <li> Arrived fast with good packing.</li>

            <li> It smells a bit too much like wax, but good stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice product with a clean clean scent.</li>
            <li> Something like cedar, rosemary, and citrus would be more pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> I am unsure after using it for 2 weeks that it is worth the price paid, but it smells nice, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Conditions very well, smells good and applies easy.  </li>
            <li> I have found a new lease on life through the use of this of this this remarkable product.</li>
            <li> My new beard balm beat the bothersome itch and allowed me to successfully grow my whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it melts right in your hand and blends nicely into the beard...</li>
            <li> but this scent is unique and pretty good.  </li>

            <li> Cool!</li>

            <li> I have tried other beard leave-in conditioners and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Cool stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Other than that mishap, This product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product as any of the other reviews will tell you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still works great and smells good, but the products consistency is a little off putting to me.</li>

            <li> Is it a strong scent?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone who uses a stronger soap for face cleaning as a strong soap</li>
            <li> It looks and feels healthy thanks to Honest Amish Beard.</li>
            <li> The strong note is anise--black licorice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deal with strong smell, so I&#x27;ve had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> The scented version is way too strong for me and my wife.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I know there are some sissy&#x27;s saying the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended, even for beard newbies like myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going 3 months strong and there is not one flake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so strong that I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Scent is that of licorice, not overly strong though.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong at all...</li>
            <li> This dryness happens after the strong urge to itch ~ which I also can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold but will straighten out rogue hairs</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it&#x27;s too strong, smells like herbs rosemary</li>
            <li> It turns out I am allergic to this beard balm because the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> The odor is too strong for an office environment.</li>
            <li> I will tell you up front that some people think there is a strong smell to this.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and seemed to work right away; after the first use his beard was softer!</li>
            <li> The smell is very soft and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my beard very soft and shiney after application, and the smell is pleasant and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Really good product, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted something special for the beard hair to make it more manageable over the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, nothing special.</li>
            <li> My beard feels and looks better most all day after applying this in the morning right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fairly strong scent the first time I applied the balm, but I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice scent, a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> The product has made my beard so lush and strong  that it successfully helped defend my face from a grizzly bear attack, I don&#x27;t have a scratch</li>
            <li> When first applying it, it smells kind of strong.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, my beard is growing fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought this, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband loves how it makes beard feel and personally we both love the light scent.</li>
            <li> Made my beard feel amazing from the first time I used it .,,.</li>
            <li> First product of its kind that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have been using Honest Amish consistently for over a year now</li>
            <li> This doesn’t provide hold, but I loved the product so much that I purchased their original beard wax as well.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal!</li>
            <li> The day I received my delivery it was a pretty warm day so the product had separated.  </li>
            <li> I liked it on the first application.</li>
            <li> But with this beard balm, it&#x27;s nearly as soft as the hair on my head, which is just remarkable.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s going to be cool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of Jager smell (you know the liquor), sweet an lemony with a hint of spice.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li> your growing a full beard, do yourself a favor and try this product--you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> Smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> First time using any kind of products on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Its strong for a couple of minutes after you put it on but fine after that.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have a coarse hair to begin with, but this product makes it look almost like a beautiful lion&#x27;s mane, and feel like domesticated cat fur (except that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it doesn&#x27;t get EVERYWHERE, like cat hair does).  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell but not a bad smell..</li>
            <li> Smell is interesting but not bad.</li>
            <li> Keeps beard nice and healthy highly recommended</li>
            <li> To be fair, there are other great beard balms, oils, etc, worth checking out, but this one is a home run.</li>
            <li> WOULD BUY AGAIN IF THE NEW PRODUCT IM GOING TO TRY ISNT AS GOOD.</li>
            <li> I am new to this type of beard care, but this seems like a really good product.</li>
            <li> Upon applying the product I have noticed very pleasant scent; it is a natural not overpowering and very refined.</li>
            <li> Amazing product after first use noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Both work fine.  </li>
            <li> pleasing aroma is half the point, and this balm has a delicious scent; my wife loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent and the pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li> While this product moisturizes and smells fine, I haven&#x27;t noticed either of the effects I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Turns a mangy mutt of a beard into a fine gentleman&#x27;s pride in</li>
            <li> The smell is fine.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted no results, I could easily get that for free.</li>
            <li> Then I comb it in with a fine comb.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> Fine product but the scent is something that needs to be worked on.</li>
            <li> Smells just fine.</li>
            <li> Just began growing another beard bout one month ago, this conditioner smells great and really prevents the intense itching that has stopped me before!</li>
            <li> All in all the product is fine.</li>
            <li> The scent is fine...</li>
            <li> The scent is actually light, not as strong as some make out to be.  </li>
            <li> The company was able to quickly and efficiently correct a shipping order that I had made.</li>
            <li> It is easier to apply, smells good and hold my beard nicely all day long.</li>
            <li> very soft beard..smells good and earthy</li>
            <li> Which is good because I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> But it absolutely moisturizes and keeps the hair looking and feeling healthy!  </li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the Beard Balm!</li>
            <li> Works really well if you love a greasy beard!</li>
            <li> This product really does work to soften the beard and make it more manageable!</li>
            <li> It helps prevent itch from new growth and it helps keep my beard healthy and looking nice.</li>
            <li> This product simply works, it&#x27;s easy to use and,  smells great.  </li>
            <li> Keeps his beard super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> The product itself has a mild scent that is neither pleasant nor particularly objectionable.</li>
            <li> my beard grows in fairly coarse and this stuff helps make it 100x more comfortable and with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a large supply of this stuff, it makes my beard look amazing, gives it a bit of a sheen, and tames my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - my beard does feel softer and more manageable just after the first use!  </li>
            <li> He loves how easy it goes on and has been very happy with how it helps tame his beard and condition it.</li>
            <li> The anise/licorice smell is nice but not too strong, and it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It feels great, gives a nice glossy look and does hold a little.</li>
            <li> it is a bit greasy, and has a unique pleasant odor, but holds the wild hairs in check.</li>
            <li> My husband says he can tell a huge difference since using it.</li>
            <li> I think the combination of the two has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s making a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It sort of smells like bees wax, which is OK, but I would prefer a nice masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Smelled great and left my beard smooth, but after two uses, I realized I&#x27;m probably allergic to it.</li>
            <li> But anyone out there who has neglected their beard or just shampoos and conditions it will probably see huge improvements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in the feel of my beard.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell as well, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny and then more.</li>
            <li> Its grainy when you spoon it into your plam but melts to a smooth oil when you rub it up.</li>
            <li> All you have to do now is comb or smooth your beard.  </li>
            <li> It really feels nice.  </li>
            <li> but after it, smooth.</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish Beard Balm works very well.  </li>
            <li> I must say I really enjoy it</li>
            <li> I have used this on my beard for a few months now and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic; can&#x27;t imagine NOT using it</li>
            <li> Made my beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I strangely enjoy the fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften and relax my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I read those reviews AFTER I ordered the product</li>
            <li> All of this was important to me.  </li>
            <li> I can now fully enjoy my beard in all its heavenly fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves his beard smooth.</li>
            <li> The product melts in your hands instantly and gives the beard a great smell and softness.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Vegan and alcohol free</li>
            <li> I have used various mustache and beard care products, Honest Amish is simply the best.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong, I think its a clean smell but nothing I can even notice after a hour or so.</li>
            <li> Now I enjoy the looks of my beard.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, and silky</li>
            <li> He says it makes his beard shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> it did help and does a great job keeping your facial hair hydrated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) Light, pleasing scent&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin under my beard free from drying out after a shower.</li>
            <li> Thanks Honest Abe</li>
            <li> It is a great product that I would recommend to all of my male friends.</li>
            <li> One issue is the Honest Amish is a butter, so you have to guess how much to use and rub it till it liquifies.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought me this stuff for Christmas and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think its fantastic...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important when it&#x27;s sitting under my nose all day.  </li>
            <li> This stuff allows me to relax because I know its smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I would buy again if available in an &amp;#34;economy&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> Leaves ur beard feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> I love looking at the tin and label sitting on my bathroom counter, it makes me smile.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my beard looking civilized</li>
            <li> Thanks Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed is it has added a great dear of lustrous shine to my red beard!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> above all the product works great, the hairs of my beard became softer.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li> The wax is great, the initial scent is almost that of medicine cabinet, but wears off.</li>
            <li> I would have rather seen a smooth balm.</li>
            <li> So here I am now day 3 of using honest Amish, I gotta say it has really tamed my beard</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic..</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard silky smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the important stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, warm packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the feel of my beard after using Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> but of course fragrance is subjective as others may enjoy it</li>
            <li> Great Balm especially used in conjunction with Beard Oil and a beard brush.</li>
            <li> It has a nice shine and really brings out the color while smoothing it.</li>
            <li> this was scent free.  </li>
            <li> It does leave an after smell - which I enjoy, but my wife doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a perk to having your beard &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; except maybe to draw people&#x27;s gaze to the amazing piece of art on your face known as a beard.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple beard conditioners and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> (so the ladies say), and I really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> I like it and my lady friends enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard glisten and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The oil has a light smell to it that i actually enjoy, and I think my lady friend did as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, but it really doesn&#x27;t condition my beard.</li>
            <li> My wife cannot smell any distinct scent, even when her nose is touching my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for twenty one days and my beard is great to the point where people are starting to think they havent seen me for months.</li>
            <li> I rather enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve grown to like it), and really enjoy using it when I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, use it daily to soften and moisturize my beard.  </li>
            <li> luck will turn around with this product and you may be just as fortunate as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was recommended Honest Amish by a friend of mine and after much debating</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I use it daily no matter the situation.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell, non-greasy, and leaves your beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and enjoy the soothing comfort both my beard and face feel.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I notice a big difference in the smoothness and softness in my beard when I use this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing really helps with the beard itch and for those complaining about the smell you must have a problem with smelling like a man</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things just buy it</li>
            <li> My beard is wonderfully smooth, and the beard dander is but a memory.</li>
            <li> I stared using coconut oil and it works just as well and is cheap.  </li>
            <li> It has softened my really coarse beard, has a really great scent, and my wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> Never used a salve like this, liquifies as described, relieves itch, keeps skin and hair smooth.</li>
            <li> If you could capture the fragrance of heart crushing defeat and mix it with soul</li>
            <li> Thanks Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Gives my beard a nice shine and makes it feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Thanks honest Amish guy</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my hair instead and it seems to moisturize great.</li>
            <li> Light scent.</li>
            <li> The customer service is absolutely fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that actually works!</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I like Honest Amish so much that my urge to try another balm or oil has been subdued.</li>
            <li> Keeps it smooth and in-shape.  </li>
            <li> Provided a nice shine to the beard, but did not provide much control.</li>
            <li> Reduces itch better than moisturizer, though I rarely am bothered by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly I enjoy that my bathroom now smells like it all the time.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction from start to finish and reply to any concerns.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s generally extremely light unless you apply a lot of the balm.</li>
            <li> It does give some extremely light hold, but on &amp;#34;bad beard days&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not up to the task of taming stray hairs.</li>
            <li> and I totally feel I made a great purchase with this.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard feel great and not so coarse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the application, it rinses easily and clean from the hands.  </li>
            <li> Rustic yet precise.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they make the bestimate beard products available.</li>
            <li> and now I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all at Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more intense hold you&#x27;ll need something with more wax.</li>
            <li> Beard is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> It makes my hubby&#x27;s beard soft and smell really good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it two stars because of the smell, but I can see many others like the smell, and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to give it too low of a rating because of my aromatic preferences.  </li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, makes my beard feel soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard nice and soft and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> It leaves his beard soft and smooth, easier to control, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved this gift and I love that he actually uses it.</li>
            <li> makes the beard shiny and soft and has a good scent.</li>
            <li> It makes your beard soft and also has a nice sheen to it, I love the way it feels after being applied.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of brands so far and Honest Amish is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t take much for each use, perfect example of &amp;#34;a lil&#x27; dab will do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The conditioner definitely does its job by allowing me to better control my beard although I think I need a bit longer whiskers for optimum manageability.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the can as sort of soft sandy texture, and you get it good and melty in your palms, and then rub in.</li>
            <li> This, combined with a nice oil leaves my beard shiny, soft, and all extremely sexy.</li>
            <li> Smells good, a bit chunky, but dries clear ...</li>
            <li> This product keeps my beard soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> makes my beard soft and smells good.  </li>
            <li> 1st can arrived this week and so far so good.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend Honest Amish to anyone with a full beard!</li>
            <li> At first I thought the smell was kind of funky, but it quickly became something I stopped noticing.  </li>
            <li> and and I find that the [nice] smell fades away pretty quickly after application.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> When you need to condition the beard, make sure you have the right gear.</li>
            <li> it was to tame a wiry beard, and it works great there!</li>
            <li> awesome product..helps tame an unruly beard (or hair)</li>
            <li> The container will go relatively quickly if applied daily, but it smells great and is easy to apply, unlike the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use it after every shower and my beard is very soft and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> the included instructions (in case it happened) were very useful.</li>
            <li> BTW, the smell is fantastic in my opinion, however it dissipates fairly quickly, so don&#x27;t worry about it being overbearing or too strong.</li>
            <li> With bi-daily use (alternating with mountaineer oil), I find that my beard is becoming more and more soft as time goes on.  </li>
            <li> Awsome really makes your beard soft, left it on over night and results where cool, will be ordering more, great customer service and really nice people!</li>
            <li> Scent is very mild and goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not overly strong and fades relatively quickly (maybe 2 hours)</li>
            <li> This is a good product but in my opinion would be better if less expense was applied to the packaging and more to the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product rubs in quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Looking for a quick easy way to condition your beard?</li>
            <li> The scent it has is very pleasing and very easy to rub in to my beard.  </li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t really bother me, but, honestly, its fairly strong, and you&#x27;re putting it right on your face, so it smells stronger to you than it does to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Helps with the itch, and it keeps my beard looking fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> the Smell can be a bit strong, although not particularly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps the curly part of the beard in check - nice and soft and no beardruff!!</li>
            <li> Honest Amish conditions my beard nicely and gives me a little more control over what it does.</li>
            <li> after a good washing and conditioning in the shower, I rub a little Honest Amish around on the palm of my hand and smooth it through my beard and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to grow a strong manly and healthy beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on the nose, doesn&#x27;t linger for hours, and is actually quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This stuff not only makes my beard very soft, but it smells great too!</li>
            <li> This was the first product I have ever bought for my beard and love it.</li>
            <li> Originally I had a beard and a friend</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give the original a try.</li>
            <li> I feel satisfied with what I got for the higher price</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Originally I was concerned about the smell that others were leaving that it smelled like licorice or anise</li>
            <li> works great for long beards</li>
            <li> it starts to smell pretty ok.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Since my first tin I was promoted at work, my wife got hotter, car got faster, the kids are better behaved, I got six-pack abs overnight</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far with this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in the burlap bag, adds a touch of rugged manliness to it. ;)</li>
            <li> After visiting the gym, which I should mention was my first time, we concluded that my muscles had gained about 20% more strength.</li>
            <li> Scent is OK - not over powering, and fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard for most of my life, in fact my wife and I were married but five years before she ever saw my face without it.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when the first canister runs out.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!  </li>
            <li> My husband was both suprised and excited on fathers day.</li>
            <li> and my wife actually comments on how nice it smells!</li>
            <li> It does not have any significant hold, so don&#x27;t count on it</li>
            <li> Even better would be not buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> of these products are fantastic, I just wonder what the true diffrence is between both the Beard Balm and the Beard Oil.</li>
            <li> Smell is unique.</li>
            <li> My first beard balm and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure at first, give this product some time to work its nourishing magic.</li>
            <li> Has a unique aroma.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference since he started using this balm.</li>
            <li> He was so excited he had to share it with all of his guy friends.</li>
            <li> and I started a friendly competition</li>
            <li> For the balm, the &amp;#34;wet sand&amp;#34; meets tapioca pudding consistency was interesting if not weird.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li> It is &amp;#34;congealed&amp;#34; in the tin at normal room temps, so you need to warm it up in your hands before applying.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if it smelled better, but smell fades after the first 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to get this balm all buttered up in my brown strands.</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use or apply (my first substantial beard).</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sensitive to the medicinal odor, it&#x27;s probably great stuff.</li>
            <li> It had a unique smell</li>
            <li> The licorice smell was not my favorite at first, but it really is mild and light and fades as the hours pass.</li>
            <li> Their scents are great, the oil is light and easy to apply, and the mustache wax is light and soft and comes in an applicator similar to chapstick that can run across the &#x60;stache and eyebrows easily.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a clean dirty-hippie.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard soft and shiny, and the scent is okay, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Also had one lady compliment my beard and tell me how clean it looked literally</li>
            <li> It also works great on dry skin on any part of your body.</li>
            <li> This product feels great and could probably be used for dry areas of skin for the rest of your body.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the product and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> The product does have a light anise scent but it quickly dissipates once the product is rubbed in to your beard.</li>
            <li> Genuine surprise greeted my psyche after I began using a beard conditioner (this is the only brand of beard conditioner I have ever used, so take my review with a grain of salt, for there could be something equally good on the market -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this review isn&#x27;t about how awesome my beard is, the focus is on Honest Amish Beard Balm.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the Leven Rose Beard Oil and my beard is soft and scratch free.</li>
            <li> In the future, I think I&#x27;ll get him one of the Honest Amish products better suited for control.</li>
            <li> This helps fill it out and make it more manageable while bring out more of the natural coloring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells great and also helps with my dry skin that tends to come out of growing beard that can lead to &amp;#34;beardruff.&amp;#34; This stuff takes care of all that</li>
            <li> Makes my beard look more alive and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean, and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Will totally buy more products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Simple, natural, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it, so I need to towel off my cheeks after applying.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it because it keeps my beard looking clean.  </li>
            <li> you have a dry beard with plenty of stray hairs, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, leaves my beard shiny and manageable, definitely a man&#x27;s man product.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish is a great company and Beard Balm will put the moisture and health into your beard that it always loses.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, pleasant initial smell that dissipates, controls beard and softens it as well.  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell blends in well, easy to apply beard not as dry and helps with the&lt;</li>
            <li> thing to note is that the smell, while pleasant, definitely lingers for a bit.</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhere between inoffensive and pleasant -- definitely nothing that detracts from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has a nice scent and is very easy to apply but as far as conditioning and didnt see much difference with my beard</li>
            <li> It is a decent beard balm, the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> The directions that come on the bag very clearly advise that you warm the product up in the palm of your hand until it melts, and then work it in to your beard with your fingers and a comb.</li>
            <li> :) Everyone is happy with the results, and less complaints of scraggly beard now!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how a beard balm can make such an amazing difference so quickly, but the results are right on my face for everyone to see.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was happy with it and wore it daily to keep his beard feeling nice, so apparently it worked.</li>
            <li> If you want it soft and to stay healthy you will order this product!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t amazed, or wowed, I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes right away honestly.</li>
            <li> Very good product for taming a unruly beard like mine, leaves beard a little too shiny for my taste.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly strong right after I put it on, but after an hour or so it wares off.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, easy to apply, fragrance is natural and not heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant exactly, but it smells like anise, which is somewhat like licorice - not my favorite smell but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Not the special day that my wife had hoped and dream</li>
            <li> People with large beards need more product.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and you&#x27;re certain to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does add shine to my beard specially in sunlight which others may not want.</li>
            <li> Certainly beats stinkbeard :)</li>
            <li> Apply to a damp beard, by rubbing it in gently and then comb for a more styled, clean look.  </li>
            <li> The balm easily turns into oil after rubbing it gently between your fingers, and it works into your beard just as easily as a liquid oil based product.</li>
            <li> working pretty good so far.....</li>
            <li> smells amazing, keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be surprised if my beard becomes much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen videos on YouTube and read great reviews about it, but for the short time being, I must say I&#x27;m really liking it alot!</li>
            <li> After one full week people have complimented me on my beard</li>
            <li> :) And I don&#x27;t much believe in ordering things for it.</li>
            <li> All around does a good beard proper.</li>
            <li> It makes your beard more manageable and much softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ok its not a mirmiracle worker, but did work really well for me.</li>
            <li> your beard/mustache is exceptionally coarse or damaged, you may need to give it a good trim to remove the hair that is beyond repair by a product like this.</li>
            <li> But my five minutes of research concluded that this was one of the best-reviewed beard balms on Amazon so it had to be good enough for me.    </li>
            <li> Many thanks to you my bearded brothers.</li>
            <li> A bit gritty but looks good on my beard.</li>
            <li> and it makes his beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my only complain is the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the smell, there is a really nice scent that lasts for an hour or two</li>
            <li> Being the Beatnik, hippie type of dude, I liked the fact it was an all natural conditioner with organic oils and fruit and nut butters.  </li>
            <li> Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell here, but everyone that has been around me while the smell is still noticeable have commented that it&#x27;s a nice earthy, natural smell</li>
            <li> Good product overall, it does what is says is does in conditioning my beard.</li>
            <li> He has since had a trim and looks a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li> Its cool to have a product for your beard</li>
            <li> It was so much softer and much more tamed with those unruly stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I use the excess oil in my hair, and it gives it a nice natural shine/keeps the friz away.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard look full.</li>
            <li> The smell is manly, without being overpowering, and it leaves your beard with a nice sheen and a soft feel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard nice and soft all day.  </li>
            <li> I scrape out about a pea sized amount with my nail, so a can will last a good while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s made out of quality natural ingredients and</li>
            <li> He says it smooths and tames it which is cool...</li>
            <li> This, along with some good conditioner, helps put things back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Well, the answer is a direct result of using Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-</li>
            <li> It just simply feels good on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This makes my beard soft and has a nice manly scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only good on the beard but got rid of my bearddruff.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and it makes his beard nice and soft...</li>
            <li> I have always had a full beard and mustache but it has not always been my friend.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s definitely a beard man, and was looking for something of good quality.</li>
            <li> Made his beard nice and soft</li>
            <li> Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li> beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Also it makes your skin and the hair itself nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, the product does work very well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The next day was good as well.</li>
            <li> That said, I have a fairly wiry and curly beard - not much short of shellac will probably straighten it out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a nice but masculine smell.</li>
            <li> This year, I started researching ways to help me maintain a pristine and full beard, while avoiding the itchiness, and came across this product as a result of reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched over to Beard Brand for beard oil and mustache wax and realized caring for your facial can be downright pleasurable for you and your loved ones.</li>
            <li> Not only does it shine but it feels good as well after getting out of the shower and drying your beard off and putting in the beard balm feels like heaven.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really good, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t blow me away.  </li>
            <li> The true benefit comes over time.  </li>
            <li> 8/10th of full beard.</li>
            <li> After purchasing honest Amish beard balm and a boar bristle brush, my beard is soft to the touch and has a uniform look.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a healthy looking beard.  </li>
            <li> Giving it a five because it’s awesome, nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> If you are into having a sweet looking beard, this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cool burlap bag and a retro styled tin.</li>
            <li> Helps with the beardruff and makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> close friend of mine loved the smell, she encouraged I strictly use this only from now on.</li>
            <li> and I have re-ordered since growing a full beard.</li>
            <li> and so do I. Smells nice, makes beard soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard silky smooth and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> GET A BOAR BRISTLE BRUSH AND WORK A TINY BIT OF THIS GOOD SMELLUM INTO YOUR FACE BUSH.</li>
            <li> but the jar wasn&#x27;t completely full</li>
            <li> If your going to grow a beard, you&#x27;ll need a good beard oil to manage it properly.</li>
            <li> It really does make my beard much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li> Rub some between your palms for two seconds and it completely melts in to a nice uniform oil.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cool...</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and at times it seems to have mind of</li>
            <li> But hey.... when you are sporting a sweet beard what is money?</li>
            <li> The good news is that I am going to make it REALLY simple for you to decide whether you will like it or not!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and keeps my beard much softer.</li>
            <li> Still, I give it full marks.</li>
            <li> I loved using it, it seems the one is enough for 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend decided to let his beard go full Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li> Gives a nice natural shape.</li>
            <li> makes my beard nice and soft...</li>
            <li> It works really well, I&#x27;m just not so sure about it&#x27;s scent...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff and this grease.</li>
            <li> Bluebeards beard saver is a better all-around product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really worked for my beard and that&#x27;s probably more me than the product.</li>
            <li> Product is good for the beard, personally prefer the oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves it :).</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard looking fresh and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Man Beard Oil&amp;#34; which was good but definitely didn&#x27;t improve the health of my beard.  </li>
            <li> experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  </li>
            <li> One month in, not bad.</li>
            <li> BUT FOR THE PRICE OVER ALL ITS NOT BAD, WISH IT WAS CHEAPER.IM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER PRODUCT.I</li>
            <li> but it no not bad in any way</li>
            <li> But, it is not bad and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for in a beard oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but because its just below your nose you can always smell it.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> I loved my beard but felt it wasn&#x27;t achieving its true potential</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, and it comes in a cute little burlap tie-bag.</li>
            <li> Best balm I used hands down, keeps beard conditioned all day long, I will continue to buy products from honest amish</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll never go back to leaving my beard untreated, the scent is a nice easy earthy treat</li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to product scents but she loved this so much</li>
            <li> Since you apply it right beneath your nose, this is an important feature.</li>
            <li> nothing makes her purr like a face full of fur) and does a tremendous job of softening the hair and eliminating split-ends.  </li>
            <li> You can easily smell it within the first hour or so, fades after that.  </li>
            <li> Pretty easy to wash off your hands too compared to others.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and does not linger long.  </li>
            <li> is a real positive addition in the morning after my shower.  </li>
            <li> I suppose to the untrained nose with no other reference to go by, licorice could be the most accurate description, but I assure you, anise is not the primary smell.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my boyfriend as a little surprise gift and it shipped quick and he loved it!</li>
            <li> it was easy to apply and soaked into the hair pretty quickly, but it did leave the skin of my face oily for a couple hours after application.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care much for the price which leads me to look for cheaper alternatives or making my own in large batches.</li>
            <li> Other scents, or even an unscented option would be great.</li>
            <li> This on the other hand works great.</li>
            <li> Smells good and gives my beard a little more &amp;#34;pizaz&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a rather pleasant smell, which isn&#x27;t overbearing and doesn&#x27;t linger for very long in any case.</li>
            <li> He has a very long beard and this product does much to keep it healthy and looking good.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best stuff!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, keeps the hairs softer and more conformed to your desired shape, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any distinct dandruff from dry skin</li>
            <li> I love it, I feel ten times more Amish.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;grit&#x27; will fall off your fingers if you rub too quickly before it starts to melt.  </li>
            <li> He says it can make his face kind of greasy, so he uses only a light amount.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, but go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> A quick tousle</li>
            <li> Smells great, keeps the beard soft and makes it soft if it already isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The main thing that I love about it thought is that it does not make my face break out.  </li>
            <li> Stuff super legit.</li>
            <li> Super conditioning and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will be back for more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Then again my beard is much more coarse than many people.  </li>
            <li> He says the smell is pleasantly mild.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and not too strong, his beard is noticeably softer and less wiry and bushy after two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Love it, smells decent, makes beard look</li>
            <li> The smell is not overbearing and fades quickly and won&#x27;t be noticeable after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I think that the scent will be the main point that will separate people who love this product and people who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and his super curly beard.</li>
            <li> In all seriousness, I love this product and plan to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> We received it quickly and my husband loves the way his beard feels now that he&#x27;s been using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> But the recipient&#x27;s beard has seemed particularly glorious lately, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this purchase.</li>
            <li> This softened the hairs quickly and was not over oily.</li>
            <li> and the smell is fairly mild.</li>
            <li> It smells not girly in the slightest and the scent fades rather quickly even if you don&#x27;t dig it.</li>
            <li> , I get lots of compliments, I love looking at it, and combing it, and washing it, I could actually go on all day about how much I love my beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeably more effective if you use it once you get out of the shower, while your beard is still wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish Beard Balm for over a year now, and it makes the difference between my growing a &amp;#34;homeless beard&amp;#34; or a fluffy beard that has a character all its own.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products, including most oils on the market.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product I was losing because my beard more resembled that of a homeless person rather than sophisticated bourgeois.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terribly bad smell, I enjoy fishing, but it&#x27;s not a smell I want to follow me for the first hour or two of my day.    </li>
            <li> , many of my friends now want this product and i will deffinatly be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> Just a supposed conditioner, leave it in and just makes my hair look super oily and still doesnt make it softer.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was as advertised</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean, good smelling, not super strong.  </li>
            <li> I think its going by quick though.</li>
            <li> This is super stuff for a beard</li>
            <li> I bought this for more boyfriend, who is growing a giant beard but wanting something to soften it up and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> The smell on this stuff can get super bothersome when it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> It helps me shape my beard properly as well as adds a nice sort of light sheen to mine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, it smelled great and made my beard softer almost instantly</li>
            <li> I noticed a softening of his beard hairs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> And it does dissipate rather quickly.</li>
            <li> A mild, earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected Thank You Kindly.</li>
            <li> So I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my facial hair using this.</li>
            <li> It would have been helpful to have more complete information about the variety of products  available</li>
            <li> Now it feels soft and so much more comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It smells like mild licorice and herbs...</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent, but that two disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> A great, not-overbearing smell that only really lingers for a couple hours tops</li>
            <li> I read comments about the odor smelling like licorice, but it&#x27;s a mild smell</li>
            <li> As a final thought, though, I would like to note that the way it conditions my skin and the feel of my skin after a week is actually the best part of using the product.  </li>
            <li> After three days, the difference is tremendous.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda funky but the smell wears off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the highly rated oils on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent or product very much</li>
            <li> I use the palm of my hand to smooth it out and it works very very well.</li>
            <li> While the product did a great job keeping his beard healthy and neat, the smell was a little bit much for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for options to tame my unruly face mane when I stumbled across Honest Amish&#x27;s amazing line of products.</li>
            <li> First, this product does a great job of conditioning a dry beard and skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d try other Honest Amish products for sure.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to order some more of the other products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> and this stuff tamed it in the very first application.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li> I have been using other products for years and this one is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> My beard has never been more full and soft after just one tin of this stuff!</li>
            <li> But after using this product for a short while I don&#x27;t feel any better and realize that a freshly washed and groomed beard is better than a pungent hippie beard.</li>
            <li> Its been around a year and while my husband really enjoyed his Honest Amish Beard Balm, he has moved on to other Balms.</li>
            <li> The product smells &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; but certainly not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I found a different product that was much smoother and more effective for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the full monty, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I carry a handkerchief, because I&#x27;m going to need it with this product all day long.</li>
            <li> Has great smell, and make mustache lay down well..</li>
            <li> It melts quickly and easily when you&#x27;re ready to use it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft all over and under my beard, my beard is soft, easy to maintain, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> but I will say its a high quality product worth trying out backed up by a reputable company.</li>
            <li> She really seemed to have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> I live in a town where organic rules, and I&#x27;ve smelled this smell many times.</li>
            <li> Great scent, makes my beard shine, conditions as advertised, comb glides through with less pulls ...</li>
            <li> Smells great, slight herbal/lemon scent.</li>
            <li> All great except it smells like black licorice.</li>
            <li> My beard is much softer and this is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product to use, especially in the winter as it leaves not only your beard nice soft and smooth, but your skin moist as well.</li>
            <li> Say good by to dry itchy skin under your beard.</li>
            <li> The first hour it seems greasy but after that is leaves a nice aroma and a soft beard.</li>
            <li> It helps control dry skin and smells good.</li>
            <li> She was really against me having a beard at first but now is enjoying it with me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cool idea, but the container is TINY for the price you pay and the balm is kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine arrived, some of the ingredients had separated, but the instructions tell you how to re-mix them (basically heat and shake, I chose to heat it under hot running water, but the instructions also suggest just leaving it on a windowsill, which would also work, it has a very low melting</li>
            <li> so should last a good while on my first canister purchased.  </li>
            <li> It does tame my beautiful beard.</li>
            <li> Really softens up coarse beard and give it s nice shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really just echoing what pretty much most people have said.</li>
            <li> but my hands could use a good rubbing on dry skin or a wipe with a paper</li>
            <li> Although if feels a bit gritty at first, it quickly melts into a nice, smooth oil.  </li>
            <li> I can put my normal face lotion on and then this Beard Balm in my beard and it feels great, leaves it in control and a little shiny (a healthy look)</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm/oil I have ever used so I cannot compare it to other brands, but I can say that it smells good, works its way into your beard easily and does not feel greasy or look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a very large, full beard and this stuff</li>
            <li> ; This stuff is the real deal!!  </li>
            <li> Hydrating, wonderful smell, but a weak hold.</li>
            <li> And over brushing or combing will still cause split ends - it is best to run through liberally with your fingers first and then only brush or comb briefly after the balm has been applied to get everything into place/shape.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> FAST Shipping!!</li>
            <li> But the best thing about this conditioner is it really tames his long beard hairs and makes it look shaped and professional, without an oily or glossy look.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the stellar product!</li>
            <li> So much softer!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this line!!!</li>
            <li> The product seems easy enough to apply, it keeps my goatee more manageable and it has helped in softening a wee bit</li>
            <li> I use a couple different Honest Amish products, sometimes they ship extremely quick and some times it takes a while.  </li>
            <li> I visibly have less wrinkles under my eyes and a nice healthy sheen on my face.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and, although initially greasy, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It does have a scent, though it&#x27;s much more complex than anise (way to go to all the savvy dudes who knew how to describe licorice); it smells like chai and cedar, which I find rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> As you more gifted beard growers may know, this results in a itchy, dry, flaky beard.</li>
            <li> My beard is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions, especially if you live in a warm climate.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeps my beard healthy, smells amazing, and is great for keeping a few stubborn beard hairs down.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling once applied and absorbed to my beard, and my beard has never felt more soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 30 years, and have struggled on and off to find a good leave-in conditioner that does what I want: help keep my beard healthy, doesn&#x27;t add unnecessary complications like styling wax or strong perfume, and helps stop skin flakiness.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it goes on easy and works on softening  right away</li>
            <li> makes my beard feel great, makes my skin a little greasy when i sleep with it in.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit provides a great result.</li>
            <li> It comes in a great little burlap bag.</li>
            <li> Gets a little soupy in the Arizona summers but works great.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in a little burlap bag, which was great because this was a gift.</li>
            <li> Like I said, the longer the more you&#x27;ll need; if shorter like mine, just the back of your nail is fine.</li>
            <li> My beard is so soft, I feel like i have a kitten wrapped in satin wrapped around my face!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure magic, my beard is so much softer already.</li>
            <li> Personally I love the smell of this stuff, nice earthy scent that fades after a little while.</li>
            <li> I realized that the beard balm softened my beard gradually, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference day to day, but when I stopped I realized just how much of a difference this stuff makes.</li>
            <li> enjoy using the product and doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li> overall effect this has on a beard is amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product (I am writing this mostly from my opinion, with a few from him directly).</li>
            <li> Really like the light scent of the oils used and the fact that they don&#x27;t overpower and don&#x27;t linger all day.  </li>
            <li> Works great to keep my rough beard feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell alone is fantastic and the results are fast and outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it smells amazing and it softens your beard almost instantly...</li>
            <li> This has a good amount of hold, but it isn&#x27;t quite enough for my very curly beard.  </li>
            <li> So far he seems to love it.</li>
            <li> just got my Honest Amish last weekend</li>
            <li> leaves my beard nice and soft----and that is a really big change from before when I was not using it.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Smooths it and makes it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Its nice, and I actually like the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and it smooths out your facial hair</li>
            <li> Makes for a soft, sexy beard.</li>
            <li> Has a distinct smell, but it fades as it dries.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> He went to a local barber shop and had it trimmed nicely -</li>
            <li> I love how soft and controlled this makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over beard wax any day, feels a lot more natural.</li>
            <li> and no I am stuck with a pretty full container I will not use</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to putting the Honest Amish Conditioner  in my  beard after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did, my beard is soft, and even a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li> Love the all natural smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I rarely have tangles after using this balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been interested in growing a full grown beard</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold it in larger containers for people with longer beards</li>
            <li> The balm gives a nice sheen/shine to your beard also, which makes it look healthier to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  </li>
            <li> This smells masculine and works better than both.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even know it existed or that it would be useful.  </li>
            <li> , my face-bear is soft and manageable, grows thicker and more lustrously luxurious, it looks roughly 62% more dashing and 100% MORE MANLY.</li>
            <li> came separated, the instructions stated to leave in a window to let warm up and it would reconstitute, this works but only for about a day</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the beard dandruff go away completely, but it does alleviate it for the most part.</li>
            <li> catastrophe can be traced back to my decision to pack Honest Amish in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a beard balm called Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> worth the expense and maintenance.</li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> I love this item and so far it has lasted 2 months</li>
            <li> Get the beard balm, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard feeling extremely soft, more so then any oil I have used.</li>
            <li> She said she also thinks it would have useful application in controlling fly-aways while braiding.  </li>
            <li> She said she also thinks it would have useful application in controlling fly-aways while braiding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for about two months, then hitting the rest button just to keep things fresh.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish will always be part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my voice had gotten deeper and much more masculine.</li>
            <li> I don’t have so many of those wild beard days.</li>
            <li> No applicator needed, and it makes your hands soft too (another added bonus that your lady friend is sure to notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks a lot for making such a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more masculine smelling then it sounds though.</li>
            <li> I really liked that one but only tried this because it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> of the Bay Lime beard conditioning oil for about the same price as the two-ounce Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li> Also, the contents is kind of a gritty balm.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must own</li>
            <li> I decided to try ordering again during the cooler weather and have been happy with this product, so I&#x27;m adjusting my review score accordingly, but still... not worth buying online during hot weather.</li>
            <li> adds moisture and makes the beard more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the beard soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> After using these products my beard is twice as soft and much more tamed.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but its much more comfortable on my face, which has resulted in me growing my beard out to a longer</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Really nice natural oils aroma and feel, not sticky, a real must for the bearded soul.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well, okay then, let&#x27;s try putting some oily stuff that smells like tea ( according to a surprised co-worker).</li>
            <li> I currently have the Honest Amish Bread Oil as well, and I noticed that once you rub the Beard Balm into your hands that it basically turns into the liquified Beard Oil.</li>
            <li> It does keep your beard looking more professional.</li>
            <li> Not rotten, not rancid, just like fresh fish out of the lake being cleaned and gutted.</li>
            <li> And you could probably achieve the same results with a good store bought conditioner (with a smell you really like) without the messiness.ness.</li>
            <li> Apply after shower and gives a great, soft feeling for beard entire day.</li>
            <li> The tin that it comes in is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> I would say this is more for beard/skin conditioning, with a minimum amount of corralling wild</li>
            <li> After reading such rave reviews about the Honest Amish Balm, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though it can sometimes make my face shine a bit, and I&#x27;m using have a fingertips worth.  </li>
            <li> billy goat I&#x27;ve been coaxing to stay groomed this last year and after finding Honest Amish I gotta say</li>
            <li> Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, there was a popular practice of bronzing baby shoes.</li>
            <li> I saw this product and decided it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews, but this stuff warranted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a cross between vanilla and cloves which is relaxing.  </li>
            <li> My beard is red salted with a bit of white and the Honest Amish does a really nice job on it.</li>
            <li> When you scoop it out, it seems kind of gritty and rub it together in your hands</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it and leaves his beard looking very well-kept and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> But overall, a nice product.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I did have some difficulties with on rare occasion is melting the product.</li>
            <li> Starting to become a fan of Honest Amish products ...</li>
            <li> I have been using Honest Amish Conditioner for about 4 months now daily!</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard fresh and looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> As someone who constantly plays with his beard, this kind of got me to stop doing that.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who enjoys the smell of mud and greasy car parts or who inhales deeply the burning lawn debris of your neighbor, then you will probably like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Will update if it is worth fighting the smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural love it</li>
            <li> I think maybe it kinda does, but more of a natural spicy woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, minus the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tin now and it really does improve the condition and shape of a good 2&amp;#34; or longer beard and keeps 1&amp;#34; beards from getting split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard rarely itches since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions that are included in the product are a useful guide to having a softer, cleaner beard.  </li>
            <li> Works nicely, bear is definitely softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I will only use Honest Amish Beard Balm from now on.</li>
            <li> After a week, his beard is really soft, his skin feels much better.</li>
            <li> Also love the fact that it is all natural and made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I like when he uses the&amp;#34; hsi argan oil&amp;#34; I bought for my hair, that made it soft and smells way better.</li>
            <li> I tried different beard oils and conditioners but the Honest Amish Beard balm beats them all.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;ve got some split ends in your beard &amp; it feels more wiry than soft, think about using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I can’t honestly recommend this product based on the price, quantity and lasting effect (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> If the right amount is used, then it will present a nice softness to the skin that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a grainy consistency which no one else seemed to have mentioned in the comments and had a very distinct licqorice odor, which again want really mentioned in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but quickly melts as long as your hand is warm.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a higher rating except that it really has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> But then again, why mess with the integrity of a good product, right ?!</li>
            <li> I respectfully disagree with other reviewers who have stated that the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been super impressed with the product, and two months after buying, and using it daily for a month and a half, I&#x27;m still not halfway done with the tin.  </li>
            <li> The scent fades pretty quickly anyway, so it shouldn&#x27;t noticeable to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have their nose buried in your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well it was too hot when it was delivered, but luckily they warned me before opening</li>
            <li> First week, there was a tremendous amount of growth.</li>
            <li> it melts pretty quick</li>
            <li> It is a noticeable (but not overpowering) scent when first applied, but that wears off fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have kind of an an unruly yet thin and patchy beard at the best of times, and it is usually pretty scratchy and coarse.  </li>
            <li> The Honest Amish smells like a spicy gumdrop at first, and then later on it kind of reminded me of a ripe fruit scent of which I&#x27;m not a big fan.</li>
            <li> I am considering some of their other products since this one has been so good.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get too excited and use too much.</li>
            <li> Very dude friendly stuff.</li>
            <li> The tin came in a cool little burlap sack packed with beard care instructions (which I particularly loved, I think that&#x27;s a class act thing to include).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crunchy granola at all and don&#x27;t give a rip about its ingredients other than it has the butters and oils I read are good for beards.</li>
            <li> It smells great; It is easy to apply with no messy, oily fingers afterwards; It lasts a long time in the beard itself, even after a shower; You don&#x27;t need a lot of the balm to apply to your beard; And it makes my beard super soft.</li>
            <li> Out right majestic.  </li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> , it melts right in your hands, and it gets rid of the beard itch.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a day right after I shower with a beard comb to help even out the application of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Treat your face pubes right and get this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right below your nose.</li>
            <li> So that part of this product is right on the money.</li>
            <li> and I could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li> so a post service beard was just so right for me.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived melted, but don&#x27;t do what I did and use it right away.</li>
            <li> softens my beard right up.</li>
            <li> This has just the right amount of hold to let me style it like I want.</li>
            <li> Once I applied it to my disheveled beard I knew right away that things were going to start looking up for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is right for you, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, a beard massage.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> then right out of the shower</li>
            <li> I put it on right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> then maybe this isn&#x27;t the right beard balm for you.</li>
            <li> He noticed a difference right away with his beard softening and not being as scraggly.</li>
            <li> You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its a very light hold, just enough to reign in some of the wild hairs that pop up from time to time and allows for some very light shaping.</li>
            <li> Product separates easily -- came separated even when new.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; makes the beard look great, but I&#x27;m not Amish yet :(</li>
            <li> It smells pretty much like every Amish crafty type store I&#x27;ve ever been</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance but really after the first couple times I didn&#x27;t notice the smell and you can&#x27;t notice from a distance, just up close.</li>
            <li> First off when my honest Amish beard balm came in it was all melted and gross.</li>
            <li> First and last time I buy from Honest Amish,.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt or seen an long term benefits to using this cream, but it works great for a clean and healthy look for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Honest Amish was the first beard balm I used when I started my beard several months ago.</li>
            <li> Beard very soft, easy to manage and comb</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using balms on my beard for about 3 years now and there is a really distinct line between a balm that smells good and a balm that gives the guy 2 cubicles down from you a headache.</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice, smooth beard and keeps the hairs down after I brush it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this and the fact that it is all natural is a huge selling point for me, but I found a local company that I think is better.</li>
            <li> I use this by itself daily and it really keeps my beard nice, controls split ends and gives a nice shine especially when outdoors.</li>
            <li> Softer beard, less tangles, and nice and smooth surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different beard oil and was less than impressed and it gave me a rash in fact.</li>
            <li> The dry skin/dandruff is gone and my beard feels a lot more smooth than before.</li>
            <li> Its great on my sensitive skin as well, doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything for that matter.</li>
            <li> after regular use my beard looks and feels super healthy.</li>
            <li> Plus I love the smell and so do the woman lucky enough to get close to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li> I was looking at other beard oils to get and this had the most reviews and most positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend, I will likely get more but just use in moderation and when your beard is wet and seems good to use.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok, but if you dont like scents in general, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> It works great (once I get past the graininess).</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for a first time buy.</li>
            <li> In short, it has made my beard look a whole lot better and healthier!</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell really and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I chose Honest Amish and after a week of use I&#x27;ve been wondering why I took so long to start using a beard balm.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more once I run out, which is taking surprisingly longer than expected.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little unusual, but not unpleasant and fades quickly, leaving your beard looking and smelling good.</li>
            <li> A must-have for a long, strong, full beard!</li>
            <li> has a pleasant smell right after application that dissipate in a few minutes...</li>
            <li> What was once a mesh of strange hair now looks healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li> You can actually use certain oils (like all the ones contained in Honest Amish) on your face to moisturize (it wont cause breakouts) instead of lotions with who knows what in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the natural feel and scent, but it certainly is a pain to fully rub in.</li>
            <li> product is practically solid when it arrives -- like a bunch of very fine pellets pressed into the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little more production, since it is a salve, not an oil, but the results were phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but was hoping it would condition a little better.</li>
            <li> I only use enough to fit on one fingertip, and it successfully covers my whole goatee once it melts.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting texture and the smell is nice but hard to describe and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice and subtle, not too strong!</li>
            <li> They certainly made a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, really makes the beard softer with a non-greassy sensation always you dont abuse during daily application</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, keeps my beard moist, manageable and almost completely flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all as the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine without being overpowering, and also has a nice natural scent.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the Heavy Duty balm better and the control is better.  </li>
            <li> all natural, organic BS, this just means that the product separates easily, so you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am prime so shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, we saw a nice difference in texture by the second day</li>
            <li> It helps tame hubbies beard and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth the price, quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Has a very earthy but mild smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard incredibly soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> If course I was not expecting strong smell seeing how this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> or so I decided it would be best to just toss it and work on regularly combing it everyday.</li>
            <li> I give it two stars because it&#x27;s made from all natural materials which is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice and the packaging neat, but it left a very greasy feel to my beard that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Well i&#x27;ve always had facial hair and it really didnt cause a problem, but since using Honest Amish Beard Balm my moustache has gotten softer and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> My beard is very coarse, and Honest Amish really did the trick.</li>
            <li> - Honest Amish tops the list.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well - even easier to use on daily basis than the beard wax.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the smallest to the biggest of beards, When I put in the second time my friend finally notice it and said damn that beard is shinny.</li>
            <li> and I really like the mild anise smell.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and really helps to bring out the colors and nuances of the beard.</li>
            <li> This was my second balm that I&#x27;ve tried, after being quite happy with Irish Beard Balm, but wanting to see what all the scuttlebutt was with the Amish brand.</li>
            <li> The aroma made me think of a sawmill, not unpleasant, but not as nice as some other balms.  </li>
            <li> I Like the way it makes my whiskers feel, and also a very subtle aroma that is most pleasant.</li>
            <li> got the best of me, so I ordered this a few days prior to this review.</li>
            <li> A good product, you have to work it between your fingers to break it down to a oil/lotion consistency as it is a bit clumpy at first.</li>
            <li> Calms down the wiry hair around the edges, smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Honest Amish beard lube is like taking Moby Dick by the cojones and single handedly felling the tallest redwood in California.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite obvious to people near you where the smell is coming from, and overall I do not think it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed as I really like the Honest Amish Beard Wax: great stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is addictive, the conditioning is just right, and my beard looks and feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> I purchased more right away - the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version this time to see if there is a big difference..</li>
            <li> Have used several of their balms/waxes and they are clean, and do the trick to keep your beard looking fine.</li>
            <li> This delivers as advertised - light but effective at helping to control your beard without looking slicked down  - manly smell, softens beard and really helps reduce itching.</li>
            <li> If my beard ends up dry from some reason I will run hot water over the side of the can to warm it up to liquid then put a lot in.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s sort of a spice-like scent when I first put the balm in my beard; it fades fairly quickly (or my nose gets used to it fast).</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply with no mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint but smells so masculine, clean woodsy, and just wonderful manliness to this sensitive schnoz!</li>
            <li> I like this beard balm very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what people say, the scent is very very</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell very much but the conditioning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for that very much.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell with a little bit of licorice thrown in.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products for my beard and this one is the easiest and most comfortable of all.</li>
            <li> You beard will instantly look more vibrant, clean, and refined.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Just a little of the balm and a good comb</li>
            <li> It does smell interesting - nothing strong that would be noticed by others, but a slight anise scent is in the balm.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have a full beard.</li>
            <li> It has the best smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Was able to grow one and did early in high school and have had one ever since, I&#x27;m 58 now.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t  until my youngest son started growing his bread, very thick and full, father&#x27;s proud moment, and we started talking about it care</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, really like how it makes the beard feel (has a slight hint of black licorice scent to it, which I typically don&#x27;t enjoy, but for this concoction it has grown on me)</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab and it works great to make your beard smooth.</li>
            <li> I live in southern California, and when I first received the product, it included a warning about the products consistency due to shipping temperatures which made perfect sense to me.</li>
            <li> After my first use my beard was a lot softer and looked thicker.</li>
            <li> My dog really loves me!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, on my second can.</li>
            <li> Got this and a bottle of Beard Oil via Amazon for my first ever beard.  </li>
            <li> First time growing beard, and</li>
            <li> This winter is the first time I grew a beard.</li>
            <li> and it definitely makes the hair look and feel healthy as you gain some length.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard conditioner</li>
            <li> This balm does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> first time beard grower..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried beard oils after I ran out the first time; nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Holds very Well!  </li>
            <li> This is my first use off a beard conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> This is my first adventure with a beard balm.</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis and because of this product have received many compliments of how well maintained my beard is.</li>
            <li> This would be the first beard product I have used, I like it.</li>
            <li> (Its my first beard since youth and 20 years of never shaving it off, so of course</li>
            <li> What exactly is a &#x27;balm&#x27; anyway?  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see how this would infuse into my beard.  </li>
            <li> I can think of is because of the straightness, thickness, and blackness of my beard, the balm can make it glisten in direct light.</li>
            <li> 7 days, 14 days, 6 weeks, all soft and itch free with just a dab of beard balm.</li>
            <li> I could see if you were prone to acne this could exacerbate it, since it is pretty oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have the tangles and the constant drying hair and breaking any more.  </li>
            <li> have multiple items from them and satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> but while it looked handsome, I still found it to be closer to a Brillo pad than something I wanted to cuddle up next to.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this balm!</li>
            <li> The first time I&#x27;ve used this brand.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I bought this to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into purchasing beard product, and I almost gave it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my second can</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on my beard</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I used the unscented first</li>
            <li> At first I did not attribute the beard balm to the cause of the break out</li>
            <li> It made his beard oily and funny smelling but neither of us could feel a difference  even with months of continued usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Just freaking stellar.</li>
            <li> Thanks you Amish fools!</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I could tell a difference in how my beard felt.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, but it grew on me a bit.</li>
            <li> I grew my first beard this winter and the itch was killing me.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see him like his &#x27;ol uncle waxing up his big beard. :)</li>
            <li> importantly, the fragrance is fanning from all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> There are no fake fragrances or colorants in this beard balm.  </li>
            <li> Repeated this test a third time to make sure it was the balm.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about dropping $15 on a beard product, however, after using this balm for 2+ weeks, I am happy I did!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; it won&#x27;t make curly hair straight!  </li>
            <li> We tried the process of elimination to determine the cause and sure enough, it&#x27;s the balm.  </li>
            <li> My first order of this product was an accident, one click oops.</li>
            <li> No itching and softens very well!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do for your beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> It is a abrasive to my SO, so I thought I would try a beard care product to see if it would soften my beard and possibly promote some more even growth.</li>
            <li> , it just don&#x27;t have the consistently for hold,  its not waxy,  </li>
            <li> you wont know how much your manly face beard needed this until you go without!  </li>
            <li> Can be a bit oily for the first hour</li>
            <li> First off, my wife is not a fan of my beard.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it.</li>
            <li> First, backstory.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely going to purchase this again!</li>
            <li> you buy it during hot temps place it in the fridge for 30 min before use.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t willing to admit to a stranger that this was a product for my &#x27;beard&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Be careful when opening the container for the first time, it may have melted and be in liquid form if it was delivered on a warm day.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> Spreads pretty evenly on a semi-damp beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A noticeable benefit in both &#x27;feel&#x27; and appearance from first use.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit funky at first ...</li>
            <li> Given how simple and cheap it is to make your own, I will probably be going that route for future beard balm needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first product for my beard</li>
            <li> This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my beard smoother and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My beard is pretty curly and this helps flatten it out.</li>
            <li> Will leaving your beard looking shiny and healthy, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;m smelling his beard all the time ;)</li>
            <li> Give this balm a go ;)</li>
            <li> First, the scent.</li>
            <li> I think, personally, the top note is clove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same tin for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same tin for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this beard balm quite extensively.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but definitely not something you want in your nostrils all day</li>
            <li> This product was my first crack at a beard conditioner/oil</li>
            <li> My first beard balm</li>
            <li> First time using beard balm.</li>
            <li> my beard simply looked thicker and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I realized women seem to be following me around more.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be buying more</li>
            <li> You will notice the beard improvement on the first application.</li>
            <li> I think I would like it better with short beard, but if your longer than a couple inches you need something heavier.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, and I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes it feel softer and it&#x27;s more manageable to comb through.  </li>
            <li> First time purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first shot at having a beard and after 4 months without shaving</li>
            <li> This is the first beard product that I have bought and so my review isn&#x27;t a comparison but just on my experience.</li>
            <li> First of all my wife loves the smell and texture of my beard now that I am grooming it with this product.</li>
            <li> This balm took my beard from Hobo to Hero in my first application.</li>
            <li> My beard also grows more evenly and fuller when I&#x27;m using this daily.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future..</li>
            <li> For first time beard oil / balm buyers I would pick up some for sure or something similar like cornwall beard oil.</li>
            <li> Now, roughly a month into my Honest Amish experience, I can&#x27;t imaging using anything else.  </li>
            <li> Has a barely detectable natural kind of scent once worked into beard.  </li>
            <li> For my circle-beard, I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li> be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a really rough beard and this stuff does a nice job of making it soft, holding it in place and giving a light shine.  </li>
            <li> I grew my first beard this winter.</li>
            <li> I received my first tin of this stuff yesterday and applied it after showering.</li>
            <li> only wish the manly scent lasted longer because I love it</li>
            <li> I figured there was no way this stuff would last me more than two weeks, a month max, so I used it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li> Hey Guys, So I would consider myself an avid beard grower.</li>
            <li> At first, I was drawn to the novelty of the brand, packaging and description.  </li>
            <li> In fact, his drinking and smoking has cut back and he&#x27;s being a lot more polite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made of butters and oils, so if you overdo it, you&#x27;ll be a bit oily, but it absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> The price was on the higher end, but with the size of the can given the amount used per apply, it is well</li>
            <li> Non of the people around me commented on its existence even when I asked if I smell funny</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it exists once you</li>
            <li> Or, just apply balm daily till your beard soften at a longer length allowing better combing</li>
            <li> Thanks guys...good stuff!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this complaint is nit picking a great product.</li>
            <li> Takes most of the itch out of initial growth.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> &quot; -- pretty girl in mid-kiss    </li>
            <li> Thanks for coming through, Amazon!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for extra control and sculpting power, I recommend their Extra-Grit product which is more like a wax.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was a hot day, so the jar was a puddle of goo.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product; the fact that it is hand made with natural product is very appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Not only does his beard feel softer, it also looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li> and I have only been able to use it once</li>
            <li> I just recently retired from the United States Marine Corps and as most veterans do, I am growing my post service beard.</li>
            <li> First, I am funny about smell.</li>
            <li> the age of 53, this is my first beard.</li>
            <li> It reduces itch, makes my beard softer and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I will be sure to post about it here for any future buyers.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The oils don&#x27;t really seem to be absorbed by the hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have actually been able to grow my Beard out.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the most moisturizing beard product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm!</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse, wiry beard and nothing I&#x27;ve used has been able to get it under control.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend thinks it smells funny</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and upon first use</li>
            <li> After using the product my beard responded to a brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after the first couple applications.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have some of this that was never too hot.</li>
            <li> I think if you order this in the middle of winter it may be OK.  </li>
            <li> The first issue is the &#x27;balm&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I suppose it could use a higher beeswax content.</li>
            <li> That was my first impression.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the container the oil had separated from the cream which gave the product the consistency of grits.</li>
            <li> but its changing chemistry and messiness will most likely keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again!</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more of this.</li>
            <li> Even next day you are still OK.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my beard look and feel fuller and shinier!</li>
            <li> I just started growing my first beard this winter and realized as it grew that I would like to maitain it a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say about a dime sized amount should be more than enough.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> He digs it, because it makes his beard pretty.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is one of the first beard products I have purchased or used.</li>
            <li> Makes his beard very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into beard balm.</li>
            <li> It makes a creamy oil when warmed up in your hands and leaves your beard pretty oily throughout the day and builds up even more so during a week of use unless you shampoo your beard daily.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;i alternate between this and beard bomb.</li>
            <li> I picked this at random and am pleasantly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> im sure you were in the same boat I was.</li>
            <li> So i got this and the first time i used it</li>
            <li> My beard is shorter and my hair pretty course.</li>
            <li> if you want a simple, one product beard care regimen, you won&#x27;t find any better than this.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Smells very organic!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of work to get it all melted and consistent, but when you finally have, it&#x27;s probably my favorite beard product out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and have never had more than a 3 day growth of facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ran out of my favorite shave soap before and had to fall back on bay rum scented shave soap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from this product and it has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from this product and it has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get through that itchy phase finally.  </li>
            <li> It DOES smell great, at least to me.</li>
            <li> The described scent had me interested.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> last thought is is an oil so make sure</li>
            <li> My first beard conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li> This was given as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It also, after extended use, leaves your beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It got delivered on a hot day here in co-cal</li>
            <li> SILKY, SMOOTH, SOFT, MANAGEABLE, NO TANGLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference the first day I put this balm in my beard.  </li>
            <li> When both of those were used up I ordered more of the regular beard conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I run out, I will absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Helped me grow my beard fast!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> I first tried it</li>
            <li> It smells EXACTLY like that.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fantastic sale, all the ingredients except the kitchen sink, and, a money back guarantee, not to mention the cool packaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> And I thing my stubble beard feels the same too. :)</li>
            <li> its my first beard balm</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> From the first time I applied it, the itching issue disappeared.</li>
            <li> Definitely does what it says by making your beard smooth and soft, and appear much more groomed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown a beard and it helped ease the itchiness at first.  </li>
            <li> I had never grown a beard long enough to require any maintenance, but I must say this stuff worked great.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommending :-)</li>
            <li> It has a pretty organic smell.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of any type of balm.</li>
            <li> far as I can tell the balm doesn&#x27;t even achieve its primary purpose of being a conditioner - beard is still course and wiry,</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff</li>
            <li> was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re growing a beard for the first time I recommend you buy a beard comb along with your balm.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t just stand out, it explodes in the sun light and has completely caught some people off guard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I get stopped on the street, ogled on the train and put in precarious situations by the opposite sex more often than not (to my wife&#x27;s vexation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> packaging it came in is pretty</li>
            <li> I keep a short beard (most would consider it stubble)</li>
            <li> ; beard is definitely softer and more manageable after I use it.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first time in my life I grew a beard with no itching at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a product for my beard.  </li>
            <li> I love my beard, have had it for over 1 year, but it was getting to the point that I was fed up enough to consider shaving it off.  </li>
            <li> My son also told me I smelt funny.</li>
            <li> Conditions very well!</li>
            <li> I was given my first container by a friend.</li>
            <li> We will definitely order more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this recently, and was really pleased with how it felt in my beard.</li>
            <li> I personally also enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li> That said, this is my first time growing a beard - and I am 38.</li>
            <li> For a better value and similar experience you may want to consider Burts Bees salve.</li>
            <li> First, the scent.  </li>
            <li> This is a four star review and not a five star review simply because I am not in love with the scent and the consistent coarseness of my beard even after a week of application.  </li>
            <li> when I wore it around her for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this product</li>
            <li> I will know more later.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a good month everyday.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the heavy duty version.</li>
            <li> but all I did was place it in a cup with a little hot water and then let cool and was good as new.</li>
            <li> Makes my Large Goatee soft &amp; easy to run my comb thru.</li>
            <li> more than three and a half stars reason behind it is because after a while it would start smiling more like popcorn in the Apple Cinnamon that I got but it stays with you all day s and during the shipping it did not get watery which was great.</li>
            <li> Always arrives quickly after order, one can lasts about 2 months for me, l highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely clove fragrance that is masculine and clean without being too strong and which fades to a barely noticeable scent not long after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is definitely more comfortable and less itchy.  </li>
            <li> It gives your hair a slight sheen and has a great masculine</li>
            <li> However, it has more of a scent than expected and  did not dissipate as quickly as hoped.</li>
            <li> Just the right consistency for applying it to my beard without putting on too much.</li>
            <li> I looked to Amazon and ordered the two beard oils/balms with the highest ratings to compare and can say that I prefer Honest Amish balm over the other product I ordered that had very slightly higher</li>
            <li> I have tried commercial beard oil (it was ok) and a cream hair conditioner that I actually leave in (works the best but doesn&#x27;t last long).  </li>
            <li> but I actually like it for the soft hold and use it on the hair on top of my head!</li>
            <li> I have tried other beard balms and this one is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good , not strong smelling</li>
            <li> It smells good but is not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of softening your beard but won&#x27;t help tame it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that left my beard feeling very soft in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of responsibility immense enough to wield the great power this product will bestow upon you and your front-mullet.  </li>
            <li> It does at least smell very nice</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d say is be careful using too much, but this stuff is by far the best beard balm I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Being that my beard is right under my nose, I anticipate it only smells strong to</li>
            <li> Would recommend for any true man with a wild beard!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like some other products and I&#x27;ve received plenty of comments about how nice my beard looks ever since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It contains natural oils and butters to create a unique moisturizing balm that moisturizes well without making my beard too greasy like beard oil.</li>
            <li> 10/10 will be buying again along with other products by Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> soft facial hair allows longer growth which causes more full beards</li>
            <li> Also, check out the Honest Amish Etsy page for all of their other products.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand over the other popular brand I bought for its smell and texture.</li>
            <li> Perhaps in time the occassional itch/dryness will be completely gone and my beard will become more full, as the balm indicates it should do, but only time will tell</li>
            <li> I was worried the smell would be strong after reading the other reviews, but I would say it is very mild and shouldn&#x27;t keep anyone from using it unless they&#x27;re very seneitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Now it is smooth to the touch, exudes a rich but not overpowering scent of majestic herbs and lavish oils while flaunting a sumptuous shine to complete the mesmerizing trifecta of beard splendor that falls just short of hypnotizing any whose gaze may fall upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great - light fragrance, not cloying, faintly of anise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but great.</li>
            <li> I have a very curly and wiry beard, this product makes it soft, smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> It makes my beard look fuller, clean, and brings out all my natural colors (I have a rainbow beard).</li>
            <li> Leaves beard soft and clean feeling not greasy or slimy</li>
            <li> My beard is just soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard soft and clean looking throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Does a lot to keep my beard soft and clean, as well as keeping skin moisturized underneath.</li>
            <li> Currently in the process of purchasing a second tin for my husband, who LOVED this beard balm.</li>
            <li> His beard is not only stronger but more gentle on my face😀</li>
            <li> After you put it on, it does seem to soak up very well such that you don&#x27;t have any meaningful residue on your beard.  </li>
            <li> It keeps his beard soft and his skin underneath the beard healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> Conditions well, and the absolute only knock is he wishes there were more scents..</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it, and will definitely getting more, when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Second, it really does condition your hair, and even more, your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the product-it definitely made his beard softer, although he didn&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they stuffed cherub angels in the tin that blow kisses to the strands of my beard all day long.</li>
            <li> for several hours my beard looks very shiny and healthy...</li>
            <li> It is a good little product to enhance his beard!</li>
            <li> Before I was using pure jojoba oil, and that worked pretty well too.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time not leaning in to get closer right after he uses it because he smells and looks so dang good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
            <li> While it certainly does have a unique smell to it, the smell is natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves my husband beard super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and keeps my beard soft and tame.  </li>
            <li> What was dry grey beard now shines fluffs out makes skin feel great and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My girl likes the feel and smell of my beard now and constantly likes to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and I noticed a difference immediately after the first application.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was surprised by the size of the container, but quickly learned size isn&#x27;t everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a couple hundred dollars trying to find the perfect products to tame the beard.</li>
            <li> The reviews about this product are insanely positive.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought I had found the cure with this balm.  </li>
            <li> After seeing all the positive feedback about this product I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> Agree with pretty much every positive thing that&#x27;s been written.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is gently rub it between your first two fingers of each hand for about 10-15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever grown a real beard</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with my first application, I am immediately awakened by the intense woodsy, manly fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help pretty well, and I do really like the feeling of putting it on each morning.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s mixed in with a bunch of other really great manly smells</li>
            <li> Love the smell and will continue to buy this product for as long as I have a beard</li>
            <li> i love it and will continue using it for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very*) picky about scents</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used way too much and my beard was greasy.</li>
            <li> and I really like knowing just what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will continue to use it, as long as I keep my beard.</li>
            <li> I pretty much think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li> I put a surprisingly small amount in my beard in the morning and am good the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells good, not sure why people are complaining about that shiz.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel soft, moisturized and non greasy for a full day.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice but subtle musk scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - only takes a little to add more volume and control for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it feels nice once rubbed in and the scent wears down after a couple of hours (or</li>
            <li> It still seems effective but I have to work at the chunky bits to break them down.</li>
            <li> This is not a substitute for beard wax and will not make truly rogue hairs lay down however Honest Amish makes beard wax as well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my beard oil to arrive and I am excited to put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and though the container is small, you don&#x27;t need to use much at all unless you have a ZZ Top style beard.</li>
            <li> Anybody willing to do a little research will find lots of info on how to make your own beard oils.</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish canister arrived in a small burlap sack, but the can was pretty well dented!</li>
            <li> scent is hard to describe, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> The bread looked healthier, smelled great and a few days later felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes his usually abnormally coarse bead very soft, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews hearing the smell was amazing and all this other stuff I was expected something much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this balm for about a month, and it has completely transformed my beard from a frizzy, uncontrollable mess into a beard that gives me confidence and looks pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> got this balm for my boyfriend just for something new and fun to try.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my beard slightly softer but nothing amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and helps with the coarse hairs and the itching of the dreaded neck beard.  </li>
            <li> The mild, natural scent is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with a beard, and let&#x27;s be honest....</li>
            <li> I like having a beard, put I&#x27;m very particular about it.</li>
            <li> It makes his beard super soft and snuggable.</li>
            <li> The result is a beard that feels smooth and soft like normal scalp hear</li>
            <li> It will probably never be super soft, but it&#x27;s gotten to the point where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a Brillo pad.</li>
            <li> I was getting horribly dry skin, mostly on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Less hair breakage and a nice Suttle shine.</li>
            <li> Beard is super soft and it isn&#x27;t greazy as the Chuck Woolery would say.  </li>
            <li> This balm makes my husband&#x27;s beard shine and feel super soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application was easy enough.</li>
            <li> A quick application after a shower made for a soft and manageable beard.</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t even mentioned it once; and she&#x27;s super sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> ive had a beard for a while, and used numerous products, this is easily one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Combining this with a beard brush has made my beard more manageable, and keeps my face from getting dry underneath my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In less than 5 seconds, the grains will disappear as soon as it gets warm.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice if you like earthy, slightly menthol smells.  </li>
            <li> I can use mustache wax at night and after two nights super soft...  </li>
            <li> Beard is softer, easier to handle and not itchy but what I like the most is that it helped with dry skin on my chin.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell neutral, but had wished at least for some pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Do not need to use much, which is good because it is a small container.</li>
            <li> The container looks small but it lasts longer than I thought it would, it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to get your beard looking good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dramatic...</li>
            <li> If my husband must have a full beard, at least he uses Honest Amish Balm</li>
            <li> For those of you who may not want something with such a strong scent, they do have an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it is a little anise based - but it dissipates quickly if that is a concern of yours.</li>
            <li> With your finger you dig out a bit maybe twice as large as a pea and rub it in between your palms.  </li>
            <li> I wish it also came in a tin about 4 times as large.</li>
            <li> It certainly depends on the type of beard you have.</li>
            <li> If you have a large beard probably 1 or 2 months.</li>
            <li> The natural oils and butters tend to melt very quickly so makw sure its sealed tightly if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> However, I really like the smell and see this as a positive thing.</li>
            <li> A great smell, make his thick long beard smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Same beard, been trimming it the same for about 4 months now but this balm has started to give the beard a more full look and shine to it.</li>
            <li> I love the Beard Balm, I used oil in the past but so far this product I feel is much better.</li>
            <li> It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  </li>
            <li> and I believe that if I grow this sucker out to a foot it will be healthy and look good for a long time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, was reading about all the new age, organic, botanical, feel good advertisement on all the stuff you can improve your beards health and appearance with and tried a few things at the grocery store and pharmacy.............</li>
            <li> Great product I previously tried hydrating my beard with different types of oils</li>
            <li> It also cured his dry skin, which was REALLY flaky before and now is 100% better.</li>
            <li> One thing I really don&#x27;t like is if you eat food crumbs and salt easily stick to the beard even several hours after applying.</li>
            <li> far as the beard goes, this product really does help with softening and even some mild styling/straightening of the beard</li>
            <li> A little help with the blow dryer and a round brush, a nice coating of the balm makes a huge difference!!</li>
            <li> There two folks commented how nice/trim my new beard looked (after several scraggly months) -- clearly attributable to Honest Amish.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it also isn&#x27;t good, yet still noticeable, I just ordered their &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34; version, which is supposed to be scentless, so I may like that better!</li>
            <li> The next day the product was fine...</li>
            <li> One, simply putting some of the paste into my beard and allowing the heat from my face to melt it for dispersion worked fine, though this can leave one area bit concentrated.</li>
            <li> Mainly, I think this was because I was using too much at first</li>
            <li> Smells decent, too!</li>
            <li> Works really well on large bushy beards.</li>
            <li> The waxy texture mildly tames his beard while the essential oils provide the right amount of moisture that lasts through his workday.</li>
            <li> So, I did a little research and stumbled upon this Honest Amish beard balm.  </li>
            <li> so I melted the balm and added a little scented oil of my own to change the smell.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected; however, fair price, fast shipping, and really cool</li>
            <li> Goes on great after a shower, or later in the day when things are getting a little frazzled.  </li>
            <li> Neutral scent has a good feel and offers a little control.</li>
            <li> within a hour, it has absorbed and has made my beard soft and perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li> He has a very manly set of whiskers where my chin will only support a light goatee.</li>
            <li> Next I&#x27;m gonna try the heavy duty beard balm, heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> so I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t doing much for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, but once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to stop!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try another product like this.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> They are cheap enough to get both</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, too; when he uses the beard balm his beard looks much fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> It really does help.</li>
            <li> It really makes your beard feel softer.  </li>
            <li> This assumption was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li> He says that his beard is much softer.  </li>
            <li> The balm is very &amp;#34;beady&amp;#34; like the texture of grits.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product</li>
            <li> Much to my chagrin, it fades progressively after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Since then I haven&#x27;t really noticed it.</li>
            <li> Product was very grainy upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> Really work it in all over; neck, mustache, cheeks, everywhere.  </li>
            <li> After around three days you&#x27;ll notice a real difference in how your beard lays on your skin and how it feels.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfume-y at all and is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try to use the rest of this can because it costs as much as it does</li>
            <li> But when you rub it into your fingers and beard, you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling, unless you use too much.  </li>
            <li> Use too much and can be greasy start out with a pea size amount and work your way up all depends on beard length</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I do think this softens the beard up a bit, but not that much.</li>
            <li> I intend to regrow it when the weather strts cooling off and this product will be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get how anyone would say it promotes growth.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks to really notice a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Apply gently.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated products would recommend to others and I use it when I&#x27;m not using my wax for my much beard</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this beard balm would help to control a few independent-minded hairs from doing their own thing in my beard, but this product really doesn&#x27;t do much for that.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The real reason for the 2 stars is the scent-</li>
            <li> I do not have to much to compare it to but am not regretting buying it.</li>
            <li> It really helps to soften up my beard and makes it easier to get a comb through it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> Really helps my beard maintain it&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> While he really likes the way his beard feels and looks after using it he feels like he can&#x27;t in the winter.</li>
            <li> Really tames the ole face pubes.  </li>
            <li> Those Amish wizards really know what they&#x27;re doing.)</li>
            <li> Really works well.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this product for his beard.</li>
            <li> and since I can&#x27;t stand either of those smells, I was really concerned before it came.  </li>
            <li> This balm really helps soften the beard and eliminate itch.  </li>
            <li> This helps resolve much of that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take as much as you might think.</li>
            <li> Really softens the beard.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I could return this and get a non-scented version.</li>
            <li> But it is very oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of tips - read the instructions and follow them because they really do work.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys the smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But after 2 weeks of this balm, my hair is much softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> will she want to kiss me if I have the whole homeless beard thing going)??  </li>
            <li> It is VERY oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> And the smell is very manly.</li>
            <li> Do not need to use that much of product to condition my beard.</li>
            <li> I gave as a gift, and was told that it works really well.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend not fond of boyfriends beard,but said much softer now.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> my beard comes in very wiry/scratchy, and my skin underneath dries out and itches.</li>
            <li> this really helped with both issues.</li>
            <li> you have to be judicious with how much you use -- too much and you&#x27;ll notice a bit of oiliness.</li>
            <li> Also I really like the smell</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t really a selling point for me although I do prefer fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> It conditions well and has made his beard very manageable.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much I like it</li>
            <li> It really make beard much softer and stronger.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to do much with my beard except make it oily.</li>
            <li> My lady friend absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li> My wife prefers me to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow which would normally be very prickly, with HONESTAmish</li>
            <li> Really tames my beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this if you want to help out your beard!</li>
            <li> He also appreciated the beard care instructions included.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really speak from experience</li>
            <li> My beard was much healthier after using this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use...</li>
            <li> Add a beard oil if you choose, but this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I tried just reguar hair conditioner it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone that wants to keep a well maintained beard.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> My beard and face are much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> i use this once or twice between shaves and it really stops the itching</li>
            <li> , my fiance absolutely hates when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for a longer beard.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using the balm the split ends are gone and my beard is so much softer.</li>
            <li> There is much to-do about the scent in the reviews</li>
            <li> She said that she couldn&#x27;t really smell anything at all.  </li>
            <li> So, I asked her why she likes it so much.  </li>
            <li> So, I asked her why she likes it so much.  </li>
            <li> If your hand is covered in beard balm, you are probably using too much.</li>
            <li> Everyone can notice your beard will be very shiny.</li>
            <li> The consistancy of the material really looks like the conditioner is made from all organic products, like advertised.</li>
            <li> Totally makes beard and skinn smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell</li>
            <li> It was very oily.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It treats the beard and the skin beneath it and leaves your beard softer to the touch and your skin beneath it much healthier.</li>
            <li> anyone complaining about it leaving your face/hands/beard greasy: you&#x27;re using too much.  </li>
            <li> If you do put on too much,  take a damp towel and wipe over your beard to remove some of the excess then brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so much licorice.  </li>
            <li> I had to adjust the appropiate amount to use as to much leads to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Use too much and it can make your beard feel oily.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t seem to really sink in.  </li>
            <li> I was never into using hair care products on my face, never gave it much thought.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice the scent like others are stating.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t freak out the gentle people too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use that much, but after a week</li>
            <li> Leaves a very greasy residue that never goes away during the day.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t touch beard or your hands get very greasy</li>
            <li> and no, it&#x27;s NOT greasy unless you use too much of it.</li>
            <li> At the begining my fiance didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> It feeds your beard really well and conditions the skin underneath briliantly.</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm.  </li>
            <li> but he doesn&#x27;t like that it really stays with it.</li>
            <li> It is very woodsy and manly, and--</li>
            <li> When it cooled and hardened it became very granular and using it feels like rubbing oily sand through my beard.</li>
            <li> but it just don&#x27;t do much if anything from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> It came in very quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three together have really helped both issues a lot.</li>
            <li> really helped the texture of my boyfriend&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> Very manly smell.  </li>
            <li> sweetie thought I&#x27;d really like this.</li>
            <li> I need to ask if it is because my manly whiskers are too much for her</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what they are really supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I was unsure on how much i needed to use.</li>
            <li> I did not know there were such things available, so I have nothing to compare this to except for using no products at all.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, if it is too oily, you are using too much.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face as a moisturizer and to soften my beard.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, he really likes using it on his beard.</li>
            <li> it will really do what they say it will, but it don&#x27;t happen in one application.  </li>
            <li> This has a very pungent smell.</li>
            <li> I wrote them and they sent me the unscented version which is so much better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t have any real *hold</li>
            <li> but your beard you get really oily</li>
            <li> I really knew nothing about it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Along with a beard brush his beard is now much smoother and neater.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> i guess it does what it says it will do, but i dont really like the way it smells</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much,</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well, two weeks in, and it really works.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> Was really iffy of it.</li>
            <li> This product really softens up and moisturizes my beard and at its cost, is a real value compared to pricier oils and alternative products.</li>
            <li> and it really made a difference in the thickness and look of my once scraggly face moss.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend that needed to ease up his fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tasted real chartreuse before</li>
            <li> I will use the balm at night after the shower when my beard is wet and use the wax in the morning for more control.</li>
            <li> I also ordered a Kent mustache comb - I highly recommend the combo!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li> The fact that it is made in the USA is desired, and greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised works very well with my beard.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference since he&#x27;s started using this product.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I found this great</li>
            <li> Very overpriced</li>
            <li> The scent is very easy-going.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Things have been going very well</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe now much nicer</li>
            <li> Also really helps a lot with the itch when the beard is just beginning to grow.</li>
            <li> And his beard really feels much softer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this product to work as a gel or styling oil, that really isn&#x27;t the purpose.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it and it does make his beard a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Very scented not as manageable as desired.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and really can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in my beard.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m ordering my third can I&#x27;ll be getting the unscented, melting it, and adding a few of my own essential oils to craft my own scent.</li>
            <li> He uses it after he showers and it&#x27;s really made his beard and stache softer, plus I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Really softened up my beard.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amish</li>
            <li> The beard absorbs the balm very well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, i will be purchasing again when i&#x27;m running low</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve refrained from letting it grow out much.  </li>
            <li> so he didn&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes this beard balm.  </li>
            <li> I noticed how much thicker my beard looked from photos I had taken of myself the week before,(yes</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> This stuff really conditions my beard.  </li>
            <li> Really like this balm.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way that this helps my beard.  </li>
            <li> but my beard is really curly</li>
            <li> I think if my beard hair was straight this would probably work well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Really made the beard look nicer.</li>
            <li> , my beard is much softer.</li>
            <li> Had some separation issues initially, but after heating product up and remixing it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Works well, costs to much</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product really softens it the hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really makes it that much softer..</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Does not take much.  </li>
            <li> If however I don&#x27;t feel like being greasy, then it really doesn&#x27;t do that much.  </li>
            <li> but I believe your pricing has now gone to high!</li>
            <li> It really helps out with the dryness that can happen under the beard.</li>
            <li> It works after warming it up but too much hassle.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t wear cologne it might not matter as much</li>
            <li> I really like this balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the aroma actually.</li>
            <li> Recommended this to a couple guys at work and they&#x27;ve been really into it as well.</li>
            <li> but this stuff really does improve what I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more my hands wanting to pull at the beard.</li>
            <li> Rad, thanks.</li>
            <li> Works really well, just the smell isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> and I can really notice a difference in my beard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Package came as described, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally scent free</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> but thanks anyway</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine how much someone would have to put on at one time to be bothered by it...</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I have very wiry beard hair and was hoping that this balm would help to soften it up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it so much</li>
            <li> To me, not having that citrus scent really diminishes the pleasure of using the product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell is very manly, but my wife is not a fan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell, really guys?</li>
            <li> Word of advice, don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll get oily.</li>
            <li> It will cause your beard to become somewhat oily, depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> , i really like the feeling it gives my bear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> So much so, that every time I use it, I make my wife smell my beard.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping like everything from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too much and beard will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it and I will definitely continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li> My beard used to itch, but not anymore thanks to this balm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the skin underneath the beard was much of a problem until the irritation went away.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Jaegermeister liquor and the light licorice smell accompanying</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, he really likes it because it keeps it under control and is softer.</li>
            <li> This Beard Balm really works to soften and condition beard hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and neat packaging.</li>
            <li> Too much on the medicine side.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well on my bread.</li>
            <li> It really does make his beard softer.</li>
            <li> His beard looks and feels so , much softer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much styling ability from it, not that it claims to, so if someone is looking for something to style with I would recommend something with a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> It is prickly, but using this product really does soften it up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And you really don&#x27;t use much at all.  </li>
            <li> This product has taken my beard to the next level of smooth, manly, and being well-kempt.</li>
            <li> I really like this balm.  </li>
            <li> Before using this, my beard was very bristly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t even notice it</li>
            <li> I switched to balm from oil when my beard got beyond 3 inches because balm makes it much easier to manage and work-in with a comb.  </li>
            <li> Product really softens my beard.  </li>
            <li> I was using too much and it was leaving my beard feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> From the time I placed the order, to the time I received it was fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, and I was suspicious that it would do what it said.</li>
            <li> No lady wants a scratchy beard face to snuggle.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my beard feel after applying it.</li>
            <li> very oily.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really help with styling</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying the scent free beard oil drops (from Amazon) next!</li>
            <li> My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> no more soap flakes, just a healthy, full beard.</li>
            <li> I have since picked up Honest Amish&#x27;s Heavy Duty Beard Balm, and am much happier with that product.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner definitely made my beard softer and most importantly to me, completely eliminated any beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 different beard products, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the extra strength honest Amish balm or a leave in conditioner you only have to use once or twice weekly.  </li>
            <li> love how soft it makes it no coarse or bristly here..</li>
            <li> My younger brother has been using a beard oil for several years and I convinced him to try the Honest Amish Beard Balm</li>
            <li> It is pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard nice and shiny with out being greasy or heavy and the mustache Wax is a life saver</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others, but they don&#x27;t compare to the Honest Amish Brand.</li>
            <li> There were also a few websites that suggested Honest Amish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sticky or heavy but gives beard a nice feel, texture and conditioning for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool packaging too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - on my 2nd order and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> Growing my winter beard in and it was real coarse,  this all natural product smoothed it out and made it more manageable</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my beard soft and manageable, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> or under it), the only place flakes reside now is on my upper lip area, where I didn&#x27;t apply Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> You can, and I do, put a couple of drops of something like Essential Oils into your hands and rub it in after you apply the Honest Amish to give a different scent.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes of application it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling; you can spread the rest on your skin, which has helped keep my face from drying out in the winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coconut oil (the thick waxy stuff in a jar) is just a s good and</li>
            <li> I also use a little tiny bit on my own hair to tame fly aways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it also has a nice sent to it no too strong.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a better product for their beard and for a solution to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural &amp; has a pleasant, not overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li> The balm has great texture and feels very nice, but the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Pretty new to caring for my beard and heard about this stuff.</li>
            <li> He has a pretty good sized beard (maybe 5 inches at the longest point), and using it every other day, he still has more than half left.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but dissipates quickly, and I like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shake it up and put it in the fridge for a minutes (says it clear in the directions by the way).It has a grainy feel to it but dissolves into oil right away.    </li>
            <li> other day, a complete stranger informed me he had &amp;#34;beard envy&amp;#34; so I pointed him in the direction of Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> It works  well, much like many of the  other balms on the market.  </li>
            <li> Honest Amish helps me tame the beast a bit.</li>
            <li> Like most all the other reviews of this product, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely by this and other products from these good folks again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to any other bearded brother out there.</li>
            <li> Regardless of your tolerance for fragrance it doesn&#x27;t stay strong for long.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve put up with dry frizzy beard for so long!</li>
            <li> I got it mainly because my beard/facial hair is incredibly course and scratchy, and so can be really uncomfortable at times.</li>
            <li> I have other oils, but this one helps a lot better at keeping a tamed look for work</li>
            <li> which makes it a lot easier to put into your beard than most other oils  </li>
            <li> After regular use my beard does not seem significantly softer.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, so it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other balms but this one just works better.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that they will work as well as their original products.</li>
            <li> My wife love the smell of this one over all my other oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading descriptions of many other products.</li>
            <li> Are other products better?  </li>
            <li> Maybe tamer hair will benefit more along the lines of other reviewers;</li>
            <li> After him trying many other products (including my Moroccan hair oil)</li>
            <li> Now, I just rub in a little Honest Amish and it feels normal.</li>
            <li> So most of it leaked out into the box due to the damaged tin.</li>
            <li> Better than other oils that I tried.</li>
            <li> Also felt a bit more oily than other balms that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Smells way better than some of the other balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When opportunity strikes, make sure you&#x27;ve spent the 4 minutes it takes to give you a leg up above the competition and lather that sweet victory in to every follicle.</li>
            <li> Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  </li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount, and it makes him smell and feel good.</li>
            <li> This product, at least for me, was purely about keeping my beard soft and pleasant for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small amount of Honest Amish will keep your beard shiny and manageable (too much and it will get greasy).</li>
            <li> and it went from sophisticated gentleman to Tom Hanks in Castaway, and back with a few easy strokes.  </li>
            <li> Smelled decent, but didn&#x27;t really benefit my beard in anyway?</li>
            <li> my husbands REALLY long beard is now REALLY soft too:)</li>
            <li> simply wasn&#x27;t suitable for use regularly.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any particular softening of my beard in 3-4 weeks of application, but that may have been again because the product wasn&#x27;t really a gel often when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product -- only wish it were slightly cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely oily, but smells clean, not chemically.</li>
            <li> First: when you get the product, if it&#x27;s not cold outside - put it into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes - else, it may be melted into a liquid.</li>
            <li> only when I get out of the shower cause it calls for a clean beard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown a pretty full beard, over an inch long.</li>
            <li> Smells good but still manly and leaves my above average size beard softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> also the smell is not bad, but my girlfriend doesnt really dig it, so next time prbably will go for the option with no smell.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide between the Honest Amish beard balm or their light-hold beard wax and the balm ultimately won out due to the fact that it had far more benefits than the wax, or it at least listed more in the write-up.</li>
            <li> The Balm smelled nice and worked well keeping the hairs soft, but did not work that well keeping stray hairs down.</li>
            <li> Then take a comb and use the tight side of the comb to gently comb your beard (while combing, make sure you can feel the comb gently raking the skin of your face...</li>
            <li> while expensive, it works like magic, beard looks and smells great, and you use so little it should last a good long while.</li>
            <li> The forst few times you use it, you will use too much, but it&#x27;s easy to make adjustments until you find the right amount for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No, the smell is not strong, yes, it is pleasant, and it makes even my scratchy old beard feel (relatively) soft.  </li>
            <li> a nice smell (that doesn&#x27;t last very long).  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much, as it can become a little too greasy should you put too much in.  </li>
            <li> I can see where some people would be turned off by it, but its very &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smelling, and more of a scent, less of an &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves a very smooth and slightly glossy look to your beard.</li>
            <li> The product packaging is nice and simple; a tin with a single color sticker on it and wrapped in a burlap bag.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my beard isn&#x27;t very long, so the balm at least helps with styling somewhat, but I also have the added bonus of reduced itch and a moderatly pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> A litte goes a long way; also using the heat of your palm rub it around to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> I have a full naturally white beard and this balm</li>
            <li> He has a full beard, usually very coarse, but it has been smoothed and tamed by this product.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard pretty soft as well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming which is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this and within the first week not only was my beard much softer, but the skin under my beard felt so much relieved!</li>
            <li> It does have some smell to it, nothing that bothers me but people who are extremely sensitive to odors should be aware of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the shower I take a small dollop,  warm it up in my hands and massage into my beard.  </li>
            <li> The first stuff I found that manages the wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine after a whole van it only gets better looking and stronger looking beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works well, but it&#x27;s not worth the smell.</li>
            <li> Ive been researching all these cool ways to maintain your beard and give it the proper moisture, comb it correctly, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Honest Amish Beard Balm for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Since it is a more solid product, I feel like you get lesser coverage than other products that are more liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial hair conditioner, keeps my facial hair soft and flake</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount of Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Most of my traits are more common with the Italian and Samoan sides of my family.</li>
            <li> It instantly caused the irritation to cool and took away the itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> At first he thought it was a gag gift, but was pleasantly surprised by its usefulness.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice.. kind of weird smell but fades nearly instantly</li>
            <li> I generally use normal hair conditioner on my beard once or twice a week and get the same benefit at a much better cost per application over this product.  </li>
            <li> Very good stuff, just a little pricey, which is why the one star is missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your normal &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; retail look, but what bearded man is looking for something that looks like Ed Hardy designed it?&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular beard balm, but I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HJM1Q/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 , and it did more to lay my errant beard hairs down than this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more inclined to lay down and look presentable.  </li>
            <li> there is a mild, not overwhelming scent and is easy to use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, while it is strong at first application, the scent dwindled shortly after but there was still a definite presence of the smell.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for someone with a beard and started a new trend!</li>
            <li> It looks a little shiny right after putting it on but the shine goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It is soft and semi gritty feeling at first, make sure you rub it till it melts into liquid, which only takes about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product so much I plan on trying other products the company offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I have very little idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I have very little idea what that means.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hipster boyfriend who is new to the whole world of beards.</li>
            <li> After just one application his beard was like a whole new beard.</li>
            <li> It softens your beard and really helps to alleviate the dryness, itching and irritation of new beard growth.</li>
            <li> It really helped with the itch from new growth.</li>
            <li> This gift along with the beard and mustache comb that I ordered have really helped my boyfriend with his new beard.</li>
            <li> less is more when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a woodsy, slightly smoky smell with a hint of anise, if anything at all.</li>
            <li> A healthy beard makes my wife complain like 5% less.</li>
            <li> I love the slight licorice smell that it has</li>
            <li> What I discovered is less is more.</li>
            <li> I love the woodsy (kinda black licorice)  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a decent value otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s grown on me, my significant other wasn&#x27;t a fan at first, but the reduction in beard rash against her face won her over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is in a solid form, but quickly melts into liquid when you rub it between your hands before application.  </li>
            <li> I would love this stuff like crazy, as it works well and leaves you beard feeling NICE.</li>
            <li> That was my main concern.  </li>
            <li> Only wish the container was larger and held more product for the price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about softer as I don&#x27;t particularly touch my beard</li>
            <li> a whole, worth the price of admission, especially if you are looking to upgrade from &amp;#34;possibly homeless&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;unquestionably magnificent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as spicy and the main note I smell is Cloves.</li>
            <li> It softens and maintains control far better than I expected .&lt;br</li>
            <li> lemon grass and clove are the two main aromas.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep hair growing in the same direction, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> The main reason I needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really particular when it comes to beard care and products and would pick</li>
            <li> find it neat that it comes out gritty balm, but melts quickly in your hand and you rub in.</li>
            <li> I get the fun of sharing the secret of Honest Amish with all my bearded friends, but my baby-faced friends just know that my beard works and theirs don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Hence my reason for purchasing this particular beard balm.</li>
            <li> I have recently ordered the Extra Grit Beard Wax to see if it will help manage my beard even more.</li>
            <li> Such smell may be appealing to others, but it definitely was not to me.</li>
            <li> The balm starts as a semi solid substance and quickly turns to an oil after rubbing in your hands.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will be ordering more, probably in the bigger tin though.</li>
            <li> All in all, it was decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li> I kept getting a decent amount of bearddruff.</li>
            <li> Most of my family are either Irish, Italian or Samoan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found out from an older bearded man whom I work with that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like starting a bar fight with chuck Norris and winning after seven double scotches and hog tieing yourself just to make</li>
            <li> Remember this is mainly a moisturizer/conditioner, so dont plan to sculpt with it.</li>
            <li> It initially smells like medicine (think Vicks vapor rub), but the scent goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> This will give your beard a decent moisturizing and a bit of a sheen.</li>
            <li> Next, it is kind of gresy, but not a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Left my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have is that, after application, the scent fades so quickly.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff, smells great, and I generally hate scented things.</li>
            <li> Genetics is the main determiner of your beard growth pattern, not wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent conditioning, but the smell leaves a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li> My wife recently became pregnant after 8 months of unsuccessful (yet relentless) attempts at procreation.</li>
            <li> It took a few months for me to really fall in love with this balm.</li>
            <li> In the tin it seems a little grainy, but once you emulsify it in your hands, it turns out to be very smooth.</li>
            <li> I had the consistent problem of my chin becoming unbearably itchy every time I let the beard grow past a certain length.</li>
            <li> Scent is a little too strong at first</li>
            <li> It has made my beard very soft and manageable, while taming some of the stray whiskers that tend to stick straight out rather than fall with the flow of my beard.</li>
            <li> The only time I noticed it is when I put it on for the very first time.</li>
            <li> Works very well with sensitive skin to boot!</li>
            <li> The can is larger than I anticipated and looks like it will go a LONG way for me, and would last a good while with a beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> My beard is not that long, a good 4 1/2 inches, and I only use the back of my thumb nail for measuring the amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously smells come down to personal preference much of the time, but I think that this product smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> , I use my beard balm to keep it nice, tame, soft, and smelling like</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and container tells you to be careful because it may have turned into a liquid state if it was too hot.</li>

            <li> Again, maybe I didn&#x27;t read or see the container size in the info above but other than that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other oils and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It emulsified easy enough, but to the same consistency as a very oily butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product, as well as consider other Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tried two or three other beard conditioners, but keep going back to the Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Normally, I am very sensitive to smells and was worried at first that this would bother me, but even being very close to him, I can barely smell it and when I do, it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better, and I am not a fan of the scent</li>
            <li> I wish I got a little more for the money, and it doesn&#x27;t handle stray hairs as well as I thought, but that might just be my unruly beard.</li>
            <li> However, I was looking for a little more hold</li>
            <li> lasts all day, not too greasy and the smell is a little like Jaegermeister :)</li>
            <li> It comes in an adorable little tin inside of an adorable little pouch.  </li>
            <li> The packaging could of used a little more thought put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its ok a little greasy for my liking</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ll do that, then put a bit on your palm and add a little water with it then rub your hands together until it becomes more oily, it will do its job.</li>
            <li> smells a little licorice-ish, but if you like that this cream will give your beard a shine she will remember :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and extremely manageable with just a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as strong as other reviews have claimed.</li>
            <li> This has a strong odor that lingers unlike what other reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> A little for a long way of this product which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason for 4-star review is that I am new to beard balms and this is the very first one I have used; I dont think I&#x27;m qualified to rate 5-star.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way as it will be months before I buy more (and I will)</li>
            <li> My beard is a little wiry and the grey is starting to be more prominent.  </li>
            <li> Although it does not smell bad, it does not smell AWESOME either.</li>
            <li> Made my beard real soft.</li>
            <li> When he does use the beard balm, it really does work to keep his beard maintained and soft.</li>
            <li> This really helped keep things conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li> It really helped keep the hair soft and in place during the day.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the unusual nature of this product aroused the suspicion of the TSA agents.  </li>
            <li> People complaining about it making their beard to oily are clearly applying to much.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking the product though.  </li>
            <li> It is a very manly sent...but a sort of musky old man variety.  </li>
            <li> my beard is now soft and seems to be growing much quicker.</li>
            <li> He uses since Valentine Day (10 days ago) and he told me that he really like it how keeps the beard hair in place, but feels soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend it as it is natural and works very well at softening the beard and protecting the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my beard soft.  </li>
            <li> Really helps condition the beard, and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I went straight out to my yard and fixed the lawnmower.  </li>
            <li> The beard itself was fairly soft to the touch, but it was very irritated.</li>
            <li> - really helps keep my beard soft.  </li>
            <li> My daughter isn&#x27;t wild about the fragrance, but he really likes it.</li>
            <li> The tiniest bit makes his beard a magnet for concrete dust.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the balm a try, and I am very satisified with how soft my beard feels.</li>
            <li> Even a dime-sized amount would be way too much for me (though my beard is pretty short).</li>
            <li> I love the scent and wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried, I love the consistency of this.</li>
            <li> then it just separates and never returns to normal (not fridge not room temp house).</li>
            <li> , I like the ingredients, and my beard is definitely healthier, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than two hours before the scent and the feel of the oil are completely gone.</li>
            <li> My beard was soft and manageable after the first application and still is soft.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the beard and skin for instant conditioning.</li>
            <li> If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  </li>
            <li> If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, and after using it for several weeks, am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few more shots too, even after a shower but still didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only critique is that Im not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> It contains a few more ingredients over Beard Balm, like Argan oil.</li>
            <li> this stuff will last you longer than you expect, well worth it.</li>
            <li> What was once a normal scraggly beard is now a majestic bear, on my face.    </li>
            <li> Heavy duty works better on my beard.</li>
            <li> think this will be a staple in my normal beard care routine</li>
            <li> I grew my first beard starting this November, and it took care of the itching and it did make the beard much softer as it was growing in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m contemplating trying the Heavy Duty Beard Balm instead since it sounds like it has better control.</li>
            <li> i love this product is works really well with making sure that my beard does not go all crazy through out the day.</li>
            <li> My one complaint about the honest amish balm, is that it leaves your face a bit oily/greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple and straight forward to apply.</li>
            <li> #5-trimmed beard stays oiled for almost the entire day from about a pea-size worth applied in the morning.</li>
            <li> It slowly fades to a barely there scent that reminds me of a sexy mountain man (think hot stud/not burly &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t shower man&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> so I doesn&#x27;t clash with my normal cologne I use</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are an eco conscious company and I would definitely order more of their product in the future.</li>
            <li> First, do not use too much if you have a short beard.</li>
            <li> Tried a few beard oils, this worked a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> My own personal overall impression ... middle of the road.  </li>
            <li> First I have to mention how fast the product got to me in my current APO location.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of use, I can&#x27;t say that my beard is any softer, but it&#x27;s more under control.</li>
            <li> I understand that it states on the paper that came with it that skin is fair game too</li>
            <li> Consistency is strange, not bad but too grainy.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and very subtle.</li>
            <li> I would NOT let that stop you, as the scent is very subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Realized that you really have to smooth it out and break down the clumped up parts before applying.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard feeling soft, healthy, and keeps the friz down.</li>
            <li> getting the wild hairs down; trimming does that job better.</li>
            <li> It takes considerable efforts to degrade the sandy viscosity down to something more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about it, my first few applications (once every other day) didn&#x27;t seem to do too much.</li>
            <li> Not hard to liquify in the palm of my hands.</li>
            <li> it made my facial hair super soft.</li>
            <li> In your hands it has a partial sandy texture, but after a quick rub together it&#x27;s ready to be applied.</li>
            <li> My beard was super soft with just one use and the flakes are totally gone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a great, earthy smell without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s not super heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells like a hippy + licorice and is not pleasant for someone that wants to smell nice to colleagues in the office.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and after a week of using it regularly, my beard is as soft and majestic as a lion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a dime-sized amount every morning after a shower (make sure your beard is dry before applying), and let it do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a low review because the product has such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Compare all natural ingredients to other popular brands - this is the only product I&#x27;ll put on my beard.</li>
            <li> Softened the goatee right up and, its a short hair goatee at that.</li>
            <li> and I bought it right before I left for a mountain biking trip.</li>
            <li> I use it right after I get out of the shower and my facial hair is noticeably softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely leading us in the right direction.</li>
            <li> My beard feels softer already, and it&#x27;s becoming less itchy/flaky throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I searched all over for a solution including using conditioner, shampoo and more to see if I could tame the itch.  </li>
            <li> is much more tame.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was actually very relieved to receive the product and find that it smells like cloves, and not black licorice.</li>
            <li> but the sent is light enough that it just smells a little sweet.</li>
            <li> He only uses it abt every other day to avoid greasiness and the smell is a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> A little dab will do on your fingertip, rub upward into your beard and smooth down with your favorite beard comb</li>
            <li> I know Honest Amish doesn&#x27;t use artificial fragrance, and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Smell tones down after 15-20 ...depends on whether you have a strong sense of smell and whether or not you like the smell to start with.</li>
            <li> not only does a bushy beard require only a small amount, but it smells great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to tame my wild mane into a fine piece of face fur.</li>
            <li> It even gained a little color as the moistened hairs show their color more clearly.  </li>
            <li> Was concerned about the smell after reading other reviews, but I actually enjoy it and it fades after application; not overpowering in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it worked or not,but I&#x27;m sure after use and a complete shave the beard grew much faster.</li>
            <li> honestly, this one is a little gritty for my taste.</li>
            <li> As I have just received the product I can only say honestly that I have used it a little.</li>
            <li> Great to tame a few wild hairs but really noticeably softens the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the smell I like it, it&#x27;s a little strong smelling it straight out of the can.</li>
            <li> so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> If you are growing a new beard like</li>
            <li> We even tried to shave his beard and apply the product as the new hair grew in, but there has been no noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new staple</li>
            <li> My new beard is always getting compliments from both sexes.</li>
            <li> It was a new concept to me, but the effects were noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started seeing new growth in those areas.</li>
            <li> Also I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to quell the dreaded &#x27;new beard itch&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have that itchy new beard feeling anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to having a beard.</li>
            <li> I live in Wyoming and work out side every day.  </li>
            <li> I live in Vegas</li>
            <li> The product, as advertized, helps in grooming my relatively new beard.</li>
            <li> His beard is softer and smells really nice, in a subtle way that doesn&#x27;t overpower or interfere with cologne.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, my main points about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my wild beard soft and much easier to run a comb through.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more</li>
            <li> I have just ordered Honest Amish heavy duty beard balm and their extra grit wax.  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant earthy spicy smell, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, not only did I not notice much of a change with the beard look, but it didn&#x27;t help with the itch like Beard Balm did, regardless of how much I used.</li>
            <li> Its kind of gritty, greasy, and messy.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe if one is to grow a beard or any Length of facial hair, Honest Amish Balm is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It smells of black licorice, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong black licorice smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is good, very very subtle</li>
            <li> Put less under nose if odor is to strong.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and it comes in a cute little burlap bag!</li>
            <li> At first it may feel a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; but this quickly passes as the balm soaks into your beard and skin.  </li>
            <li> There were far more positive reviews than negative</li>
            <li> Though my beard curls excessively, I am still able to enjoy the benefits of what this product offers.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking to try other products in the line soon.</li>
            <li> It has a mild odor of clove oil, and my beard hair sucks it right up!</li>
            <li> Mine tend to get very wild, and while this helped some, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> He started using it and his beard is very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Makes his beard very soft</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin)...</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this product works well and has made my beard very soft..</li>
            <li> Beard feel very soft</li>
            <li> makes your beard very soft after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It makes it very soft and stay in place.</li>
            <li> My wife Loves the smell and says it has made my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> When you put it on, the pleasant earthly smell doesn&#x27;t last long and for me it was replaced by this slight smell of rancid oil.  </li>
            <li> Plain old lanolin was better.</li>
            <li> my son loves it even more than expected thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying if your are looking for a new beard balm or something other than a straight beard oil.</li>
            <li> This balm keeps my short beard and the skin underneath it from becoming dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I found it softens my beard, but I was hoping it would tame the wild hairs a bit better than it did.</li>
            <li> I have long scruffy chin hair and this stuff has made it super soft.</li>
            <li> However, credit where it&#x27;s due: a little goes a long way, and it really adds a great shine to your beard.</li>
            <li> Some people prefer that look and on some beards I&#x27;m sure that it wouldn&#x27;t be so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the smell is not bad, my main complaint is the price, I understand why its expensive, due to all of the great ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural product.&lt;br /&gt;Natural beard products are difficult to find</li>
            <li> Beings from another dimension crossed through the time rift, but luckily I was able to use this wax to forge my beard into a great sword that shot laser beams and I banished the evil beings back into oblivion.</li>
            <li> Its hard for us Northern Nigerians to grow beards already, but this product makes it look easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking to myself, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who&#x27;s beard had become wild and unruly!</li>
            <li> The smell is different, I suggest using a light/minimal application as I would say the aroma when I first used made my stomache turn a bit.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The 1st time I used it my beard was instantly soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever had that actually eliminated my beard dandruff...or as I like to call it....</li>
            <li> is fine (black liquorish).</li>
            <li> Instantly felt a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old likes my husband to do his hair with it too!</li>
            <li> This small tin lasts me 4-6 months, but I would rather be able to get a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for one day and my wife commented about how soft my beard has gotten!</li>
            <li> Had my first beard balm experience at my local barber.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to help with the extreme irritation on the moustache area, but it did not  work all that well for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft!</li>
            <li> My first container lasted me about a year - and that&#x27;s with daily use!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s now shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed was around day two or three of consistent use of the Beard Balm when I was helping my friend move out of his apartment.</li>
            <li> After a day of wearing the stuff, the skin near the edges of my beard started to break out in zits!</li>
            <li> This is a unique conditioner and it works extremely well....</li>
            <li> Started usin this at the begining of the year and the beard is soft, curly and my fiance loves it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is light enough to not leave your hands oily, and soft enough that you&#x27;ll want to run your hands through it all day.</li>
            <li> Ok not sure this makes your beard any softer,</li>
            <li> My wife says it&#x27;s lemony, but I&#x27;m not so sure, and I don&#x27;t see any citrus fruits listed in the ingredients (though I&#x27;m not sure they listed all of them).</li>
            <li> EPIC!</li>
            <li> Hopefully this helps for people like me who have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I keep a pretty short beard, which is always at the stage of being ultra itchy.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple.</li>
            <li> This paper had a warning about how if it was hot outside when the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; shipped it may be liquid and should be cooled before use.  </li>
            <li> First, when it arrived it had a completely different chemistry</li>
            <li> If you can get past the odor then you will love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day after using this product, complete beard comfort!</li>
            <li> (pea size- amount you put on your tooth brush), rub it in your palms and it melts like a hot knife through butter into what id like to call the ultimate oil to put in your beard</li>
            <li> It seems to do most of what it claims to do, but not sure if I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first application the following happened:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he&#x27;s been using this for three days now and his beard is already so soft!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard soft!</li>
            <li> If I try other brands of similar products, I&#x27;ll add more to this review.</li>
            <li> This makes my husband&#x27;s beard SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars, but this is the first product I have used on my beard and only have used it for about a week, so want to see how it goes over time.</li>
            <li> being said this product lives up to its claims and unless I am introduced to something better, I will likely buy it again when I grow a beard for next year&#x27;s and future fund-raising campaigns.</li>
            <li> Gives beard a nice gloss but other than that not much conditioning to beard.</li>
            <li> Obviously it was hot when it arrived but</li>
            <li> He said the product helps manage his beard better, but he is not sure about its conditioning abilities.</li>
            <li> only wish I had found it twenty years ago when I first grew my goatee.</li>
            <li> but I rarely let it get soooo long.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side, compared with other similar products and you better like</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty gross.</li>
            <li> No more itchy skin and the beard looks and feels incredibly smooth!</li>
            <li> Within minutes of first application, the difference was ENORMOUS.  </li>
            <li> No more suicidal  thoughts  :-)</li>
            <li> It does, however- soak your beard with nutrients, (and some control) and I have noticed my facial hair much softer, and more controllable in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to go full on wax</li>
            <li> I guess if you have a long beard then it would probably look good and work well, but for a short beard it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is stronger than I expected and it does stay fragrant throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Like G.Scott Parkinson says in the other comments, put it in the sun for a day and it was great right after it cooled down and solidified a little.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s on-par with one of those little breath mint tins you can easily carry in your pocket.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong to me and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll most likely get some of the heavy duty balm when my beard gets a little longer and needs some more hold.</li>
            <li> not only is not disgusted by its fragrance, but actively enjoys it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, softens my man&#x27;s beard, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cool little bag straight from amish country...</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not over powering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Therefore a 4 should be beyond what you expect, and a 5 should be reserved for those very few cases when a product or service does something really outstanding and beyond your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish they could offer a few other products that have some kind of send added to them.</li>
            <li> and my wife loves the new beard vs the old brillo beard...</li>
            <li> As far as promoting new growth, we&#x27;re not convinced.</li>
            <li> Strangely I like the smell of licorice but something isn&#x27;t right with this scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy nonsense that says vegan gluten free straight edge organic</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard smooth and gives it a slight sheen - not as shiny as an oil based product though.  </li>
            <li> But not too heavy, easy to work in to beard.</li>
            <li> Goes in easy and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and works, but is not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> At first oily and shiny, the next day the beard feels soft and springy and stays that way until you re-apply the balm.</li>
            <li> Conditions and smells nice, but a LITTLE goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> By the time I get to the office I am barely aware that I have put anything in my facial hair aisde from how pleasantly soft it has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for years and never did anything special for it other than pert plus shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the size of the tin, but like most have said, a little really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Since this balm is sitting under my nose it makes me very self conscious for about an hour till the scent luckily dies down and nearly vanishes.</li>
            <li> Only started using it, but I love the smell and how it helps the hair lay down.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic and helps make the hairs soft, shiny and keep them down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed his beard is more tame!</li>
            <li> He grows a pretty thick beard, so this doesn&#x27;t work to keep all of the wirey hairs smooth, but helped it stay soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is weak, but it&#x27;s kind of grassy, and not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Mind you, my beard didn&#x27;t grow new hair, that&#x27;s up to genetics, but just like healthy head hair looks thick and voluminous</li>
            <li> Slightly scented, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Simply regarding the concerns: Yes, it is a bit oily, but less is more.</li>
            <li> After daily use, my husband&#x27;s beard is glossy, healthy, and shows less signs of split ends.  </li>
            <li> I had beard dandruff, my beard was rough like a brillow pad, and I had dry patching skin under my beard and after using this beard balm for about a week my beard has softened, darkened and just looks better.</li>
            <li> Less coarse and more maintained.</li>
            <li> but I found if you just run your finger in a circular motion it melts down to a more fluid wax and that&#x27;s when I twist my horse hair beard brush soft on it and apply.</li>
            <li> beard balm provides a clean, quality ingredient profile that acts fast and provides a shine and smoothness where other products have fallen short.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product, i just wish they would either give you a little more, or charge a little less for it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, CK</li>
            <li> The wax is too stiff for easy application.  </li>
            <li> Cleared my dry skin right up.</li>
            <li> other great thing about this beard balm is that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but after I stopped using the balm for 2 days my face cleared up right away with no new acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, warm smell instead of the cold and hateful stink of black licorice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they could tame the strong smell</li>
            <li> a large jar will last for a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain I&#x27;m literally rubbing actual butter into my beard.</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t stand that smell, and I certainly don&#x27;t want my beard smelling like that.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like a large can of shoe polish, but it&#x27;s really tiny for the price.</li>
            <li> I started using this shortly after trying another product that was pure jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> It might sound a little majestic</li>
            <li> I tried this balm for the first time a few weeks ago, and I like it a lot more than any other option I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My beard didn&#x27;t get super soft and smooth overnight, but after a few applications I noticed my facial hair wasn&#x27;t quite as coarse.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole container and didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference with my very dry, very prickly beard.</li>
            <li> If you are constantly itching, especially in the first couple of weeks of growing your hair, I would apply this 2x a day and you will be relieved!</li>
            <li> The only thing I need to watch out for is making sure I rub all the balm in my hands to liquefy it to ensure I don&#x27;t get little chunks of balm in my beard.</li>
            <li> His beard is still a little bit coarse after using it, but better than it was before.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s oilier than the other balm I had (beeswax based), and the smell doesn&#x27;t dissipate that quickly.  </li>
            <li> it should last me a long time mainly because you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> apply Honest Amish Beard Balm daily and comb out my beard and mustache with a little comb made especially for beards.</li>
            <li> While some other reviews have complained about the smell, I find it mildly pleasant</li>
            <li> Works best if a little warm - cold counters leave the product a lot harder and more difficult to work into an oil in your palms.  </li>
            <li> Made my beard feel nice, which only served to make it more tempting to stroke.&lt;br /&gt;Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I also sometimes get some on my lips and it&#x27;s great as chapstick in the cold.</li>
            <li> it is very oily when applying, but my goaty gets soft next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So clearly, people noticed.</li>
            <li> Im getting ready to buy several 4 oz cans</li>

            <li> amount to use here, naturally.  </li>
            <li> If you are burning through this tin faster than that, you either have a beard that is old growth forest, or you are using way too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note, one way to tell if you are using too much, brush your hand through your beard prior to bed (mutually pleasing).</li>
            <li> yes soft.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your beard soft and conditions it all day.  </li>

            <li> It keeps my beard soft all day without being oily.  </li>
            <li> However I have alternatives that I prefer to use that are also natural, organic and quite cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard stays a bit curly, and still keeps its natural look, but it just tames and softens it a ton.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and dissipates after about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by somebody who thought they were giving me a \\&quot;gag gift\\&quot; - I&#x27;d long had a beard and never used any sort of product to maintain it.</li>
            <li> so I do really wish I could buy a bigger container of it than have to purchase a bunch of these 2oz tins every time I re-order!</li>
            <li> I started using this when my beard was about 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 36 year old man.</li>
            <li> I want to use it after showering at the gym, but after my bag has been in my car all day, the balm would be completely liquid.</li>
            <li> This product fixed all of that.</li>
            <li> This product makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like old cheese.  </li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft but not oily</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, its too early to tell if it helps growth.</li>
            <li> It has a natural scent to it.</li>
            <li> Only reason I docked one star is because the price and shipping is a bit much for what you get.</li>
            <li> It has tamed my wild circle-beard (aka goatee).  </li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> BUT this is all part of a natural product&#x27;s characteristics.  </li>
            <li> My itchiness and dryness has completely went away.</li>
            <li> I believe it is some softer, but not as soft as I was hoping it to be.</li>
            <li> I like how soft it made his beard and how glossy, not greasy</li>
            <li> Makes the beard soft.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft as can be.  </li>
            <li> And as far as the smell...</li>
            <li> I have had FAR fewer stray hairs come out in my comb.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of solid growth I really started looking into beard oil/balm.</li>
            <li> This time around I have been thinking of really taking the beard to the next level like \\&quot;fear the beard\\&quot; status.</li>
            <li> But, I realized I need some help since I work in a professional environment.</li>
            <li> Once it started getting pretty long</li>
            <li> It is supposed to &amp;#34;tame wild hairs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> He was drinking Wild Turkey out of the bottle and smoking Marlboro Reds all day.  </li>
            <li> Though not often, my job does require a professional appearance</li>
            <li> very woodsy, piney smelling stuff which goes well with a big burly beard.</li>
            <li> My beard was getting pretty long and brittle after 3 months of growth.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was one day late, but the likes happen, so I would say arrives on time more or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product worked well in keeping the beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My wife, not so much which means that I will probably be ordering the unscented tin next time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell some have complained about.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> He puts it on after the shower and it makes his beard soft, shiny, and neat.</li>
            <li> I shall try others in the future, but as a first-round pick, I believe I did very well selecting this product.</li>
            <li> but wow they itched.</li>
            <li> Ive now used this for two beards and wow the itch is gone.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t go near him.</li>
            <li> But, the real difference came a week later.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and helps straighten my hair some.</li>
            <li> It definitely has made my beard softer and eliminated much of the itchiness that I&#x27;ve had as it&#x27;s been growing in.</li>
            <li> What you get from this is a soft and moisturized feeling in your beard</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I&#x27;m leaving stains on the pillow case</li>
            <li> Keeps it soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Keeps wild beard in place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said before, my beard is naturally soft.</li>
            <li> In just a short time my folicles have grown much softer and thesmell is both manly and pleasent.</li>
            <li> bowl shave using Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp; a Gilette Fatboy from the 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily and would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It does not, however, make it soft at all.  </li>
            <li> It is much nicer to look at and apply when it is solid like this.</li>
            <li> But WOW, does it work.  </li>
            <li> Makes his beard so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes his beard soft and glisteny.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much we&#x27;ve bought several cans now!</li>
            <li> I also use a soft bristle</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s soft.  </li>
            <li> has helped considerably with fullness and softness of beard.  </li>
            <li> how much i rub it in my hands, its gritty with a hateful smell.  </li>
            <li> i could tell a big change in how much softer it made my beard feel and</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s soft and stays in place.</li>
            <li> Leaves whiskers and skin feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Works well even on my sensitive ginger skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe the Amish aren&#x27;t sensitive to this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients is a plus also.</li>
            <li> The shine goes away after a bit and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> They were stocking stuffers for Christmas for my 23 year old Grandson.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness there, but combine it with a Boar&#x27;s Hair soft brush and you will be the talk of the town.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from looking like a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This helps control my husbands wild beard - it makes it look nicer and softer.</li>
            <li> and I served 3 tours in the Middle East, so that&#x27;s really saying something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to cologne smells or chemical smells</li>
            <li> His beard is soft and conditioned without leaving it oily and shiny.</li>
            <li> Slippery and soft stuff.</li>
            <li> My big bearded boyfriend uses this and raves so much about it</li>
            <li> A licorice/spice smell, but it is only really noticeable</li>
            <li> It leaves your beard soft and moist.</li>
            <li> My beard leans toward Moses or bedlam patient in its natural state, their beard wax is my go to beard tamer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells quite masculine, like a mixture of licorice and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally frizzy</li>
            <li> The product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the beard thus, even hours after application, if you stroke your beard you&#x27;ll be left with a greasy hand.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft too.</li>
            <li> So far, I have found no oil residue on my collar shirt or jackets.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED FROM AN OLD BEARDO.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at a long term beard</li>
            <li> My facial hair is much softer and easier to groom.</li>
            <li> knocked off a star because it hasn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> if I weren&#x27;t using the stuff, though.asn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> (Argin oil, natural shampoos and conditioners and even some home made family recipe balm)</li>
            <li> Only had it for a week, so trying to adjust how much to use.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something masculine he would use.</li>
            <li> This makes it soft and the scent is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and organic</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> My beard is so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff really takes your beard to the next level.</li>
            <li> Feels buttery and natural.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> for the natural conditioning properties it has...</li>
            <li> While it is still damp I pull out just a bit, rub it in my hands until completely liquidated, and then rubbing it through my beard.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> This is complete nonsense.  </li>
            <li> I use this in addition to another Beard Oil and like it just as much for different reasons.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky is the feel</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use it on the ends of my hair at night sometimes and it makes them soft too.</li>
            <li> have a naturally wirey beard with a defiant personality.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li> No itching, my beard was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Been using this after every shower for nearly 3 weeks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s not baby soft</li>
            <li> My skin was getting very irritated from rubbing my beard to get rid of the big flakes.  </li>
            <li> Because it is 100% natural, it doesn&#x27;t have any aroma&#x27;s added.  </li>
            <li> my beard is so soft and shiny, while not greasy.  </li>
            <li> My wife would not come near me with it on.</li>
            <li> In the end it made my whiskers soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> He loves the smell, says its woodsy and masculine without being over powering.</li>
            <li> It still hasn&#x27;t tammed the wild hairs</li>
            <li> how well I keep up the beard, and how soft it has become.</li>
            <li> keeps my face bush feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> girl who lives with the man with the epic beard</li>
            <li> Seemed to absorb fast, and definitely made my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I started using this oil daily to see if my beard would begin to soften up, and after 2 months my beard doesn&#x27;t feel much softer than before, the exception to this being if the oil is still in my beard.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft and shiny....</li>
            <li> Was using Jojoba oil but was clearly missing something, especially now the beard has more growth.  </li>
            <li> After the first few hours of the first application of Beard Balm</li>
            <li> Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying.</li>
            <li> Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying.</li>
            <li> Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both.</li>
            <li> I reapplied it after waiting 5 days of non-use and sure enough my nose started reacting heavily to the scent again.</li>
            <li> and my beard has been growing SO much more evenly and thick, and is way softer.  </li>
            <li> I lose the smell after about an hour, maybe more if i lay it on thick.</li>
            <li> Rub it together in-between your palms until it&#x27;s nice and thin...</li>
            <li> As my beard grows slowly it seems to be getting softer and looking better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After seeing how much this product has helped maintain my beard, I am interested in trying some other products from the company!</li>

            <li> may try ordering again when things cool down a bit here in Virginia.  </li>
            <li> smell but due to only using a little bit at a time, it fades fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It needs to be washed regularly, but it can get dry and wiry unless you have special products to treat it.</li>
            <li> I take a portion of about a dime (much less when my beard is a young and full of dreams), rub it between my hands for about 3-5 seconds to warm/disperse it, then lightly spread it through my beard like I am doing some heavy pondering.</li>
            <li> Can be used for daily purposes (I wash my beard daily even though it isn&#x27;t recommended) because I live in a humid, hot area and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this balm, and i actually get annoyed if i cant put it on right after my shower.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of days, but so far everyone has said my fierce beard is more tame.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot, but watch out, because it&#x27;s REALLY oily, so if you can&#x27;t wash your hands right after applying it, you&#x27;ll end up destroying everything you touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an open mind and reserve the right to alter my review in case further experience changes my perceptions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t start to soften your beard right away, but after a few days it is much softer.  </li>
            <li> and it gives it a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; and makes it not look so dull, if you are growing a beard, this is by far one of the best products to use or if you let your beard get kinda long before shaving it will do the same</li>
            <li> It is extremely reasonably priced for what you get, and you use very small amounts for a moderate (4-6&amp;#34;) full beard.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like a lot of grooming (low maintenance) but admitted this stuff helped his beard and mustache be a bit more tame.</li>
            <li> It looks more liquefied other than a sort of solid texture that it should be from the various videos i watched of the product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this and their other products in the future.</li>
            <li> but right now I see no real benefit to using it.</li>
            <li> I am just starting down the journey of growing a beard, this beard balm works well and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> My beard is pretty course and always feels dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It gets quite addicting to put on your facial hair and face due to the fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is needed and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> The regular scent to me is kind of like a mix of sandalwood with a very small amount of vanilla in it.</li>
            <li> Like most beardsmen (and anyone who knows a little bit about hair at all), I do not wash my beard every day, as doing so strips it of all of the natural oils which can lead to a dry, wiry, and coarse beard, which nobody wants.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, the moist feeling makes your beard feel so soft and enjoyable</li>
            <li> applying you need to rub it vigorously thru your hands until your hands are nice and shiny, then rub thru your entire beard, a little goes a long way in taming the beast!&lt;br /&gt;dont</li>
            <li> They sure put a lot of extra packaging on it to make the claim that they&#x27;re trying to be &#x27;all natural&#x27;, as part of being natural is not using excessive packaging.</li>
            <li> less is more, use too much and your beard is an oily mess, overly saturated and gross.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> What is left on my hands after applying to my beard I rub into the skin on my face and then clean it off rubbing into wet hair and brush it immediately.</li>
            <li> The balm has an interesting floral scent that is not overpowering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like many people have said before, a little bit (I&#x27;d say about a pea size portion) goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way :)  </li>
            <li> just make sure that you don&#x27;t apply to much a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Once straighten, they pretty much stay like that while  being soft and no greasy or heavy feeling to it.</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad, not especially good either.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came in the mail that I did not read anything (BIG MISTAKE) and went on directly opening the package to find it spilling a good amount on my shirt &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I personally love there subtle smell of anise that it has.</li>
            <li> Usually my skin is better as the temperature warms but that is actually when my dandruff started.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be as much if not more useful than quality beard oils.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell and it pretty much dissipates within a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people have complained about the smell, as this stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely the main scent that I could detect.</li>
            <li> They both smell exactly the same and achieve the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is decent, which is the only reason i keep putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of black licorice/anise, but the smell is tollerable, overall it&#x27;s a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li> a woman who has to smell the after-effects of anything that my significant other wears, I actually like the scent.</li>
            <li> The black licorice smell is noticeable for about 5 minutes but goes away quick.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, very subtle and I have a K-9 nose</li>
            <li> It does tend to separate into what looks little tiny balls of wax, but rub in together in your hands and it melts and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I go against the grain, in circles and then smooth it back down.</li>
            <li> my beard is very coarse and the balm helps smooth it down.</li>
            <li> However, it really hasn&#x27;t done much to help the stray hairs on my beard lay down.</li>
            <li> I know it seems like a little bit spread out over a full beard won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> Really cool image and neat little tin.</li>
            <li> I tried other very expensive beard oils and came to appreciate Honest Amish beard balm even more.</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other beard products before I find what is right for me.</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At first it looked like an awfully small can but after using it I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;ll last me quite a while because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only very minor gripe, is that I am not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> definitely softens your beard, shines a little more that I would like, actually got accused of glitter in my beard once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or waxy at all, it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave buildup, and it doesn&#x27;t give an unnatural texture--it just leaves your beard strong, soft, thick, and controlled.</li>
            <li> After a few days you&#x27;re beard will be super duper soft..</li>
            <li> Overall it is comparable to other beard balms, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was using a beard oil prior to trying this product, and was not one hundred percent satisfied due to still having problem areas with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a pretty strong licorice scent, but it only lasts for about 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I felt a little girly getting this(conditioner... for a beard nonetheless), but now I&#x27;m convinced I made a pretty decent choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this happened because it was in a box with huge air bubbles.</li>
            <li> I dont have a beard (real beard, long bushy)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a long beard, still this product softened it and feels very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolute necessity for long beards.  </li>
            <li> It barely has a smell, it has a hint of natural smell.</li>
            <li> Fantastic beard balm!&lt;br /&gt;I grow a beard every November, which usually stays with me through the duration of the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not to happy that I spent money on something that was in such poor shape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes there is a light scent (anise) but it is not overwhelming, or offensive.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and feel but for the price I don&#x27;t want something I have to mess with every few days.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but then again, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The other product that I bought simply labeled as &amp;#34;Beard Oil&amp;#34; will give similar results, but I felt that I had to use more than the recommended amount to get the same results.  </li>
            <li> My beard was pretty rough coming in</li>
            <li> The normal hair conditioners just simply don&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> I was using normal conditioner before, but after having used this I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I expect a conditioner I put in my beard to be absorbed by my beard, not fun all day.</li>
            <li> I needed something to calm it down and bring it under control.  </li>
            <li> This has helped calm down my ADHD hairs.  </li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s easy to use, definitely helps tame the hair and soften it.</li>
            <li> I am sending this back and will stick with a homemade beard oil that is pure jojoba and some essential oils.</li>
            <li> Mine has grown out enough that beard oil doesn&#x27;t tame it any longer, but this leaves my beard soft and civilized looking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell other than it smells like a new 2x4.</li>
            <li> It did make my beard quite soft though, but no more so than a few drops of good extra virgin olive</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, it does smell like licorice BUT a lot more subtle/fresh and slightly sweeter.</li>
            <li> It lasted forever - my husband used it almost daily for about a year before we had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and Beard Balm at the same time as I was new to the beard conditioners, waxes, etc.</li>
            <li> Now at the age of 61 a new beard surfaced and it is presently 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to grow a beard several times, but put an end to my new hirsute look when the itches attacked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would be great for styling crazy beards, but it works well as a regular leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> She may be getting tired of me telling her that, but with such an amazing smelling product in the hairs on my face, I&#x27;m going to keep telling her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to eliminate dry skin under your beard and make your beard look a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> It helps soooo much with your skin feeling dry under your beard.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> It felt like my beard was only marginally softer after using almost a whole tin in regular applications.</li>
            <li> It helps to control the wild hairs, and it accentuates the natural waves in my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> This stuff has brought so much life back to my beard definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> The downfall is that I actually could not stand the smell - at all - which really doesn&#x27;t work well when they want to put their face next to yours.</li>
            <li> My beard was driving me crazy and I was ready to shave it off, but after application, the beard softened and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> I am sure i can make it last at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The whole can fits entirely inside the palm of my hand with an inch of palm left on all sides.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and slightly of anise, but not overpowering and it does wear off during the day.</li>
            <li> Definitely softens very course facial hair and helps alot with itching.</li>
            <li> But within a few minutes of putting this on the smell quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> Honest Amish has the texture of a sugary paste with a light oily base.  </li>
            <li> I got this to tame and soften my full beard.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is something I thought would bother me, but it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My wife had difficulty smelling it after a few hours of application, and she is a super smeller.</li>
            <li> just got a raise, which I&#x27;d be dishonest if I said was as a result of my strong work ethic and lack of tardiness.</li>
            <li> It goes on rather easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> He is very sensitive to constant smells like deoderant or perfume, so I was nervous to order something like this.</li>
            <li> Every guy that wants to have a beard (or other facial hair) and ended up shaving it for his significant other needs this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily in my beard to an almost excessive amount, it leaves the hair feeling soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Left my beard shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I had MAJOR problems at the airport as a result of my decision to bring this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a third hoping the next one will be like the first not the second.  </li>
            <li> This made my beard feel like a mink i am sold will not use no other product</li>
            <li> Jojoba is usually quickly absorbed and my beard doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but something in this made it a mess.  </li>
            <li> The smell is sort of reminiscent of a fine black licorice but lacking the pungent smell of the actual candy.</li>
            <li> and my whiskers were still pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand, find it smells funny.</li>
            <li> I put off buying this for a while due to the consistent comments about the &amp;#34;licorice smell&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay once you get used to it, but it is extremely greasy no matter how little of it is used.  </li>
            <li> So instead I received the vegan beard balm which initially I was hesitant due to the review about its texture , but after using it for 2-3 weeks every other day I love it.</li>
            <li> He has become obsessed with this balm; which I am ok with!</li>
            <li> Also, major kudos on the packaging.</li>
            <li> My beard looked healthy, thick, and brimming with pride!</li>
            <li> smells good and a little goes a long way, but did not soften or tame the beard.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first week, by the second week the dry, flaky skin under my beard started to go away.</li>
            <li> It is not super oily and soaks right into your beard and skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s daunting to spend that much on so little product, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would last a little longer but appears to be absorbed quickly, haven&#x27;t been using it long so can&#x27;t address the dry skin issue.</li>
            <li> You take a very small amount of the paste and rub it between your fingertips to make a liquid that&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and you learn that the first time you use it and accidentally grab too much.</li>
            <li> I use there beard oil at night time and have switched to there heavy duty beard balm to use in the mornings to control the wild hairs a little better.</li>
            <li> While I was certainly surprised, I can say that a little bit of this product really does go a long way, and it really does help with growth and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I echo the general consensus here</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good for a bad, the smell and texture is more like something you would find in the automotive industry (thick, waxey, greasy texture)-</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t want to smell anything.</li>
            <li> Guys don&#x27;t generally go in for &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; oneself, but go for it with this product.</li>
            <li> Finally she came upon the clear plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> this one really works it last long gets rid of the crunchy crispy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried to grow out my beard in the past but the itching became unbearable and when I inevitably shaved I could see that my skin was genuinely irritated and flaky.</li>
            <li> product comes in a soft, yellowish solid form.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is providing enough control over my wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend says it makes my beard soft, loves it actually.</li>
            <li> definitely helps with the wild hairs and appears to thicken the beard up some.  </li>
            <li> I have a big beard and this balm helps keep it soft and manageable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Definitely keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> An added bonus to it&#x27;s daily use is how soft it&#x27;s made my hands.</li>
            <li> Left my beard soft.</li>
            <li> Only used once so far since I got it, so we&#x27;ll have to see the results.</li>
            <li> Not only does it condition, it also helps wrangle wild beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> For extra kicks, I recommend buying a beard brush made with soft boar bristles so you can brush in the balm as well as neatly brush your beard.</li>
            <li> Be careful how much of it you use.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it before bed at night and wake up with an extra soft beard.  </li>
            <li> My beard naturally grows in 1,000 different directions.</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> lasts forever too - you barely need to use any</li>
            <li> It left my beard soft and under control.</li>
            <li> when applied how everyone on the reviews recommended it barely softened my beard.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase it leaves the beard soft all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently at 4 or so weeks of growth and this product has tamed the itch and discomfort considerably.</li>
            <li> Only used once so far</li>
            <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband who&#x27;s had a beard of various styles and lengths for nearly 8 years.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product for the last week and so far it seems to be helping to soften my beard.  </li>
            <li> Goes back to the old days when everyone wore beards.</li>
            <li> Only been using it about a week so far</li>
            <li> barely attached</li>
            <li> I am a male 41 years old</li>
            <li> Once applied, it simply softens the beard and leaves it soft and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using it since December, and has barely scratched the surface of the product.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful and not apply too much</li>
            <li> It is not wet or greasy.</li>
            <li> Then , you can barely smell it, if at all.</li>
            <li> Guess I don&#x27;t look like a natural red head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a soft, cat hair face beard, then definitely pick up this product!</li>
            <li> As someone with fairly coarse beard hair, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in how manageable and soft my beard feels after just about a week.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews about the scent I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t like most colognes and licorice scents make me nauseated</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not overly scented, has like a stale beeswax kind of smell.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a weird scent</li>
            <li> This is actually kind of a difficult product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your beard will look nice but you&#x27;ll smell like a drunk hobo.</li>
            <li> Less is more (too much is a little greasy).</li>
            <li> Left beard very soft but a little greasy at first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a leave-in conditioner, as the site label asserts, so to really receive the complete benefit of using such a product, it is necessary to put it in sometime in the morning and leave it in for at least eight or nine hours, but I generally leave it there until right before I decide to climb into bed.</li>
            <li> I read that it very much resembles black licorice, which I think is spot on.</li>
            <li> ;  I work a tiny amount into my wet hair and it adds just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your hands if you run them through your hair later.</li>
            <li> Second, in either form (oil or solid) the product will coat your fingers and washing does not really get it off right away.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is necessary to moisturize the beard and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does make my beard softer, and as other reviewers have written, the scent eventually fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works, beard feels soft and has a slight scent of licorice.</li>
            <li> However, I discovered that for mysize of beard, I need less than a fingertip&#x27;s worth of balm to work through and condition my entire beard.</li>
            <li> My facial foliage is now so thick and strong</li>
            <li> Takes a few days to get used to the right amount you need depending on your beard&#x27;s thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this, despite having a beard for more than 30 years, but lately I&#x27;ve been letting it get a little longer and regular hair conditioners don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had a beard longer than a half inch.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice less itching first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about half way through my first jar.</li>
            <li> for the first half hour or so after applying, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I kept on getting whiffs of a waxy black licorice type aroma...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same tin for a solid near two months and I am a believer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first beard balm I have tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but I hope they do not have such an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> The tin is pretty big compared to two other balms I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Smell is not what some people make it out to be, it is a something different, but it only lasts a little bit and its NOT BAD.  </li>
            <li> If a few hairs decide to pop back out later in the day, or if I just want to bask in the softness and nice aroma, I sometimes pull out the comb and brush it a few times.</li>
            <li> Only tip warm in your hard 1st or the beads wont breaks down.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, works well with a faint black licorice scent.</li>
            <li> and putting this stuff on, it gets really soft and much easier to make neat with a little stroking.</li>
            <li> As for the cost being a little expensive, I was happy to see that it is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> did not expect an odor, and while I don&#x27;t mind it much, I am inclined to try other products.</li>
            <li> The greasiness described by other reviewers hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me, but I would expect that they are just using too much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, a dime sized amount every other day, for this product to work.</li>
            <li> Other than making me oily, I really can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s doing anything for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered in Summer and got a melted mess that didn&#x27;t congeal back right.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are right - this stuff does smell kinda strange.</li>
            <li> It really helps all the wild hairs and areas that grow faster lay down properly.</li>
            <li> When you trim every 3 days its hard to keep it from getting rough and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, no pun intended, I really can&#x27;t tell a whole lot about the product.  </li>
            <li> soft wires thanks to this balm) and only about an inch to an inch and a half in length.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed with the small amount you get, but after using it for several months Ive become impressed with how long it has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a different in the texture and quality of my whiskers from the initial use, and have continued to use the tin nearly every day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would even get particular patches on my chin where I could almost peel the dry skin off in one big piece.</li>
            <li> The tin arrived really dented on the bottom (almost crushed) but still sealed so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times so far I am definitely liking it.</li>
            <li> beard used to be scraggly and coarse, like an old sailor&#x27;s big toenail.</li>
            <li> Its a very subtle clove scent, you can&#x27;t smell it when you&#x27;re standing by him or he walks by, but when I hug him I can smell it :-)</li>
            <li> I have Firehouse Moustache Wax, live in the high desert, and that stays fairly firm even though I keep it in my pocket all day during the summer.    </li>
            <li> it smells like anise, very strongly, and then faintly.</li>
            <li> its a little greasy when you first put it in.</li>
            <li> Well, at first it is a little moist.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell for the first little bit till it wears off.</li>
            <li> Its a little waxy when it first goes on, but dries a bit over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little off-putting at first if it separates in shipping, but as the info card says - don&#x27;t worry about it.  </li>
            <li> My first impression of the balm itself was a little....</li>
            <li> Its a little oily at first, but after a couple of hours it soaks in.</li>
            <li> However, during the cooling process the ingredients that have a higher melting point congeal together first which requires me to work it a little longer on my beard to get the little wax beads to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways, and as a result, I suspect I&#x27;ll easily get another winter season out of my single container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used about a dime&#x27;s worth (for my thick, full beard) and even a few hours later my beard was greasy to touch.</li>
            <li> would not only recommend this, but I&#x27;m certainly buying some as a gift for other beardos.</li>
            <li> I have had a short goatee for a while now, and every time I tried to go for anything longer I wound up trimming it back down to fight those wild hairs that would shoot straight out.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a strong beard wash, this balm is as much as expected, if not more.</li>
            <li> If you put too much in at once it can make a dark beard look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I had tried basic lotions and other products but this one really  made a difference.</li>
            <li> Over time, the formula has congealed into the more common \\&quot;wax\\&quot; form that you see in their other products.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard 3-5 inches long and this balm just makes it feel so soft and conditioned all day.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only been using this for a few days but so far, he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Makes beard hair soft and keeps the hairs under control when beard is really long.</li>
            <li> she never expected me to call her back.</li>
            <li> I personally have a van dyke, and after a week of using this regularly my beard is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; my wife</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within the first few minutes</li>
            <li> Just grew a beard for the first time a few months ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown out my beard a few times, but this is my first experience using conditioner.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work the first few times you try it don&#x27;t throw it away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using Grandpa&#x27;s black tar soap to wash my beard, but am seriously considering using the Honest Amish soap after trying this product.</li>
            <li> Im curious to see how long exactly this batch will last me and</li>
            <li> but it is still pretty messy.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using it my beard is much softer!</li>
            <li> the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> I think if you can manage it the first few minutes after applying it, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with this stuff at first.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the container was super small for the price tag it holds, but now several months later I&#x27;ve realized a little bit goes</li>
            <li> I do not like though that it does not do much in the way of taming your beard or causing the hair to lay down</li>
            <li> It also make some stray hairs lie down, but does not offer as much control as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> The beard balm helps soften an lays my hairs down, can get greasy if you use too much</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews may have mentioned, this is not to take care of every little stray hair, but more to soften that rough beard and keep your skin from itching.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma it gives off at first when you apply it and that it only takes a little to go along way.</li>
            <li> It is also worth noting that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> using about half of this container which seems to last a rather long time, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price paid, I decided to try a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; beard product also in a can known as &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This does all that - my beard feels soft, if you use the right amount (a very SMALL amount - trial and error helps to find what that amount is for you)</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because I wanted to be able to manage my beard, in particular few of the whiskers which are hard to direct because they grow out instead of down with all the other whiskers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want a pine scent for a 1/2 hour then a soft, supple beard for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just got to the point where I have full coverage on my face, but I have problems with dryness, itchiness, random stray hairs sticking out in odd directions etc ... after using Honest Amish for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I only give 4 stars because it makes my beard really oily therefor I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if I&#x27;m using it right, but it seems like it because my beard is luxuriant.</li>
            <li> that out of the way, you&#x27;ll notice right off how small the container is.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is anise, but I don&#x27;t really think it smells like black licorice.  </li>
            <li> previously used oils in my beard and think this is so much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> The product works as advertised leaving the hair feeling much softer and less unruly.</li>
            <li> If too much of the balm is used, it will leave the beard looking slightly oily and over-conditioned in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use too much and it leaves the beard greasy, but any less</li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way, much longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is helping to keep the hair in check, and not stick straight out from my face, but this does help to keep the  hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I can smell it for first few min, but wife can not unless she is close enough to kiss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have always been able to grow a thick beard, and having spent 6 years in the military, I was never able to see it come to full fruition.  </li>
            <li> but it dissipates fairly quickly and it (slowly) starts to grow on you.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a chance despite the strong black licorice smell, since I paid a fortune for such a tiny little tin.  </li>
            <li> As far as the claims that it makes the wild hairs lay down....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it is standard that you have to melt the product down every two days to keep it ready for application.</li>
            <li> No more flakes, the beard is softer, a little shinier, and overall in better health than at anytime since I&#x27;ve had a beard, (over ten years now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have decided to try growing my beard out, as I normally shave every other week or so.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for the amount you get and doesn&#x27;t last that long after you apply it.</li>
            <li> He uses this conditioner 3-4 times a week and it helps so much by making his beard feel softer and less coarse.</li>
            <li> The tin that holds the conditioner is thin metal and dents easy but not a big deal</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s performance quickly made me overlook this initial singular negative aspect of the product.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty low melting point - which is stated by the company, and they say to just put in the fridge if that happens, but that can be kind of annoying in the summer months when the house is above 70 during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is coarse but not very long 1/4&amp;#34;-1/2&amp;#34;, however this stuff</li>
            <li> Not too oily, has that odd, not quite herbal, not quite chemical smell shared by dozens of other, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; body products that is neither bad nor good and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different beard conditioners, and while they worked in the short term, this is the only beard balm I have found that leaves my beard feeling soft and itch-free all day long.</li>
            <li> I used to have 6-7 long hairs come off every stroke, now I usually just get the one occassional hair, which means less hair is coming out, and spending more time growing.</li>
            <li> I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much and have a tendency to play with your beard as I do, you will end up making things you touch afterwards a little greasy/smudgy-looking.</li>
            <li> At least post the SMELL ODOR IS HIGH CLOVE OIL!!!</li>
            <li> The balm gives your beard a little shine and leaves it so much softer.  </li>
            <li> My whiskers are a little softer, but I don&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He really likes how little it takes to condition with this product and the smell is spicy, which he likes and so do I...</li>
            <li> Stinks to high heaven!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My beard did feel considerably smoother after about a week of daily applying; but I did also oil my beard with olive oil (balm in the morning, oil at night; my beard is very dry, so I need all the oils I can</li>
            <li> Also, the material doesn&#x27;t melt readily on your fingertips, leaving little tiny bits to melt into your beard.  </li>
            <li> used it for the first time last night and this morning, I have no itch and very little flakes in my beard (</li>
            <li> I do not notice any smell good or bad from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad ;-)</li>
            <li> It does seem to relax the wiry hairs pretty well for a few hours but wears off/dries out before to long require multiple applications throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I would say my whiskers are on the prolific side of things, but only about 4 inches long; I use slightly under a large lima bean-size amount, work it into a non-sedimentary oil on my palms, and then just rub it as evenly as I can throughout my beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s minor and disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I don&#x27;t love the scent - it has a slight licorice smell to it; however, this is relatively minor considering how well the product works.</li>
            <li> I started my beard two weeks before I bought this here, and it really calmed down the itch and irritation, and the anise aroma is faint and pleasant, and it fades slowly throughout the day, so that by mid-day, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> But it works great to tame my crazy beard.</li>
            <li> leaves your beard soft and tame with a natural look not too oily</li>
            <li> Overall a decent product that performs as advertised and leaves little to complain about.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this out over other products due to the amount of positive feedback.</li>
            <li> My Asian genes left me with facial hair that is very straight and thick.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong so I can use it on my beard without having to endure it too much, but I cannot put it on my mustache.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this stuff, it keeps his beard tame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to tame my beard and this really helps.</li>
            <li> The balm really helps to tame it.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt tame it as much as people claim and</li>
            <li> A little sweet, a little woody.  </li>
            <li> This product is priced high, for such a little container.  </li>
            <li> Little skeptical at first but after a day or so of use, HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this is an everyday (sometimes more than once a day) application for me.</li>
            <li> Use this when your beard is still wet from a shower or just soak your beard a little first.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way</li>
            <li> some other have said, it does have a bit of a natural smell.</li>
            <li> This is almost a trial size and will only last a short time when used on a long beard.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty big deal since I use heavy machinery outdoors and have rough, calloused hands.</li>
            <li> It is as good as if not better than the expensive facial lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for me to pay for a beard product, but you can tell its high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> They dissipate fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s hard to put something on your face when you object to the smell!</li>
            <li> Shower conditioners just doesn&#x27;t last very long and the beard oils tend to be very greasy and messy.</li>
            <li> What comes is a small tin containing a very granular and almost gritty paste.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, wondering if this stuff would really work.  </li>
            <li> At first I was not thrilled with the product, but after experiencing the resulting lustrous beard it helps create, I felt differently.</li>
            <li> ALSO, just a hint that I learned recently to help manage your beard, after you shower style your beard the way you&#x27;d like it to stay while it&#x27;s still wet and let it dry naturally</li>
            <li> Secondary to me stroking my beard is a significant other being touched by my beard when I give them a kiss and leaving them with greasy skin.</li>
            <li> This was pretty expensive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the course beard that much just yet.</li>
            <li> My only small gripe is the scent, which is very not overpowering, but noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell at first but it quickly grew unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have about 3&#x27; of length currently, so that should let you gauge about how long the tin will last for you.  </li>
            <li> , I keep my beard short and this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> A tiny tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only problem is that a tin doesn&#x27;t last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> I tend to use a good-sized portion, particularly as my beard gets longer and before I transition over to the Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use a good-sized portion, particularly as my beard gets longer and before I transition over to the Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t smell it at all after a few minutes, but if you have a decent &#x27;stache you can taste it throughout the day-</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and health but it broke my face out had to stop using it, and it smelled weird not bad just like anis oil</li>
            <li> little goes a long way with this product, and even though the tin is small, you really don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my beard tends to be unruly and course past a certain length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is easy, put a little of the product in the palm of your hands, rub together until the thick waxy product turns into an oil, then rub into beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product after reading reviews and knowing a few bearded comrades who have used this beard balm.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard pretty close cropped, but even at that length it can be prickly,  dull and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; gray.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, when I first received the Beard Balm container, I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> No beard oil I have ever purchased did anything to subdue the terribly itchy, dry, flaky skin under my magnificent face fur.</li>
            <li> but I recently started to let it grow thicker, and as a result my facial hair and face started to get dry.</li>
            <li> My score for this product might be different if I maintained a beard year-round; however, my knowledge is limited as I temporarily develop facial hair annually in order to have it removed along with the hair on my head as a fund-raising incentive for the supporters of a national campaign that raise money for childhood cancer research.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like the smell that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I really can tell a difference in the softness of my beard, but does help grooming.</li>
            <li> I ordered, and toughed out the two days with witch hazel and various other general purpose lotions that just weren&#x27;t doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while it did help with the itching, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really made it softer.</li>
            <li> The whole thing comes in a small burlap &amp;#34;ditty bag.&amp;#34; Just do it.</li>
            <li> I ride a lot in a Jeep with no top or doors and this stuff conditions very well all day.</li>
            <li> The package may look small but you don&#x27;t need much so it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I like the smell though it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I use it after every shower, as my beard is only like 2 inches long or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> On my third can now and will keep using as long as I keep the beard.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because of the price you get a can the size of a flat golf ball for $20 lower the price</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t grown a beard long enough to speak to its styling properties yet</li>
            <li> have a long beard (relatively, about six inches from chin to tip).</li>
            <li> My beard is about 2\\&quot; long, coarse and tangly.</li>
            <li> and it did not make my beard lay flat.  </li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d make a long lasting cologne with this scent, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to feel any conditioning effects yet, but it does make my beard behave.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I will use it as long as I have facial hair</li>
            <li> Girls smile a little bit longer, that the sun shines a little bit brighter, and my beard smells like I care about myself now.</li>
            <li> bought it for two main purposes: To tame the rogue hairs, and help soften my beard.  </li>
            <li> Once I got out, I started trying to grow my beard as thick and full as I could, but my skin became extremely irritated underneath.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great smell, though not bad, and you&#x27;ll be smelling it all day.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised by the small container but a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully it&#x27;s not particularly potent--unless someone else is within inches of your beard, you&#x27;re likely to be the only one to notice.</li>
            <li> Though I can&#x27;t prove it, I believe at night while I was asleep he was going out, robbing liquor stores and pushing down old women in the street.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my beard in shape and keeps the wild hairs down.</li>
            <li> I also do shave my head so shaving my face is just a natural swipe down from the head, but I decided to give the beard a try.</li>
            <li> Added a little bit of hold and made my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this beard balm for a week so far makes my beard softer and less itchy.</li>
            <li> I have really dry facial skin</li>
            <li> Easy to use with a faint scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps keep my beard soft and less frizzy during the day.  </li>
            <li> The dry patch I spoke of before is totally gone.</li>
            <li> So, in short, this balm has helped my dry and flaky chin skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like black liquorice and lemons in a old wood trunk</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is very oily.</li>
            <li> Skin still was dry, I don&#x27;t like the smell, and my beard didn&#x27;t feel any different.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin, and my beard was visibly flaky (especially in my mustache and chin area).  </li>
            <li> Beard is soft with a slight gloss and it even moisturizes your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a larger size, as the tin is actually smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Initially I didn&#x27;t like the smell, maybe expected something different.</li>
            <li> My only problem was the tin was dented on both sides, which makes it harder to screw back on.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was I had to be careful cleaning your hands afterwords as I found out when touched around my eye hours later</li>
            <li> so I will probably move up to the heavy duty in the near future</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far, but it seems to moisten/hydrate my beard upon application.  </li>
            <li> The tin was a bit smaller than I had expected but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Thick, soft, lush, well coiffed.</li>
            <li> My parents are Dominican and my facial hair is very curly, thick, and wiry.</li>
            <li> it smells weird and is really strong.</li>
            <li> Making my beard nice and soft, what&#x27;s to hate?</li>
            <li> For me the application is key, I put it in after a shower, before i get out of the shower I put the water on as hot as I can handle and spray my beard down, then as soon as I get out I rub the product into my damp beard, and let it air dry after its all dried out</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using this for the first time, try using a little less than what you think you&#x27;ll need, otherwise you could end up a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Every single time I come back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now, and although some mention the greasiness that can be there, it&#x27;s normally due to using too much.  </li>
            <li> I was pushed to the ground by an agent who was approaching from behind, handcuffed and detained in a small room for many hours.</li>
            <li> After applying maybe half a dime size amount into my beard the smell was real clean and faint.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s conditioning properties will tame the wirey wild hairs that shoot out at all different angles.  </li>
            <li> The balm is very simple to use and helps tame those wild stray hairs that want to grow outward instead of with the rest of the beard growth.  </li>
            <li> A weird cross promotion with Duck Dynasty makes me take this otherwise great brand slightly less seriously.</li>
            <li> The smell is only apparent for a couple hours after application then goes away, not that it&#x27;s strong or unpleasant in any way.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it does not travel well due to its low melting point.</li>
            <li> probably explore other similar products, with different scents, consistencies, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use blue beards revenge and before that I used some super expensive leave in conditioner I stole from my mom back home.</li>
            <li> Helped keep the beard thick and healthy, and tame down those crazies that just don&#x27;t want to behave.</li>
            <li> Because of the natural oils, it does give my hair an oily sheen after application that can rub off a little so use in moderation.</li>
            <li> There is a little shine, the beard is easier to control, feels soft and</li>
            <li> I have a short beard, and in the summer and winter, my beard tends to get dry which causes my skin to dry and flake.</li>
            <li> The main reason I was in the market for a product like this was because I wanted to get my beard more under contol, which implies using wax instead since the balm made no mention of using it for styling purposes, and the usual grooming just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> It turns into a kind of oil, which I thought would be bad for my combination dry/oily skin - I tend to stay away from oily products.</li>
            <li> it is too much labor to apply and at least the one I got</li>
            <li> shattering disappointment, and you put it in a tin, you would not be able to tell the difference between that and this product.</li>
            <li> My friend came over and clearly had trouble restraining herself from stroking him.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a hot day when this arrived on my doorstep and the contents were almost completely liquefied.</li>
            <li> I will be buying both for as long as I have a beard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a long beard</li>
            <li> It always drives me nuts when it gets about that long.  </li>
            <li> He also has sensitive skin prone to breakouts and has not had any trouble with this product clogging his pores...or mine.</li>
            <li> This balm has a strange texture.</li>
            <li> The smell fades not too long after application, but I could see it being a turn off for someone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Winter time means hibernation time, which means I use it as an excuse to let myself go for 5 months out of the year.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband months ago and his beard has grown to be about 4 inches long now.</li>
            <li> It also seems to go a long way toward holding in a bit of moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went for so long without this.</li>
            <li> surgical precision, the agent pulled apart my carefully packed items, including some male undergarments which were a surprise for my soon-to-be wife.  </li>
            <li> With latex covered hands she carefully pried open the zip-lock and fished out the plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I go about a week or so between shaves and it gets kinda long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This left my beard shiny and wet.</li>
            <li> I defend freedom in remote parts of the world and defend it with only two things: a knife and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not wild about the smell, but getting used to it.</li>
            <li> will order this product as long as I have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully that will be along long time.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not overpowering and the scent tends to wear off before long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Last year I let my beard grow with minimal trimming from August to December.</li>
            <li> My beard is fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li> but I can say without a doubt that as long as I have a beard</li>
            <li> so I had to make a minor change.</li>
            <li> My beard is not overly long.</li>
            <li> , I will continue buying this product as long as I have a beard (or, forever).</li>
            <li> When I rubbed the material between my hands it went from a solid state that resembled wet sand to a semi-liquid cream.</li>
            <li> My beard is getting quite long</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> My beard is not instantly soft.  </li>
            <li> like it does is strange.</li>
            <li> but this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not gonna make this too long</li>
            <li> Container smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the balm itself</li>
            <li> but considering my beard is around 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few days and beards feeling doll hair soft already.</li>
            <li> ; long, who knows how long it will grow at my age.</li>
            <li> Arrived two days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> As to long term effects, too soon to say.  </li>
            <li> But, I am in a mood where I want to see how long I can get it.</li>
            <li> I just expected an obvious benefit, and don&#x27;t feel like I got one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my bathroom is directly hit by the afternoon sun, so on the afternoon I first tried the product, it was soup again.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way; for new growth I&#x27;d suggest a dime-sized dab massaged into a wet beard.</li>
            <li> but in that form it was gross to look at, gross to touch and the oils dripped down my fingers like melted butter.</li>
            <li> I noticed one thing immediately: despite applying it as an oily liquid, it would dry in minutes and create ugly flakes in my beard that I would then have to wash out - effectively nullifying it as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this product 4 stars because even though it does seem to improve my beard, it does so in such a slight way that I could be just tricking myself into thinking its doing something</li>
            <li> But I do like to use it regularly (not necessarily every day, but at least every other day), and I&#x27;ve got a lot of beard real estate to cover here -</li>
            <li> My beard in the early stages tends to be a bit scraggly and stiff.  </li>
            <li> Smell is masculine and not strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance smell but it is naturally scented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get one of their other products too because my beard is starting to get too long to control with just this.</li>
            <li> Once she gets to be about 1&amp;#34; or so long ~ My hair follicles start to get extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> The texture is like little beads, but after rubbing a little bit on your hands it liquefies fast.</li>
            <li> Helps to tame the wild beast.</li>
            <li> Still doesn&#x27;t do much to tame the wild hairs.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to work with, yet still worth the effort...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so not sure how this would work for me.</li>
            <li> Very natural but not overwhelmingly crunchy.</li>
            <li> but you really do need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but after I try something different I will repost.....</li>
            <li> This brand initially drew my attention, primarily due to it being an Amish product.  </li>
            <li> still trying other brands which all seem the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the texture or unique fragrance or random chance, but I was pulled out of line as they conducted a thorough search of my things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use every other day, and only requires about the size of a dime of product</li>
            <li> You really one need to apply a very small amount.</li>
            <li> However it definitely keeps my beard manageable and not harmful on your skin like other products.</li>
            <li> I might try some other brands just because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> When I finally use up this tin, I&#x27;m not even going to look around at other possibilities, I&#x27;ll just order this again, and again, and again......</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to make the jump from having a beard to &amp;#34;growing my beard out&amp;#34; for about 2 years I had a beard grown that I trimmed every other week to keep it at a size 5 on my hair clipper setting.</li>
            <li> Originally I got the wrong order</li>
            <li> I even had to give it to him earlier than christmas because he was unsatisfactied with other products.</li>
            <li> I believe my can will last me a 3 months using just a dab every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products but none are close to matching up to this quality.  </li>
            <li> It is different than any other type of conditioner that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because his beard is really coarse and prickly, while my skin is softer and quite sensitive, making it really hard for us to kiss at all.</li>
            <li> smell like very strange oil being kept on you at all times</li>
            <li> To start, I don&#x27;t have a very long beard, but I like to let my beard grow for 1-3 weeks before shaving it.  </li>
            <li> I asked my wife to \\&quot;smell my beard\\&quot;, which out of context is a very strange request.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my beard isn&#x27;t very long, but it didn&#x27;t seem to get any of the stray hairs under control.</li>
            <li> My skin as well has been affected by the product, I no longer have any itching from new growth or stiff wirey hairs!</li>
            <li> It did not work overnight, by beard was so bad it took 3-4 days for it to get better and then only after using it 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I apply after the shower getting my beard towel dry</li>
            <li> Sometimes my beard could pass as pubes glued to my face when dry.</li>
            <li> My Foo mancho while deployed was getting dry and sticking out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend uses this to prevent his beard from getting flaky from dry skin under his beard.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use it my beard gets dry.  </li>
            <li> And keeps my beard from being dry, itchy or flaky.</li>
            <li> Without it, it feels dry and wiry.  </li>
            <li> My beard was a bit dry</li>
            <li> I blow dry and brush my beard.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my dry flakey skin under my beard has started to go away too.</li>
            <li> Cured my dry skin under my beard overnight.  </li>
            <li> does what it says, after rubbing in beard i put it on my dry skin areas and it helps.</li>
            <li> I needed something to solve the dry brittle feeling of my beard had and this stuff did just that.</li>
            <li> I do not have dry skin/flakes in my beard and</li>
            <li> Then just apply some of this balm (once dry)</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin problems in the winter, and while I&#x27;ve always wanted to grow my beard during this time of year, it also tends to dry my face.</li>
            <li> I decided to I needed to do something for my under-beard dry skin.</li>
            <li> my beard is curly an sometimes dry.</li>
            <li> It has helped with the dry skin under my beard that I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> Beard does not look dry</li>
            <li> Keeps the dry skin at bay like a boss.</li>
            <li> I use to dry out in the evening, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> My beard use to be extremely dry</li>
            <li> I dry off the beard that I just washed in the shower.</li>
            <li> Subtle fragrance and gentle shine.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus benefit, it has helped my dry hands heal.</li>
            <li> You can also use it if you have dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any bearded folks with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would dry a bit faster.</li>
            <li> Beards are a whole different ball game when you have a downy blanket on your face, and your lady friend will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves his thick facial hair soft and</li>
            <li> A single tin will last a few weeks of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While driving, I looked down at my steering wheel and noticed one side was very shiny and slick.  </li>
            <li> One single spritz of cologne is way stronger than this stuff.  </li>
            <li> During that time, I never received a single compliment about my beard that did not come from my wife.</li>
            <li> I can now leap tall buildings in a single suspendered workbooted bound.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I like it plain and simple.</li>
            <li> If smelling like an Amish is wrong than I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was initially concerned because the tin is a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell can be a little much.</li>
            <li> of this conditioner into a small plastic bottle and placed the bottle into a clear bag as TSA guidelines dictate.  </li>
            <li> I usually would just let my beard go natural.</li>
            <li> It ticks all the marks; handmade in small batches with all natural ingredients, no animal testing.</li>
            <li> No more wild hairs.</li>
            <li> Despite other reviewers it seems to last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really mind the smell at all like some other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard with any length to it try Honest Amish, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> wife always complained that my mustache was so coarse it made her eyes water when the little hairs poked her upper lip, near her nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the size of the container but don&#x27;t worry, I have had this same little guy for over a month and have barely used the top layer.</li>
            <li> and then I trim it down to just about naked.</li>
            <li> does help his (curly) beard to lay down quite a bit, especially when it&#x27;s growing out.</li>
            <li> It helps keep some stray hairs down, but I keep my beard fairly short.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders to bring the beard back down to earth after getting beaten up by the wind on motorcycle rides.</li>
            <li> Warming it up just helps in getting down deep in the hair and on the skin.  </li>
            <li> What is left on my hands after I rub down my face, scalp and hands, I rub on my Dachshund.</li>
            <li> if you want to switch it up add a drop of essential oil to your beard rub down.</li>
            <li> - you will get a lot of use out of this little tin, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this tin can last months.</li>
            <li> Not a big container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Beard Balm is very soft - not liquid, just not as hard as the wax.  </li>
            <li> Huge red spots of dry, irritated skin would thrive under the thick whiskers, and I would have to itch all over my face like crazy, especially the upper lip area in my mustache.  </li>
            <li> It helps my beard stay soft and lay down just a little but has no hold quality.</li>
            <li> (I expected more of a lotion than an oil), and the smell is just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> I have a bushy beard and this deff helps, the only problem is after on week it&#x27;s half gone.</li>
            <li> However, as soon as I put a small amount, enough to cover the pad of my middle finger tip, I could feel it &#x27;melting&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Gritty and smells a bit like black licorish.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a random part of a gift for my significant other who was trying out a beard.</li>
            <li> Around the 5th or 6th day I noticed a slight break out of acne, no big deal it happens.</li>
            <li> All you need is dab about the size of your thumbnail (less with a short beard).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone thinking about growing a beard, and my room mate will be trying it out in a few weeks once his beard gets long enough.</li>
            <li> but I am thinking about buying small vials of essential oils to change up the scent perhaps even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell which is annoying the first couple of days</li>
            <li> He has been growing it out for over a year, but noticed it was getting dry and not much longer.</li>
            <li> After a month I&#x27;m only half way thru the tin.</li>
            <li> (I personally wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s black licorice, though I can see how some people could arrive there.)</li>
            <li> 30 days later, lo and behold, I had gained between a quarter and a half inch of beard length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are essential oils in it so there will be a slight oily feel.</li>
            <li> It made my short stubbly moustache hairs softer and less bristle like.</li>
            <li> I usually rub two fingers in the balm and then smear it together in my left palm and apply in sections to my beard, takes about 2-3 minutes to work through my entire beard.</li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s less than that, beards are the same.</li>
            <li> Me being a black male</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and Bluebeard&#x27;s Beard Saver, which is much less greasy.</li>
            <li> Being half black and Chinese, it was growing in kinda coarse and curly..</li>
            <li> Been using daily for about 4 months, still not even half gone.  </li>
            <li> Which means I&#x27;m not particularly fond of it, but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only request would be it come in a small container to keep in my pocket and a much larger container for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Simply because my previous employers didn&#x27;t allow them.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of black licorice mixed with Jager (yes...the liquor)</li>
            <li> His beard is quite coarse and fluffy when long.</li>
            <li> After just one use, my hairs feel less coarse as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did wonders for the itchiness of his face and inclination toward ingrown hairs from the odd assortment of textures he has from his mixed heritage.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard softer and only has a slight scent to it.</li>
            <li> The one problem I have found is that I left it in a hot car during the summer and the ingredients separated a bit when it cooled, it formed into hard little nodules and got a little &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Is that vague and mildly offensive to some?  </li>
            <li> I get very dry, flaky skin under my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you are serious about your beard.</li>
            <li> be prepared to make a mess though, it comes as a solid and you liquefy it in your hands.</li>
            <li> Balm does NOT equal wax; try the heavy balm or simply wax to keep your hairs down</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be overpowering (I normally hate scented anything), but I listened to the other reviewers and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry / rough beard</li>
            <li> I expect at this rate of usage this little can will last me a while</li>
            <li> Just wish the can was a little bigger..  </li>
            <li> Only made it a little oily.</li>
            <li> This little tin is going to last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try something with a little citrus next time.</li>
            <li> I ordered several items to put together a little &amp;#34;beard care&amp;#34; gift set for my husband.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you may be combing out little nuggets of product.is gritty in the can.</li>
            <li> The 4th day the product became unusable and left little ball like piece everywhere in my beard.</li>
            <li> I notice a small bead of the stuff that hasn&#x27;t been worked in but nothing major.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long long way towards taming the beard and giving it that little extra something.  </li>
            <li> I simply pinch a little bit out, wet my hands and rub my hands together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually natural oils and not some hard paste that doesn&#x27;t lather or spread</li>
            <li> This is hard at 60degrees and nearly melted at 70.</li>
            <li> The conditioner typically lasts me the entire workday whereas other brands I&#x27;ve tried tend to wear out after an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> and it was a hard wax, now its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its ok ill probably order again.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m not sure a tin will last me terribly long, and I kinda wish it was bigger, but maybe I&#x27;m being a little greedy.  </li>
            <li> no worries for that.&lt;br /&gt;The can looks small, but you really need very little product...</li>
            <li> It did marginally soften up my beard, but it has an overwhelming smell of licorice to it which I suppose isn&#x27;t so bad if you like that smell, but I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li> Overall waste of money and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The setting:  Late October, USA; East Coast, 50 deg F, clear skies, 2:08 am.  </li>
            <li> Some time ago, I purchased this product as a bearded man living a lonely life.  </li>
            <li> The only cons I think of is that I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey (but it did last me at least for a month).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any real softening after 2.5 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use just enough and apply long past after you think you used up on your fingers.</li>
            <li> It helps with a kinky beard like mine minimally.</li>
            <li> It just looks wet sometimes.</li>
            <li> did not soften beard-did not do what I expected</li>
            <li> and I have only been using it a few weeks (2-3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I literally get burns on my chin that are irritated, red, and peel with dead flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep my beard as well kempt as I expected.</li>
            <li> but as it is it lasts me roughly 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I discovered it a few months into growing a beard last year.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, would buy ten times over!</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints or regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different beard moisturizers from shower conditioner to beard oils.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong worth every penny.</li>
            <li> However there is not much hold as it is a conditioner not a styling gel.</li>
            <li> No, absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> The product does what its entended too but the smell is not very pleseant.</li>
            <li> I use it roughly 3 times a week</li>
            <li> This can add a few hours to a simple beer run, so I would suggest adding an hour to almost every task that involves going into the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works about 80% as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks of daily use</li>
            <li> Used to grow there but stopped for an unknown reason.</li>
            <li> The beard still is coarse, wirey and seems dried out, even after applying liberal amounts of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Split up container into a few smaller containers so if one melts out, you have backup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using dandruff shampoo/conditioner solely for my beard for the last few years, I still hadn&#x27;t managed to lick the dandruff/scratchiness demons and softness can always be improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard for the last fifteen years with few exceptions.</li>
            <li> So, ordered, and the balm arrived a few days later, all spiffily wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Ive had a beard for over 10 yrs, and i always assumed that it just was supposed to be rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no perceptible change in beard softness, manageability, or sheen.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The texture is like wet sand, until you work it into your finger and it liquefies.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> So I bought this despite the mixed reviews I read about it being greasy and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I rotate a few products but use this several times a week.</li>
            <li> So after I opened the can of &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; that turned out to be liquid oil that spilled on the front of my shirt, I noticed a pink slip of paper inside the bag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a close trimmed beard (its an actual beard, not one of those &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t shave for few days&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I expected quicker results</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had to do this two times in the few months that I&#x27;ve had this product.</li>
            <li> This product did not produce the results expected or promised.</li>
            <li> end, ready to shave off another fledgling beard because it was irritating my face</li>
            <li> It calms my beard, but didn&#x27;t control as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> Before using beard balm my beard was scraggly and rough.</li>
            <li> Enhances curling, be careful of build-up, as it becomes greasy.  </li>
            <li> but it does remind me a lot of the amish country where i spent time as a child...</li>
            <li> So can I assume it&#x27;s just an empty container?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days but already seeing improvement in my steel wool.</li>
            <li> Came way faster than expected, too.</li>
            <li> Just be really careful if you have a nut allergy.</li>
            <li> Makes it much harder to use.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected it have the consistency of wax instead.  </li>
            <li> It is not really for styling but is all about conditioning.</li>
            <li> Initially I wanted the heavy beard balm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;No problem&amp;#34;, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just put this in the fridge for a bit to let it firm up and that should be the end of it.&amp;#34; I pulled it out of the fridge later and looked at the product again</li>
            <li> and it looked exactly as I expected it to</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try the heavy duty hold next.</li>
            <li> It goes away in a few minutes after applying, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li> There was an initial &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; to it, but after a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> have discussed this product with a few friends who were put off by the possible &#x27;scent&#x27; of the product.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained of the smell, but I think it is very subtle and fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was even more doubtful when it arrived and the can is much smaller than the picture appears.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no simple task for a construction worker forced to wash beard daily.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but this small tin does last a very long time because you use a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> It will NOT keep down unruly hairs or help you style a long bear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the product works over the long term, because I only used it once due to the off putting scent.  </li>
            <li> + people can&#x27;t be wrong, right?</li>
            <li> dab will do for each section and, while it is a tad on the strong side, the smell is not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It did help with the wild hair and itch, but it also took care of the spit ends, softened the hair, made it start growing like mad and thickened it up very noticeably.</li>
            <li> I started using this when my beard was about half an inch long.</li>
            <li> The simple truth is that this has done nothing to soften nor tame my beard hairs - it does not seem to penetrate at all.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order this, not only to help tame my beard hairs but also because I thought &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li> That is a whole other ball game as well.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that it feels intensely itchy for a little while after application.  </li>
            <li> Only giving it 4/5 because it&#x27;s a little pricey for such a small canister.</li>
            <li> The consistency is exactly what I need to help keep those few wild hairs under control on cold windy days.  </li>
            <li> I was initially surprised by how small the tin was, however, a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different but not powerful.</li>
            <li> I will try other products, not because I&#x27;m unsatisfied but just curious as to what is out there.</li>
            <li> I use a portion a little larger than an average pea when my beard is damp after a shower, and my beard is never oily.</li>
            <li> I basically follow the instructions as far as application, but I usually apply a little bit at the time through out the day.  </li>
            <li> It was also a little difficult to turn into full liquid form in my hands.</li>
            <li> his glorious mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little deeper than I expected which definitely made the price seem less of a punch in the wallet.</li>
            <li> I also found it to be overall not very effective on my beard.</li>
            <li> Softer, easier to brush, staying in place, and cut down on &#x27;loose&#x27; hairs sticking up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for roughly the past 6 months, daily, while I grew a beard from scratch.  </li>
            <li> The balm has a subtle scent and leaves his beard feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and smoother.</li>
            <li> It only takes a dose about like a small pea rubbed between wet hands to cover my face.</li>
            <li> the smell is subtle yet enigmatic.</li>
            <li> The container is small, but the amount used per application is minimal, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> You only need a small pinch of the stuff to rub into your wet beard.</li>
            <li> but it definitely made my beard softer and itch a little less.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little truly does go a long way.</li>

            <li> As other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Oh and don&#x27;t be concerned when you get the container and its seems small - it doesn&#x27;t take much when applying to your beard so although its a small container it goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> the hairs are starting to lay down!!</li>
            <li> When you think real hard, when you think real soft, and even when you&#x27;re not thinking at all!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the products other benefits</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, Instantly softens and conditioned my beard.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I will try other waxes to compare.</li>
            <li> and he only uses a small dime size dab of it each day.</li>
            <li> First off, I never went through any uncomfortable itchy stage as had always happened before.</li>
            <li> The balm is tan in color and appears to be tiny beads, I usually use the side of a dime.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trust my beard to any other conditioning product.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty skeptical that they would do what they promise.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of couscous at first (weird isn&#x27;t it?)</li>
            <li> No residue as in other products.  </li>
            <li> I found comments in other reviews about.less</li>
            <li> While the can is small you use such a small amount that it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the other reviews and bought it about six months ago.</li>
            <li> The smell of the balm doesn&#x27;t leave and conflicts with any other lotions or colognes. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about the claim that it helps hair growth, but maybe that has something to do with the fact that it is moisturizing your beard...</li>
            <li> Only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with beard and face health (no more itchyness and fewer splits).</li>
            <li> Price is on par with other beard balms.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to apply this to a damp beard and the dampness helps the small amount of the product go even further.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to apply this to a damp beard and the dampness helps the small amount of the product go even further.  </li>
            <li> and it is a bit greasier that my other preferred brand.</li>
            <li> However, with this product, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> also steal it every other morning to use as lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about beard oils and other products</li>
            <li> I would recommend the other product on this site.  </li>
            <li> He also said that a little dab goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> If there were other options besides scent-free, I&#x27;d consider those.</li>
            <li> but it shouldnt be over powering at all if you only put a small amount on.</li>
            <li> What works extremely well is Mane</li>
            <li> It takes but a small dab to add life to your facial hair.</li>
            <li> ;, I don&#x27;t know if I am allowed to discuss other products by name?</li>
            <li> Have yet to try their other products</li>
            <li> Simply take a small amount with your finger tip, and rub well in between your hands.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any other benefits of using this product though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but i dont think im gonna use it anymore due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I ended up with hndlebars moustache wax to try basically due to price.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> usually keep my goatee short</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> The other reason I gave it 4 stars rather than</li>
            <li> It is a clove like smell with hints of other scents.</li>
            <li> This is truly not a wax like product, a little goes a long way though!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to purchase other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Like other researchers, I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m dying to try their other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But beware, a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Nor do any other girls I&#x27;ve asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, he loves it</li>
            <li> It also does not have the petroleum-like residue that other lotions do.</li>
            <li> Weeks later, I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After repeatedly applying the product as instructed (by taking a small dab and melting it between your hands, then rubbing it through your beard)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting on products I&#x27;ve ordered from other vendors from 2.5 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I want it to flow and keeps those defiant hairs in line with the other.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a funny, whimsical gift, and you can use it on your bangs if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> will note that the user instructions recommend using this once every other day or something</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not just saying that, other people comment on it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it maybe every other day.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount in the palm of your hand that you rub together until the product become liquefied</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Smells like the natural butters used (if you&#x27;ve ever smelled shea butter you know what I mean) with an ever so slight peppermint/anise smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of not noticing a difference, I realized how little I had actually used.  </li>
            <li> I expect the little tin will last a few months of twice weekly applications (maybe three times) and then I&#x27;ll see how I feel after its been gone for a while.</li>
            <li> in the last few tins the conditioner has been beaded up into little balls.</li>
            <li> and/or their Heavy Duty Beard balm (which seems to last a little longer into the day), I won&#x27;t be buying again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, with both this product but also that with so many positive reviews, it still failed me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the beard game.</li>
            <li> As for some people on here saying the smell is to strong, I don&#x27;t think it smells bad</li>
            <li> Keeping it at room temperature will allow it to harden in a few hours, or you can put it in the fridge for a few minutes, so melting is not a big deal if you&#x27;re at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using much less, but it still happens to a minimal degree.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a good smell either, but it doesn&#x27;t last so long as to be cloying.</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical of this item, but bolstered by all of its positive reviews, I decided to give it a try for the sake of dealing with the three nightmarish aspects of beard ownership: dandruff, scratchiness, and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, without much benefit and a lot of money for a small amount, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to apply and rub in and unless you do extremely vigorously then you will be left with blobs all over your face.</li>
            <li> I use it to control my beard, however,  my wife uses it on the end of her dry, thick long hair.</li>
            <li> From the product description, it is apparent that the manufacturers stand behind their product and will accept returns for unsatisfied customers (as long as at least 50% of the product is left).  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty faint and goes away after a little while so it won&#x27;t overpower any cologne or other fragrance you might use.</li>
            <li> The price tag seems steep when you receive the small can, but once you use it for a week you will understand why I will never try any other product for as long as I have a face blanky.</li>
            <li> , so I use just a little bit -- a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a very small amount, and when mixed with wet hands it spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My beard looks a little wet after applying but it soon dries.</li>
            <li> I was getting split ends in my beard and it was feeling a little rough.</li>
            <li> rub in a little bit of it every night after showering &amp; shampooing hair &amp; beard, while beard is still damp or wet.</li>
            <li> The jar is small but will last a while, you only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and i am letting it grow out long,and it is was getting wild looking with hairs sticking out all over.</li>
            <li> Previously I find myself trimming around a week in due to the itching and uncomfortableness</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been  a little over a week and already my beard is beginning to feel softer, which makes the wife happier, and no more itching.</li>
            <li> A little weird at first</li>
            <li> I feel a little Amish now...and kinda guilty for using this Mac to post a review on Amazon ;)</li>
            <li> Put just a little on when I get up (a little bit goes a very long way) and comb in.</li>
            <li> first I thought it was a bit expensive for a small container, however a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> when I first starting use it, it wasn&#x27;t bad - just noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were also several reviews that complained about the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It can become pretty disastrous if left untended.  </li>
            <li> It showed up several days late.  </li>
            <li> (not sure it would seal fully) especially after a few drops.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I cannot use it very often.</li>
            <li> At least I would have a cool tin if it failed.  </li>
            <li> I helped me get rid of those random hairs that would stick straight out.</li>
            <li> I predict at least a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t care much for the product.</li>
            <li> Also, while the product comes in a small tin, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way with a damp beard.</li>
            <li> Just takes a small bit on a finger for my long goatee.</li>
            <li> I keep a shorter beard and a small amount of this balm goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference if I fail to apply it.</li>
            <li> Leaves small granules in beard, makes beard oily not soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small, 2\\&quot; wide tin of grainy yellow goop, but a small dab lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Instead, we received this disgusting stuff that you have to dig out of the container with your fingernails that goes on smooth as granulated sugar mixed with butter, only clumpier.  </li>
            <li> Makes a shiny dark look</li>
            <li> My beard hairs, which are rather thick individually, are tamed and smoothed by the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The balm soon starts to melt and you&#x27;re left with a thick oil on your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> If you love the man but hate the scratchy, stinky beard...</li>
            <li> Hate the smell but love the texture and feeling after applied</li>
            <li> I use heavy machinery outdoors and have rough, calloused hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other beard moisturizer so far, but I found the weird consistency to be a little messy and off-putting.  </li>
            <li> Now you may love the smell of black licorice, or may hate it.</li>
            <li> I look down and it appears to be snowing.</li>
            <li> Helps the beard and lays it down well</li>
            <li> Takes your beard from sketch to legit in one rub down.</li>
            <li> I get a pervasive flaky itch that wages a war of attrition with my face until I give in and trim it down.</li>
            <li> This won hands down BUT it may make you break out, as it did me.</li>
            <li> I have to rub it in my palm for some time to break down the &amp;#34;grains&amp;#34;, and if I miss one or two, they end up getting stuck in my beard.</li>
            <li> It also helps a lot to keep any itching down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> The paste will melt down into the consistency of an oil, and spread evenly throughout your beard.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s basically no difference in softness if I run my hand from the side of my head, down my sideburns, into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soften the hair and made it lay down.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of product and ease of how it breaks down into an oil.</li>
            <li> but if it were toned down or odorless that would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I suggest buy this and use 1 day a week to keep cost down because I will still use it along side coconut oil.</li>
            <li> helps with beard itch as well as keeping stray hairs down.</li>
            <li> He had a lot of &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; beard hairs before, and this seems to keep them tamped down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really like how it helps my beard lay down and look clean/straight all day.  </li>
            <li> It helps prevent split ends and smooths the hairs down for a softer feel.</li>
            <li> then rub it all over your beard, even down to your skin.  </li>
            <li> the product, have started to look into their other products as well!</li>
            <li> If anyone has any suggestions on other products we could try, please let us know!</li>
            <li> Such a small amount needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other balm!</li>
            <li> I received my item extremely dented!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I first got it, expected it to be larger.  </li>
            <li> After growing my beard out for months and having complaints about how rough and narley it had gotten from my wife and daughters, I figured it was time to try to tame my face-forest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow beard on and off for years could never get past the itchiness in the dry skin</li>
            <li> and I feel it does a less than average job.</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to justify the price versus the quantity of what is essentially</li>
            <li> His beard goes about half way down his chest</li>
            <li> I would describe the smell as slightly rugged, the smell is not for sissys like those who hose themselves down with axe body spray.</li>
            <li> The tin is very thin almost as thin as a soda can so it bends to easy....</li>
            <li> The tin seems small but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the little grains of wax don&#x27;t always dissolve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container, but a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the small container.  </li>
            <li> very_ small amount is plenty, just enough to cover a fingertip.</li>
            <li> an use a paper towel to dry off any skin that you have the balm on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumspringa!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed less crying due to my hair daggers no longer piercing me.</li>
            <li> Plus not a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> The balm does have a slight scent, but I find it quite pleasing.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my beard.</li>
            <li> It seems softer and less of a hassled to come, even in the morning before application.</li>
            <li> it smells sort of like black licorice and cinnamon</li>
            <li> There is the faintest hint of black licorice.</li>
            <li> the less    BOTTOM LINE:  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t coming from some novice that is emptying half the can into his beard and lathering it on like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> (Though it is a slight smell of it, it is not over powering at all.)</li>
            <li> Seems to me that  the balm is subject to summer mail melting</li>
            <li> There is a hint of anise (black licorice)</li>
            <li> Made my beard softer and gave a slight glow.</li>
            <li> That said, it did leave a slight oil in my beard.  </li>
            <li> and I find the oil is less greasy while sacrificing some hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that the beard will thicken up even just ever so slightly on the cheek areas.</li>
            <li> It makes my goatee less itchy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a combination of a woodsy pine with black licorice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe it as a mix of black licorice and pine.</li>
            <li> Downside is half leaked out of container</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people describing it as a black licorice smell, but</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of black licorice, you&#x60;ll probably not mind the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight bit of residue on the hands, but it&#x27;s moisturizing so who cares?  </li>
            <li> but it is not super noticeable and goes away after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Has a slightly nutty smell to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried to grow a beard, and decided to trim and shave my whiskers because of the dreaded beard itch.</li>
            <li> The quality is great!oking slightly oily and over-conditioned in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, to address the previous issues with the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> It has &amp;#34;softened&amp;#34; my beard slightly but not to the point of amazement.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand black licorice</li>
            <li> Honestly half the size I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> In just two applications, my beard is darker, softer, less knots, and lays</li>
            <li> odd.</li>
            <li> and I literally ripped the air in half.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about half of that time.</li>
            <li> I *almost* didn&#x27;t buy this stuff because of all the reviews that said it smells of black licorice.</li>
            <li> If I could eliminate one taste from existence, it would be black licorice.</li>
            <li> There is a slight spice scent, but not over-powering.</li>
            <li> My beard itches 75-90% less now.</li>
            <li> Makes beard less ichy does not poke spouse.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this beard treatment; the pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li> I also feel less of a need to comb it every day.</li>
            <li> Smells like black liquorice.</li>
            <li> me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less than Good.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Go to the store and buy a bag of black licorice and smell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sort of black licorice smell though.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of black liquorice</li>
            <li> It makes it slightly softer.</li>
            <li> Slightly.</li>
            <li> I have heard it referred to as an overpowering black licorice (anise) scent.  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using a</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews, I purchased this thinking I could deal with the slight licorice scent; I can not.</li>
            <li> There is a hint of black licorice smell to it</li>
            <li> Some say it smells like black licorice, but that&#x27;s misleading.</li>
            <li> The smell is like black licorice, a manly smell.</li>
            <li> Been using it for less than a week.</li>
            <li> Has a slight smell to get used to</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Wild</li>
            <li> People say it smells like black licorice and then goes away.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like you will get a decent amount of this stuff, wrong.</li>
            <li> It has a very distinct anise/clove/black licorice scent that can be sickening at times, especially as the smell dissipates, and then you get an odor that smells like black licorice melting in vegetable oil, or something like that.  </li>
            <li> Just put a little on your hands, rub together until melted then apply to beard and work down to skin.</li>
            <li> It appears larger in the photos than it actually is, which made me think it was a little expensive for what I got.</li>
            <li> This means that I wake up every morning with a wiry mess to deal with.</li>
            <li> but it gets your hands greasy whenever you touch your beard and will turn your phone into a greasy mess after a phone call.  </li>
            <li> It took the wiry, scraggly mess on my face and smoothed it into a presentable and shapely beard.</li>
            <li> if you follow the directions and apply a SMALL amount to a WET beard, it doesn&#x27;t build up or make your beard feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, and my goodness within ten minutes his beard went from coarse and annoying to soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> If you order it in August in Arkansas you will have a mess on your hands when you get.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell, just personally dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> To put it bluntly, this mess be like some type of BEARD CRACK,</li>
            <li> I have an unruly long, thick beard.  </li>
            <li> Other products I have tired have returned similar results.</li>
            <li> Its makes the beard a little softer and less itchy.  </li>
            <li> I was applying about half a dime to a dime and it would make my beard a little to shiny.</li>
            <li> My beard did look a little neater but it wasn&#x27;t much less itchy than before.</li>
            <li> The photo is a little misleading, looks like the size of a tobacco tin and its not its about the size of a half dollar.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a little less.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my fiancé, he has a very long, hard to groom beard.</li>
            <li> Well, the lid to the mustache was was so tight I ended up leaving it</li>
            <li> somewhere between black liquorish and clove cigarettes... Not very appealing when applied to an area an inch away from your nose.</li>
            <li> You have to melt the little pellets by rubbing them in your hand and it creates a mess.</li>
            <li> maybe ill try something new</li>
            <li> Slight smell of Anise which fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The easier solution, if you know your hands are cold, is to just run them in hot water for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> After using it a few days, I have noticed my beard feels less itchy and brittle.</li>
            <li> It really sucks because this stuff is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I felt it was expensive but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Figured this would be a little less messy for it.</li>
            <li> Your beard will look healthier and shinier with a little of this on it.</li>
            <li> Now, I do have to offer a little background.</li>
            <li> Take a little and rub it into your palms.</li>
            <li> This is honestly a little too hipster for me.  </li>
            <li> It makes it a little easier to control</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!! Axel grease would be better!</li>
            <li> The little can lasts forever.</li>
            <li> A little over a month in, and he now uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I found this little gem and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> JUST A LITTLE GREASY.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it gives my beard a little shine.</li>
            <li> When you scoop a little bit of the balm out of the container and rub it in your palms, the beads turn into an oil.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my beard when I get out of the shower and it is still a little moist.  </li>
            <li> A little oily.</li>
            <li> Having never used a beard conditioner before, I have little to compare this to.</li>
            <li> Thought this might be a little costly but decided to try it out either way.  </li>
            <li> a little mint, a little something else.</li>
            <li> Makes beard a little softer.</li>
            <li> a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> it tends to make his beard smell a little bit like straw though...?</li>
            <li> You need to take a little out and work it into your hands then spread it throughout your beard.  </li>
            <li> am playing around a little</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on a little greasy but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if the scent lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit on each finger for each side of your face.</li>
            <li> yeah, that one was a little</li>
            <li> Little did I know, it takes a lot of care.</li>
            <li> Now I just run a little bit through my beard after every shower.  </li>
            <li> Plus a little seems to go along way</li>
            <li> It is a little offputting and takes some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little like licorice</li>
            <li> I opened it to have a little smell - sort of woodsy citrusy?</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you may be combing out little nuggets of product.</li>
            <li> The container is very small but a little bit of oil does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little too greasy for my taste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little over 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda frizzy and little too &amp;#34;full</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely read the directions, it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a month</li>
            <li> It came in a little burlap bag.</li>
            <li> Just seems to leave my beard a little to greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> The anise smell took a little getting use to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, it smells a little like ginger to me</li>
            <li> Put a little bit into your balm, rub and work around until it melts into a oil type substance on your hands and work in into your beard.</li>
            <li> After apply a little bit in the morning and combing it through my beard</li>
            <li> My husband has also started using a little bit in his hair and loves it there as well.</li>
            <li> Softens my beard and gives just a little shine.</li>
            <li> It gets your hands a little greasy-&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned</li>
            <li> A little oiler than my husband prefers, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice,remember just a little dab will do</li>
            <li> My beard is perhaps a little softer, but the effect is short-lived.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend daily use since it can build up a bit being an oil base, but my husband uses a small fingertips worth every 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> This product is a little like putting a pat of butter in your hands, working it to liquid and putting it on your beard.  </li>
            <li> It does make your beard shine and gives it a bit of softness, but it is a little too greasy for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tired it while my beard is wet, just after a shower, I&#x27;ve tried it on a dry beard....</li>
            <li> Only disappointment was the size of the container was about half or a third of what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> The smell of Anise (licorice) is a little unpleasant but very subtle, most people might like it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad it&#x27;s not even funny!</li>
            <li> My bf thinks its a little heavy of a product</li>
            <li> The product itself is a little to heavy when in your beard it feels sticky.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged but did have to put it in the refrigerator for a little while to firm it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a fluffy little cloud on your face - THAT KILLS those who oppose freedom and manliness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a small jar, but lasts me about 6 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight black licorice smell, but goes away after a tick.</li>
            <li> The skin irritant only increased, buildup is tough to wash out (and,</li>
            <li> It has an earthy, herbal scent that reminds me of digging sassafras root down in the Ozarks!  </li>
            <li> These guys have it down!</li>
            <li> It has a very sour smell to it, and it isnt smocky or nature smelling like I was thinking it would.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thick and coarse, until I started using these soaps</li>
            <li> This has helped tame the mess that is my boyfriend&#x27;s goatee.  </li>
            <li> It also helps my beard lie down since it usually looks a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since been fighting a high irritable sense of smell that causes my nose to run and symptoms of a cold running down into my throat.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful that this product would help alleviate our problems, but to my disappointment, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer pretty bad psoriasis flare ups on around my chin/cheek/general beard area which can be pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REALLY JUST CRAZY OILS</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t all stay stuck to your beard, so not a good choice for those who touch their beard a lot, or long beards that rub against clothes.</li>
            <li> Rather messy.</li>
            <li> With this product, I noticed an immediate difference &amp; it seems to get healthier everyday.</li>
            <li> I had gone a few weeks without shaving before, but never like this.  </li>
            <li> I put this product in a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I am not one of those people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that melts and gets everywhere unless kept at a low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it everyday because it makes me want to drink.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and can tell a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> (try the EQLEF Green Sandalwood beard comb).</li>
            <li> and I bought a few from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product was simply a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have worn a goatee for a few years.</li>
            <li> I started using it everyday, but now I notice that isn&#x27;t needed...  </li>
            <li> Kinda like licorice when it goes on, and sort of cedar smelling after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times varying the amount used.  </li>
            <li> Softer than I expected and liquified between fingers to make a thick oil.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that i no longer have dried skin on my chin and the persistent itches has ceased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday thing for me.</li>
            <li> It took forever for it to solidify in my hand and there always seemed to be chunks of it left behind.</li>
            <li> I apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> Having used it for a few days, my wife did not even notice the scent of it on me.  </li>
            <li> In fact, for the sake of science, I put a lot on one morning, waited a few minutes, and had my wife give me a sniff from about 5 inches away.  </li>
            <li> Lifting heavy items was no longer as strenuous as it once had been.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and loves it.</li>
            <li> Put in after a shower and after a few days to a week your beard gets soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the smell</li>
            <li> He uses this everyday after his shower.</li>
            <li> You can tell a difference after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> They melt away when heated by rubbing the balm between your hands, but I always seemed to have a few stuck between my fingers.</li>
            <li> After a few days use, I&#x27;ve noticed a change.  </li>
            <li> Stick with it for a few weeks and</li>
            <li> so I ordered the Heavy Duty Beard Balm and will update this review after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about the scent - it dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Heck, I think I could melt the can just by holding it in my palm for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It was the performance that I disliked.</li>
            <li> After a few hours the rancid smell was gone.  </li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair, go with the heavy duty beard balm.</li>
            <li> After browsing a few beard forums and seeing this product mentioned a few times, I decided to wander over to Amazon and purchase this beard balm.</li>
            <li> Give it a chance to melt on your fingers for a few seconds before rubbing it into your beard.</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended this product and I think him everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few beard balms and oils, this stuff is still my go to.</li>
            <li> For about the first week I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Now the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; has granules in it and is not smooth at all.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes, then use a tooth pick or a skewer to stir up the oils</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> if you have a beard and don&#x27;t use product like I used to be, you are missing out.</li>
            <li> And she had always complained about my beard being to rough whenever I grew it out.</li>
            <li> I have a standard length beard that that is a tad bit on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant,barely noticeable, and fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> heavy clove and spice notes...</li>
            <li> Product is missing from container and has leaked out.</li>
            <li> He said he loves the smell and it does go away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and it goes away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I employed a few solutions.</li>
            <li> so I look forward to seeing what it looks like after a few weeks of using this balm.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they shaved the damn beard after I protested pleaded and almost damn near cried.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and that is it.</li>
            <li> Along with it I ordered the Heavy Duty Beard Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> (I have a few).</li>
            <li> use this everyday after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> .......use everyday............</li>
            <li> The smell of the product goes away in a few hours and if used sparingly it isn&#x27;t greasy nor oily in my beard</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and stopped.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos</li>
            <li> I waited until I had used it for a few days before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> My grooming now is to use the Heavy Duty Beard Balm after my shower, even if I used a conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li> What I disliked was that my beardruff actually got worse while using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of my husbands beard, but I can see a difference when he uses this</li>
            <li> The beard wax is a little too stiff for my preference.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a stronger hold because his beard is a little on the unruly side and this product doesn&#x27;t tame the strays.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About the only thing I dislike, or, not really dislike, but take in stride, is that due to the nature of it being a &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, if the ambient temperature or your fingers are cold it takes a few seconds to liquify.  </li>
            <li> Smells slightly of licorice which I thought was a bad thing at first.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed my beard is not as stiff and wiry.</li>
            <li> For black men questioning whether this product will work for them, the answer is yes!</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount, less than the size of a dime.  </li>
            <li> my husband hardly uses it due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I have ordered him some of the Beard Wax to tame the few hairs that this doesn&#x27;t control.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terribly off-putting, but every morning for the last week I&#x27;m starting the day with the smell of a high school wood shop class in my nose.  </li>
            <li> I saw some other negative reviews about people having an allergic reaction to this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the other negative reviews on that.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been blending it with some of my other beards oils to help with the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a very small can, about 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and the sides can be extremely unruly.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard under control and just plain works.</li>
            <li> well keeping rouge hairs manageable during the day with out having your beard be stiff from gel.</li>
            <li> yes, I used a little, VERY little at a time).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Using along with a beard oil and have seen dramatic change in the moisture of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> but it is not strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep it tame and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This balm allows me to tame my beard and keep the hairs running in one direction.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, there&#x27;s a very subtle scent that I no longer notice (and no-one has ever mentioned to me), and I stopped having flakiness on the second day of use.</li>
            <li> It does not serve to tame the stray hairs but does soften the beard.  </li>
            <li> It didnt itch and had a very slight glow.</li>
            <li> and it work nicely to tame stray hairs and keep my hair and skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really tame the rogue whiskers though.</li>
            <li> but if you need to tame your unruly man pelt you need to use the wax as well.  </li>
            <li> so I had to tame</li>
            <li> If you are wanting to try and tame your beard while growing it</li>
            <li> Consistency of semen mixed with crisco not a balm more like a sloppy disgusting mess I struggle to think how you are supposed to use this.</li>
            <li> Making my beard a little softer everyday!</li>
            <li> At the weekends it needs a little gardening to remove the small rodents and nesting birds that moved in during the week.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the small can as I was, a little goes a longggg way.</li>
            <li> little tough to work with in your hands after it&#x27;s melted down, but you get it down after a while.  </li>
            <li> I was literally om the verge of cutting off my beard from sheer frustration with the dry and brittle feeling.</li>
            <li> Without I had pretty bad beard itch</li>
            <li> - one small tin still lasts me a few months even as my beard has gotten longer.</li>
            <li> I would usually shave after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the price, very expensive for such a small canister.</li>
            <li> The subtle &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, the subtle softness, the subtle glean or shininess, the subtle smell, it all adds up to a much improved presentation.  </li>
            <li> My mustache is thick, and this product makes it feel softer and less course - and it seems to tame the goatee.</li>
            <li> It just seems a little expensive for what you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very thick beard (hair is thick as horse hair)&lt;br /&gt;- Daily flacking, looked like my beard had dandruff</li>
            <li> be concerned about the small size, ive been using it everyday for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have thick black beard (1 inch length) but it does keep the beard shiny and hair untangled for the day.</li>
            <li> Not easy to get past.</li>
            <li> I hate the scent (Liquorice) and it leaves my beard super greasy.</li>
            <li> I mean within hours of applying this product I felt my testosterone surging and had the uncontrollable urge to put on a flannel shirt and start chopping down trees.</li>
            <li> Can is tight and hard to close.</li>
            <li> This is a little difficult to apply, but I wet it down and make a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; in my hand, then apply.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just not true, at least not with my tin or my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It works but its definitely a little too thick.</li>
            <li> I find this product greasy and feel very little softening.  </li>
            <li> This is oily, pain to melt and apply after 4 nights very little difference in softness.  </li>
            <li> Yes, faintly, and for a little bit until you either adjust or the scent fades away--it&#x27;s hard to measure what is actually happening under one&#x27;s nose.  </li>
            <li> Its a little expensive but will go a long way if you use the amount you are supposed too.</li>
            <li> I hardly notice after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> this container is small for the price.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> Idk why ppl complaint about the smell, I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> No more snow.</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;Honest Amish Beard Leave-in Conditioner&amp;#34; for the past year</li>
            <li> and then I pinch a small amount out at a time.</li>
            <li> No more dryness.</li>
            <li> No more itch,</li>
            <li> so you could say that I am an amateur beardsman.  </li>
            <li> seconds after walking into a bar this past weekend.</li>
            <li> This is the most stinking CRAP I&#x27;ve ever smelled!!!!</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve shaven because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the itching...</li>
            <li> and I usually get uncented stuff</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and receive lots of compliments on how my beard looks and feels!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father who is infatuated with his beard, and he LOVES it!</li>
            <li> No more itch.</li>
            <li> No more flaky skin.</li>
            <li> No more saying &amp;#34;Screw</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size of the tin fool you.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what this did.</li>
            <li> I usually use it before work around 7am ish and the smell is basically gone in a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> So I am not sure what people are complaining about.  </li>
            <li> The balm is in a small container but lasted my husband 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything.</li>
            <li> I have no more split ends</li>
            <li> Needless to say, family and friends couldn&#x27;t make a second trip</li>
            <li> No more itching.</li>
            <li> The tin is small but you need about a finger tip scoop.</li>
            <li> Not sure about some of the reviews saying that it has an aroma of medicine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the intended consistency is correct, but this balm was grainy.</li>
            <li> Yes, so don&#x27;t be put off by what seems to be a small tin.  </li>
            <li> Yes, so don&#x27;t be put off by what seems to be a small tin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> Some of areas on my face have small patches of no growth.</li>
            <li> I usually use about a pea size blob each application.  </li>
            <li> My beard feels softer, healthier, and there&#x27;s no more &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am not sure any product is going to make the itching go away.  </li>
            <li> We have family that is allergic, and I&#x27;m sad when they visit because his beard is not the same without this product!</li>
            <li> and I lost part of an already small container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not used any oils or balms in the past.</li>
            <li> There are some small solids... or granules in this product.</li>
            <li> I give them two stars for taking their useless product back.</li>
            <li> I was pretty dismayed about this last winter because, to be quite frank, it was scratchy and terrible.  </li>
            <li> No more pricky itchiness to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and not sure how I&#x27;ve grown a beard without it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a small tin, it lasts quite a while because of the small amount needed each use.</li>
            <li> My nose doesn&#x27;t detect any sort of artificial fragrance, and the smell seems all natural.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Small tin,</li>
            <li> The can is small but</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is how it was meant to be</li>
            <li> I think I may try out the slick wax too.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is a small package..</li>
            <li> Small container for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small tin</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because i think it should not be nearly as expensive as it is.</li>
            <li> Once I get past the 10 day mark or so, it starts to itch and bother me a bit, to the point where I crave to shave it.  </li>
            <li> Rub a small amount into your palm, work it around to melt and work it through damp hair.</li>
            <li> No more scratching.</li>
            <li> Comes in a small burlap bag!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Really not pleased with it.</li>
            <li> A small amount softens the hair, straightens it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter for a beard</li>
            <li> growing a beard (or atleast what I call a beard) on and off for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> So, in order to keep on my track as an amateur face and beard model, I had to take this blow (like a 4 yo hitting you under the belt) and man up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Softens beard, ha odor but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already a small container to begin with.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll  buy it again without the scent.</li>
            <li> wife doesn&#x27;t seem to even notice the smell and for me it&#x27;s usually gone in 10 minutes after application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely small for the amount paid.</li>
            <li> The microbeads melt in your hand and a small amount is all you need.</li>
            <li> No more beard itch which was putting me close to shaving it off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what some people are smelling.  </li>
            <li> I feel like every time I walk past someone they&#x27;re thinking,</li>
            <li> You want just a small &#x27;swoop&#x27; with your fingertip, which you then rub together between your hands and apply/rub into your beard.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the balm is for me.</li>
            <li> Over the Christmas break I decided to quit shaving and when I got back I was complaining to some office mates about the beard being uncomfortable, etc.</li>
            <li> No more flaking from my beard.</li>
            <li> beard, and anyone who loves it, will appreciate the small effort it takes to take it from hobo to Gandalf</li>
            <li> Works well on my beard controlling the random hairs, especially the mustache ones that flip up and tickle my nose!</li>
            <li> My beard was so dry with a sweep broom like texture, if fact it was so bad that it actually hurt my face when I rubbed my hand through it.  </li>
            <li> The smell gets annoying throughout the day and can leave your skin and beard feeling greasy if the right amount isn&#x27;t applied.</li>
            <li> My beard is softer, healthier, has no beardruff, and very few split hairs or rogue hairs.</li>
            <li> (I usually abandon ship after about a month), but it does make the initial growing-in phase a lot less unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the growing itch while not completely gone is not near as bad.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the beard thick, soft, and untangled even in cold weather.</li>
            <li> for the crazy people who have complained about not including an applicator in the reviews, they clearly must not have hands.</li>
            <li> Helps control the beard and keeps it from being so stiff!</li>
            <li> It will tame the wildest beard!  </li>
            <li> Has helped tame the beast as well!</li>
            <li> Helped tame the beast!</li>
            <li> So, I had a decently long beard, a lot of &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34; quips from random strangers wherever I went.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t list their ingredients (and I don&#x27;t blame them), but I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s a shea butter base</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about the size of it but let me assure you if you use it like the company says it does go a long way!</li>
            <li> Gift for don who failed to tell me he shaved long beard off for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Without this product my beard is itchy and really hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint what it smells like, but you sort of smell like a hippie.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply and I have to comb the granules out after each use but does keep my woolly beard from being too woolly.  </li>
            <li> often times a beard looks dull...</li>
            <li> , here&#x27;s the hard part of the review; will YOU like the scent?  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply evenly to my beard.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the smell, or at the very least would not want to smell like that if this were a cologne.  </li>
            <li> One complaint, somehow the tin got dented during shipping.</li>
            <li> No Prime Shipping -- At least at the time I bought it,</li>
            <li> In the process my beard has itched like CRAZY from the short spiky growth sprouting on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> However, while the balm works wonders for me, it has negatively affected my wife.  </li>
            <li> But it will NOT manage, hold, or shape your beard in any way (at least not mine at 3&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My one complaint is it does leave you feeling a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my beard lately...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a manly scent, to say the least, and I haven&#x27;t had anyone complain about it.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to order the product because some users complained about the anise scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is a negative for me</li>
            <li> He has used it at least 5 times since opening it Christmas morning.  </li>
            <li> Given the cold weather we&#x27;ve been having recently</li>
            <li> the negative side, it is a bit too scented.</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed this product my biggest complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> not do that, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;d get Curley out of my face.  </li>
            <li> You see, genetics were not nice to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to it now, but it is not overpowering in the least.  </li>
            <li> I dont know why others complained about the smell: my boyfriend and I, both like the herbal fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I used it at least once</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t think it was.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> My beard is quite thick, but has a lot of body and tends to twist and knot.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick and wiry (but</li>
            <li> It is a thick goo that you scoop onto your fingers, then you rub it together and it become an oil.</li>
            <li> , so my beard is thick, wirey, and curly.</li>
            <li> The thick, and still stubbly hairs below my jaw feel softer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much like licorice, and I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> as far as people complaining about smell, maybe they were expecting some fru fru crap, this product is for men with a little dirt under there finger nails, pampered men look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I mean whatever, she&#x27;s a dog.</li>
            <li> I mean how manly is that?</li>
            <li> ...what a small tin!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know what I mean when you smell it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it because of the reviews, but it left my beard(1 inch) greasy, shiny, and the smell drove me mad.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased their soap and just ordered the slick wax!</li>
            <li> The gritty texture is not appealing to me and the scent is really bad.</li>
            <li> Not happy :/</li>
            <li> The tin that this product comes in is very small.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for the faint licorice scent I had seen mentioned in previous reviews/answers.</li>
            <li> Seriously I don&#x27;t see how some people can use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Feels like you are taking your beard seriously</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> in fact, its, subtle, but that&#x27;s part of the beauty of it.  </li>
            <li> Any man that is serious about his beard needs to use a product</li>
            <li> I had an issue with flaking and serious irritation.</li>
            <li> Seriously, upon putting the stuff on, I could start to feel a difference as I massaged and combed it in.</li>
            <li> It is subtle.</li>
            <li> But subtle.</li>
            <li> Also, once you have it on your fingers and get any on the container, it is IMPOSSIBLE to open the container again because it is so slippery.</li>
            <li> Place the tin in a shallow bowl.&lt;br /&gt;C.</li>
            <li> The initial impression by my graphic designer wife was how terrible the label/logo are.</li>
            <li> It has a licorice hint along with subtle notes of nut/woods (to me).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is subtle and manly.</li>
            <li> If you have a mixture of hair colors and coarseness - the oil will bring out subtle highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so subtle</li>
            <li> but I seriously noticed zero benefits.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unpleasant, particularly to my girlfriend, rendering the product useless (or worse) to me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not very ideal for my office mouse and keyboard.</li>
            <li> The only bad quality about this product is my dog, a Boxer breed, loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps your beard from straying out too bad.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so bad and the tin I got was bigger than the one in the pictures.</li>
            <li> You can however tell by my 5 star rating that the shine it produces isn&#x27;t bad enough to dock it a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Not only is the product bad, but these guys are now in partnership with the clowns from Duck Dynasty.  </li>
            <li> bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a good product.</li>
            <li> Really like this balm,  but my wife hated the smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not good.  </li>
            <li> Not a good thing.</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent of licorice but it isn&#x27;t noticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Though the flaky skin has not been entirely eliminated, my face is not itchy, or painful at all.</li>
            <li> For anyone one out there growing a serious beard, and I mean a SERIOUS beard, this is the elixir to facilitate just that!</li>
            <li> Not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad as long as you like &amp;#34;woodsy smells&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Wife agreed to let me grow out my beard as long as it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; look bad and doesn&#x27;t get ruff.</li>
            <li> which often leads to pretty nasty ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> At least no one would smell you coming an hour before you got there!</li>
            <li> Again, don&#x27;t be dumb; it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong or what.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tin came in a small useless burlap bag that I immediately threw away, which seemed wasteful.</li>
            <li> However, my face under the beard is prone to become extremely dry and even painful after a day of not washing it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of previous reviews that said it smells like anise</li>
            <li> Makes combing my beard a lot less painful as my beard is thick and curly and can be a pain to comb thru at times.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he did a &amp;#34;No-Shave November&amp;#34; and cultivated a tough, scraggly beard.</li>
            <li> now have a tough choice ahead of me:  </li>
            <li> And no, I didn&#x27;t put it on very thick.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> so it was a little disappointing</li>
            <li> but for the price........just a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I so badly wanted to give this a 5-star rating and if I was single, I could!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but not a fan of the smell, it reminds me of wet woodchips and dirty</li>
            <li> eh....it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> but the poor grizzly broke his paw on my beard.  </li>
            <li> I am you know how irritating it is at times.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I will be walking downtown and have three to four girls behind me at all times.</li>
            <li> ive never tried any products for my beard before, but hafve been getting annoyed at how unruly my beard has been getting.</li>
            <li> That said, I am addicted to the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> and it was mildly irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> The flaky skin never got any worse.</li>
            <li> It does make my beard softer, but that&#x27;s almost worse since now</li>
            <li> I use about a cranberry size dollop each application and the tin lasts me approximately 30 applications.</li>
            <li> Hopefully over time I will notice a change in beard fullness and fewer broken hairs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted to using it.</li>
            <li> My beard game was on point</li>
            <li> The worst part is dealing with the company which doesnt take customer questions very well.</li>
            <li> for one am not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> I was trying to grow my beard out and was tired of the itching and irritation.</li>
            <li> So wirey, like a brillo pad, not soft at all :(  </li>
            <li> I mean not that there is anything wrong with that.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overpowering at all.. just a slight scent..</li>
            <li> bad, other reviews had mentioned the smell.</li>
            <li> Some claim the smell is a little unpleasant but</li>
            <li> so when I say it&#x27;s not overwhelming or bad, I mean it.</li>
            <li> Im a bit disappointed, not really of the product but the tin it comes in.</li>
            <li> His beard hair is very coarse and thick and difficult to manage, but he loves this!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle smell.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very (seriously, *</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I mean your bodies chemistry may result in a slightly different smell, either way, for me, it wasn&#x27;t terrible or over-powering and I&#x27;ll use it again with no reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does smell a little like licorice, not too bad though.</li>
            <li> After a bit in my air conditioned (read as cold) house it separated and because hard to mix</li>
            <li> I use this before bed because it gives the beard a shiny tint and is slimy, making it a bit unpleasant to wear in public (Beard gropers will get a handful of slime, and your beard will appear shiny in a bad way).</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical because I tried other products and they kinda failed me and I was worried the smell would be bad based on others reviews</li>
            <li> Anyway, that product was terrible, it had a disgusting bathroom cleaner antiseptic smell (that lingered for hours) and it made my beard feel very thick and dirty (not &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; in a good way).</li>
            <li> No matter how little of the that balm that I used it still made my hairs clump together and feel dirty and unlike this balm, at the end of the workday it still felt as dirty and clumpy as it did at the time of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly beard hair, which creates a mess of crazy hairs!  </li>
            <li> You will not regret purchasing this product... unless you have a pencil-thin moustache and goatee- in which case you are obviously evil and Honest Amish will melt your dirty-beard into a thatch of pathetic peach-fuzz.</li>
            <li> MAJOR CRAP!</li>
            <li> I HATE black licorice.</li>
            <li> (I hate black licorice).</li>
            <li> and I HATE black licorice.  </li>
            <li> I can see why they describe it that way, but I hate the smell of black licorice</li>
            <li> No more!!!</li>
            <li> It smells like a weird</li>
            <li> Too greasy and smelled weird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faintly beeswaxy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say he no longer uses it.</li>
            <li> It has a weird consistency.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend is literally obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> I think time will tell whether it truly softens and strengthens my beard hair (what a weird statement).  </li>
            <li> Works well but has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> When I turn to look at them they faint almost immediately.</li>
            <li> so ill let you how it does</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been inspired to experiment with some longer styles now, and my beard just keeps getting softer and softer.</li>
            <li> but, it was difficult to get out of my dress shirts.</li>
            <li> I may be totally wrong here, but just being cautious.  </li>
            <li> but my wife does not like the way it smells it does have a weird smell</li>
            <li> I thought that was weird</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> Id have bumps and random ingrown hair and maybe even pimples.</li>
            <li> Its always been difficult to manage</li>
            <li> it conditions the beard without irritating the skin and helps your beard grow!</li>
            <li> The only thing I have seen that this product has done was make my beard smell awful.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping my skin would have matured or changed, but sadly, this was not the case.  </li>
            <li> Step your beard game up!</li>
            <li> Washing the grease off your hands is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but there&#x27;s a lot of talk in the reviews about the scent.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> SO WRONG.</li>
            <li> No beardrift and the itchy beard days are behind me!</li>
            <li> or you will have a greasy weird beard.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it did what it said it would.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> it has a weird texture but u can tell its organic,</li>
            <li> only ships usable balm some of the time, at worst all it leaves you with is a greasy, flaky beard and a $15 hole in your wallet.</li>
            <li> The smell is not an issue for me - I would describe it as faint.</li>
            <li> It does have a faint licorice scent, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed by the smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of there products.</li>
            <li> This is a heterosexual beard, so that was a bit difficult to walk around with all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> although the smell can take some getting used to,  and the product seems a litter expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the balm.</li>
            <li> My wife, who was skeptical, is now a believer in the product.  </li>
            <li> I have a very tough hair on the chin, and this softens and helps promote growth.  </li>
            <li> I knew he didn&#x27;t mean it, that he was frustrated</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the smell is really terrible, its very strange that people are writing reviews that the smell is not a concern, IT IS A</li>
            <li> Not sure, but maybe it goes bad or was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Poor Amish are getting a bad rap on this one.</li>
            <li> If your fingers are cold for some reason (say you just rinsed your toothbrush in cold water), this can be difficult.</li>
            <li> The itching was driving my crazy and this product helped alot.</li>
            <li> I like to use it when I have a lot of hairs going in crazy directions.</li>
            <li> I did not itch like crazy at the beginning stage.</li>
            <li> He likes having a beard but always ends up shaving it after a couple weeks because the dryness and itching drives him crazy.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, disappointing,</li>
            <li> My beard likes to get crazy and go in every direction except the direction I need.</li>
            <li> My wife no longer is afraid to touch it.</li>
            <li> He works outdoors and says it makes his face cold.</li>
            <li> Holds alright but smells like dirty hippies uuugh</li>
            <li> and you may be afraid that the scent is &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; or that you&#x27;ll smell like licorice all the time.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a dirty hippy.</li>
            <li> I Wont recommend this product unless your desperate and dont care about how you smell</li>
            <li> both times I used it and my skin felt numb.</li>
            <li> Makes my face way too oily and stinks</li>
            <li> Kept my beard from going crazy, and gave me some shine.  </li>
            <li> Very bad smell and not effective at all, plus</li>
            <li> For those who complain that it is not wax and fails to melt on contact: Patience, grasshopper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it does anything terribly beneficial.  </li>
            <li> Growing out a beard for no shave November and it was itching like mad.  </li>
            <li> Now on to the smell, a lot of poster&#x27;s say it&#x27;s bad an stinks or whatever</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If your even considering it...just get it you won&#x27;t be sorry unless you hate the scent of clove.</li>
            <li> If not beard becomes crunchy and smells very weird.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to wash off my hands.</li>
            <li> Very weird smell.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re sick of your man&#x27;s beard stabbing you when you go in for a kiss, buy him a can</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad and its very faint.</li>
            <li> Works so insanely well on my thick beard!</li>
            <li> It just made my beard greasy and smell bad.</li>
            <li> The can came badly dented on the bottom and on the side.</li>
            <li> However, because it itched and looked so bad</li>
            <li> in all, I like it, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even bad.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t that bad .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t think it smells bad</li>
            <li> I think the can I got is bad, it is granulated and feels like a paste with sand that does not dissolve.  </li>
            <li> and I may have gotten a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Ur product isn&#x27;t bad, that&#x27;s just the way it is.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> bad:  </li>
            <li> I suffer from bad split ends on my beard.</li>
            <li> But like I said it isn&#x27;t a bad smell at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit greasy, but if you use the amount suggested (a pea size amount), it&#x27;s not too bad and works well.</li>
            <li> The smell is not even nearly as bad as people make it up to be unless you have a sensative K9 nose.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and doesn&#x27;t soften beard.</li>
            <li> but it does not smells bad.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> They seemed shocked when I told them it is product I put in my beard.  </li>
            <li> Before, Beard was a bit crude.  </li>
            <li> Too bad i had to shave :(</li>
            <li> &gt;:( too bad I couldn&#x27;t grow out the beard for long.&lt;br /&gt;Genes suck.</li>
            <li> I had been using this for a while, and I was slightly disappointed with the results.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up shaving my beard :(</li>

            <li> It makes my wife very unhappy when I kiss her</li>

            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> I hate licorice</li>
            <li> However, growing a beard is an annoying thing because it would always get scratchy as it grew out.</li>
            <li> during this phase my face gets SO itchy and feels like crap.</li>
            <li> Worthless in my opinion.</li>

            <li> the sheen was annoying to me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> As others have said, it smells great and feels great after you apply. I had been using this for a while, and I was slightly disappointed with the results. My beard is short so I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t doing much for me. It felt like my beard was only marginally softer after using almost a whole tin in regular applications. However, when I stopped using it, my beard became way scratchier and rougher within a couple weeks of not using the product. I realized that the beard balm softened my beard gradually, so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference day to day, but when I stopped I realized just how much of a difference this stuff makes. Highly recommended, but once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to stop!</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago, and have used it almost every day.  I can finally see the bottom of the 2 oz tin, should have a week or so left.  I have about 3&#x27; of length currently, so that should let you gauge about how long the tin will last for you.  This has a good amount of hold, but it isn&#x27;t quite enough for my very curly beard.  I am switching to the Heavy-Duty version after this can is gone.  I have been very pleased with this product and brand, and I would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I youse it every morning works great .</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A must have for the bearded man! Makes my beard softer and smoother and easier to brush through.</li>
            <li> Use it every day.. Smells good and works..</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, nice packaging.  Make sure you read the instructions, especially if you live in a warm climate.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product.  It recommended to me by a buddy that has a monster beard and I know now why.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and helps with the coarse hairs and the itching of the dreaded neck beard.  If you are constantly itching, especially in the first couple of weeks of growing your hair, I would apply this 2x a day and you will be relieved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for roughly the past 6 months, daily, while I grew a beard from scratch.  It works wonderfully and smells great.  Now I can&#x27;t go a day without.</li>
            <li> After my first use my beard was a lot softer and looked thicker. I enjoy the smell as well, not overpowering. Its a very light hold, just enough to reign in some of the wild hairs that pop up from time to time and allows for some very light shaping. If you&#x27;re looking for a more intense hold you&#x27;ll need something with more wax.</li>
            <li> Works well for control and moisturising. If it melts and rehardens it can clump up a bit which is anoyingly. Not my favorite smell but not a bad smell..</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to try another product like this.  The last few I tried had a very lingering smell and left a film.  Honest Amish Beard Balm is amazing.  The smell is very soft and pleasant.  After one full week people have complimented me on my beard and I owe all of it to this product.  Im getting ready to buy several 4 oz cans so I never run out.  You have a Customer for Life.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried - and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of beard balm. It helps my beard straighten out and look longer.    The smell reminds me of a clean dirty-hippie. (Good smell)    The only bad quality about this product is my dog, a Boxer breed, loves this stuff. I&#x27;m thinking to myself, \\&quot;Wow! My dog really loves me! Ohhh WAIT! STOP LICKING MY BEARD DOG!\\&quot;    I would recommend getting two cans if you own a dog like me. Only because when I&#x27;m sleeping, I wake up to my dog licking the beard balm out my beard. I mean whatever, she&#x27;s a dog. But then my beard looks like rodents have been playing in it and trying to make beard angels.    No big deal. Just wash your face and put some more Honest Amish beard balm to your beard. Beard will look puppy-free and looking nice for the beard loving ladies.    Disclaimer: No dogs or rodents were harmed in the making of this review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Definitely will buy again.  I don&#x27;t even use it every day and it has kept my beard &amp;#34;down&amp;#34;; not having hairs going every which way.  And like I said, I don&#x27;t use it every day but even on the off days, when I comb my beard it just stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it smells:  Yes, in the can it definitely has a sort of medicinal herbal smell. Kinda reminds me of jaegermeister actually.  I am not a huge fan of the smell, or at the very least would not want to smell like that if this were a cologne.  But within a few minutes of putting this on the smell quickly goes away.  Just don&#x27;t use too much. I know it seems like a little bit spread out over a full beard won&#x27;t do anything but it does.  I use an amount equal to the size of my finger tip, rub it in my palm a bit and then put it in my beard.  I expect at this rate of usage this little can will last me a while and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, on my second can. Beard is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> eh....it&#x27;s not great. Beard really isn&#x27;t soft after use. If you want a soft beard, use oil - not this.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Very nice ..keeps my beard in place ..nice smell..I just rub in into my skin afterwards</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Conditions the beard nicely, and after using it on my beard I used the leftover that was on my fingers to style my hair. I&#x27;ve already ordered more.</li>
            <li> Got this and a bottle of Beard Oil via Amazon for my first ever beard.  Both work fine.  Probably just a matter of taste.  They are cheap enough to get both and you can decide.  I will be buying both for as long as I have a beard.</li>
            <li> does everything it says it will. Leaves the beard feeling awesome</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used beard balms and oils before, but nothing compares to the quality of this product. not only does a bushy beard require only a small amount, but it smells great and lasts all day. excellent product for a reasonable price. 5/5 - will buy again</li>
            <li> Mt beard could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Seems to work great and I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Really good product, highly recommend it. Leaves beard really soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Just got this product for my male friend with a beard. So far he seems to love it. Hopefully we see results soon.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been &#x27;tirelessly working&#x27; to grow out a beard to be proud of...it started looking a bit scraggly this winter, and he became miserable - even suggesting he was going to shave it all off. I knew he didn&#x27;t mean it, that he was frustrated but he&#x27;d hate himself for shaving it...so bought this stuff for him as a last-ditch effort to get him to (shut up) like his beard again. Truth be told, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, too; when he uses the beard balm his beard looks much fuller and shinier. It&#x27;s easier to manage, and doesn&#x27;t look all scraggly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked! He loves it, uses it every day now...and it kind of has a manly herby scent without being overpowering or smelling like patchouli. Placing another order now - 3 months later - because he&#x27;s almost out.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what your thoughts will be after buying this item:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it: &amp;#34;Wow this container is small for the price.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Upon touching it: &amp;#34;This texture is weird. It says to rub in hands until liquid but the texture is like greasy salt so it just clumps up.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Upon putting it on your beard: &amp;#34;This just feels like putting salt in my beard. It smells like a weird licorice&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;After putting it on your beard: &amp;#34;Great, now my beard is greasy and smells bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a good product. It just made my beard greasy and smell bad. It didn&#x27;t help with anything that it says it does.</li>
            <li> Used it last year, same this year! Nuff said!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for any beard.  As other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way.  It has a very subtle smell.  Your beard will look healthier and shinier with a little of this on it.</li>
            <li> This product solved my problem with flakey skin under my beard.  My wife is very sensitive to product scents but she loved this so much she made me look to see if Honest Amish had soap with the scent (they don&#x27;t--hint, hint).  It has an earthy, herbal scent that reminds me of digging sassafras root down in the Ozarks!  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes the it would give me beard a sleeker and more well-maintained look.  It satisfies thoroughly in this respect.  My beard hairs, which are rather thick individually, are tamed and smoothed by the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also several reviews that complained about the scent.  I thought it was a fairly strong scent the first time I applied the balm, but I liked the scent.  It is a woodsy, earthy smell and honestly I&#x27;m completely okay with it.  My girlfriend also commented that she thought the smell was woodsy and manly.  Again, while it is strong at first application, the scent dwindled shortly after but there was still a definite presence of the smell.  I however don&#x27;t mind the smell at all (I rather like it, actually) so this is of no consequence to me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this beard balm for a week so far makes my beard softer and less itchy. Idk why ppl complaint about the smell, I will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> First time growing beard, and I can tell the difference along the proces: similar (and analogous) effect as when using lip balm on chapped lips. Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells like total ass.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really does work as advertised. This winter is the first time I grew a beard. I have really dry facial skin so I was expecting beard dandruff and was pleasantly surprised when it didn&#x27;t happen. Usually my skin is better as the temperature warms but that is actually when my dandruff started. I was using beard oil twice a day and still getting white flakes all over my shirts. I was constantly &amp;#34;popping&amp;#34; my shirt to shake off the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my Honest Amish last weekend and it immediately solved my issue. I put a surprisingly small amount in my beard in the morning and am good the rest of the day. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has completely gone away but I went from a dandruff scale of 8 (out of 10) to maybe a 1 so I can live with that. I struggle with head dandruff as well so I don&#x27;t honestly expect anything to work 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially concerned because the tin is a little smaller than I expected but you really do need a very small amount. Even a dime-sized amount would be way too much for me (though my beard is pretty short). I don&#x27;t have a long beard so I can&#x27;t speak to the products other benefits but I will testify it works for the dreaded beard dandruff. It was getting to the point I was thinking about shaving my beard if I couldn&#x27;t get it under control.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job of softening my beard which is what I was going for.  Wish it worked a little better, and I am not a fan of the scent</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I have a full naturally white beard and this balm has helped to grow and kept it soft feeling</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, leaves my beard shiny and manageable, definitely a man&#x27;s man product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Improved the softness and appearance of my beard.</li>
            <li> Good product. My beard is much softer and this is really easy to use. Although another fragrance would be nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good , not strong smelling</li>
            <li> This stuff was made by Grizzley Adams himself.  Unbelievable, Instantly softens and conditioned my beard.  I recently tried Grave Before Shave beard balm and it actually made my beard stiffer and unbearable.  Couldn&#x27;t even go a week before I had to order Honest Amish again. Out right majestic.  Just buy it. Its worth every penny and then more.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the early stages of beard growth as it reduces itching and it definitely makes the hair look and feel healthy as you gain some length. It has an interesting texture and the smell is nice but hard to describe and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get away from giving 5 star reviews.  I think that a three should be considered a good score because (I believe) it means that the product is doing what you purchased it for.  Therefore a 4 should be beyond what you expect, and a 5 should be reserved for those very few cases when a product or service does something really outstanding and beyond your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after considering it for a while I decided to give the product a 5.  My reasoning for it is because I don&#x27;t think that I could tolerate my beard without it.  This is the first time I have had a beard longer than a half inch.  It always drives me nuts when it gets about that long.  Now I have about 2 inches of beard, and I can&#x27;t wait to put this stuff on to make it more comfortable.  It just feels soothing and nice.  So while it doesn&#x27;t make me breakfast in bed, it makes my beard not only tolerable but pleasurable.  My wife loves to play with it when I have the conditioner in, and that is a good thing ;-)</li>
            <li> working pretty good so far.....leaves my beard nice and soft----and that is a really big change from before when I was not using it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this so far. it&#x27;s only been  a little over a week and already my beard is beginning to feel softer, which makes the wife happier, and no more itching. I like the aroma it gives off at first when you apply it and that it only takes a little to go along way. The price was very fair in my opinion with what else is out there. I would definitely recommend. This is my first beard conditioner so  once I&#x27;m done with this, I will try something else though so I have something to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. My husband wears a goatee that he likes to keep trimmed short, but it was still itching sometimes. He uses this conditioner 3-4 times a week and it helps so much by making his beard feel softer and less coarse. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My beard and my wife thank me for this investment.</li>
            <li> Currently in the process of purchasing a second tin for my husband, who LOVED this beard balm. The waxy texture mildly tames his beard while the essential oils provide the right amount of moisture that lasts through his workday. The mild, natural scent is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Could not be more pleased with my purchase. I got this because my facial hair is very coarse which often leads to pretty nasty ingrown hairs. This conditioner seems to be softening my beard up a bit. It also smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I have an amazingly unruly beard and although this product does a perfect job of softening the hair and making it much easier to come, it does not help my beard keep shape.  I&#x27;m assuming I will need a wax for that.</li>
            <li> This balm does exactly what it claims to do. My beard is softer than ever. It helps to control the wild hairs, and it accentuates the natural waves in my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;A pleasing aroma is half the point, and this balm has a delicious scent; my wife loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the smell, the feel on my beard, how my beard looks and feels after I shower and apply it. Definitely worth trying if your are looking for a new beard balm or something other than a straight beard oil. BTW, the smell is fantastic in my opinion, however it dissipates fairly quickly, so don&#x27;t worry about it being overbearing or too strong.</li>
            <li> first time beard grower..i am liking this product. smells good and makes my beard softer. helps take the itch away</li>
            <li> So, I have a beard. :) And I don&#x27;t much believe in ordering things for it. Especially skin softening stuff. I mean how manly is that? Right? Got myself a Wahl beard trimmer and figure that&#x27;s about it. Now, I do have to offer a little background. I keep my beard short. Let it grow out to where it just starts to itch and then I trim it down to just about naked. Been doing this for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as luck would have it. I&#x27;m sitting at my desk one day and rub my beard. I look down and it appears to be snowing. I&#x27;m thinking \\&quot;dandruff?\\&quot; So I apply a bit of head and shoulders and that doesn&#x27;t work. Now, I&#x27;m panicked, because I am constantly in front of people. So I look up this stuff on Amazon and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold after one usage. Wow! It&#x27;s amazing. Take a little and rub it into your palms. Rub that into your beard and that ended that. No more snow. My wife loves how soft my beard feels even on days when her skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the bomb! I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Legit, the lady digs it. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t get the beard too oily, lasts forever, keeps the beast well tamed. All around does a good beard proper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can. This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried beard oils after I ran out the first time; nothing compares. I love it.</li>
            <li> I just received this.  This is honestly a little too hipster for me.  The container comes in a mini burlap sack, I&#x27;m sure hand-sewn by underprivileged youth.  The good news is that, so far so good, it seems to work as advertised.  It seems to reduce beard itching and irritation.  It also seems to condition my beard, making it smoother, and controlling flyaways.  The advice that came with the package was also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> My favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It holds the beard nicely,&lt;br /&gt;and she thinks the smell is intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I would recommend it!  Keeps beard soft.  Just wish the can was a little bigger..  used every day - lasted about 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> Works OK. Rather messy. Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, really makes the beard softer with a non-greassy sensation always you dont abuse during daily application</li>
            <li> it feels good on your hands and on your beard! It makes my beard soft and shiny, and the scent is okay, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. Still, this will make you look good and all the ladies will want to run their fingers through your manly mane.</li>
            <li> Holds very Well!  Will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> Helps the beard and lays it down well</li>
            <li> It really does help. I have a bushy beard and this deff helps, the only problem is after on week it&#x27;s half gone. This is a very small can, about 2 inches wide. Just can&#x27;t see me spending $35 a month for this. Coconut oil (the thick waxy stuff in a jar) is just a s good and a large jar will last for a year.</li>
            <li> My son said this made his beard really soft, yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product at all - the smell is overwhelming.  Had to return it.  It did make my beard quite soft though, but no more so than a few drops of good extra virgin olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to launder pillowcases twice to remove smell of clove.</li>
            <li> Great product. Beard is soft and looks healthier after use.</li>
            <li> This is my first use off a beard conditioner. I have to think there is probably much better products on the market. This stuff is extremely greasy. It helps with a kinky beard like mine minimally. I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but after I try something different I will repost.....</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who&#x27;s beard had become wild and unruly! He is using it daily and it really works! Smooths it and makes it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It smells great. It makes my beard shiny, not gooey or sticky, a must have for your beard. Its all natural and organic...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It makes your beard more manageable and much softer to the touch. I personally love there subtle smell of anise that it has. So does my wife.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes my hubby&#x27;s beard soft and smell really good.</li>
            <li> I love it, I feel ten times more Amish.</li>
            <li> This is my first adventure with a beard balm. After just a few uses my beard feels much softer and is easier to manage. The balm does have a slight scent, but I find it quite pleasing. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s minor and disappears quickly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my brother and he loves it!</li>
            <li> husband loves smell and makes beard soft and visibly shinier.  a very nice product</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my grandson. He loves the product.</li>
            <li> good anise smell, it melts right in your hands, and it gets rid of the beard itch.  I started my beard two weeks before I bought this here, and it really calmed down the itch and irritation, and the anise aroma is faint and pleasant, and it fades slowly throughout the day, so that by mid-day, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It really makes your beard feel softer.  Also seems to help with beard itch.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for some high-quality beard balm.  This brand initially drew my attention, primarily due to it being an Amish product.  I figured, these people have been balming their beards for hundreds of years, so they must know what they&#x27;re doing.  This assumption was absolutely correct.  A tiny amount keeps my beard in check all day and night.  It has a pleasant, light aroma that fades quickly.  I just wish it came in a larger size, as the tin is actually smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;Honest Amish Beard Leave-in Conditioner&amp;#34; for the past year and I am completely satisfied with the results.  The balm smells great (the wife approves...nothing makes her purr like a face full of fur) and does a tremendous job of softening the hair and eliminating split-ends.  Unlike wax, the balm is not greasy after the initial application and does not harden and leave a buildup after repeated use.  I use this once a day right after I shower with a beard comb to help even out the application of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Honest Amish to anyone with a full beard!</li>
            <li> Beard is softer after a week of once a day use.  Does add a shine to the beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! This was the first product I have ever bought for my beard and love it. It will makes your beard soft and managable. Highly recommended and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff.  He says that his beard is much softer.  I have to say I agree.  A little goes a long way. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and no chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, no pun intended, I really can&#x27;t tell a whole lot about the product.  I have used it day and night for about a week.  Its nice, and I actually like the scent.  However, I&#x27;m kinda just neutral on the product.  The balm is very &amp;#34;beady&amp;#34; like the texture of grits.  However, it does melt nicely with some rubbing.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product</li>
            <li> It works well for softening. My beard is getting to about 2 inches and was starting to feel like steel wool. I started using this after showers or in the morning and it softens my beard up great! It makes it a little easier to control but it&#x27;s not for holding or shaping. I&#x27;m going to get one of their other products too because my beard is starting to get too long to control with just this. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard shimmer as though touched by the angels themselves. Highly recommend if you want a pine scent for a 1/2 hour then a soft, supple beard for a few days. Great value and product.</li>
            <li> Good product, not too greasy. I found it softens my beard, but I was hoping it would tame the wild hairs a bit better than it did. Mine tend to get very wild, and while this helped some, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. However, as a conditioner it is great. I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have kind of an an unruly yet thin and patchy beard at the best of times, and it is usually pretty scratchy and coarse.  I&#x27;ve been using this beard balm for about a month now and my beard has been growing SO much more evenly and thick, and is way softer.  I&#x27;ve even gotten the &amp;#34;your beard is so soft&amp;#34; compliment while smooching, which, come on fellas, that&#x27;s the goal here.</li>
            <li> RARRRH! I just want to get ALL - UP - IN - THERE with my face and hands when my hubby puts this on!! And I do. LOL! After reading the reviews about the scent I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t like most colognes and licorice scents make me nauseated but it doesn&#x27;t smell like that at all to me, in the can or on my man. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint but smells so masculine, clean woodsy, and just wonderful manliness to this sensitive schnoz! Much to my chagrin, it fades progressively after a couple of hours. My hubby keeps his beard and &#x27;stach to a trimmed medium/shorter length but I have noticed a big difference in shine and softness with his twice a day use. He also has sensitive skin prone to breakouts and has not had any trouble with this product clogging his pores...or mine. :)  He&#x27;s promo&#x27;ed Honest Amish to his bearded buddies as I have to my girlfriends with bearded menfolk. No one product is perfect for 100% of users but we highly recommend you try this stuff.</li>
            <li> Too greasy and smelled weird</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, like tea and lip balm from a health food store, and a walk through a forest, in a manly way.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS..... Softened the goatee right up and, its a short hair goatee at that.</li>
            <li> I just got it today so I&#x27;ll update later. It has a pleasant smell, like sweet pine. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel to oily. One complaint, somehow the tin got dented during shipping. I&#x27;m not sure how this happened because it was in a box with huge air bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past and have been very pleased with it. I use it on a daily basis and because of this product have received many compliments of how well maintained my beard is.</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, though it goes away after maybe ten minutes. My beard does seem to be getting &#x27;softer&#x27; after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using Honest Amish for about 4 months and I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my beard. It seems softer and less of a hassled to come, even in the morning before application. Though my beard curls excessively, I am still able to enjoy the benefits of what this product offers.&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking to try other products in the line soon.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  It has tamed my unruly beard and turned me from a hillbilly to a trendy hipster.  Ok its not a mirmiracle worker, but did work really well for me. It has a, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, sandalwood kind of scent, it&#x27;s not that strong or overpowering.  I do like the scent.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal I&#x27;ve never used beard balm before but I&#x27;ll never go back to leaving my beard untreated, the scent is a nice easy earthy treat...spend some money &amp; take care of your beard!</li>
            <li> This would be the first beard product I have used, I like it. The product seems easy enough to apply, it keeps my goatee more manageable and it has helped in softening a wee bit (Its my first beard since youth and 20 years of never shaving it off, so of course its soft to begin with). The smell is different, I suggest using a light/minimal application as I would say the aroma when I first used made my stomache turn a bit. I would reccomend, I will likely get more but just use in moderation and when your beard is wet and seems good to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I was looking at other beard oils to get and this had the most reviews and most positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve never used a beard oil before but I now know that this is a must have for any guy growing a beard. I used to shampoo and condition my beard to stop the itch. That didn&#x27;t work. Tried a leave-in hair conditioner, that didn&#x27;t work either and made my beard flaky. After using this I&#x27;ll never be without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product mixes well.  I apply after the shower getting my beard towel dry and then I pinch a small amount out at a time. It takes a few seconds to get the granules to smooth out. They remind me of caviar. But once it&#x27;s turned to oil in my hands I apply to my beard. I go against the grain, in circles and then smooth it back down. Any of the excess I use on my face and arms. You can actually use certain oils (like all the ones contained in Honest Amish) on your face to moisturize (it wont cause breakouts) instead of lotions with who knows what in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look - My beard looks a little wet after applying but it soon dries. My beard looks healthy and manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell - I took one star off for this. But smell is subjective anyway. Is it awful? No! Do I love it? No. Some have said this has a licorice like smell to it. The only time I noticed it is when I put it on for the very first time. Since then I haven&#x27;t really noticed it. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe the smell other than it smells like a new 2x4. I would&#x27;ve liked something with more of a scent to it but again it&#x27;s not awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? - Yes! This takes away 95% of my beard itch! And my beard looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it. So far so good. It seems that my beard is getting stronger as well as smoother. Even, my beard hear seems to be alive now. I&#x27;d try other Honest Amish products for sure.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent but the burlap bag it comes in seems a bit hokey to me.</li>
            <li> Stuff is the jam. Takes your beard from sketch to legit in one rub down.</li>
            <li> Product is good. The can came badly dented on the bottom and on the side.</li>
            <li> works well for my husband. he doesnt care for the sent. id call it herbaly?</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> If your growing or have a beard, buy this product. Beard hair is much different than the hair on your head. It needs to be washed regularly, but it can get dry and wiry unless you have special products to treat it. A small amount of Honest Amish will keep your beard shiny and manageable (too much and it will get greasy). Tailer the usage to you beard length and you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift, my wife stopped complaining that my beard itched when I kiss her, so I guess it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice smell (that doesn&#x27;t last very long).  The tin seems small but a little goes a long way, I keep my beard short and this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Holy crap this stuff it great! Beats using hand lotion. That stuff made my beard feel mangy. It smells of black licorice, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff has brought so much life back to my beard definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> On my wife&#x27;s urging, I decided to regrow my beard after four years. The itching was driving my crazy and this product helped alot. It has a nice scent and doesnt leave my beard greasy. Its grainy when you spoon it into your plam but melts to a smooth oil when you rub it up. This is a good product that I higly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Great service too!</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best product he has ever used in his beard and he loves the smell. :)</li>
            <li> Product was very grainy upon arrival.  Melted and cooled per instructions.  Two days later (at room temp) it was grainy again.  I liked the scent and feel but for the price I don&#x27;t want something I have to mess with every few days.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The same feeling as when you deposit your check.....MONEY! My beard no longer is in a FRITZ! once applied has a debonair scent to it. Highly recommend and easy to apply. After a couple of days i&#x27;m liking how I&#x27;m able to brush my beard and it compliments that fresh side-part lumberjack looking haircut!</li>
            <li> Great product I previously tried hydrating my beard with different types of oils but this wax is great it smells sort of like black licorice and cinnamon I put it on once in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go all day</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but then again, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting.  What exactly is a &#x27;balm&#x27; anyway?  A lotion?  A paste?  Regardless, I am a convert now.  What comes is a small tin containing a very granular and almost gritty paste.  At first I didn&#x27;t see how this would infuse into my beard.  However, as soon as I put a small amount, enough to cover the pad of my middle finger tip, I could feel it &#x27;melting&#x27;.  All you need to do is gently rub it between your first two fingers of each hand for about 10-15 seconds.  The &#x27;grit&#x27; will fall off your fingers if you rub too quickly before it starts to melt.  The balm soon starts to melt and you&#x27;re left with a thick oil on your finger tips.  Just work it from the bottom of your beard, going against the &#x27;grain&#x27;, towards the top.  Really work it in all over; neck, mustache, cheeks, everywhere.  All you have to do now is comb or smooth your beard.  At first it may feel a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; but this quickly passes as the balm soaks into your beard and skin.  In about an hour you won&#x27;t be able to stop touching it.  It really feels nice.  After around three days you&#x27;ll notice a real difference in how your beard lays on your skin and how it feels.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.  It isn&#x27;t perfume-y at all and is very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> does smell a little like licorice, not too bad though. seems to be doing its job, no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product just wish you would get more than what was delivered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Filipino dude and I&#x27;ve grown a pretty full beard, over an inch long. My Asian genes left me with facial hair that is very straight and thick. I also tend to sleep on my face. This means that I wake up every morning with a wiry mess to deal with. After showering (no soap on the beard!) and putting this stuff on, it gets really soft and much easier to make neat with a little stroking. Personally, I like the scent. It&#x27;s faintly beeswaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is because of the straightness, thickness, and blackness of my beard, the balm can make it glisten in direct light. It might sound a little majestic but it&#x27;s not. It just looks wet sometimes. It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with a beard, and let&#x27;s be honest.... Sometimes my beard could pass as pubes glued to my face when dry. This stuff is great, apply it right after a shower or washing my face and it does well to condition my beard. I&#x27;ve received a lot more compliments on my beard for sure. A little truly does go a long way. I&#x27;m ordering my second jar now, after over a month of use.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy. Smells okay but it gets your hands greasy whenever you touch your beard and will turn your phone into a greasy mess after a phone call.  I does not soak in by any means. I will try to use the rest of this can because it costs as much as it does but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> A must-have for a long, strong, full beard!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves it and so do I. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong. IT smells a bit like licorice. I hate licorice so when I say it&#x27;s not overwhelming or bad, I mean it. Helps control the bead &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s greasy for about 15 minutes after he puts it on but after it, smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff for his beard. I&#x27;ve ordered it several times. Helps to keep it tame and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My beard is now nice and healthy looking. No more dryness. Takes away the itch. More manageable. The mild clove smell is subtle, not overpowering. I recommend it to anybody with a beard regardless of length. If your even considering it...just get it you won&#x27;t be sorry unless you hate the scent of clove.</li>
            <li> Gritty and smells a bit like black licorish. Not terrible, but I wasn&#x27;t wooes.</li>
            <li> did not soften beard-did not do what I expected</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, keeps my beard moist, manageable and almost completely flake-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying tins of this stuff for bearded friends with the following instructions: &amp;#34;If you like it, just buy me a tin. If you don&#x27;t, give me the rest of this one.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t gotten a semi-used tin yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, a complete stranger informed me he had &amp;#34;beard envy&amp;#34; so I pointed him in the direction of Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Makes man-thing&#x27;s beard even more glorious than it already is. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Provides good conditioning when used as directed. Great product!</li>
            <li> Honest Amish has the texture of a sugary paste with a light oily base.  But when you rub it into your fingers and beard, you don&#x27;t get a greasy feeling, unless you use too much.  It works  well, much like many of the  other balms on the market.  This wasn&#x27;t my favorite, though.  It has a very distinct anise/clove/black licorice scent that can be sickening at times, especially as the smell dissipates, and then you get an odor that smells like black licorice melting in vegetable oil, or something like that.  I know Honest Amish doesn&#x27;t use artificial fragrance, and that&#x27;s fine. But this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell isn&#x27;t that great.  I&#x27;d give it two stars because of the smell, but I can see many others like the smell, and it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to give it too low of a rating because of my aromatic preferences.  Although it helps your beard stay soft and manageable, it also smells funky.  So, yes, three stars: \\&quot;It&#x27;s okay.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Smells ok and works ok.</li>
            <li> Great product! As people are writing... There is the faintest hint of black licorice. It&#x27;s very mild and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all as the ingredients are all natural. I&#x27;m looking forward to being a Honest Amish customer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve always had facial hair &amp; my beard has always been a double-edged sword. I like having a beard, put I&#x27;m very particular about it. With this product, I noticed an immediate difference &amp; it seems to get healthier everyday. No more itch, no more soap flakes, just a healthy, full beard. If you take pride in your looks &amp; you have a beard, you need this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again. still trying other brands which all seem the same. Has a nice beard man scent and provides nice shine and softness to the beard. Women like to stroke me. Use too much and can be greasy start out with a pea size amount and work your way up all depends on beard length</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. I&#x27;ve tried several different beard conditioners, and while they worked in the short term, this is the only beard balm I have found that leaves my beard feeling soft and itch-free all day long. I have a very coarse, wiry beard and after about 5-7 days of growth I get a pervasive flaky itch that wages a war of attrition with my face until I give in and trim it down. Not anymore. 7 days, 14 days, 6 weeks, all soft and itch free with just a dab of beard balm. A little does go a long way; for new growth I&#x27;d suggest a dime-sized dab massaged into a wet beard. Honest Amish has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Good product. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and shine it gives to my beard.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes my beard soft and keeps wild whiskers under control. Some people don&#x27;t like the scent, but I like it. My wife has not commented on the scent. In fact, she&#x27;s keeping comments about my lengthening beard to herself. Hmm.</li>
            <li> All natural beard conditioner, leaves my beard feeling great. Helped relieve the itch when I started growing it out...Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good, I love when my husband uses it. It&#x27;s masculine without being overpowering, and also has a nice natural scent. He says it can make his face kind of greasy, so he uses only a light amount. I could see if you were prone to acne this could exacerbate it, since it is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;It does help his (curly) beard to lay down quite a bit, especially when it&#x27;s growing out.</li>
            <li> The Honest Amish Beard Balm works very well.  I do not have the tangles and the constant drying hair and breaking any more.  I will purchase this regularly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item. My husband says it feels nice and I love the way it looks and smells!</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner, leaves my beard feeling very soft, but not oily as many beard balms tend to do. Has a nice scent, a bit strong at first but it fades. Great product to use, especially in the winter as it leaves not only your beard nice soft and smooth, but your skin moist as well. Say good by to dry itchy skin under your beard.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells even better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beard balm.  It works.</li>
            <li> The reviews about this product are insanely positive. I must say I really enjoy it but it is not THAT great. I use this before bed because it gives the beard a shiny tint and is slimy, making it a bit unpleasant to wear in public (Beard gropers will get a handful of slime, and your beard will appear shiny in a bad way). I do think this softens the beard up a bit, but not that much. The oil solidifies at room temp and needs to be warmed up between your hands before application. It smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Feels great, and I love the smell.  I was worried it would be overpowering (I normally hate scented anything), but I listened to the other reviewers and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My Foo mancho while deployed was getting dry and sticking out everywhere. This is keeping under control. Smells good too.  Originally I had a beard and a friend had me try some of his which I instantly found perfect for my needs. But alsas as My beard now comes out white my gal said it made me look to old and I shaved it while home on R &amp; R.  I intend to regrow it when the weather strts cooling off and this product will be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my beard look great.</li>
            <li> Seems to be no different than an oil product you could purchase out of a body store. I really don&#x27;t get how anyone would say it promotes growth. Really? Don&#x27;t purchase for hair growth. That is a joke. It has a nice smell and it smooths out your facial hair but that is about it.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Moisturizes beard excellently.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my brother as a gift, he likes the smell and feel of it more than the beard oils that he has been using.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels soft.</li>
            <li> great product and great company. have multiple items from them and satisfied with everything. my girlfriend likes the smell of the stuff more then I do, but at the end of the day.... I don&#x27;t smell good for myself. When i have it on, it&#x27;s like there is always a pleasant smelling citrus candle burning in the room that i cant find. Keeps my beard softer and keeps it from drying up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. It smells great (like sassafras) and makes my goatee look luxurious.  A small amount goes a long way. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its one of the more softening balms. I like to use it when I have a lot of hairs going in crazy directions. I have other oils, but this one helps a lot better at keeping a tamed look for work</li>
            <li> This balm has a strange texture. It is sort of mealy and you have to work the tiny beads in your hand until they are gone. It doesn&#x27;t go on well and seems too light to be effective at conditioning and taming a beard. I also did not care for the strong licorice notes it has. They dissipate fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s hard to put something on your face when you object to the smell! I use Stingray Bay &#x27; s beard and mostache gloss and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Great cconditioner. Made my beard real soft. However it&#x27;s not so great at holding the hair in place but I guess you need a wax for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard look and feel great!</li>
            <li> I got this for my love and he likes it. Makes for a soft, sexy beard. It was delivered on time they are a great company with great products.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend uses this to prevent his beard from getting flaky from dry skin under his beard.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I am pleased with this selection, as it does all that I&lt;br /&gt;would expect from a top quality moisturizer and softner.</li>
            <li> Nice feel to skin and mustach.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used this on my beard for a few months now and I am very happy with it. It does just what is advertised, protects and helps with a healthy beard. I love the scent and wear it everyday. I recommend this balm!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Makes even my short stubble softer and keeps my face from itching.</li>
            <li> Works great on my beard, and as an added bonus my wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> my beard balm was delivered quickly and was everything as advertised, extremely happy and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. I&#x27;m finding out that I prefer beard oil, but I do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two months and its done wonders for my beard and mustache. It took about two weeks to really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife always complained that my mustache was so coarse it made her eyes water when the little hairs poked her upper lip, near her nose. Honest Amish has alleviated this problem almost completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after a good washing and conditioning in the shower, I rub a little Honest Amish around on the palm of my hand and smooth it through my beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: A little goes a long way. If you use too much and have a tendency to play with your beard as I do, you will end up making things you touch afterwards a little greasy/smudgy-looking. (Sunglasses, phones, etc) I figure this is my fault not the product&#x27;s, after all my stuff wouldn&#x27;t be smudgy if I didn&#x27;t touch my beard all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your beard/mustache is exceptionally coarse or damaged, you may need to give it a good trim to remove the hair that is beyond repair by a product like this. I&#x27;ve trimmed a 1/4 \\&quot;off three times now, and each time the hair gets softer and softer. Just a thought...&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, makes my beard feel soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! I would recommend this to every dude with facial hair! Even my girlfriend loves it!! She says my beard is a million times softer and doesn&#x27;t feel like pubes any more!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell of cloves, then don&#x27;t buy it. The smell fades not too long after application, but I could see it being a turn off for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect an odor, and while I don&#x27;t mind it much, I am inclined to try other products.</li>
            <li> Great product for taming and conditioning beard. Easy to use and effective. I bought some as a gift for my son too. I happily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have about a 3 month beard going.  This is the first time I have ever grown a real beard so you could say that I am an amateur beardsman.  I had gone a few weeks without shaving before, but never like this.  &amp;#34;No shave November&amp;#34; has come and gone and I do not see myself shaving off my beard for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I never knew how much goes into growing a proper beard.  Two months of growth in I started to feel like my beard was naturally getting a bit unruly and decided to look for beard growing advice online.  What I found were YouTube videos describing the proper combs, scissors, trimmers oils etc.  I looked to Amazon and ordered the two beard oils/balms with the highest ratings to compare and can say that I prefer Honest Amish balm over the other product I ordered that had very slightly higher ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a soft, yellowish solid form.  With your finger you dig out a bit maybe twice as large as a pea and rub it in between your palms.  Although if feels a bit gritty at first, it quickly melts into a nice, smooth oil.  Apply to a damp beard, by rubbing it in gently and then comb for a more styled, clean look.  You beard will instantly look more vibrant, clean, and refined.  The other product that I bought simply labeled as &amp;#34;Beard Oil&amp;#34; will give similar results, but I felt that I had to use more than the recommended amount to get the same results.  I think that this product gives a nicer visible result, but what separates them more than anything is THE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously smells come down to personal preference much of the time, but I think that this product smells AMAZING.  I can only describe it is a spicy smell similar to sassafras.  Perhaps it is anise, but I don&#x27;t really think it smells like black licorice.  The smell will dissipate after some time, but it does linger for a while.  Since I bought this product just a month ago, I have had two ladies complement my smell and ask what cologne I am wearing.  They seemed shocked when I told them it is product I put in my beard.  Also had one lady compliment my beard and tell me how clean it looked literally seconds after walking into a bar this past weekend.</li>
            <li> Keeps beard soft. When I don&#x27;t use it my beard gets dry.  Has a distinct smell, but it fades as it dries.</li>
            <li> Making my beard a little softer everyday!</li>
            <li> Works great!  My beard in the early stages tends to be a bit scraggly and stiff.  The beard balm was just what I needed.  It&#x27;s got a fantastic scent,  as well so making my beard softer and much more comfortable in my face.  I&#x27;d recommend this stuff to anyone trying to grow a beard or just as part of your daily beard maintenance.</li>
            <li> the smell is good-OK. it is very oily when applying, but my goaty gets soft next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have one big problem…my fingers are having allergic reaction and make the skin hard.&lt;br /&gt;I need to wear glove, or should I discontinue….</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells good but is not a strong smell. And keeps my beard from being dry, itchy or flaky.</li>
            <li> This is the most stinking CRAP I&#x27;ve ever smelled!!!! Had I known it smelled like a CLOVE OIL BARRELL I never would have purchased it!!!! Stinks to high heaven!!!!!! You can be smelled from 50 feet on a windless day!!!! Horrible!!!!! Axel grease would be better! Smell wise!!!! At least no one would smell you coming an hour before you got there! YUK!!!!!! Never again will I purchase from this outfit!!!! At least post the SMELL ODOR IS HIGH CLOVE OIL!!! So people don&#x27;t have to pay $16 plus bucks to throw it away!!! Nauseating smell!!!!! I wouldn&#x27;t give it a one but you have to rate it something!!!!</li>
            <li> My son loves it!  He loves the oil, balm &amp; brush &amp; his beard never looked better!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast delivery!  AAA+</li>
            <li> I does what it says. Controls and Condition your beard, and it smells great</li>
            <li> Seems to make my beard slightly softer but nothing amazing.  Smells nice but that is about it..    Can&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and smooths out my beard. Will order again.</li>
            <li> My fiancé&#x27; loved his beard balm and the smell!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, keeps my beard soft.  Also, I&#x27;ve grown a beard twice since I bought it - both times I did not itch like crazy at the beginning stage. In the past I&#x27;ve shaven because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the itching...this stuff solves that completely.  As far as the claims that it makes the wild hairs lay down....not for me and I just don&#x27;t see how it possibly could for anyone. I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one so obviously I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a random part of a gift for my significant other who was trying out a beard. I read mixed reviews mostly related to it&#x27;s smell. I decided to take a chance and purchase the item. My boyfriend was happy with it and wore it daily to keep his beard feeling nice, so apparently it worked. The downfall is that I actually could not stand the smell - at all - which really doesn&#x27;t work well when they want to put their face next to yours. Needless to say he no longer uses it. 5 stars for practical application but one deducted for stench.</li>
            <li> OVERVIEW:  Winter time means hibernation time, which means I use it as an excuse to let myself go for 5 months out of the year. However, growing a beard is an annoying thing because it would always get scratchy as it grew out. Until this point, I had no idea beard oils, conditioners and balms were a thing. But my five minutes of research concluded that this was one of the best-reviewed beard balms on Amazon so it had to be good enough for me.    PROS:  *  Solid -- This stuff starts in a solid form and melts in your hands, which makes it a lot easier to put into your beard than most other oils  *  Amish -- They have epic beards. They make this. This is not a coincidence  *  Au Naturel -- It&#x27;s made with nothing but the exotic oils, herbs and spices of Amish lore    SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE:  *  Scent -- This is a personal preference, but if you like the smell of Jagermeister, you&#x27;ll like the smell of this    CONS:  *  No Prime Shipping -- At least at the time I bought it, but it&#x27;s worth it none the less    BOTTOM LINE:  1000 reviews don&#x27;t lie. Treat your face pubes right and get this. It&#x27;s hands-down the best stuff and you&#x27;ll wonder how you managed to grow a beard without it.    This has been part of my 365 Review Revue: 1 review a day, with humor along the way.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! Makes your beard soft. NOTE: A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So far I like this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week now and I have one word.....WOW! I mean within hours of applying this product I felt my testosterone surging and had the uncontrollable urge to put on a flannel shirt and start chopping down trees. The product has made my beard so lush and strong  that it successfully helped defend my face from a grizzly bear attack, I don&#x27;t have a scratch but the poor grizzly broke his paw on my beard.  If you have ever wanted to have a beard that can protect you from a grizzly attack buy this product! The Amish know a thing or two about beards.....and buggies.... and making furniture.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, keeps beard looking great. Also use it in my hair like palmade.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to put in my husbands beard for months now! This product relaxed his coarse, brittle, curly hair and really helped soothe his irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews of people complaining about the smell, but I LOVE it! I massage the conditioner in his beard every night and the smell lingers onto the next day. Its an amazing earthy/woodsy smell. So if you don’t like that- don’t buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Honest Amish! I will be placing an order here soon- hoping to try out your bar soaps!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. It makes my fiance&#x27;s beard so soft and luxurious. It smells like a handsome man.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - only takes a little to add more volume and control for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I like the smell though it doesn&#x27;t last long. After regular use my beard does not seem significantly softer. Seems to be a decent value otherwise.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he did a &amp;#34;No-Shave November&amp;#34; and cultivated a tough, scraggly beard. I wouldn&#x27;t kiss him. He went to a local barber shop and had it trimmed nicely - but while it looked handsome, I still found it to be closer to a Brillo pad than something I wanted to cuddle up next to. While shopping on Amazon, I happened upon Honest Amish Beard Balm and decided this stuff needed to be in his Christmas stocking. It has definitely helped! His beard is softer and smells really nice, in a subtle way that doesn&#x27;t overpower or interfere with cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy another brand than honest amish their balm and oil are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived next to the Amish for over 18 years and they never told me about this product.  My beard was driving me crazy and I was ready to shave it off, but after application, the beard softened and feels nice.  I did have to melt it to mix the product, but that was no big deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that left my beard feeling very soft in less than a week.  Wife approves!!!!</li>
            <li> I love how soft and controlled this makes my beard feel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff that wont make you break out. Softens your beard up but you wont be able to style it with this stuff it is not that type of consistency.</li>
            <li> I put this in my husband&#x27;s stocking for Christmas this year. He likes having a beard but always ends up shaving it after a couple weeks because the dryness and itching drives him crazy. He absolutely loves this balm! He&#x27;s kept his beard for almost two months now and it looks and feels great. I also love the way it smells on him. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great, looks great, would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good.</li>
            <li> I was initially surprised by how small the tin was, however, a little dab will do ya. Nice product with a clean clean scent. I use this product after I get a shower at night and follow up with the beard oil in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> Received this product as a gift. It improves the look and comfort of my beard. As a bonus it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star because I don&#x27;t think its the best product for me. not that it isn&#x27;t a good product its just not for me. because I know people that use it and love it</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. It works great on the beard. My only complaint is that the little grains of wax don&#x27;t always dissolve. This product is good, but I prefer others. My favorite beard product is Beard Grease from The Beardsmith.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling , very greasy. Apply gently. Keeps the beard nice.</li>
            <li> Great beard oil. Really conditions facial hair</li>
            <li> Works great.  Beard is softer and no beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> No, the smell is not strong, yes, it is pleasant, and it makes even my scratchy old beard feel (relatively) soft.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the growth, but if I do then I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, feels awesome in my beard.  I love the scent, it&#x27;s very light and a bit woodsy.  I recommend this over beard wax any day, feels a lot more natural.</li>
            <li> I have found a new lease on life through the use of this of this this remarkable product. If you are growing a new beard like I am you know how irritating it is at times. Honest Amish has saved me from the grips of the persistent itch. Many thanks to you my bearded brothers.</li>
            <li> Best beard balm ever. The first time I&#x27;ve used this brand. In 3 days my beard has a softer feel better management. Honest Amish you have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Good conditioning oil.  Slightly scented, but that doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour. My beard is definitely more comfortable and less itchy.  This is the first product like this I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to others.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best product I have purchased in a long time. Without this product my beard is itchy and really hard to maintain. My beard looks fuller and definitely feels a lot healthier. It is not super oily and soaks right into your beard and skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to grow a strong manly and healthy beard. If I could put 6 stars I would.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the beard balm</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who loves it.  Makes his beard soft and the fact that it is a balm and not an oil that will spill is great.</li>
            <li> makes my beard feel great, makes my skin a little greasy when i sleep with it in. that is all.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Just arrived. The scent is strong. Was hoping for the faint licorice scent I had seen mentioned in previous reviews/answers. The clove is quite prominent. As far as softening it works well.</li>
            <li> give it&#x27;s actually more than three and a half stars reason behind it is because after a while it would start smiling more like popcorn in the Apple Cinnamon that I got but it stays with you all day s and during the shipping it did not get watery which was great. I really appreciated products would recommend to others and I use it when I&#x27;m not using my wax for my much beard</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my son, and he loves it</li>
            <li> Hubby loved!! Has great smell, and make mustache lay down well..</li>
            <li> Not greasy and gets the job done, my dad really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite -- it&#x27;s oilier than the other balm I had (beeswax based), and the smell doesn&#x27;t dissipate that quickly.  I have a 20 minute drive to work and can smell it all the way there.  Not my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> My order was received earlier than expected, pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I put this product in a few times a week. It smells of Anise, and some people think is too strong a smell. Fortunately, I am not one of those people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I&#x27;m using it right, but it seems like it because my beard is luxuriant.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My beard feels softer already, and it&#x27;s becoming less itchy/flaky throughout the day.  Exactly what I bought this to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tough to work with in your hands after it&#x27;s melted down, but you get it down after a while.  I would suggest using some kind of stiff-bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that it feels intensely itchy for a little while after application.  The effect seems to be diminishing, though, so it may be something you just get used to.  Or it&#x27;s just me?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making my beard any thicker, but I know it does make it softer and easier to manage. The little can lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband months ago and his beard has grown to be about 4 inches long now. Crazy. This makes it easier to shape and then it keeps the shape. It also cured his dry skin, which was REALLY flaky before and now is 100% better. He loves the product. I love the look. A win win. We will def. purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into purchasing beard product, and I almost gave it 4 stars but I felt that doing so wouldn&#x27;t be fair.  I had hopes that this beard balm would help to control a few independent-minded hairs from doing their own thing in my beard, but this product really doesn&#x27;t do much for that.  I have since picked up Honest Amish&#x27;s Heavy Duty Beard Balm, and am much happier with that product.  I like the scent of the Heavy Duty balm better and the control is better.  But if you just need a product that will soften your beard and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of hold, this beard balm is great in that regard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it.  Uses it all the time. Shipped quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> instant change to my beard and not left with an oily feeling. very nice</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!...i love the product!!!</li>
            <li> Works well. A bit gritty but looks good on my beard. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s like crack for my beard. Huzzah!</li>
            <li> Amazing Product, very effective! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it,i&#x27;ll be getting another one soon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my second can</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. I love it BC he&#x27;s happy with it and it makes his beard nice and soft. It&#x27;s not too greasy and I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic; can&#x27;t imagine NOT using it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved this for Christmas. It makes his beard manageable and it glistens. I can touch it (because I like to stroke his beard while I ponder my life choices) and my hands don&#x27;t come away with residue. He said it&#x27;s great because any excess on his hands afterward he just runs through his glorious mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little deeper than I expected which definitely made the price seem less of a punch in the wallet. I&#x27;d buy it for him again ^_^</li>
            <li> I like it.  My daughters like the smell. I&#x27;m happy to get rid of beard flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the container was larger for the cost.</li>
            <li> Yeah I guess this stuff makes your beard softer, but it also makes it kinda greasy. The real reason for the 2 stars is the scent- somewhere between black liquorish and clove cigarettes... Not very appealing when applied to an area an inch away from your nose. Good luck smelling anything else but that all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the consistency is a bit dodgy- while the company takes pride in their hippy-dippy all natural, organic BS, this just means that the product separates easily, so you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of oil everywhere. What&#x27;s worse is that melts and gets everywhere unless kept at a low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, disappointing,</li>
            <li> Bought the balm as well as the wax. Both are outstanding. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> One month in, not bad.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great.  I am prime so shipped super fast.  Was using Jojoba oil but was clearly missing something, especially now the beard has more growth.  It can become pretty disastrous if left untended.  Simply run into palm and apply to a damp beard.  Yes, does have a scent and I usually get uncented stuff but this scent is unique and pretty good.  You can easily smell it within the first hour or so, fades after that.  But those who get close to will still smell it later.  It&#x27;s a must have to give your beard that great look without looking oily.</li>
            <li> Made my beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Only thing I do not like about this product is the scent. I realize it is an all natural organic balm which is why it smells like it does. It does the job though and I can notice my beard has a nice shimmer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily in my beard to an almost excessive amount, it leaves the hair feeling soft and comfortable.  One can lasts around 5 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a low review because the product has such a strong scent. On the product page there were nine answers to the question of whether or not this had a strong odor or not. The majority of them describe the scent fairly but they also say that the smell dissipates over time. That&#x27;s just not true, at least not with my tin or my body chemistry. The smell remained strong all day. And no, I didn&#x27;t put it on very thick. When I first put it on my beard I had my wife smell it, she said, &amp;#34;Eww!&amp;#34; Not the effect I was looking for! I told her that the smell would dissipate over time. She got home about five or six hours later and she still said, &amp;#34;Eww.&amp;#34; Even more than that, when it goes on your mustache it&#x27;s right below your nose. The smell was strong under my nose all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it did make my beard feel great and helped the longer hairs to be in control. So that part of this product is right on the money. The product&#x27;s ad did not say it was unscented and they describe it as being made with essential oils. That is going to have a stronger scent. So I guess my problem is mostly with the answers that were given by others that have bought it. I think the company should mention a bit about the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower and it helps maintain essential moisture in my beard and helps retain its proper shape for the day. I strangely enjoy the fragrance as well. Gotta trust the Amish when it comes to beard care</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my face from drying out which is a problem for me in the winter. The smell also reminds me of Jagermeister so I can&#x27;t use it everyday because it makes me want to drink.</li>
            <li> For the most part it is a good product. It leaves your beard very shiny and smells good. I do not like though that it does not do much in the way of taming your beard or causing the hair to lay down but wild hairs are still wild. I do not have to much to compare it to but am not regretting buying it.</li>
            <li> Fanstastic product to rein in an unruly beard during winter grow out. Used as instructed and works well, especially with a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of beard conditioners and like this one best. It gives good control and smells good. Took some getting used to the scent but it grew on me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I just received my third tin last week.  It really helps to soften up my beard and makes it easier to get a comb through it in the morning.  It also seems to go a long way toward holding in a bit of moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used and I like it. I used the unscented first so I thought I would give the original a try. It has a pleasant smell. Licorice. I&#x27;ll buy again when this can runs out.</li>
            <li> My beard likes to get crazy and go in every direction except the direction I need. This product helps to soften my beard and keep it in place. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> It has a weird consistency.  I have been using my hair dryer to warm it up, but not the best I have used</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I don&#x27;t think it is providing enough control over my wild hairs.  But I&#x27;m still giving it a chance.  Maybe it&#x27;s conditioning properties will tame the wirey wild hairs that shoot out at all different angles.  I like the smell, not to strong, have gotten no complaints from the ladies. I will try other waxes to compare.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, made my beard softer and happier.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Makes my beard nice and soft and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> Works very well, we saw a nice difference in texture by the second day</li>
            <li> Amazing beard conditioner! I love the scent, which is not overpowering, as well as the way it makes my beard look and feel!</li>
            <li> Good Product !!. It does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this balm for over a year. Girlfriend says it makes my beard soft, loves it actually. The best feature I have discovered about this product is that it is receptive of essential oils. I think it is great alone, but palo santo, patchouli, whatever blend you mix in works well. Softens the sharpness of using essential oils.  I made my own blend, many compliments.  Disclaimer:  I&#x27;m in rural Northern California.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend patchouli and palo santo in suburbia.</li>
            <li> Great smell; distinguished and earthy.  enjoy using the product and doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this stuff, it keeps his beard tame.</li>
            <li> Takes away some of the frizz and makes it smell very nice. Comes in a cool little bag straight from amish country...</li>
            <li> Good smell that doesn&#x27;t linger and is not overbearing. I prefer this &amp;#34;bees wax&amp;#34; over beard oil.</li>
            <li> Beard is softer and smoother than it&#x27;s ever been. And it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my only complain is the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I thought as a balm it would have more holding and molding power to keep stray hair from stickout out 90 degrees from your face - it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The price is a bit steep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you just want a conditioner it&#x27;s excellent stuff, if you want something that has a bit of hold look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard touchably soft. really.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product after reading reviews and knowing a few bearded comrades who have used this beard balm. If you have sensitive skin I would be cautious of this balm. I have been using this for a good month everyday. Around the 5th or 6th day I noticed a slight break out of acne, no big deal it happens. At first I did not attribute the beard balm to the cause of the break out but after I stopped using the balm for 2 days my face cleared up right away with no new acne.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a good run but I will not be purchasing this product again and no I am stuck with a pretty full container I will not use</li>
            <li> bardzo dobra odrzywka do brody</li>
            <li> Very nice , great smell , does not hold as much as I expected but defiantly makes the beard looks much much better!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this stuff is. I was hopping it would help manage the &amp;#34;wild hairs&amp;#34; and the itch, but this stuff was so much more. It did help with the wild hair and itch, but it also took care of the spit ends, softened the hair, made it start growing like mad and thickened it up very noticeably. All this and I have only been using it a few weeks (2-3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I can smell it for first few min, but wife can not unless she is close enough to kiss. She loves how soft it is now.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften and relax my facial hair.  Without it, it feels dry and wiry.  I use about a pea sized amount and work it through thoroughly. This is the third puck I&#x27;ve used up and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Ever want to smell like that patchouli drenched vagrant playing a djemba for change outside your local starbucks? Well here&#x27;s your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using balms on my beard for about 3 years now and there is a really distinct line between a balm that smells good and a balm that gives the guy 2 cubicles down from you a headache. This isn&#x27;t coming from some novice that is emptying half the can into his beard and lathering it on like suntan lotion. There are lots of good balms out there, this ain&#x27;t one of em, unless you judge it&#x27;s quality by how offensive it is to everyone within a 10 meter radius of your beard.</li>
            <li> Really helps my beard maintain it&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about it, my first few applications (once every other day) didn&#x27;t seem to do too much. Then a beardless coworker mentioned that he&#x27;d love to have a beard like mine, one that doesn&#x27;t frizz. That&#x27;s when I realized how much it actually WAS working! Softer beard, less tangles, and nice and smooth surface. Go more than a day or so without using it, and it&#x27;s like night and day! (The great beard results lasted much longer than some &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell? Manageable. It&#x27;s grown on me, my significant other wasn&#x27;t a fan at first, but the reduction in beard rash against her face won her over quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, have started to look into their other products as well!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! The 1st time I used it my beard was instantly soft! I use it everyday and receive lots of compliments on how my beard looks and feels!</li>
            <li> Wow! I have tried several different beard conditioners, balms, wax, treatments, etc...  This is the first product I have ever had that actually eliminated my beard dandruff...or as I like to call it....&amp;#34;Mandruff.&amp;#34; This stuff is the real deal!!  I actually look forward to putting the Honest Amish Conditioner  in my  beard after a shower.  It has a great smell, but not to overpowering.  I highly recommend this product if you care about the health and appearance of your beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father who is infatuated with his beard, and he LOVES it! A couple things he has mentioned that are particularly great would be the wonderful honey smell, and how soft it makes his beard feel compared to not using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about this beard balm is that a little goes a long way. His beard goes about half way down his chest and he only uses a small dime size dab of it each day. I bought this product for him in December, and at the beginning of April he ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  You can tell that this product is of high quality.  The smell is pleasant and does not linger long.  They provide instructions and a list of ingredients with the product.  I was impressed with everything that went into this balm and I will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used oils in my beard and think this is so much easier to work with.  This product is in a solid form, but quickly melts into liquid when you rub it between your hands before application.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back to oils after using this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest Amish is quality stuff for the price.  I dig their presentation with the hand woven bag and the instructions they sent with the balm. I feel satisfied with what I got for the higher price (compared to some oils).</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because his beard is really coarse and prickly, while my skin is softer and quite sensitive, making it really hard for us to kiss at all. I literally get burns on my chin that are irritated, red, and peel with dead flakey skin. I was really hopeful that this product would help alleviate our problems, but to my disappointment, it didn&#x27;t do anything. It made his beard oily and funny smelling but neither of us could feel a difference  even with months of continued usage. We even tried to shave his beard and apply the product as the new hair grew in, but there has been no noticeable improvement. If anyone has any suggestions on other products we could try, please let us know!</li>
            <li> Found the fragrance offensive. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...definitely helps with the wild hairs and appears to thicken the beard up some.  I have been using it for a few weeks and can tell a noticeable difference.  Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves it! It makes his beard super soft and snuggable. The smell is a great perk too. Get this beard balm for your fellow beard lovers and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Great product, it does what it supposed to do. i recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and was hesitant to give it to him because he is picky about his beard products. A little over a month in, and he now uses it every day. I just had to order him another tin, because he is running out! He has a full beard, usually very coarse, but it has been smoothed and tamed by this product. The scent is pleasant, and it comes in a cute little burlap tie-bag. Would recommend for any true man with a wild beard!</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant scent and glosses up your beard! My beard looks and feels smoother!</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot. I cannot wait to order some more of the other products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me a bit of playing in the straw on the farm as a kid. But it works great to tame my crazy beard.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Wife approves. work friends approve. Great product! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product all around.</li>
            <li> Made my beard feel nice, which only served to make it more tempting to stroke.&lt;br /&gt;Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing stuff. Smells great. Feels great on the beard. Just freaking stellar. Thanks you Amish fools!</li>
            <li> I have decided to grow out my beard because I can!  In the process my beard has itched like CRAZY from the short spiky growth sprouting on my cheeks and chin. I searched all over for a solution including using conditioner, shampoo and more to see if I could tame the itch.  I found this little gem and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did, my beard is soft, and even a bit shiny.  A little goes a long long way towards taming the beard and giving it that little extra something.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Helps moisturize my beard!</li>
            <li> Works just like you would expect it to. Love the all natural smell and texture. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Works wonders, turned my beard form bristle to soft.  My wife no longer is afraid to touch it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best beard product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I could tell a difference in how my beard felt. After a week I can say I&#x27;m very happy with this product and my girlfriend has even been enjoying it as well (I get a lot more kisses now). It helps make my beard soft and adds a bit of control to it. The smell is subtle but very nice. I am enjoying this product so much I plan on trying other products the company offers. Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a very big improvement in the feel of my beard after just one use of this beard balm. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. While he really likes the way his beard feels and looks after using it he feels like he can&#x27;t in the winter. He works outdoors and says it makes his face cold. He still uses it on the weekends and will use it more often in the warmer weather.</li>
            <li> Hydrating, wonderful smell, but a weak hold. Doesn&#x27;t keep my beard as well kempt as I expected.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase. I did not see many good results. It was just oily on my beard. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do LOVE IT!  This stuff is great and keeps my beard soft and tame.  I just wish they sold it in gallons.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, but go through it quickly. I wish it also came in a tin about 4 times as large.</li>
            <li> This beard balm is incredible! It leaves my beard soft to the touch and provides a great shine to my beard. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like some other products and I&#x27;ve received plenty of comments about how nice my beard looks ever since I started using this product. Just a little bit provides a great result. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not over powering and a little goes a long way. A little dab will do on your fingertip, rub upward into your beard and smooth down with your favorite beard comb (try the EQLEF Green Sandalwood beard comb). I love the way it smells on my husband beard! A huge plus for Honest Amish is that in this chemical ingredient world, this product is ORGANIC!!!</li>
            <li> Little skeptical at first but after a day or so of use, HUGE difference.  No more itch. No more flaky skin. No more saying &amp;#34;Screw this! Time to shave!&amp;#34;.  Some claim the smell is a little unpleasant but no complaints in my experience, only compliments.  Only possible con was that during No Shave November people accused me of trimming since my beard looked too well groomed.  A quick tousle and it went from sophisticated gentleman to Tom Hanks in Castaway, and back with a few easy strokes.  Really tames the ole face pubes.  (Bonus:  I occasionally suffer pretty bad psoriasis flare ups on around my chin/cheek/general beard area which can be pretty annoying.  Since I started using Honest Amish: No. Flare ups. Period.  Those Amish wizards really know what they&#x27;re doing.)</li>
            <li> Really works well.  I have a very tough hair on the chin, and this softens and helps promote growth.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this product for his beard. It smells very fresh and clean. It also isn&#x27;t greasy. In the tin it seems a little grainy, but once you emulsify it in your hands, it turns out to be very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my beard. It smells great, and I don&#x27;t like strong scents, it feels great, it&#x27;s easy to put on, just ... get it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this product because I was having a lot of itching as my beard got thicker. After a day of use the itch was gone and the hair became softer and smoother. As far as the smell, there is a really nice scent that lasts for an hour or two and then it&#x27;s gone. This product is all natural and pricey, but you get what you pay for. I would recommend this product to anyone that is experiencing itchiness or dryness with their beard. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Originally I was concerned about the smell that others were leaving that it smelled like licorice or anise and since I can&#x27;t stand either of those smells, I was really concerned before it came.  Fortunately I read those reviews AFTER I ordered the product so I got to smell it for myself and I am glad I did!  The smell was great!  If you don&#x27;t like licorice or anise smells, please don&#x27;t dismiss this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It is super moisturizing and smells great. It’s the best beard tamer I have tried yet.</li>
            <li> My bf thinks its a little heavy of a product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent at first, but it grew on me a bit. Compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried, I love the consistency of this. It stays solid until you start rubbing it in your hands, and immediately turns to liquid. Pretty easy to wash off your hands too compared to others.</li>
            <li> I grew my first beard this winter and the itch was killing me.  This balm really helps soften the beard and eliminate itch.  Some people complained of the smell, but I think it is very subtle and fades very quickly.  It helps keep some stray hairs down, but I keep my beard fairly short.  If you have a longer beard, you might want some kind of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was a bit expensive for a small container, however a little goes a long way.  I use this just about every day after a shower and it has lasted me almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> Left my beard shiny and soft! Really awesome stuff! Has a pleasant smell, not too overpowering. Would defiantly recommend !</li>
            <li> My beard is quite thick, but has a lot of body and tends to twist and knot. This helps resolve much of that. I rarely have tangles after using this balm. It also helps my beard lie down since it usually looks a little frizzy. Because of the natural oils, it does give my hair an oily sheen after application that can rub off a little so use in moderation. It doesn&#x27;t take as much as you might think. My beard is also a lot softer after application, just as promised. A great investment.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much ! Have a nice day !</li>
            <li> Scent is great.  Really softens the beard.  Non-comedogenic blend.  Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works even better. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my nephew who has about 10 years to use this product.  Can&#x27;t wait to see him like his &#x27;ol uncle waxing up his big beard. :)</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! Takes a few days to get used to the right amount you need depending on your beard&#x27;s thickness. 4 days in and no itchy skin and my beard is much more tame. I use this with beard iol as well and am trying their beard wax for the days when I need a solid shape. Honest Amish is good by me!</li>
            <li> It feels tacky and smells too piney. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product with a -2 for the smell. I really wish I could return this and get a non-scented version.</li>
            <li> it is everything that it was suppose to be. helps my growing beard look good and tamed. and smells greta</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like the smell. But I think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Goes great with the Soap!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, but my husband doesn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of cloves. (Though it is a slight smell of it, it is not over powering at all.) When he does use the beard balm, it really does work to keep his beard maintained and soft. I only gave it 4 stars bc my husband hardly uses it due to the smell. But it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT JUST A LITTLE GREASY. THE SENT I GOT USED TO AND IT DID MAKE MY BEARD SOFTER. BUT FOR THE PRICE OVER ALL ITS NOT BAD, WISH IT WAS CHEAPER.IM GOING TO TRY ANOTHER PRODUCT.I WOULD BUY AGAIN IF THE NEW PRODUCT IM GOING TO TRY ISNT AS GOOD.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be as much if not more useful than quality beard oils. Works really well on large bushy beards.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gives you a nice, smooth beard and keeps the hairs down after I brush it. My only complaint is that it has a pretty strong licorice scent, but it only lasts for about 30 or 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hipster boyfriend who is new to the whole world of beards. He loves it and it makes his beard really soft. However, a little goes a long way, and if you&#x27;re over zealous with it, it can make his beard greasy. Smells nice, too. Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard smooth! And shiny last along time but the smell is alright</li>
            <li> Great balm for your beard. It has a pleasant smell to it and keeps your beard molded al day!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fear the beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years, I&#x27;ve had a soul patch that was my identifying feature.  I&#x27;ve always been interested in growing a full grown beard but after awhile it would get all itchy and unbearable.  I&#x27;d end up scratching at my beard like a dog with fleas.  So, I&#x27;d shave it off and return to the trusty soul patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the advice of some female friends who encouraged me because they all agreed I have the face for a beard I was determined to beget a full-grown beard and endure the itchy stage.  So, I did a little research and stumbled upon this Honest Amish beard balm.  Being the Beatnik, hippie type of dude, I liked the fact it was an all natural conditioner with organic oils and fruit and nut butters.  There are no man-made chemicals or preservatives.  The beard balm is also packaged in 100% recyclable materials.  All of this was important to me.  I only want authentic ingredients to mix in with my beautiful bearded hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with my first application, I am immediately awakened by the intense woodsy, manly fragrance.  I was concerned it might be too strong but nobody&#x27;s ever mentioned anything to me about the fragrance.  Being that my beard is right under my nose, I anticipate it only smells strong to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, the fragrance is fanning from all natural ingredients.  There are no fake fragrances or colorants in this beard balm.  Therefore, what you smell and see is organic and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the itchiness is immediately dissipated and perishes with each application to your beard.  I can now fully enjoy my beard in all its heavenly fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.  It softens the beard.  It nourishes the hair.  It works wonders.  It will be the only beard balm I ever use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, it has tamed his beard and the smell is fine (black liquorish). But it is very oily. less is more when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for your beard</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten fill use of the product yet, but I have read many reviews before I bought this. It helps my beard look, feel, and smell nice. It has brought out color and growth. I will be definitely buying again and spreading word!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size of the tin fool you. All you need is dab about the size of your thumbnail (less with a short beard). The smell is a little unusual, but not unpleasant and fades quickly, leaving your beard looking and smelling good. This conditioner definitely made my beard softer and most importantly to me, completely eliminated any beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> Best beard balm I have ever tried and I bought a few from Amazon. This won hands down BUT it may make you break out, as it did me. I have sensitive skin and evefrytime I started using it, I would break out a bit. I stopped for 2 weeks, cleared up..tried again..broke out again. Repeated this test a third time to make sure it was the balm. It was. So 4 stars because if I did not have sensitive skin I would love this stuff like crazy, as it works well and leaves you beard feeling NICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard balms and so far this one is my favorite. It has a nice clean smell with a little bit of licorice thrown in. It keeps my beard pretty soft as well. It would be nice if they sold it in larger containers for people with longer beards but as it is it lasts me roughly 3-4 months. It has the added benefit of leaving your hands smelling nice as well.</li>
            <li> First product of its kind that I have ever bought. I usually would just let my beard go natural. But decided to take a dare with this product. Works as advertised. Good packaging. Never had an issue with use. The only cons I think of is that I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey (but it did last me at least for a month). Also, the smell neutral, but had wished at least for some pleasant aroma. Still. I highly recommend this product. Very good!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I discovered it a few months into growing a beard last year. My beard was a bit dry and I had split ends. This really helped keep things conditioned and soft. Plus it was easy to use and didn&#x27;t have any offensive scent or texture to it, just moisturizing love for my beard. I ended up shaving that beard and starting over because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the shape, and this time I used Honest Amish Beard Balm from day 1. It made a HUGE difference! First off, I never went through any uncomfortable itchy stage as had always happened before. Second, the beard grew in thicker and faster than before - only 6 months to reach the same length it had been after 9 months before, and the hair remained straighter and tangle free with fewer split ends. And finally, my beard is thicker and stronger than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips - read the instructions and follow them because they really do work. A little really does go a long way - one small tin still lasts me a few months even as my beard has gotten longer. And over brushing or combing will still cause split ends - it is best to run through liberally with your fingers first and then only brush or comb briefly after the balm has been applied to get everything into place/shape.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your beard LOOKING great all day.</li>
            <li> the shipping package warns you to put it in the refrigerator to avoid any heat-related problems in transit and good that they did  --  we&#x27;re in a heatwave and heat-related problems occur whenever it&#x27;s not in the refrigerator.  if the heat keeps up, i&#x27;ll just join it in the refrigerator; if not, i&#x27;ll save it for winter use.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard softer and smells great. Not hard to liquify in the palm of my hands. Helps to tame the wild beast.</li>
            <li> Best balm I used hands down, keeps beard conditioned all day long, I will continue to buy products from honest amish</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about dropping $15 on a beard product, however, after using this balm for 2+ weeks, I am happy I did!  I have a sensitive nose and tend to get migraines with high-fragrance anything.  That was my main concern.  But this scent is great!  It&#x27;s light on the nose, doesn&#x27;t linger for hours, and is actually quite pleasant.  My wife really enjoys the smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for two main purposes: To tame the rogue hairs, and help soften my beard.  In 2 weeks, I can truthfully say this stuff works well.  I have curly beard hair, which creates a mess of crazy hairs!  This balm allows me to tame my beard and keep the hairs running in one direction.  Keep in mind it&#x27;s not a miracle worker; it won&#x27;t make curly hair straight!  However it has enough strength to keep them from sticking up and out!  It also does a good job &amp;#34;softening&amp;#34; your beard.  Beard hair is very coarse.  Prior to this, I had the dreaded &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34; going.  It hurt to scrub my beard with shampoo as I tried to cure that problem.  But after 2 weeks of this balm, my hair is much softer to the touch.  Again, don&#x27;t be dumb; it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  Your hair is still going to be coarse!  But it absolutely moisturizes and keeps the hair looking and feeling healthy!  My beard doesn&#x27;t hurt to rub anymore.  And the beardruff is no longer there.  The balm gives a nice sheen/shine to your beard also, which makes it look healthier to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  I so badly wanted to give this a 5-star rating and if I was single, I could!  However, while the balm works wonders for me, it has negatively affected my wife.  After kissing her with this balm in my mustache, she breaks out around her lips.  We tried the process of elimination to determine the cause and sure enough, it&#x27;s the balm.  I saw some other negative reviews about people having an allergic reaction to this.  It seems my wife is one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a tough choice ahead of me:  To balm or not to balm?  Balm and feel good/look good but no kissing?  Or no balm while looking like a homeless beard but kissing (or is that counter-productive...will she want to kiss me if I have the whole homeless beard thing going)??  Oh decisions, decisions......</li>
            <li> The smell of this is awful! Reading the reviews hearing the smell was amazing and all this other stuff I was expected something much better. It smeels like your poured jagermeister on your beard. The product itself is a little to heavy when in your beard it feels sticky. I am waiting to see if it actually softens the beard after only hae used it once.</li>
            <li> Love it...buy it. smells good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it gives my beard a little shine. I will buy it again. It was well packaged but did have to put it in the refrigerator for a little while to firm it up.</li>
            <li> Seriously I don&#x27;t see how some people can use this stuff. It smells ....all day. It is VERY oily/greasy. Think of melting some butter in your hands and then applying it to your beard. Not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have a big beard and this balm helps keep it soft and manageable throughout the day.  The fragrance is nice and my kids don&#x27;t complain about my kisses being too scratchy now.</li>
            <li> My goto beard keeping product. Have used several of their balms/waxes and they are clean, and do the trick to keep your beard looking fine.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve got a very large, full beard and this stuff not only keeps it fairly tamed, it also smells great and is easy to apply.  I&#x27;m a fan for life.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT. It makes my beard feel so alive. And the smell is very manly. Will buy .again</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel awesome. Definitely keeps it soft. Would highly recommend to any guy who is noticing flaky beard syndrome.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, my beard is soft and the balm has a nice but not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Helped me to soften my coarse beard. Do not need to use that much of product to condition my beard.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product. The smell is a bit different in my opinion but it&#x27;s not overwhelming which is nice. It really does make my beard feel great and healthy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the beard balm. Smell is ok.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Definitely keeps your beard from straying out too bad.  Do not need to use much, which is good because it is a small container.</li>
            <li> Must have if you have a beard.</li>
            <li> My first order of this product was an accident, one click oops. Got it, tried it, love it. Now I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I gave as a gift, and was told that it works really well. Makes beard really soft. Girlfriend not fond of boyfriends beard,but said much softer now.</li>
            <li> 100%!! I&#x27;m a duck hunter and I like growing a beard during hunting season. However, because it itched and looked so bad I would usually shave after a few weeks. It is December 31 and I haven&#x27;t shaved since before Thanksgiving!! It really works!! No itching and softens very well!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Smells great, softens and tames the beard. Highly recommended if you have a full beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He really likes it. It leaves his beard soft and smooth, easier to control, and it smells good.  It does exactly what it says it will do for your beard or mustache. We will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My beard is already softer.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what this did. Smelled decent, but didn&#x27;t really benefit my beard in anyway?</li>
            <li> It helps tame hubbies beard and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> When I started to grow my beard out I realized that I should probably look into conditioners, oils, balms just to see what was out there.  I was recommended Honest Amish by a friend, further realizing it was the #1 best seller on Amazon so I knew it must be good.  The tin that holds the conditioner is thin metal and dents easy but not a big deal, whats inside it what matters!  The balm is tan in color and appears to be tiny beads, I usually use the side of a dime.  When you scoop a little bit of the balm out of the container and rub it in your palms, the beads turn into an oil.  I apply it to my beard when I get out of the shower and it is still a little moist.  The balm has an interesting floral scent that is not overpowering and a little goes a long way. The balm gives your beard a little shine and leaves it so much softer.  Days that I forget to use it I regret second I walk out of the house.  I have since gifted it to my brother who also loves it.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the Beard Balm! It makes my beard feel soft and manageable as well as thickening the beard.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it!! Leaves his beard smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent and the pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li> The love the smell of this product and have gotten a number of compliments. The product melts in your hands instantly and gives the beard a great smell and softness.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer and he loves it!! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works good-smeals great</li>
            <li> Consistency of semen mixed with crisco not a balm more like a sloppy disgusting mess I struggle to think how you are supposed to use this. It smells like chemicals and has a disgusting texture. Seems to me that  the balm is subject to summer mail melting then it just separates and never returns to normal (not fridge not room temp house).</li>
            <li> excellent product. my beard comes in very wiry/scratchy, and my skin underneath dries out and itches. this really helped with both issues. you have to be judicious with how much you use -- too much and you&#x27;ll notice a bit of oiliness. you can pat it away easily enough. bonus feature: this stuff smells really nice, but not overpowering or cologne-y.</li>
            <li> works great for long beards</li>
            <li> This has worked well with my beard and will continue using it. No smell that causes problems for me. If you want something that works well give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this.  I was really skeptical because I tried other products and they kinda failed me and I was worried the smell would be bad based on others reviews but I am pleasantly surprised.  I have had issues with my beard feeling very coarse even after regular shampoo and conditioning.  After one use it was helped fairly substantially.  Also I really like the smell and my GF doesn&#x27;t mind it.  I usually use it before work around 7am ish and the smell is basically gone in a couple hours.  So I am not sure what people are complaining about.  Heck I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the smell stayed all day.</li>
            <li> Smells great, keeps the beard soft and makes it soft if it already isn&#x27;t. Helps keeps the fly aways down, conditions the beard and makes it shiny (not greasy looking, but awesome looking). A 2 oz. tin lasts me about 4 months with the recommended amount. My beard is thick and wiry (but soft wires thanks to this balm) and only about an inch to an inch and a half in length. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used to use blue beards revenge and before that I used some super expensive leave in conditioner I stole from my mom back home. This smells masculine and works better than both. Such a small amount needed! Keeps the beard thick, soft, and untangled even in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad&#x27;s Christmas present. We both enjoy the scent - it&#x27;s pleasantly mild.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves his thick facial hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I figured it would take me about a week to see results from using this. But after only a day of use, I could see that my beard looked healthier, and was also much softer to the touch. Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell here, but everyone that has been around me while the smell is still noticeable have commented that it&#x27;s a nice earthy, natural smell and I can&#x27;t get enough of it. It is easy to apply and though the container is small, you don&#x27;t need to use much at all unless you have a ZZ Top style beard. An added bonus to it&#x27;s daily use is how soft it&#x27;s made my hands. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone thinking about growing a beard, and my room mate will be trying it out in a few weeks once his beard gets long enough.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, would buy ten times over!</li>
            <li> This Balm is great, I love the way it works in the beard and has a fantastic smell</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product. Excellent Service.</li>
            <li> GOOD STUFF !! WORKS WELL !!</li>
            <li> Product was good, did the job, customer service is really fast!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about this product if I wanted to. Prompt shipping. Excellent product. It produced a noticeable improvement of beard/mustache growth; also provides a pleasant shine and softness. It has a strong nutty scent which some find medicinal in nature but is quite pleasant. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and luscious. I wouldn&#x27;t trust my beard to any other conditioning product.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Leaves my beard softer and easier to comb/brush and a bit tamer!  Also smells great -- but not overpowering.  This is my 2nd tin -- one for home; one for the boat.</li>
            <li> Works well for my husband.</li>
            <li> Product was simply a waste of money. If you&#x27;re looking for something to help soften your beard plz look else where.</li>
            <li> Bought for boyfriend for anniversary and it works great! His beard is not only stronger but more gentle on my face😀</li>
            <li> Perfect and smells great!</li>
            <li> very soft beard..smells good and earthy</li>
            <li> I have worn a goatee for a few years. It is a abrasive to my SO, so I thought I would try a beard care product to see if it would soften my beard and possibly promote some more even growth. While this product moisturizes and smells fine, I haven&#x27;t noticed either of the effects I was looking for. If my opinion changes after I have used the entire can, I will update my review. I definitely will not buy again. There are far cheaper moisturizers. I am a carnivore, so the the vegan, etc. aren&#x27;t really a selling point for me although I do prefer fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great and my husband loves it!  I bought him one run for Christmas and ordered two more because he liked it so much. It conditions well and has made his beard very manageable. Delivery was speedy too!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this product. I am a Muslim, so a beard is a must. I have always had skin problems since I was a kid and no amount of washing and conditioning my beard was helping. I bought this and within the first week not only was my beard much softer, but the skin under my beard felt so much relieved! It&#x27;s Vegan and alcohol free so that means there are no Haram ingredients. And a little goes a long way, so it is a great buy. I find the fragrance to be very pleasant and not at all overpowering. I will be using this product for a long time to come. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used various mustache and beard care products, Honest Amish is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it feels good on my beard and face! I am new to this type of beard care, but this seems like a really good product. I have been using the balm for about three or four days and I have no complaints or regrets.</li>
            <li> Good product overall, it does what is says is does in conditioning my beard. I will say now that I am onto my second batch that I am getting tired of the &#x27;scent free&#x27; nature and the fact that it just smells like grease/oil. I like the product but I am thinking about buying small vials of essential oils to change up the scent perhaps even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to tame my beard and this really helps. I&#x27;ve had a beard for years but it has always been kinda ragged (rugged). The balm really helps to tame it. I like the way it feels as well.</li>
            <li> I originally tried BlueBeards Original Beard Saver and that stuff made my beard flake which I never had before, so i ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm.. Its amazing! I can put my normal face lotion on and then this Beard Balm in my beard and it feels great, leaves it in control and a little shiny (a healthy look) nothing overly shiny.&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, I think its a clean smell but nothing I can even notice after a hour or so. Nobody could smell it even in close proximity.&lt;br /&gt;2. The consistency is kinda like  chunky honey or chunky lotion, feels like honey with bits of wax in it before its mixed in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;3. I put about a pea size in my hand, mixed my hands together as if I was trying to warm up my hands outside in the cold and the Beard Balm turned into a oil, I then rubbed it into my short beard and it made it look great! There is a little shine, the beard is easier to control, feels soft and I can&#x27;t wait to use it over time to see how it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;4. I wouldn&#x27;t think this is made for hold, it just don&#x27;t have the consistently for hold,  its not waxy,  like I said when I rubbed it my hands it sorta turned into a oil.</li>
            <li> Best thing to happen to my beard ever. I can&#x27;t go a day without this stuff, it keeps my beard and skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The price is a little high, but it does a great job. It also works great on dry skin on any part of your body.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong or what. I like the scent, I like the ingredients, and my beard is definitely healthier, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than two hours before the scent and the feel of the oil are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Amazing balm that makes your beard soft, comfortable and smells great. Can&#x27;t believe how much I like it and my girlfriend loves the softness and scent</li>
            <li> Great product . It really make beard much softer and stronger. It smell good. Expensive but worth the price, quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this balm.  He says it is great for taming and softening his beard.  The balm is in a small container but lasted my husband 2 months.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it goes on easy and works on softening  right away i will continue  to use this more and more thankyou</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to do much with my beard except make it oily. Perhaps my beard hair is just too crazy to be tamed by an Honest Amish. I have also found if I use it more than one day in a row, I will get acne on my face. I should probably wash it off at night, but I didn&#x27;t...It would be helpful to send that information with the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, it smells great and did help marginally (hence the 3 stars instead of 1).</li>
            <li> Softens and conditions my beard, with a very light scent. My lady friend absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. My beard feels better on my face. Girls smile a little bit longer, that the sun shines a little bit brighter, and my beard smells like I care about myself now. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great been using it for a couple of days and redness has reduced.</li>
            <li> So good. I don&#x27;t usually buy nonsense that says vegan gluten free straight edge organic but this is a solid beard balm.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about this product before I used it.  Now I enjoy the looks of my beard.  It works!</li>
            <li> Makes beard feel softer and more manageable, and gives a bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. you wont know how much your manly face beard needed this until you go without!  Can be a bit oily for the first hour but then it disappears and all is good!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Good quality.  I bought 4 and have them over every door on my &#x27;15 JKU.</li>
            <li> Love it so far. Instantly felt a difference the first time I used it. Smell isn&#x27;t bad and its very faint. If your looking for something for your beard give it a shot. You will be happy. I keep my beard 3-5 inches long and this balm just makes it feel so soft and conditioned all day. Definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> Not only the best beard product I&#x27;ve tried, but the best male care product I&#x27;ve ever tried. The smell alone is enough to make me want to put it on. It smooths and softens your beard, gives your hairs a nice shine, and makes it easier to comb and style. My wife loves the smell and always reminds me to put it on before work!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husbands beard. He loved it! My 3 year old likes my husband to do his hair with it too! It&#x27;s perfect! Definitely going to keep purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is literally obsessed with this. A great smell, make his thick long beard smooth and shiny. I give it a 15 out of 5!</li>
            <li> Husband says it works well and I&#x27;ve noticed his beard is more tame!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face and beard very moisturized and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have never tried balms or beard oils before and I was pretty skeptical that they would do what they promise. But when I got the Honest Amish product it exceeded my expectations! I even use it on a bald patch on my head and it&#x27;s made the hair seem to be fuller in that area. My wife prefers me to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow which would normally be very prickly, with HONESTAmish it is soft and doesn&#x27;t itch making it easier for me to maintain. I only wish that the can was bigger.</li>
            <li> Really tames my beard. Smells nice, but the fragrance fades in an hour or so. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my beard kept it were I brushed it and  held it in place. Left my beard soft. Easy to brush through. Also has a great scent that&#x27;s not over powering. Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, so I took a chance since it was a fairly low price.  My beard is scratchy and very coarse, so I put this on every morning after I shower.  Seems to help pretty well, and I do really like the feeling of putting it on each morning.  Highly recommend this if you want to help out your beard!</li>
            <li> Only wish the container was larger and held more product for the price.  But then, I will likely re-order even so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went for so long without this. Must have for all bearders. Outstanding. Great. Riveting. Smooth, and silky</li>
            <li> smells great and tames the wire. The beard just drinks it up. Works wonders to bring the beard back down to earth after getting beaten up by the wind on motorcycle rides.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tin, I have a lot of beard and it seems to last me about 2 months per tin...  I started using it everyday, but now I notice that isn&#x27;t needed...  For me the application is key, I put it in after a shower, before i get out of the shower I put the water on as hot as I can handle and spray my beard down, then as soon as I get out I rub the product into my damp beard, and let it air dry after its all dried out I blow dry and brush my beard.  The result is a beard that feels smooth and soft like normal scalp hear and my wife loves the new beard vs the old brillo beard...</li>
            <li> One of the better beard care products I have used and my girlfriend digs the smell so that&#x27;s always a plus</li>
            <li> Really like this balm,  but my wife hated the smell.  I&#x27;ll have to try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my beard from feeling like a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> I bought Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-In Conditioner for my brother&#x27;s unruly beard.  He has since had a trim and looks a whole lot better.  This beard balm smells and feels nice.  It made an improvement in my brother&#x27;s appearance.  He also appreciated the beard care instructions included.</li>
            <li> So it comes semi-frozen/solid as I guess it is suppose to be. You need to warm up your hands by rubbing them together before putting some on. Rub it on your hands again to make it melt and then run your fingers through the beard. Overall, I would definitely recommend this. It has a distinct smell which is annoying the first couple of days but then you grow into it and it starts to smell pretty ok. I have thick black beard (1 inch length) but it does keep the beard shiny and hair untangled for the day.</li>
            <li> It will give your beard shine.  But it will NOT manage, hold, or shape your beard in any way (at least not mine at 3&amp;#34; length).  Although, people do take note -  saying &amp;#34;How do you get your beard so shiny and healthy?&amp;#34;  So clearly, people noticed.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Husband loved it. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Only used once so far since I got it, so we&#x27;ll have to see the results. But not too heavy, easy to work in to beard.</li>
            <li> I love Honest Amish Beard Balm.  Not only does it condition, it also helps wrangle wild beard hairs.  One word of caution, if you have a dog, put it away after you use it.  My dog apparently really liked it and started chewing on the tin.</li>
            <li> My son seems to like it a lot. He says it makes his beard shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.  I just wish they had a larger size.  This small tin lasts me 4-6 months, but I would rather be able to get a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. No amount of reading reviews does this stuff justice. Buy some and experience the joy of having a well-tamed, healthy man-forest on your face.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase of the balm for my boyfriend. He loves how easy it goes on and has been very happy with how it helps tame his beard and condition it. Plus, it smells really good!</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me for xmas.  I hadn&#x27;t asked for it, didn&#x27;t even know it existed or that it would be useful.  I use it every morning now.  The scent is pleasant without being overwhelming or girly.  It seems like it has softened my beard but I can&#x27;t really speak from experience (it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s cheeks that get scratched by it).  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.  In fact, just this morning I sent a link to the product to a guy at work.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I bought this for my man friend and he loves it. Beard is soft, sexy, and smells great!</li>
            <li> after regular use my beard looks and feels super healthy.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smells so good. I wish they made cologne with this scent.Oh, and it&#x27;s vegan too!</li>
            <li> First time user and its a great product!!</li>
            <li> Its makes the beard a little softer and less itchy.  But it does nothing for taming the wiley hairs.  Smell is ok, but if you dont like scents in general, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> First off, my wife is not a fan of my beard. It&#x27;s too &amp;#34;scratchy and pokey&amp;#34; she says. A friend of mine recommended the Honest Amish beard balm since I was letting my beard grow out. I used this stuff for one day and my wife commented about how soft my beard has gotten! No joke. This stuff is awesome and it smells good. Kinda like licorice when it goes on, and sort of cedar smelling after a few hours. Not over powering though. I noticed my dry flakey skin under my beard has started to go away too. I am considering some of their other products since this one has been so good.</li>
            <li> FAST Shipping!! On my second tin, Works great!</li>
            <li> boyfriend loves it so i guess it works !</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  It has a smell to it, but I have found that most people love it.  My beard was much healthier after using this.  I put it on after every shower.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard conditioner that I&#x27;ve bought, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it. The greasiness described by other reviewers hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me, but I would expect that they are just using too much. The directions say to use a very small amount, and when mixed with wet hands it spreads well.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as off putting as some reviewers make it out to be. It&#x27;s kinda of a lavender/licorice smell that I find to be nice and soothing.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> Works really well if you love a greasy beard!</li>
            <li> I like it so far, my main points about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does have some smell to it, nothing that bothers me but people who are extremely sensitive to odors should be aware of it.&lt;br /&gt;- Makes your bear look better, period. I don&#x27;t know about softer as I don&#x27;t particularly touch my beard a lot.&lt;br /&gt;- No reason to doubt the ingredients list, so the fact that its all natural is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;- Its cool to have a product for your beard, I don&#x27;t know why, but it is. Feels like you are taking your beard seriously (this coming from someone who never uses product on his hair)&lt;br /&gt;- I use it after every shower, as my beard is only like 2 inches long or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point though, they say that after you are done applying the oil, you should just rub on your skin whatever is remaining on your hands, I don&#x27;t because of the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love the woodsy sort of scent. A tiny tiny bit goes a long way. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, he was very pleased with it. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all. It gagged me. Smells like licorice. YUCK. Made his beard soft though.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for beards of all kinds, and smells great, too.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of couscous at first (weird isn&#x27;t it?) but quickly melts as long as your hand is warm. It turns into a kind of oil, which I thought would be bad for my combination dry/oily skin - I tend to stay away from oily products. Surprisingly, I don&#x27;t mind the oily consistency which is unusual for me. It just takes awhile for me to work it into my skin, but the results are pretty awesome. I&#x27;m cursed with EXTREMELY coarse hair (a downside of my Hispanic heritage) and this product has worked reasonably well in softening it. It will probably never be super soft, but it&#x27;s gotten to the point where it doesn&#x27;t feel like a Brillo pad. I&#x27;m not sure I like the smell that much. It&#x27;s not unpleasant exactly, but it smells like anise, which is somewhat like licorice - not my favorite smell but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Keeps the curly part of the beard in check - nice and soft and no beardruff!!</li>
            <li> First, backstory.  I have about a 4-5 inch beard.  I was getting horribly dry skin, mostly on my chin.  I would use my wife&#x27;s conditioner, but it would only help so much.  I looked into beard oil, but didnt want to walk around shiny all day.  So I figured, why not.  I was skeptical at first, wondering if this stuff would really work.  BUY IT NOW is all I have to say.  I wasnt sure if the smell was going to be overpowering or not.  NOT AT ALL.  If your beard is in good condition, but you want it in great condition, this will be the best purchase you will make.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. His beard was so out of control and scratchy. After just one application his beard was like a whole new beard. It was so much softer and much more tamed with those unruly stray hairs. Absolutely going to purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Completely melted upon arrival, and popped in fridge before opening. Smells good. A little oily. Waiting to see how well it works in time.</li>
            <li> Best beard oil I have ever used! It&#x27;s actually natural oils and not some hard paste that doesn&#x27;t lather or spread</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is a great product. I am definitely impressed with how soft and full it has made my beard. Have only been using for a week or so and can already tell a difference. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...I love it!</li>
            <li> I started using this when my beard was about half an inch long. It really helped keep the hair soft and in place during the day. The container looks small but it lasts longer than I thought it would, it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to get your beard looking good.</li>
            <li> Great product! A little goes a long way, it also has a nice sent to it no too strong.</li>
            <li> I like the stuff.  It smells good and works in nicely.  Having never used a beard conditioner before, I have little to compare this to. I think time will tell whether it truly softens and strengthens my beard hair (what a weird statement).  Anyway, I recommend giving it a try if you think you want to experiment with beard balm.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so natural, and feel great. It is a thick goo that you scoop onto your fingers, then you rub it together and it become an oil. I use the excess oil in my hair, and it gives it a nice natural shine/keeps the friz away.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband &#x27;s beard. He has been growing it out for over a year, but noticed it was getting dry and not much longer. He started using it and his beard is very soft. Very light scent which smells great. Added shine and glow to beard. A little goes a long way. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Thought this might be a little costly but decided to try it out either way.  It is a great product. Beard is softer than it has ever been.  The main thing that I love about it thought is that it does not make my face break out.  I used some hair oils that were cheaper and after a week of use my face broke out and I now will only use this product!</li>
            <li> Had my first beard balm experience at my local barber. Like it enough to search Amazon for it. Found this stuff, and since it uses natural ingredients, thought I would give it a shot. It&#x27;s a small container, but a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. Smells real good. Even the wife likes the smell. No flakes on my shirt anymore either. Would recommend this to anyone who loves their facial hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use... Not sure if it does anything.</li>
            <li> Since I began using Honest Amish I have no more split ends, my face-bear is soft and manageable, grows thicker and more lustrously luxurious, it looks roughly 62% more dashing and 100% MORE MANLY. (that&#x27;s practically double!) Ever since I began tending my whisker-crop with Honest A my face-fleece grows wonderfully fast; I&#x27;ve donated over 3 feet to Locks-of-Love in the last 90 days and I can still put those bird-dynasty wimps to shame.  My facial foliage is now so thick and strong I have to do my trimming with a hedge clipper and blowtorch.  I no longer have to worry about injuries to the head or face, as my chin-bacca will undoubtedly protect me. Since my first tin I was promoted at work, my wife got hotter, car got faster, the kids are better behaved, I got six-pack abs overnight, my junk looks bigger, and my dog started wearing sunglasses. I highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of responsibility immense enough to wield the great power this product will bestow upon you and your front-mullet.  You will not regret purchasing this product... unless you have a pencil-thin moustache and goatee- in which case you are obviously evil and Honest Amish will melt your dirty-beard into a thatch of pathetic peach-fuzz.</li>
            <li> came separated, the instructions stated to leave in a window to let warm up and it would reconstitute, this works but only for about a day and then it separates again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, in fact the best I have used.  No residue as in other products.  I found comments in other reviews about.less then desirable smell to be unfounded.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> A great product made in a responsible way. My husband loved this gift and I love that he actually uses it. It ticks all the marks; handmade in small batches with all natural ingredients, no animal testing. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I was initially nervous of the licorice smell (anise root, maybe? Licorice &#x3D; barf for me) but it&#x27;s mixed in with a bunch of other really great manly smells and I actually love it. Smell isn&#x27;t overpowering either.</li>
            <li> It truly is, &amp;#34;the best for your beard&amp;#34;. You&#x27;ll notice less itching first. As you grow your beard, you&#x27;ll noticed the softened hairs. My beard hair near my chin and the corners of my mouth haven&#x27;t softened up just yet, but I hope they will. I haven&#x27;t noticed the beard dandruff go away completely, but it does alleviate it for the most part. All in all, I&#x27;d recommend adding this to anyone&#x27;s beard regimen. Wash with castile soap once a week and use this once or twice daily. Add a beard oil if you choose, but this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li> My beard was pretty rough coming in and I tried just reguar hair conditioner it really didn&#x27;t work for me. After a week of using the beard balm my beard has soften and acutally looks fuller.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this stuff. Since he has started using it around Christmas 2014 his beard has been softer and healthier looking with a nice shine. I like the smell, and appreciate that it&#x27;s all natural.  Happy to have found something that we both enjoy.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Has a very earthy but mild smell. It gives your beard a glossy look and softens it. While the can is small you use such a small amount that it will last a while. I have corse hair so it&#x27;s nice to have found something that makes it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it during hot temps place it in the fridge for 30 min before use. It melts easy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on great, smells great, and does what its supposed to do. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to keep a well maintained beard. I will definately keep buying this product when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair since I started using it. Smells good and easy to apply. Works best right after shower.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> not a fan of the smell</li>
            <li> Good stuff, smells good. Seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exceeds expectations, but please BEWARE: LEAVE THIS AT HOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was traveling for the most important date of my life; the day I would marry my sweetheart of 4 years. I had MAJOR problems at the airport as a result of my decision to bring this product.  I missed my flight and the wedding had to be rescheduled the following week.  Needless to say, family and friends couldn&#x27;t make a second trip and we had to conduct our nuptials on the stairs of the courthouse.  Not the special day that my wife had hoped and dream of!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This catastrophe can be traced back to my decision to pack Honest Amish in my luggage. It was included in my carry-on bag which I brought through the security checkpoint at my local airport. Before leaving, I had transferred 2 oz. of this conditioner into a small plastic bottle and placed the bottle into a clear bag as TSA guidelines dictate.  Nevertheless, the unusual nature of this product aroused the suspicion of the TSA agents.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the texture or unique fragrance or random chance, but I was pulled out of line as they conducted a thorough search of my things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With surgical precision, the agent pulled apart my carefully packed items, including some male undergarments which were a surprise for my soon-to-be wife.  Finally she came upon the clear plastic bag.  With latex covered hands she carefully pried open the zip-lock and fished out the plastic bottle.  At this point I was nervous and humiliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She demanded, &amp;#34;What is this?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;A personal product&amp;#34;, I replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I should point out here that I&#x27;ve never had the ability to cultivate much facial hair.  In fact, the sparse growth on my lip and chin are somewhat embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I wasn&#x27;t willing to admit to a stranger that this was a product for my &#x27;beard&#x27;  Her tone got irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She asked again more forcefully, &amp;#34;What IS this?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly humiliated, I mumbled, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a beard balm...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, she couldn&#x27;t this make out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;WHAT?!&amp;#34;, she barked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the stress got the better of me and spoke angrily - or rather,  yelled:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;IT&#x27;S A BALM!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point things went off the rails.  I was pushed to the ground by an agent who was approaching from behind, handcuffed and detained in a small room for many hours. As I stated, I missed my flight, my wedding and was placed on a no-fly list.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on beard.  Be careful when opening the container for the first time, it may have melted and be in liquid form if it was delivered on a warm day.  Just let is sit a room temp for a couple hours before opening.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will order again. You get used to the smell and it&#x27;s not even bad.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s glorious beard doesn&#x27;t feel like pubic hair anymore.  Thank you, Honest Amish.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different beard moisturizers from shower conditioner to beard oils. Shower conditioners just doesn&#x27;t last very long and the beard oils tend to be very greasy and messy. Finally I found a beard balm called Honest Amish. I gave it a try and i&#x27;m glad I did! It contains natural oils and butters to create a unique moisturizing balm that moisturizes well without making my beard too greasy like beard oil. I have a short beard, and in the summer and winter, my beard tends to get dry which causes my skin to dry and flake. Absolutely love this stuff! It gives off a nice licorice scent which I am totally fine with. Also a little goes a long way. For extra kicks, I recommend buying a beard brush made with soft boar bristles so you can brush in the balm as well as neatly brush your beard.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few times varying the amount used.  Each and every time, my eyes would turn red.  Switched to another brand and no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell and the tin is nice.  Maybe I&#x27;m the one in a thousand that this happened to?</li>
            <li> Very Awesome! my beard grows in fairly coarse and this stuff helps make it 100x more comfortable and with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Best beard balm ever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing, my beard smells great and really soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must buy</li>
            <li> great product! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice product, like the smell and how my beard feels.</li>
            <li> This was part of a shipment that was sub par, but once I overlooked the damage, the product stood on its own.  I may try it again but I hope it doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged.</li>
            <li> A great beard product. People complaining about it making their beard to oily are clearly applying to much. Keeps my beard soft, shiny and manageable. I have been using Honest Amish consistently for over a year now and I&#x27;m very happy with the results</li>
            <li> My beard is softer now and looks better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It will tame the wildest beard!  And the smell is great as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the other reviews and bought it about six months ago. Stuff smells great, makes my beard soft, and helps it not itch. Also it puts a nice shine on it. Can&#x27;t go wrong worth every penny.</li>
            <li> arrived on time.  Smells great. Makes combing my beard a lot less painful as my beard is thick and curly and can be a pain to comb thru at times.</li>
            <li> I get very dry, flaky skin under my beard.&lt;br /&gt;This solved it AND smells good, or so I&#x27;m told.</li>
            <li> Work great!! Fragrance not so good</li>
            <li> Nice product. Smells good. Keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> a great product. my beard is very coarse and the balm helps smooth it down. worth the expense and maintenance.</li>
            <li> makes the beard shiny and soft and has a good scent. its a little greasy when you first put it in.</li>
            <li> Son uses it and he and his girlfriend love it.  Makes his beard very soft</li>
            <li> No gőod look good at all these one so cute did you see it s*** News TV no buena way</li>
            <li> The smell of the balm doesn&#x27;t leave and conflicts with any other lotions or colognes. .</li>
            <li> Made my beard itchier than without using it at all. I found no benefit to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot! Is as advitised. I only gave 4 stars because my girlfriend does not like the smell at all, I like it however..</li>
            <li> Truly a perfect product! It was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it even more than I do! Definitely a new staple</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what it claims. Softens your beard. Not a wax, although they do sell a wax. No more itching. Makes your beard look full. The smell is a bit strong and after reading reviews I was worried about it. Honestly it&#x27;s not a big deal. You get used to it. It smells like wilderness. If your girlfriend makes you stop using it because of the smell she can&#x27;t handle your savagery anyway. The tin is small but you need about a finger tip scoop. Last longer than you&#x27;d think even using every day, sometimes twice a day. I use a couple different Honest Amish products, sometimes they ship extremely quick and some times it takes a while.  Either way it&#x27;s worth it. Even though you think you&#x27;re a manly man with your manly beard you still have to take care of it. Stuff super legit.</li>
            <li> Great scent, leaves my beard feeling great! Use every other day, and only requires about the size of a dime of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 or 5 different beard products, and this is by far my favorite. A little more production, since it is a salve, not an oil, but the results were phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Softer than I expected and liquified between fingers to make a thick oil. Easy to use with a faint scent.</li>
            <li> Holds alright but smells like dirty hippies uuugh</li>
            <li> My son says it&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t make his beard as manageable as he would like.  It melted and he has to keep it in the fridge, but that&#x27;s the way it goes with warm temps.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal. The smell is manly, without being overpowering, and it leaves your beard with a nice sheen and a soft feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using the product but it was easy to apply and smells great.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic about this product because of the five-star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed after using this product for a month. It has not effect what-so-ever on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot return the product, but all I can do is to tell people about the truth about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Leaves my beard nice and soft all day.  Not heavy or greasy.  Helps control those wiry hairs.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t that bad . I like to use it on my hair instead of gel.  Works pretty good</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but definitely not the best for it&#x27;s price.  Didn&#x27;t like the texture or scent and left my face feeling like I had just rubbed Vaseline all over it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would soften my beard for my girlfriend and when I used this, it worked great. The first hour it seems greasy but after that is leaves a nice aroma and a soft beard.</li>
            <li> Ordered this stuff 3 times now. Leaves your beard feeling soft, healthy, and keeps the friz down. The smell is only apparent for a couple hours after application then goes away, not that it&#x27;s strong or unpleasant in any way.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to eliminate dry skin under your beard and make your beard look a bit thicker. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about the claim that it helps hair growth, but maybe that has something to do with the fact that it is moisturizing your beard...I don&#x27;t know honestly. At first I was disappointed with the small amount you get, but after using it for several months Ive become impressed with how long it has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use it in a fairly short beard with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell isn&#x27;t bad as long as you like &amp;#34;woodsy smells&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;- You really one need to apply a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Works great....will buy again ty</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my beard feel. The smell is fairly strong right after I put it on, but after an hour or so it wares off. I really like the smell anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to put this on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but not a fan of the smell, it reminds me of wet woodchips and dirty clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Professor fuzzworthy is so much better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Not sure about some of the reviews saying that it has an aroma of medicine. I have a very sensitive nose, and I and my wife think this stuff smells wonderful. I don’t have an overly scratchy beard, but with this added to it a few times a week, it is as soft as head hair (not mine because I shave my head) but soft. This doesn’t provide hold, but I loved the product so much that I purchased their original beard wax as well. Great product with natural ingredients. Easy choice when deciding to buy.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. My beard feels thicker, straighter, and I have stopped getting ingrown hairs in that area. As an added bonus, it leaves a nice shine. A feeling of cleanliness. I use it immediately after getting out of the shower or shaving, making sure to spread the excess oil from the beard to the rest of my face. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and leaves my beard feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Feels amazing on the skin and leaves my beard real smooth. Like many people have said before, a little bit (I&#x27;d say about a pea size portion) goes a long way. The smell is pretty faint and goes away after a little while so it won&#x27;t overpower any cologne or other fragrance you might use. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to care for their beard.</li>
            <li> Leaves my wild beard soft and much easier to run a comb through. Love the smell. Only need to use a small amount.I scrape out about a pea sized amount with my nail, so a can will last a good while. On my third can now and will keep using as long as I keep the beard.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far with this product.  I have never used a dedicated beard conditioner until now.  The normal hair conditioners just simply don&#x27;t cut.  It leaves my beard very soft and shiney after application, and the smell is pleasant and not overbearing.  I have also noticed that i no longer have dried skin on my chin and the persistent itches has ceased.  I was concerned with the size of the tin, but like most have said, a little really does go a long way.  I am sure i can make it last at least 3 months.  It has also helped me grow a fuller looking beard!</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband, he loves it. Makes his beard much more manageable and softer. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I like the way it helps soften the beard a bit but the smell is a bit overpowering. Be careful how much of it you use.</li>
            <li> For black men questioning whether this product will work for them, the answer is yes! My beard was soft and manageable after the first application and still is soft. The smell is wonderful and not overwhelming. The oils seemed to have softened my hands as well. I also find it helpful to use on my head hair as well. This product feels great and could probably be used for dry areas of skin for the rest of your body. I never knew my beard could look so majestic! Honest Amish Beard Balm is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easily absorbed into the beard and skin for instant conditioning. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> smells great. a little mint, a little something else. i will buy again</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason for 4-star review is that I am new to beard balms and this is the very first one I have used; I dont think I&#x27;m qualified to rate 5-star. That being said I am completely satisfied with my purchase. My beard is exceptionally unruly and this products softens and helps to manage it!</li>
            <li> This is a good beard conditioner. It is soft and semi gritty feeling at first, make sure you rub it till it melts into liquid, which only takes about 10 seconds. Spreads pretty evenly on a semi-damp beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overly scented, has like a stale beeswax kind of smell. Which is good because I have a very sensitive nose. Makes beard a little softer. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. Not sure if it was supposed to come lumpy, but it takes some rubbing in the palms to get it to be a consistent texture.  Also, the scent is a bit strong and not my favorite (not offensive tho).  So one star off each for those.  Otherwise it feels nice once rubbed in and the scent wears down after a couple of hours (or maybe my husband just gets used to it).  Definitely helps with beard and face health (no more itchyness and fewer splits). It also seems like it will last quite a while.  Might try the unscented version next.</li>
            <li> smells good and a little goes a long way, but did not soften or tame the beard. Only made it a little oily.</li>
            <li> This product has change my outlook on growing a beard.  I use to shave it off every week because it became itchy and under my lower lip it would poke into my chin like needles.  Now I have not shaven in two weeks and my beard is getting fuller and lusher.</li>
            <li> Originally got this as a gift for my son and he loved it so much (&amp; his wife!) that I had to buy it again! Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> A noticeable benefit in both &#x27;feel&#x27; and appearance from first use.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. It smells a bit funky at first ... but it&#x27;s great! Super conditioning and goes on well. It&#x27;s an everyday thing for me. Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This product simply works, it&#x27;s easy to use and,  smells great.  My beard and face are much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference after using.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient raves about it. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for the amount you get and doesn&#x27;t last that long after you apply it. I like the packaging though</li>
            <li> It works well. I originally bought it to help with the extreme irritation on the moustache area, but it did not  work all that well for me.</li>
            <li> I dont have a beard (real beard, long bushy) but I go about a week or so between shaves and it gets kinda long. during this phase my face gets SO itchy and feels like crap. i use this once or twice between shaves and it really stops the itching and it gives it a little &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; and makes it not look so dull, if you are growing a beard, this is by far one of the best products to use or if you let your beard get kinda long before shaving it will do the same</li>
            <li> Husband LOVES this stuff and swears by it!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of softening your beard but won&#x27;t help tame it. Made the skin under my beard breakout with acne. The smell isn&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but this small tin does last a very long time because you use a tiny amount.  I had a lot of skin problems under my beard, and while this didn&#x27;t end up fixing them it did help and does a great job keeping your facial hair hydrated.  It gives your hair a slight sheen and has a great masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up shaving my beard :( to fix my skin problems, but I have actually started using this as my &amp;#34;hair gel.&amp;#34;  I work a tiny amount into my wet hair and it adds just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your hands if you run them through your hair later.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Keeps my beard soft!</li>
            <li> Not really crazy about the scent, my fiance absolutely hates when I use this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if I really can tell a difference in the softness of my beard, but does help grooming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brand of Bead oils and conditioners, I must say that I enjoy this one the most because of the great smell and how well my beard feels.</li>
            <li> Works very well for a longer beard.  Mine has grown out enough that beard oil doesn&#x27;t tame it any longer, but this leaves my beard soft and civilized looking.  Scent is very mild and goes away quickly.  Price is on par with other beard balms.  Given how simple and cheap it is to make your own, I will probably be going that route for future beard balm needs.</li>
            <li> Well, if I had understood the actual size of this, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid so much. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s on-par with one of those little breath mint tins you can easily carry in your pocket. I got this as a surprise for my husband, but he hasn&#x27;t noticed any difference when using it. So, without much benefit and a lot of money for a small amount, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the way my beard feels with this stuff. Soft and touchable. Not greasy at all. And the light scent is wonderful! Totally exceeded expectations!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for a while now and love it.  I will switch to a beard oil sometimes as well, but this leave-in conditioner is great for managing my beard.  The scent is actually light, not as strong as some make out to be.  Oddly enough, I will use a dab in my head hair as well to help control the curls.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Really great product! You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts forever. It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s made out of quality natural ingredients and the scent isn&#x27;t terribly strong.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to tame my wild mane into a fine piece of face fur. It has a very light (in my opinion) anise scent that is very pleasant. It corralled all of the fliers into a tidy order and leaves a fine sheen that looks quite good with my darker beard. The aspects I find most appealing about this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Light, pleasing scent&lt;br /&gt;2.) No added weight on my face&lt;br /&gt;3.) USA made&lt;br /&gt;4.) Turns a mangy mutt of a beard into a fine gentleman&#x27;s pride in about 3 seconds&lt;br /&gt;5.) A little goes quite a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I didn&#x27;t like are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Hands are a bit oily after application&lt;br /&gt;2.) Price + shipping is a on the steeper side of what I&#x27;d like to pay for this and if I could find it locally, I would be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, worth the price of admission, especially if you are looking to upgrade from &amp;#34;possibly homeless&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;unquestionably magnificent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin under my beard free from drying out after a shower. I highly recommend this product to any man (or woman) with a beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for years and never did anything special for it other than pert plus shampoo. I realized that I had to take care of my Garibaldi beard to keep it healthy so I decided to try this out over other products due to the amount of positive feedback. Here&#x27;s what I found after using for a month....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds shine to your beard which is nice and a little bit is all you need. After a month I&#x27;m only half way thru the tin. If you use too much you might feel greasy or waxy especially in the Mustache. However there is not much hold as it is a conditioner not a styling gel. I do feel like it does a fair job conditioning. One thing I really don&#x27;t like is if you eat food crumbs and salt easily stick to the beard even several hours after applying. You have to comb or remove the good particles after you eat which in turn makes your fingers oily or greasy. The smell is pleasant and not too strong and organic in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first product for my beard I&#x27;ve tried so I don&#x27;t know the best way to apply. Would be nice to have a how to video to get the most out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like the product and I do notice the difference days I don&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m just not sold on it yet. I want to try other beard products before I find what is right for me. Perhaps the extra strength honest Amish balm or a leave in conditioner you only have to use once or twice weekly.  After trying more products this maybe the product for me I just don&#x27;t know yet til I try more but I will say its a high quality product worth trying out backed up by a reputable company.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I never had a beard until I started using this product.  4 weeks in and I now have a noticeable chin strap!  Thanks Honest Abe (and it spells good too).</li>
            <li> My husband loves his beard balm! It smells good too!</li>
            <li> The short version:  Amish Beard Balm will make your beard more manageable, smell awesome (but not pungent or strong), and make it look much more well-groomed and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing I dislike, or, not really dislike, but take in stride, is that due to the nature of it being a &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;, if the ambient temperature or your fingers are cold it takes a few seconds to liquify.  While you&#x27;re waiting on it to melt (about 30 seconds), it feels &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;, but its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall effect this has on a beard is amazing.  It&#x27;s not dramatic...in fact, its, subtle, but that&#x27;s part of the beauty of it.  The subtle &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, the subtle softness, the subtle glean or shininess, the subtle smell, it all adds up to a much improved presentation.  I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all; in fact, if its too greasy I would suspect a person is using way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a staple in my grooming regimen for sure.  I echo the general consensus here: This stuff is great.  To be fair, there are other great beard balms, oils, etc, worth checking out, but this one is a home run.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this beard balm. It took forever for it to solidify in my hand and there always seemed to be chunks of it left behind. I made sure to rub it out into the palm of my hand and then applied to my beard. My beard did feel softer but because of the left over white clumps I did not continue using the product. I switched to a beard oil that was much easier and had the same effect on the softness of my beard.</li>
            <li> Best thing I can say, it does as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love my Beard Balm. It is a great product that I would recommend to all of my male friends. This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft and smooth. No more wild hairs. Any man that is serious about his beard needs to use a product and I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This product works great with a nice natural smell. It does leave a bit of a shine for awhile, just so you know.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my beard smoother and more manageable. What I disliked was that my beardruff actually got worse while using this product. I have no clue how that is possible considering the oils and everything it contains.(maybe I have a skin allergy to something in it) I stopped using it and the beardruff went away, and then it came back after I started using the product again. The scent was not to strong and it didn&#x27;t stick around all day. It did smell if anise so if that is something you don&#x27;t like than this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> What a great balm! My beard is pretty curly and this helps flatten it out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it does what it says. I love this item and so far it has lasted 2 months and I&#x27;m only 1/4 of the way through it. I apply it everyday. Granted, I have a business beard, so if yours is longer expect to use more than me. The smell is pleasant and I have received many complements from my girlfriend, which is always a good thing. Get the beard balm, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard incredibly soft and easy to manage. Less hair breakage and a nice Suttle shine. Great product, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> four stars for now, as i just received it but so far my beard is happy. my skin feels moisturized and i haven&#x27;t been itchy at all since i started putting it on. smells good, feels good.</li>
            <li> My beard is so soft, I feel like i have a kitten wrapped in satin wrapped around my face!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and how it softens my beard and controls the flakes.</li>
            <li> Works well but has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard feeling extremely soft, more so then any oil I have used. I would recommend applying after the shower after you comb the excess water out of your beard, but while it is still quite damp. Will leaving your beard looking shiny and healthy, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many great products on my awesome beard and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Great smell and makes my beard feel like silk. Love this stuff and will be back for more when I run out.</li>
            <li> If my husband must have a full beard, at least he uses Honest Amish Balm &#x3D;) he wears it daily. He says it smooths and tames it which is cool...his whiskers aren&#x27;t as gristly as they used to be. I think it smells great too. Not that I&#x27;m smelling his beard all the time ;)</li>
            <li> Best product Ive ever bought! Its hard for us Northern Nigerians to grow beards already, but this product makes it look easy! Havent skipped a day without using it since day 1. A must buy for anyone growing a beard. I&#x27;ll be ordering MORE soon!</li>
            <li> This delivers as advertised - light but effective at helping to control your beard without looking slicked down  - manly smell, softens beard and really helps reduce itching. I also bought Bay Lime Conditioning Oil. Honest Amish is a good product as well, but didn&#x27;t perform quite as well as Bay Lime Conditioning Oil. One issue is the Honest Amish is a butter, so you have to guess how much to use and rub it till it liquifies. I prefer the Bay Lime Conditioning Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the intended consistency is correct, but this balm was grainy. I have to rub it in my palm for some time to break down the &amp;#34;grains&amp;#34;, and if I miss one or two, they end up getting stuck in my beard. It does smell interesting - nothing strong that would be noticed by others, but a slight anise scent is in the balm. It works great (once I get past the graininess).</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought me this stuff for Christmas and it&#x27;s fantastic. It makes my beard look fuller and healthier. It also makes it feel softer and it smells great. I think this might be my favorite beard product.</li>
            <li> Beard still feels like steel wool,  won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, more importantly my wife does too. I was getting split ends in my beard and it was feeling a little rough. Since I&#x27;ve started using the balm the split ends are gone and my beard is so much softer. The only thing I need to watch out for is making sure I rub all the balm in my hands to liquefy it to ensure I don&#x27;t get little chunks of balm in my beard. I also sometimes get some on my lips and it&#x27;s great as chapstick in the cold.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this daily on his beard. He loves it. This is the 3rd container we&#x27;ve purchased. Only tip warm in your hard 1st or the beads wont breaks down.</li>
            <li> Awesome beard balm! Gave it as a Valentines Day gift and he used it immediately! Smells good too! Like a healthy an earthy smell almost! Give this balm a go ;)</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this. I works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 30 years, and have struggled on and off to find a good leave-in conditioner that does what I want: help keep my beard healthy, doesn&#x27;t add unnecessary complications like styling wax or strong perfume, and helps stop skin flakiness. This does all that - my beard feels soft, if you use the right amount (a very SMALL amount - trial and error helps to find what that amount is for you) it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, there&#x27;s a very subtle scent that I no longer notice (and no-one has ever mentioned to me), and I stopped having flakiness on the second day of use. This is excellent. I will continue to use this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This left my beard shiny and wet. I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> First, the scent. What about the scent?  There is much to-do about the scent in the reviews and you may be afraid that the scent is &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; or that you&#x27;ll smell like licorice all the time.  Don&#x27;t be concerned.  I have no idea what these people are on about.  There is a hint of anise (black licorice) but I think the scent is a mix of spice notes and woodsy scents with maybe a tiny bit of anise. I think, personally, the top note is clove. Is it a strong scent?  No, absolutely not.  One single spritz of cologne is way stronger than this stuff.  Will you smell it?  Yes, faintly, and for a little bit until you either adjust or the scent fades away--it&#x27;s hard to measure what is actually happening under one&#x27;s nose.  Having used it for a few days, my wife did not even notice the scent of it on me.  In fact, for the sake of science, I put a lot on one morning, waited a few minutes, and had my wife give me a sniff from about 5 inches away.  She said that she couldn&#x27;t really smell anything at all.  In any event, I think it smells quite good. (NOTE: If you cringe at the thought of wearing even the weakest scent, as some men do, Honest Amish makes an unscented version of this balm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Yes.  My beard is softer and it looks nicer too.  I&#x27;d recommend the product to anyone who uses a stronger soap for face cleaning as a strong soap turns your beard hair into steel wool.  This, along with some good conditioner, helps put things back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with the dreaded beard itch? Yes, and boy was I glad that it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with the dreaded beardruff?  Yes, my skin is regularly flaky with beards and this took care of that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it greasy?  Well, at first it is a little moist.  After you put it on, it does seem to soak up very well such that you don&#x27;t have any meaningful residue on your beard.  If you use a lot, it&#x27;ll be a bit greasy, but if you&#x27;ve used a beard oil before you should know what you&#x27;re in for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with holding or shaping?  Basically, no.  It does contain wax, but this stuff is for conditioning.  If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more unruly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a little go a long way?  Yes, so don&#x27;t be put off by what seems to be a small tin.  You&#x27;re supposed to apply this to a damp beard and the dampness helps the small amount of the product go even further.  There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; amount to use here, naturally.  You can tailor it to your liking or your need for conditioning.  I tend to use a good-sized portion, particularly as my beard gets longer and before I transition over to the Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  Still, I&#x27;m not burning through tins.  I&#x27;ve had the same tin for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it.  Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;For The Ladies&amp;#34; Edit, 11/29/15:  My wife, for whatever reason, started using this on the ends of her hair.  She&#x27;s been doing it for months now and swears by it.  So, I asked her why she likes it so much.  She said that it keeps her ends moisturized and it has helped to eliminate split ends.  She said she also thinks it would have useful application in controlling fly-aways while braiding.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I have very little idea what that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with holding or shaping?  Basically, no.  It does contain wax, but this stuff is for conditioning.  If you want a bit more hold, buy the heavy duty balm (and see my review on that.)  I used this stuff in the early stages of my beard and switched to the heavy duty balm when my beard got longer and more unruly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a little go a long way?

            <li> Awesome product, awesome packaging. I love that it comes in the burlap bag, adds a touch of rugged manliness to it. ;)&lt;br /&gt;I got this balm for my boyfriend just for something new and fun to try. It smells really good and seemed to work right away; after the first use his beard was softer! Some reviews noted that the smell faded over time, and I think it does, but not entirely. However, I really like the smell and see this as a positive thing. I would describe it as spicy and the main note I smell is Cloves. (one of my favs, so gotta love that.) Packaging is perfect for a high-quality, cute little gift. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I used the whole container and didn&#x27;t notice an appreciable difference with my very dry, very prickly beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this beard balm quite extensively. I purchased the tin about four beards ago...I&#x27;ve been growing my beard for about two months, then hitting the rest button just to keep things fresh. I still have about a 1/5 of a tin left, so I think that it performs well from a value standpoint. If you are burning through this tin faster than that, you either have a beard that is old growth forest, or you are using way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I use it in the morning after taking a shower. I take a portion of about a dime (much less when my beard is a young and full of dreams), rub it between my hands for about 3-5 seconds to warm/disperse it, then lightly spread it through my beard like I am doing some heavy pondering. It gives my beard a pleasant sheen, helps calm my unruly whiskers, and adds a pleasant smell that I&#x27;ve had described as &amp;#34;Man. Your face smells like man.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, one way to tell if you are using too much, brush your hand through your beard prior to bed (mutually pleasing). If your hand is covered in beard balm, you are probably using too much. For me, I find that it mostly dissipates by mid-afternoon.</li>
            <li> I bought the Honest Amish Beard Balm for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. The smell is not as strong as other reviews have claimed. It is musty but we didn&#x27;t find it overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t clump up or leave the hair greasy. 10/10 will be buying again along with other products by Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> The product does what its entended too but the smell is not very pleseant. It has a very sour smell to it, and it isnt smocky or nature smelling like I was thinking it would.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it.. it tends to make his beard smell a little bit like straw though...? I don&#x27;t know why. It isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overpowering at all.. just a slight scent.. His beard is still a little bit coarse after using it, but better than it was before.</li>
            <li> It is terrible. I would not recommend this. It is extremely hard to apply and rub in and unless you do extremely vigorously then you will be left with blobs all over your face.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s an excellent product with a pleasing scent.  Not overly strong and fades relatively quickly (maybe 2 hours) though I don&#x27;t mind that.  I find that rubbing my fingers in a circular motion within the tin to melt the balm and then applying with my fingertips after a hot shower works the best.  It does not serve to tame the stray hairs but does soften the beard.  With bi-daily use (alternating with mountaineer oil), I find that my beard is becoming more and more soft as time goes on.  It was not night and day as I was hoping but it does help to soften it...Then again my beard is much more coarse than many people.  Lost one star since it doesn&#x27;t soften the way I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell and it is a bit greasier that my other preferred brand.</li>
            <li> Neutral scent has a good feel and offers a little control. Use wax after for more control.</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I first received the Beard Balm container, I was a little disappointed. It appears larger in the photos than it actually is, which made me think it was a little expensive for what I got. However, with this product, a little goes a long way! My first container lasted me about a year - and that&#x27;s with daily use! It works great and keeps my beard soft as advertised. And, as an added bonus, my wife loves the smell! I just ordered my second container. I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer!</li>
            <li> this smooths my face and my hands. it made my facial hair super soft. yes soft. soft facial hair allows longer growth which causes more full beards</li>
            <li> This product may not even deserve two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - technically, it works. my beard stayed moisturized while wearing this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - smells terrible. Not terrible, but definitely not something you want in your nostrils all day&lt;br /&gt;  - terrible texture. Like a just-crystallized honey, you have to rub the crystals in thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;  - greasy. just leaves your beard shiny and oily. which, again, technically works. just not in a pleasing way at all</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great, it reminds me of something my grandpappy would have worn. it feels great in my beard and makes my beard hair soft. i&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift, person who received it probably likes it.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. You only need the smallest amount and your beard will shine!</li>
            <li> Top of the line product.  I have an unruly long, thick beard.  If you want it soft and to stay healthy you will order this product!  A little bit goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the small container.  This product leaves your beard soft and conditions it all day.  It has a wonderful scent when you first put it on, and it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Protects my beard from the nasty weather.  Forms well. And glistens!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend. He and his brother love it. Neither were sold on using anything &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; and were pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Everyone can notice your beard will be very shiny. if you touch the beard within 2 hours of putting it in, expect to have some greasy hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a long beard, still this product softened it and feels very good.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell right after application that dissipate in a few minutes... no worries for that.&lt;br /&gt;The can looks small, but you really need very little product... so it will last.</li>
            <li> What started as a &amp;#34;No-Shave November&amp;#34; has turned into a lifestyle. My new beard is always getting compliments from both sexes. It looks and feels healthy thanks to Honest Amish Beard.</li>
            <li> Good stuff that kills the beard-druff!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend this past Christmas. He has a pretty good sized beard (maybe 5 inches at the longest point), and using it every other day, he still has more than half left. He is very sensitive to constant smells like deoderant or perfume, so I was nervous to order something like this. He says the smell is pleasantly mild. The consistancy of the material really looks like the conditioner is made from all organic products, like advertised. As far as promoting new growth, we&#x27;re not convinced. But the best thing about this conditioner is it really tames his long beard hairs and makes it look shaped and professional, without an oily or glossy look.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my boyfriend&#x27;s horrible scraggly beard, which it worked wonders for! He&#x27;s now shiny and soft! My friend came over and clearly had trouble restraining herself from stroking him.&lt;br /&gt;I also steal it every other morning to use as lotion. It&#x27;s just so nice!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great.  I like to apply it before bed at night and wake up with an extra soft beard.  Only this I wish was that it can in a bigger container for the price.  People with large beards need more product.</li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is great. The strong note is anise--black licorice. It&#x27;s subtle but great. It reminds me of spiced wine and holiday cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the balm is perfect for use as a leave-in conditioner. It&#x27;s not greasy or waxy at all, it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave buildup, and it doesn&#x27;t give an unnatural texture--it just leaves your beard strong, soft, thick, and controlled. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It comes in a great little burlap bag. Cool!</li>
            <li> It is a decent beard balm, the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish leaves your beard silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Amazing scent, and texture!  I felt like I had just purchased the best product at NPH&#x27;s Moustachery in &amp;#34;A Million Ways To Die In The West.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Honest Amish will always be part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> It gives my beard a great look and feel... it does smell like licorice. Make sure she likes licorice before you use it. The smell can stay around for a while. I think its fantastic... I don&#x27;t think every one agrees.</li>
            <li> This has a strong odor that lingers unlike what other reviewers have said.  It&#x27;s a strong black licorice smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.  If you don&#x27;t mind that, you might want to give this a try.  I can&#x27;t deal with strong smell, so I&#x27;ve had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this balm for the first time a few weeks ago, and I like it a lot more than any other option I&#x27;ve tried.  It keeps my beard soft all day without being oily.  The anise/licorice smell is nice but not too strong, and it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other balms but this one just works better. My beard feels and looks better most all day after applying this in the morning right after a shower. It also helps a lot to keep any itching down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, herb-y fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good.  That&#x27;s important when it&#x27;s sitting under my nose all day.  It does however keep the beard dandruff away.</li>
            <li> This has helped tame the mess that is my boyfriend&#x27;s goatee.  It smells pleasant, like nuts and herbs, and my guinea pig likes to try and eat his beard now, which is an extra added amusement bonus.  We&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> Totally makes beard and skinn smooth as silk. I put on at night and it soaks in by the am. Put just a little on when I get up (a little bit goes a very long way) and comb in. The smell is a little different but not powerful. If course I was not expecting strong smell seeing how this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, really like how it makes the beard feel (has a slight hint of black licorice scent to it, which I typically don&#x27;t enjoy, but for this concoction it has grown on me)</li>
            <li> Beard is super soft and it isn&#x27;t greazy as the Chuck Woolery would say.  The smell is different.  It is an earthy nutty odor.  This is my go to beard balm.</li>
            <li> I am a man&#x27;s man; ladies swoon when they see me and men want to be me.  I defend freedom in remote parts of the world and defend it with only two things: a knife and my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might ask yourself, &amp;#34;Self, how did he become so manly, whilst defending freedom with only a knife and his beard?&amp;#34;  Well, the answer is a direct result of using Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-In Conditioner.  By applying just a tiny amount every day, soon your beard will be smoother, silkier, and shiny-er.  It&#x27;s like having a fluffy little cloud on your face - THAT KILLS those who oppose freedom and manliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this; become a man.</li>
            <li> People actually seem to notice my beard when I am putting this jaegermeister smelling stuff onto it. The feedback is that it appears softer and thicker. Does help with itching, makes beard feel softer.</li>
            <li> I work on mine sites, without this stuff my beard would feel like rusty pubes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. A little goes a long way. Rubbing it melts it and then just massage into your beard. Smells great and is a great conditioner. Thank you for making this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Every time I shampoo my beard I use some of this to re-oil my beard.  It does a great job keeping my beard soft and smooth.  I use it roughly 3 times a week and it&#x27;s one of my must have items while growing/maintaining a beard.  The smell is pleasant, and it leaves a nice sheen to my beard for quite a while after applied.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has really helped my beard looking and feeling great</li>
            <li> This product was my first crack at a beard conditioner/oil and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. It took the wiry, scraggly mess on my face and smoothed it into a presentable and shapely beard. It has a rather pleasant smell, which isn&#x27;t overbearing and doesn&#x27;t linger for very long in any case. It is also worth noting that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Honist Amish leave in conditioner Helps soften my beard and leaves it more in control.</li>
            <li> My first beard balm - I love it! My beard is very smooth and soft. dandruff is gone. I actually really like the smell - it doesnt last all day but I kind of wish it did! side note - I am not a fan of licorice, but the scent is strangely addictive.</li>
            <li> First time using beard balm. It was a new concept to me, but the effects were noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the first few minutes my beard simply looked thicker and more moisturized. It didnt itch and had a very slight glow. After the first few hours of the first application of Beard Balm I noticed that my voice had gotten deeper and much more masculine. People would ask me for approval to do the simplest of things. &amp;#34;Should I submit this report for approval to you? Or to our boss?&amp;#34; Even my boss has started coming to me for questions. I got a pay raise that same week. The next thing I noticed was around day two or three of consistent use of the Beard Balm when I was helping my friend move out of his apartment. Lifting heavy items was no longer as strenuous as it once had been. We were lifting his recliner and I actually ripped my shirt, which previously fit perfectly, while flexing during the move. After visiting the gym, which I should mention was my first time, we concluded that my muscles had gained about 20% more strength. Since I don&#x27;t work out and the only difference in my life is the use of this Beard Balm we can only assume that it is the cause. They had made me the Honorary Gym Leader later that night. After about a week of use I realized women seem to be following me around more. I will be walking downtown and have three to four girls behind me at all times. When I turn to look at them they faint almost immediately. This can add a few hours to a simple beer run, so I would suggest adding an hour to almost every task that involves going into the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would rate this item as a 5/5 because my beard appearance has improved and it makes the skin underneath feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> The first order was a great product.  The second was seperated in the tin.  It was very oily.  I&#x27;ve ordered a third hoping the next one will be like the first not the second.  If it is like the first i would happily change the star rating because the first was excellent</li>
            <li> It works great and smells good too. Definitely going to be buying more</li>
            <li> I wish I could have tried it before my dog ate it.  She really seemed to have enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It helps prevent itch from new growth and it helps keep my beard healthy and looking nice.</li>
            <li> I put this in my beard probably every 3 days and it becomes so soft and smooth its awesome. I&#x27;m picky about how my beard is groomed and I carry a brush with me at all times to make sure it is. This stuff allows me to relax because I know its smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have a goatee and it work nicely to tame stray hairs and keep my hair and skin moisturized. Plus it makes it look healthier.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He uses it everyday and loves it.</li>
            <li> this arrived on feb 28,2015. plus this is a gift for my hairdresser, he does a wonderful job . plus he was in the the Vietnam War. so ill let you how it does</li>
            <li> The moment I put this on after my shower my beard start feeling lot softer. The scent it has is very pleasing and very easy to rub in to my beard.  I am very happy on my purchase</li>
            <li> I hate the scent (Liquorice) and it leaves my beard super greasy.</li>
            <li> It certainly depends on the type of beard you have. I was applying about half a dime to a dime and it would make my beard a little to shiny. Some people prefer that look and on some beards I&#x27;m sure that it wouldn&#x27;t be so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the smell is not bad, my main complaint is the price, I understand why its expensive, due to all of the great ingredients. However I have alternatives that I prefer to use that are also natural, organic and quite cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will continue to use this product and I won&#x27;t be surprised if my beard becomes much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish!</li>
            <li> Third order. My beard loves it. You will notice the beard improvement on the first application. Wish I had found Honest Amish years ago.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 3-4 months.  Wish I&#x27;d had it years ago.  A little bit goes a long way.  My beard never looked so good, &amp; seems to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I rub in a little bit of it every night after showering &amp; shampooing hair &amp; beard, while beard is still damp or wet.</li>
            <li> My husband is so pleased with this beard balm and I can also tell the improvement in his handsome beard.  The fragrance is very light but when I was close to him I thought he had eaten something yummy so to us it is a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner daily. It helps soooo much with your skin feeling dry under your beard. It removes 100% of the itch associated with growing out a beard, and smells amazing. I was worried that it would make my skin break out and get too oily but it does the opposite. I loved this product so much I ordered the wax by Honest Amish for the days when I need to look presentable. If it is anything like the conditioner, I will fall in love with it too.</li>
            <li> Only 4 because I just started using it. Smells great though. Update coming soon</li>
            <li> So far so good!  It alleviates beard-itch as I&#x27;m trying to grow my beard out a bit.</li>
            <li> It showed up several days late.  Also once you rub it into your Palm it&#x27;s just a becomes oil not a balm.  I think I would like it better with short beard, but if your longer than a couple inches you need something heavier.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but in my opinion would be better if less expense was applied to the packaging and more to the product.  This is almost a trial size and will only last a short time when used on a long beard.  That said, it works well and I would buy again if available in an &amp;#34;economy&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> The best beard conditioner on the market. Hands down. Keep in mind that this is a conditioner and not beard wax. It treats the beard and the skin beneath it and leaves your beard softer to the touch and your skin beneath it much healthier. Can be used for daily purposes (I wash my beard daily even though it isn&#x27;t recommended) because I live in a humid, hot area and I sweat a lot. In the winter, it helps condition as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For date nights, I use beard oil but this product works just as well. The only reason I use beard oil is for the scent but this is my everyday/go-to choice. I can&#x27;t recommend it more strongly or fervently.</li>
            <li> I use beard oils and honest amish beard balm. My grave before shave beard oil smells great, they also bring back the original color of my hair better than honest amish does. I can&#x27;t say honest amish doesn&#x27;t work great because it does. I really wish they could offer a few other products that have some kind of send added to them. Understand this does not seem to condition the hair as well as any of the oils that I&#x27;ve tried from wood man or grave before shave. However this product does work great, and it&#x27;s hassle free, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Works about 80% as well as I expected. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell though.</li>
            <li> The beard balm is working great so far. The product makes my beard feel a lot smoother and softer. It helps control dry skin and smells good. It goes on rather easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love it and my beard loves it too!!! It has the best smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> ive never tried any products for my beard before, but hafve been getting annoyed at how unruly my beard has been getting. i norwegian, and have some scottish in me, so my beard is thick, wirey, and curly. and this stuff tamed it in the very first application. i think that the smell is light and quite pleasant. I will be buying a large supply of this stuff, it makes my beard look amazing, gives it a bit of a sheen, and tames my unruly hair. My beard stays a bit curly, and still keeps its natural look, but it just tames and softens it a ton.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, a dime sized amount every other day, for this product to work. It gives my beard a good shine and not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li> This product honestly works the way it says. Put in after a shower and after a few days to a week your beard gets soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the smell but that was unfounded. It is not heavy at all and dissipates after about 20-30 minutes. It also smells very mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No greasy residue or oily beard with this. Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish conditions my beard nicely and gives me a little more control over what it does. My beard naturally grows in 1,000 different directions. Honest Amish helps me tame the beast a bit. I don’t have so many of those wild beard days.</li>
            <li> It makes your beard soft and also has a nice sheen to it, I love the way it feels after being applied. I&#x27;m glad I choose this brand and will recommend to others</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that works wonders on my beard.&lt;br /&gt; It softens and maintains control far better than I expected .&lt;br /&gt; Honest Amish is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Have had a beard for years but never let it grow out.  When I finally tried I realized just how rough/wiry/dry/etc it was.  Enter Honest Amish Beard Balm.  Took a few weeks of daily use but now my bread is smooth,  moisturized,  delightful to smell and behold.  After the shower I take a small dollop,  warm it up in my hands and massage into my beard.  Brush it into shape with a boar bristle brush and voila!  Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone complaining about it leaving your face/hands/beard greasy: you&#x27;re using too much.  If you do put on too much,  take a damp towel and wipe over your beard to remove some of the excess then brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own opinion as to the smell.  My two cents: lemon grass and clove are the two main aromas.  Not so much licorice.  I love licorice and this ain&#x27;t it.  People apparently don&#x27;t actually know what licorice smells like.</li>
            <li> I have had a short goatee for a while now, and every time I tried to go for anything longer I wound up trimming it back down to fight those wild hairs that would shoot straight out. I was looking for options to tame my unruly face mane when I stumbled across Honest Amish&#x27;s amazing line of products. These guys have it down! Within only one use, my beard was noticeably softer and looked thicker. I honestly don&#x27;t know how a beard balm can make such an amazing difference so quickly, but the results are right on my face for everyone to see. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve been inspired to experiment with some longer styles now, and my beard just keeps getting softer and softer. Beards are a whole different ball game when you have a downy blanket on your face, and your lady friend will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the crazy people who have complained about not including an applicator in the reviews, they clearly must not have hands. The directions that come on the bag very clearly advise that you warm the product up in the palm of your hand until it melts, and then work it in to your beard with your fingers and a comb. No applicator needed, and it makes your hands soft too (another added bonus that your lady friend is sure to notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this product, and even though the tin is small, you really don&#x27;t need to use much. I only use enough to fit on one fingertip, and it successfully covers my whole goatee once it melts. If a few hairs decide to pop back out later in the day, or if I just want to bask in the softness and nice aroma, I sometimes pull out the comb and brush it a few times. The honest Amish residue on the comb serves as a nice touch up without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a beard, buy this product. If you don&#x27;t have a beard, grow one and buy this product. If you&#x27;re a lady, date a man with a beard, and then do them the favor of buying this product. Your face fur will never be the same.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, smells good too...I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
            <li> Smells slightly of licorice which I thought was a bad thing at first. The smell grew on me though. The can was smaller than I thought the amount inside is plenty for moderate use. Made my beard softer and gave a slight glow. Some of areas on my face have small patches of no growth. Used to grow there but stopped for an unknown reason. After about a month of using Honest Amish I started seeing new growth in those areas. May not be related to the balm but I won&#x27;t stop using it now. Works great with a beard oil in addition to it.</li>
            <li> Te product definetly leaves a healthy shine when applied. I had to adjust the appropiate amount to use as to much leads to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It just simply feels good on my beard.  The smell is fine.  The consistency is nice.  You need to take a little out and work it into your hands then spread it throughout your beard.  All good on that front.  That said, it did leave a slight oil in my beard.  Mainly, I think this was because I was using too much at first but, it was difficult to get out of my dress shirts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, and after using it for several weeks, am very pleased with it. It works as advertised, and I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> this is some good beard juice. Now stop emailing me.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my life.</li>
            <li> OK Honest Amish... I got a beef with you guys. Why isn&#x27;t there a larger size??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love everything about it, works great for me. Agree with pretty much every positive thing that&#x27;s been written. I was first introduced to this product by somebody who thought they were giving me a \\&quot;gag gift\\&quot; - I&#x27;d long had a beard and never used any sort of product to maintain it. I gave it a shot and liked the results. After continued use the longer term results kept piling up. Now I&#x27;m hooked. (So anybody who didn&#x27;t fall in love with the stuff immediately - try it more than once. It takes some time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am playing around a little so don&#x27;t be mislead by the beginning of my review - you will get a lot of use out of this little tin, a tiny bit goes a long way. But I do like to use it regularly (not necessarily every day, but at least every other day), and I&#x27;ve got a lot of beard real estate to cover here - so I do really wish I could buy a bigger container of it than have to purchase a bunch of these 2oz tins every time I re-order!</li>
            <li> I started using this when my beard was about 6 months old.  It definitely makes it feel softer and it&#x27;s more manageable to comb through.  It does tend to separate into what looks little tiny balls of wax, but rub in together in your hands and it melts and is easy to apply.  I usually use about a pea size blob each application.  Use too much and it can make your beard feel oily.</li>
            <li> Recently I had decided to grow my beard out, but it has a tendency to get itchy and unruly.  I&#x27;ve read about beard oils and other products but this one was regarded as the best so I gave it a shot.  I&#x27;m very happy, and Honest Amish has a customer for life.  The balm is very simple to use and helps tame those wild stray hairs that want to grow outward instead of with the rest of the beard growth.  The itchiness is gone.  My beard feels softer, healthier, and there&#x27;s no more &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> good over all product, works really well and I can really see a difference. thanks a lot for making such a good product.</li>
            <li> This balm makes my husband&#x27;s beard shine and feel super soft. Smell is not overpowering and smells somewhat &amp;#34;woodsy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;His beard glistens when he uses this!</li>
            <li> I find that the hold is not that great and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Hold hairs in place this does not. It smells very good, but I did not notice my beard getting any softer. To keep things in place I ended up going with a beard wax.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard look awesome! Love the smell and will continue to buy this product for as long as I have a beard</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A little weird at first but if you READ the directions it works great!&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second can.</li>
            <li> tried a lot of different products to soften my beard this one really works it last long gets rid of the crunchy crispy feeling. Gave it 4 stars because of the price you get a can the size of a flat golf ball for $20 lower the price and you got 10 stars from me Amish guy.</li>
            <li> Even smells better than the one we bought from this company a year ago. It lasted forever - my husband used it almost daily for about a year before we had to buy a new one. It keeps his beard soft and his skin underneath the beard healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> I just received this and used a tiny bit to try out on my 3 inch beard. I used a tic tac sized portion even though it says to use a pea sized one. Man, this thing is greasier than a plate of bacon after a minute in a microwave! You&#x27;re better off wiping vaseline on your beard and face. After a day of wearing the stuff, the skin near the edges of my beard started to break out in zits! I&#x27;m a 36 year old man. I don&#x27;t need zits at my age! The smell isn&#x27;t so bad and the tin I got was bigger than the one in the pictures.</li>
            <li> First time purchase. Received the product and it has a noticeable dent in the container. Thought nothing of it until i opened it. It looks more liquefied other than a sort of solid texture that it should be from the various videos i watched of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps beard nice and healthy highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have 12 weeks of beard growth.  As I am growing it out, it has become very coarse and wiry.  After reading all the positive reviews I thought I had found the cure with this balm.  The simple truth is that this has done nothing to soften nor tame my beard hairs - it does not seem to penetrate at all.  The beard still is coarse, wirey and seems dried out, even after applying liberal amounts of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it smells nice and is not overpowering, so I don&#x27;t understand the other negative reviews on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of days now and I love it! I highly recommend this product to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> Leaves my husband beard super soft and shiny! The smell is nice and very mild too. My husband says he can tell a huge difference since using it.</li>
            <li> My not-my-baby daddy LOVED it! Just don&#x27;t get too excited and use too much. A little goes a long way. Balm made his nasty scratchy misshapen ashy graying biker wannabe beard absolutely delicious looking. Nice and soft.  Also, try not to leave it in your truck/car/pocket.  Split up container into a few smaller containers so if one melts out, you have backup. Ordering him more, NOW.</li>
            <li> good stuff!  a very very mild manly sent.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard you need this. It feel great y helps make you&#x27;re beard look better. Only thing is gotta get to accustomed to the smell. It&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> The first stuff I found that manages the wild hairs.  Not wild about the smell, but getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Great beard balm--great feel and smell. Definitely leaves your beard softer and moisturized, especially if you are in desert climate where everything drys out.</li>
            <li> This balm is outstanding. It&#x27;s keeps my beard healthy, smells amazing, and is great for keeping a few stubborn beard hairs down. A little goes a LONG way. This little tin is going to last forever. As a balm, this is a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides, which have nothing to do with the manufacturer (it&#x27;s just what you get when you use a balm rather than oil), is that it melts very very easily. Keeping it at room temperature will allow it to harden in a few hours, or you can put it in the fridge for a few minutes, so melting is not a big deal if you&#x27;re at home. I can&#x27;t take it anywhere though. I want to use it after showering at the gym, but after my bag has been in my car all day, the balm would be completely liquid. For that reason, I use this beard balm at home, and travel with &#x27;The Woods Man beard oil&#x27; http://www.amazon.com/The-Woods-Man-Beard-Oil/dp/B00K54IP7G/ref&#x3D;pd_bia_nav_t_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0W4Z7PCDHP02G6MF6JAW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For home use, I do recommend this beard balm.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, my wife has noticed a difference! Its softer and wild hairs stay in their place more (even more so with the wax), and it smells good too. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is my first shot at having a beard and after 4 months without shaving I had enough of the itching and bear dander.  This product fixed all of that. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have a nappy beard. This product makes it soft and manageable. Works much better than a wax type product. Scent is OK - not over powering, and fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orders from this place process very quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like old cheese.  Does not smell good at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Makes your beard soft and manageable. As for some people on here saying the smell is to strong, I don&#x27;t think it smells bad it all, has a smell that you would kind of expect from a product like this. Also after a couple days using it, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore, plus the fact that my beard feels and looks 100% better! I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves ur beard feeling silky smooth. Smells like cedar. I would definitely buy it again. Too bad i had to shave :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Works great. Pleasant smell. Cleared my dry skin right up.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! It&#x27;s easy to use! I wish I got a little more for the money, and it doesn&#x27;t handle stray hairs as well as I thought, but that might just be my unruly beard. Overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good . You have to wash your beard every day if you have the balm in. If not beard becomes crunchy and smells very weird. Almost like throwup. Overall I liked the product and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Do you have a beard? Trust the Amish and get this stuff. The Amish know their beards. This is a little difficult to apply, but I wet it down and make a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; in my hand, then apply.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard product that I have bought and so my review isn&#x27;t a comparison but just on my experience. First of all my wife loves the smell and texture of my beard now that I am grooming it with this product. She was really against me having a beard at first but now is enjoying it with me. This beard balm leaves my beard feeling soft but not oily and I can get a brush through it quite easily. I don&#x27;t see any staining on my pillow at night either. I will try other products, not because I&#x27;m unsatisfied but just curious as to what is out there.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best stuff! It makes my beard look fuller, clean, and brings out all my natural colors (I have a rainbow beard). It is easy to apply with no mess. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> This balm took my beard from Hobo to Hero in my first application. My beard is healthier and get lots of compliments now. I highly recommend this to moisturize and maintain beard health.</li>
            <li> Nice for moisturizing beard/skin. Doesn&#x27;t really tame the rogue whiskers though. Yes, I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Better than any oil iv ever used.  It truly is amazing!</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I expected it to.  It smells great, and feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition my beard quite like my wife&#x27;s leave-in hair conditioner.  I have tired it while my beard is wet, just after a shower, I&#x27;ve tried it on a dry beard.... just doesn&#x27;t seem to really sink in.  I expect something like this to be applied once a day, at bed time since I don&#x27;t want to walk around work with a greasy beard.</li>
            <li> I like it, I suppose. I am unsure after using it for 2 weeks that it is worth the price paid, but it smells nice, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is like a mix of pine needles and menthol. I found it pleasant, but i can see room for plenty of people to disagree. it was easy to apply and soaked into the hair pretty quickly, but it did leave the skin of my face oily for a couple hours after application. My biggest issue with this is the price for size. The picture makes it look like you will get a decent amount of this stuff, wrong. The whole can fits entirely inside the palm of my hand with an inch of palm left on all sides. Assuming you shower daily and also apply the beard balm daily and have a big enough beard to need this stuff, one can will last you about 2-3 weeks. Overall it is a good product, i just wish they would either give you a little more, or charge a little less for it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, CK</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard for most of my life, in fact my wife and I were married but five years before she ever saw my face without it. Was able to grow one and did early in high school and have had one ever since, I&#x27;m 58 now. I was never into using hair care products on my face, never gave it much thought. It wasn&#x27;t  until my youngest son started growing his bread, very thick and full, father&#x27;s proud moment, and we started talking about it care did I concider bread products. I did my research and settled on Honest Amish, Very glad I did, smells great, easy to use, not greasy, and does exactly what it says. Helps keep hair growing in the same direction, smooth, and soft. Son tried it too, loves it.</li>
            <li> Just grew a beard for the first time a few months ago and I was looking for a product that would take away the feeling of having a field of wheat growing on my face. The product works as advertised leaving the hair feeling much softer and less unruly. The product smells &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; but certainly not unpleasant. I will buy more when the first canister runs out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Works great. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has a bushy beard when it&#x27;s untreated.  The smell is pleasant and not too strong, his beard is noticeably softer and less wiry and bushy after two weeks of use.  It&#x27;s simple to apply (he rubs it in with his fingers and then brushes his beard after a shower) and he enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> Just started using Honest Amish, my beard feels great. Extremely soft, its too early to tell if it helps growth. However it definitely keeps my beard manageable and not harmful on your skin like other products. The smell is a little strong to me and takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the smell was kind of funky, but it quickly became something I stopped noticing.  The conditioner typically lasts me the entire workday whereas other brands I&#x27;ve tried tend to wear out after an hour or two.  My beard also grows more evenly and fuller when I&#x27;m using this daily.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! lasts forever too - you barely need to use any</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells good. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> stop searching for who got the best balm try it out,you feel and see results in a day or two love it</li>
            <li> No demonstrable effect on my beard, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Although scent is subjective, I thought this product smelled okay in the can.  Once I applied it to my beard, it had somewhat of a rancid smell.  I&#x27;m not sure how the product works over the long term, because I only used it once due to the off putting scent.  I returned this item.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it provides light hold and maximum conditioning. My one complaint is it does leave you feeling a bit greasy. Recently they have come out with an oil in addition to the balm and I find the oil is less greasy while sacrificing some hold. For those of you who may not want something with such a strong scent, they do have an unscented version. The regular scent to me is kind of like a mix of sandalwood with a very small amount of vanilla in it. It&#x27;s more masculine smelling then it sounds though. I have tried a bunch of brands so far and Honest Amish is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Great smell, and leaves a beard much more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li> works great with the beard oil at keeping skin and hair healthy. love how soft it makes it no coarse or bristly here..</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t beard without it. It has a natural scent to it. It&#x27;s very pleasant to me and most importantly my wife likes it. This stuff has taken away the itchy scratchys of beard growing and the ingredients are pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Initially I didn&#x27;t like the smell, maybe expected something different. After couple of weeks tried it again and now I am very happy about how it smells and how it makes my beard shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone as a gift, and am told it is awesome! Conditions well, and the absolute only knock is he wishes there were more scents.. But then again, why mess with the integrity of a good product, right ?! Will be ordering more in the future..</li>
            <li> The wax is too stiff for easy application.  I would recommend the other product on this site.  I really liked that one but only tried this because it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Though a bit pricey I&#x27;m a fan of the beard balm and soap&#x27;s. The smell is great, but a bit strong at first. It left my beard soft and under control. The SO dig&#x27;s it as well. For first time beard oil / balm buyers I would pick up some for sure or something similar like cornwall beard oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  Feels great wearing it.  Not sticky.  Smell is masculine and not strong. You will not regret this product.</li>
            <li> A gritty cream. I felt no conditioning or softening whatsoever. Worthless in my opinion. Returned it for a refund. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product after first use noticed a huge difference.  Didn&#x27;t really notice the scent like others are stating. Overall great product</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He said it was good stuff! He also said that a little dab goes a long way!  He really liked it.</li>
            <li> honestly, this one is a little gritty for my taste. I found a different product that was much smoother and more effective for me.</li>
            <li> Beard looks shiny and healthy, pleasant scent. Compare all natural ingredients to other popular brands - this is the only product I&#x27;ll put on my beard.</li>
            <li> This is a unique conditioner and it works extremely well.... It is a quality product at a great price and fast shipping. I would highly recommend trying.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Had tried several items for my beard. Still had beard dandruff and was just so damn itchy. This fixes all of that.  The only thing I&#x27;d say is be careful using too much, but this stuff is by far the best beard balm I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I have updated this review three times now.  I originally reviewed this beard balm two days after I started using it and thought it was okay.  Now, roughly a month into my Honest Amish experience, I can&#x27;t imaging using anything else.  Yes, it goes on a little greasy but within a hour, it has absorbed and has made my beard soft and perfectly straight.  I now use it in conjunction with Honest Amish beard wax (wax in the morning and balm and night).  I have just ordered Honest Amish heavy duty beard balm and their extra grit wax.  I can only assume that they will work as well as their original products.</li>
            <li> it holds the beard well. just shower, keep beard damp, take a dab in the finger and run it through. that easy. the smell is rugged, work type and it does smell nice</li>
            <li> Only reason I docked one star is because the price and shipping is a bit much for what you get. You can get 4 oz. of the Bay Lime beard conditioning oil for about the same price as the two-ounce Honest Amish.  So far I am really liking the product though.  The balm easily turns into oil after rubbing it gently between your fingers, and it works into your beard just as easily as a liquid oil based product. Has a barely detectable natural kind of scent once worked into beard.  Leaves your beard smooth and gives it a slight sheen - not as shiny as an oil based product though.  I love looking at the tin and label sitting on my bathroom counter, it makes me smile.  Really cool image and neat little tin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my beard looking civilized so I don&#x27;t freak out the gentle people too much. My wife also says the scent adds to the manliness of it all.</li>
            <li> My husband carries this stuff with him everywhere he goes. It smells awesome and it no longer hurts to get kissed!</li>
            <li> Wife agreed to let me grow out my beard as long as it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; look bad and doesn&#x27;t get ruff. i use it after every shower and my beard is very soft and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> I hate when men have ratty beards. Wear the thing with pride, but be a gentleman for Pete&#x27;s sake. Honest Amish is a great company and Beard Balm will put the moisture and health into your beard that it always loses. Stop looking like a caveman, and look like the buff lumberjack on those paper towels you&#x27;re lady is always swooning over when you look away.</li>
            <li> This makes my beard soft and has a nice manly scent.  I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my beard lately... I am hooked.</li>
            <li> absolute necessity for long beards.  Conditions very well, smells good and applies easy.  Even holds the beard well.</li>
            <li> Gives your beard that greasy feeling and helps stuff stick in it.  Yuck!  I got it hoping to keep my beard in check as it grew out, and what I got was something that made it just kinda feel gross all day.  I didn&#x27;t even use that much, but after a week or so I decided it would be best to just toss it and work on regularly combing it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of days, but so far everyone has said my fierce beard is more tame. I&#x27;m hoping that the beard will thicken up even just ever so slightly on the cheek areas. The balm does have a fantastic scent, so great that I have walking around the office asking everyone to take a sniff. If you have a wife or lady friend who doesn&#x27;t mind the beard, but wishes it was better maintained.. this will work magic for you.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gets a little soupy in the Arizona summers but works great.</li>
            <li> It works but its definitely a little too thick. We were prepapred for a more to work with.</li>
            <li> So this beard balm is so great! My wife love the smell of this one over all my other oils. The tin can is &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;. Feels great on my beard and face. I am going to make this my regular order.</li>
            <li> Conditions for a bit, but doesn&#x27;t last. Also, the contents is kind of a gritty balm. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!  Cured my dry skin under my beard overnight.  Will tell all my bearded friends.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of conditioning the beard hair.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very greasy residue that never goes away during the day. Can&#x27;t touch beard or your hands get very greasy</li>
            <li> Love it, smells decent, makes beard look awesome, conditions skin. does what it says, after rubbing in beard i put it on my dry skin areas and it helps. will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. I love the smell and no, it&#x27;s NOT greasy unless you use too much of it. Keeps my beard under control and just plain works. When you get comments like &amp;#34;your beard is perfect&amp;#34;, well some of that goes to Honest Amish who make an amazing product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for a stocking stuffer, and he ended up loving it! It makes his usually abnormally coarse bead very soft, and it smells great! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> It has tamed my wild circle-beard (aka goatee).  What was once a mesh of strange hair now looks healthy and clean.  It even gained a little color as the moistened hairs show their color more clearly.  Great product!!!  Worth the money!  For my circle-beard, I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is a glory to behold. Thick, soft, lush, well coiffed. Thanks Honest Amish Beard Balm. Also, it smells good, not sure why people are complaining about that shiz.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. It&#x27;s not only good on the beard but got rid of my bearddruff. It is very strong and does a good job of taming wild hairs. Also has a pleasant smell that is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> absolutely the best product I have used on my beard. I like the smell for the first little bit till it wears off. I will def. be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Always a reliable product. Will always get Honest  Amish for my beardly needs.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish make nothing short of great products. I have tried others and still they can not be beat</li>
            <li> My husband was both suprised and excited on fathers day. He uses this everyday after his shower.</li>
            <li> I love it! All natural. Great for beard skin even hands. What was dry grey beard now shines fluffs out makes skin feel great and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product as long as I have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully that will be along long time.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF! Husband loves it and it makes his beard nice and soft... so I love it too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Loved the feel to it. Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;:( too bad I couldn&#x27;t grow out the beard for long.&lt;br /&gt;Genes suck.</li>
            <li> works great, don&#x27;t worry about the sent, it goes away in 5 min</li>
            <li> The Amish do beards good! Neutral scent. Creamy texture that melts into the hair. Not shiny or oily. I use it to control my beard, however,  my wife uses it on the end of her dry, thick long hair. Her hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This has been working amazing for my boyfriend and the smell wasnt too strong. It shipped quickly and came with nice packaging .</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this stuff. Really helps with my dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> Started usin this at the begining of the year and the beard is soft, curly and my fiance loves it! The smell took me a couple of days to get used to but, now I don&#x27;t even notice it. At the begining my fiance didn&#x27;t really like the smell but my mom loved it! Now, the fiance actaully misses the smell of it if I don&#x27;t put it on before goin te bed. It feeds your beard really well and conditions the skin underneath briliantly.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my fiancé, he has a very long, hard to groom beard. The balm has a subtle scent and leaves his beard feeling soft. A little help with the blow dryer and a round brush, a nice coating of the balm makes a huge difference!!</li>
            <li> We ordered this for the stage of beard growth when my husband&#x27;s is growing out his beard.  I am not sure any product is going to make the itching go away.  It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This was a really pleasant surprise.  I have a really rough beard and this stuff does a nice job of making it soft, holding it in place and giving a light shine.  I never used a beard product before this.  The smell is also quite nice, more of a natural &#x27;outdoorsy&#x27; &#x27;woodsman&#x27; type of smell.&lt;br /&gt;Really happy I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is melting point. This is hard at 60degrees and nearly melted at 70. Probably liquid at 80.  With a container that bends easily (not sure it would seal fully) especially after a few drops. I am hesitant to take it someplace that it might be sideways or upsidedown and warm.  Like a bag in a warm car or luggage... So I have to this time left it at home in upright position.  I may be totally wrong here, but just being cautious.  This also means that if its low 60s, applying the product is much more difficult than in the 70s or 80s.  BUT this is all part of a natural product&#x27;s characteristics.  Like coconut oil.  So i am happy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Bought as a gift for the boyfriend. The conditioner itself is light enough to not leave your hands oily, and soft enough that you&#x27;ll want to run your hands through it all day. Has a pleasant earthy spicy smell, but it&#x27;s subtle enough that it&#x27;s not overpowering. (I personally wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s black licorice, though I can see how some people could arrive there.) The packaging is very honest as well, it came in a burlap bag with a cardstock tag with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that it does contain nut oils, so it may be a downside for those who are allergic. We have family that is allergic, and I&#x27;m sad when they visit because his beard is not the same without this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm.  It is easy to apply, smells great, and does a wonderful job on my beard - just the right amount of control.  It also helps with the dreaded beard itch.</li>
            <li> I grew my first beard this winter. After experiencing some itchiness, dryness, and overall unsoftness...I turned to the interwebs in hope of finding a cure. I was immediately directed to the need of beard oil or moisturizer. That took me to an Amazon search which led me to Honest Amish. I compared and read and read and compared until I finally decided on this one. Mostly because it had so many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot has been said about the scent. It does indeed smell like Licorice to me. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is stronger than I expected and it does stay fragrant throughout the day. Keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy enough. I&#x27;m about half way through my first jar. My itchiness and dryness has completely went away. I believe it is some softer, but not as soft as I was hoping it to be. Perhaps in time, or perhaps I need to add a conditioner to my routine. One thing I have noticed is it has added a great dear of lustrous shine to my red beard! In short, it has made my beard look a whole lot better and healthier! I like it. I might try some other brands just because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried. But I would use Honest Amish again!</li>
            <li> Smoothed my husbands bears beautifully. Smells nice too! My husband doesn&#x27;t like a lot of grooming (low maintenance) but admitted this stuff helped his beard and mustache be a bit more tame.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my boyfriend and his beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product (I am writing this mostly from my opinion, with a few from him directly). I like how soft it made his beard and how glossy, not greasy, it made it look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His only complaint is the smell. It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance smell but it is naturally scented. He said it&#x27;s overpowering when he has to smell it all the time. He doesn&#x27;t think it smells bad but he doesn&#x27;t like that it really stays with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Makes the beard soft.  And a little goes a long way :)  I feel a little Amish now...and kinda guilty for using this Mac to post a review on Amazon ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for valentines day. He loved it and uses it all the time. Despite other reviewers it seems to last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> This beard balm is awesome! I needed something to solve the dry brittle feeling of my beard had and this stuff did just that. I started by using it every day now I just apply it about 3 times a week it&#x27;s made my beard feel fuller and healthier. Definitely a must own</li>
            <li> I was slightly skeptical of this item, but bolstered by all of its positive reviews, I decided to give it a try for the sake of dealing with the three nightmarish aspects of beard ownership: dandruff, scratchiness, and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using dandruff shampoo/conditioner solely for my beard for the last few years, I still hadn&#x27;t managed to lick the dandruff/scratchiness demons and softness can always be improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to the descriptions of others, the paste itself is gritty and a teensy bit greasy to the touch.  But after rubbing it into the palm for a minute and applying it to the beard, I was instantly won over.  Beard is no longer showering my clothes with beardruff and it&#x27;s soft as can be.  I look forward to getting a final verdict from the lady friend when she returns.</li>
            <li> I got this to tame and soften my full beard.  It does soften and nourish the skin, so it does what it claims to do.  It also make some stray hairs lie down, but does not offer as much control as I had hoped.  The issue I have is with the scent.  It is very woodsy and manly, and--unfortunately--my wife doesn&#x27;t like it at all.  That&#x27;s a deal breaker for me.  I&#x27;m going to try something with a little citrus next time.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as intended and I kinda like the smell. Unfortunately it was a hot day when this arrived on my doorstep and the contents were almost completely liquefied. When it cooled and hardened it became very granular and using it feels like rubbing oily sand through my beard. It still seems effective but I have to work at the chunky bits to break them down. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using the rest of the container but may try ordering again when things cool down a bit here in Virginia.  *Update 3/1/16* I decided to try ordering again during the cooler weather and have been happy with this product, so I&#x27;m adjusting my review score accordingly, but still... not worth buying online during hot weather.</li>
            <li> This product is great. This was my first journey in to the world of beard care, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. You can tell a difference after a few days of use. The fact that the product doesn&#x27;t have any man-made chemicals in it, is just a bonus. It definitely doesn&#x27;t take much for each use, perfect example of &amp;#34;a lil&#x27; dab will do ya&amp;#34;. Ships quicker than promised. Great Job!</li>
            <li> Awesome! My my beard looks good, feels good and the manly scent has become a welcome aroma in my morning routine. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading descriptions of many other products. I am very pleased with the ease of using, the softness it give my skin, the ease it allows me to comb and shape my beard and the MANLY aroma it has. Great product! Oh and don&#x27;t be concerned when you get the container and its seems small - it doesn&#x27;t take much when applying to your beard so although its a small container it goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> Works ok, but was hoping it would condition a little better.</li>
            <li> I received my first tin of this stuff yesterday and applied it after showering. So far, so good. I&#x27;ve grown out my beard a few times, but this is my first experience using conditioner. After only a couple uses, I&#x27;m hooked. I scooped out a dime-sized portion and combed it in while my face was still damp. It certainly does make my beard softer, and as other reviewers have written, the scent eventually fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. Thus, three stars. If there were other options besides scent-free, I&#x27;d consider those. Something like cedar, rosemary, and citrus would be more pleasant and masculine. Anybody willing to do a little research will find lots of info on how to make your own beard oils. It isn&#x27;t rocket science, and you can tweak your own creation to suit your preferences. I may go that route when I&#x27;m done with this product.</li>
            <li> Great scent, makes my beard shine, conditions as advertised, comb glides through with less pulls ... I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> a ghee like texture.  It makes my goatee less itchy.  I use it everyday.  Love it</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little while now, and although some mention the greasiness that can be there, it&#x27;s normally due to using too much.  I have a very dry / rough beard so I thought I would need to use a bunch, but that&#x27;s not the case. It takes a small amount, less than the size of a dime.  I would recommend that you buy their beard soap as well.  I think the combination of the two has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to manage your beard.  adds moisture and makes the beard more manageable and soft.  smells good too.</li>
            <li> nothing to write home about</li>
            <li> Ok not sure this makes your beard any softer, but I do know this...it smells weird and is really strong. My wife can&#x27;t stand it, smells the house up. It gets all over your hands putting it in then every time you touch it during the day your hands get greasy, as well as your neck. I wanted it to work but it just don&#x27;t do much if anything from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> It came in very quickly&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good, very very subtle but I was not looking for perfume.&lt;br /&gt;But above all the product works great, the hairs of my beard became softer.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li> I ordered several items to put together a little &amp;#34;beard care&amp;#34; gift set for my husband. He tends to get itchy skin under his beard, leading to flakes, and often has flyaway hairs that stick out and bug him. So I got him a beard brush, exfoliating face scrub and this balm. The three together have really helped both issues a lot. The balm is pleasant-smelling. It&#x27;s almost a combination of a woodsy pine with black licorice. But it&#x27;s not overpowering and the scent tends to wear off before long. The balm helps to Moisturize his skin, condition his beard and keep a lot of the flyaway a tucked in. We&#x27;ll be buying more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> really helped the texture of my boyfriend&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other balm! It&#x27;s very oily so I apply it at night, I&#x27;ve noticed a very obvious change in my beard! Richer fuller</li>
            <li> leaves your beard soft and tame with a natural look not too oily</li>
            <li> First off when my honest Amish beard balm came in it was all melted and gross. I had to put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before it solidified and I lost part of an already small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I brushed it off because hey if it&#x27;s good then I&#x27;ll be happy to have it. My beard is coarse but not very long 1/4&amp;#34;-1/2&amp;#34;, however this stuff when applied how everyone on the reviews recommended it barely softened my beard. I gave it a few more shots too, even after a shower but still didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And as far as the smell... It&#x27;s horrible my girlfriend hates it and so do I. I&#x27;d describe it as a mix of black licorice and pine. Overall waste of money and a huge disappointment. I give it two stars because it&#x27;s made from all natural materials which is the only good thing about this product.</li>
            <li> Smells like my aunts titties mixed with candy cane ..throwing it out</li>
            <li> Smells great! The smell is not overbearing and fades quickly and won&#x27;t be noticeable after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy or oily.  Very manly smell.  Beard glistens and sparkles in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the smell.  Works well.</li>
            <li> The product packaging is nice and simple; a tin with a single color sticker on it and wrapped in a burlap bag.  It&#x27;s not your normal &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; retail look, but what bearded man is looking for something that looks like Ed Hardy designed it?&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews I was hesitant to purchase this particular beard balm, but I am glad I did.  if you follow the directions and apply a SMALL amount to a WET beard, it doesn&#x27;t build up or make your beard feel greasy at all.  My younger brother has been using a beard oil for several years and I convinced him to try the Honest Amish Beard Balm and now he is hooked.  The forst few times you use it, you will use too much, but it&#x27;s easy to make adjustments until you find the right amount for you.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the manly scent lasted longer because I love it and my wife actually comments on how nice it smells! I&#x27;d give it five stars if the scent lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> This was a very good product to relieve the itch and manage my beard while it was growing in. Not a big fan of the smell. I would have really liked if it had an added cooling/menthol time of feeling to it. Price was fair and the product did what was said.</li>
            <li> This is the finest product for beards that I have ever purchased. I will be purchasing it again, and purchasing it exclusively.</li>
            <li> At first I was not thrilled with the product, but after experiencing the resulting lustrous beard it helps create, I felt differently.I tried other very expensive beard oils and came to appreciate Honest Amish beard balm even more.</li>
            <li> NIce smell, great conditioner and all natural. Is really a great product but i believe should be cheaper</li>
            <li> My husband love it, smell good</li>
            <li> Great after a shower. Keeps the beard soft and healthy. Was concerned about the smell after reading other reviews, but I actually enjoy it and it fades after application; not overpowering in the slightest.</li>
            <li> This was bought for me as a well thought out and intentioned gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sweetie thought I&#x27;d really like this. I need to ask if it is because my manly whiskers are too much for her and she needs them to be softer? I don&#x27;t get what they are really supposed to do. I have a beard and look awesome. The beard causes no problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the balm and it feels ok. My whiskers are a little softer, but I don&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully she will see the ad and post a response. Just asking would be too simple.</li>
            <li> This made my beard feel like a mink i am sold will not use no other product</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I was unsure on how much i needed to use. All you need is a little bit on each finger for each side of your face. make sure you rub it in good. This product will soften your beard and make you happy!!</li>
            <li> I liked but this one cannot be shipped to Angola my country.</li>
            <li> The wax is great, the initial scent is almost that of medicine cabinet, but wears off.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. Works well on course hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely softens your beard, and does it well!  A word of warning, however, this scent may not be for everyone.  It is a very manly sent...but a sort of musky old man variety.  I enjoyed it, but found it to be a bit strong at times.  I think that the scent will be the main point that will separate people who love this product and people who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard for the last fifteen years with few exceptions. During that time, I never received a single compliment about my beard that did not come from my wife. I have been using this balm for about a month, and it has completely transformed my beard from a frizzy, uncontrollable mess into a beard that gives me confidence and looks pretty damn good. I am at about 3.5 months of growth now, and I get compliments on my beard almost daily, even while standing at a urinal... yeah, that one was a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any oils or balms in the past. I did not know there were such things available, so I have nothing to compare this to except for using no products at all. I know this one works for me, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone. Like others have said, if it is too oily, you are using too much. I use a portion a little larger than an average pea when my beard is damp after a shower, and my beard is never oily. Also, the scent is very mild and reminds me of Juicy Fruit chewing gum. You can&#x27;t smell it at all after a few minutes, but if you have a decent &#x27;stache you can taste it throughout the day- bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your beard a favor and pick this up along with a boars bristle brush. Also, check out the Honest Amish Etsy page for all of their other products. I won&#x27;t beard without it again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and health but it broke my face out had to stop using it, and it smelled weird not bad just like anis oil</li>
            <li> Get the unscented version! The scented version is way too strong for me and my wife. The unscented is just as good but isn&#x27;t overwhelming with the smell!</li>
            <li> So, I had a decently long beard, a lot of &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34; quips from random strangers wherever I went. However, it hadn&#x27;t seem to grow in months.  I had hit the dreaded TERMINAL LENGTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start researching balms and whatnot to find out if something could help and came across this product. The reviews all seemed good except for the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; people, but hey, $14? I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  So, ordered, and the balm arrived a few days later, all spiffily wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...what a small tin! I figured there was no way this stuff would last me more than two weeks, a month max, so I used it oh so sparingly.  The scent didn&#x27;t really bother me, but, honestly, its fairly strong, and you&#x27;re putting it right on your face, so it smells stronger to you than it does to anyone else. I can see where some people would be turned off by it, but its very &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smelling, and more of a scent, less of an &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of not noticing a difference, I realized how little I had actually used.  This stuff goes a long way, much longer than I expected.  So, I tried an experiment.  I measured my beard, and vowed to use the balm once a day.  At then end of the month, we&#x27;d see if there was any growth.  30 days later, lo and behold, I had gained between a quarter and a half inch of beard length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does this product make your beard GROW? Probably not...but...it DOES keep you beard hair healthy. I have had FAR fewer stray hairs come out in my comb. I used to have 6-7 long hairs come off every stroke, now I usually just get the one occassional hair, which means less hair is coming out, and spending more time growing. I&#x27;ve been super impressed with the product, and two months after buying, and using it daily for a month and a half, I&#x27;m still not halfway done with the tin.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Goes perfect with the oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to give it a go in my beard. I liked the smell of the balm and it was not greasy at all. Very nice after a hot shower, my beard really liked this stuff and I could tell a difference right away. There are some small solids... or granules in this product. They melt away when heated by rubbing the balm between your hands, but I always seemed to have a few stuck between my fingers. I would have rather seen a smooth balm. Keep in mind that I am anything but a maker of balms and have no knowledge of the process. I did feel like this was a high quality item and I will get more when mine is gone.</li>
            <li> My beard didn&#x27;t get super soft and smooth overnight, but after a few applications I noticed my facial hair wasn&#x27;t quite as coarse.  After weeks of application my beard now has a nice feel to it.  Something the ladies can&#x27;t seem to resist!  I have also had compliments on the scent.  It&#x27;s a manly scent, to say the least, and I haven&#x27;t had anyone complain about it.  I can describe it as musky with some licorice notes.  I would definitely recommend this product to my bearded buds.</li>
            <li> I have bought this several times as a gift for sons-in-law, etc. They have all been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps the beard looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product. It works as advertised but the smell is strong. My wife has asthma and I cannot leave it in when I am with her. I don&#x27;t mind the smell myself, it is both earthy and spicy but unfortunately I cannot use it very often. No fault of the product.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the positive feedback about this product I decided to try it out for myself. I was in the service for 8 yrs so a post service beard was just so right for me. I had no clue what beard balm was, I thought shampooing it was good for my beard. Little did I know, it takes a lot of care. After about 4 months of solid growth I really started looking into beard oil/balm. So here I am now day 3 of using honest Amish, I gotta say it has really tamed my beard looks full, and feels great. As far as the smell I like it, it&#x27;s a little strong smelling it straight out of the can. After applying maybe half a dime size amount into my beard the smell was real clean and faint. I can only imagine after a whole van it only gets better looking and stronger looking beard so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this product a 5!!</li>
            <li> Hey Guys, So I would consider myself an avid beard grower. I have had a beard for quite sometime and or atleast facial hair. My girlfriend has seen my face shaved to the skin twice in 6 1/2 years. This time around I have been thinking of really taking the beard to the next level like \\&quot;fear the beard\\&quot; status. But, I realized I need some help since I work in a professional environment. It needs to be presentable.    Once it started getting pretty long I had some flakes and irritation that I have really only had when its too short, that I have NEVER had before with length and the sides were curling a bit. I read about this product (thank you for the reviews) and jumped on it. I absolutely love this product....love. So that is my credibility.    Size: ONLY REASON IT almost got 4 STARS...I want more lol    Quality: Mine arrived melted, but don&#x27;t do what I did and use it right away. Shake it up and put it in the fridge for a minutes (says it clear in the directions by the way).It has a grainy feel to it but dissolves into oil right away.    Smell: I love it because its not fruity or flowery or overwhelming. Its woodsy....almost hemp like but not with the \\&quot;Oh I know that smell\\&quot; type of thing. It is pleasant and subtle. Girlfriend loves it too.    Application: Very easy, adds to my morning routines now.    Aftermath: leaves you beard kind of shiny but doesn&#x27;t actually...mold your beard it does help you shape it a bit. But its not like a wax that you can make your beard do flips with.    Overall: I will always have this product for the lifetime of my beard...HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my beard soft and healthy. Downside is half leaked out of container I n shipping..</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this (I have very sensitive skin)... I was bummed that this didn&#x27;t work for me (got eye irritation). Honest Amish was great, responded nicely, and issued a refund. Great Service</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I can&#x27;t get over how GREAT this stuff smells!  He smells kinda like a spiced gum drop.  Good product and will buy again.  He also likes to use this product.</li>
            <li> From the soap to the beard balm Honest Amish products are great. My beard is very thick and coarse, until I started using these soaps my beard was uncontrollable. Now is softer and is much more behaved.</li>
            <li> This is some GOOD stuff. All around it just feels good on my face. It softens your beard and really helps to alleviate the dryness, itching and irritation of new beard growth. It is supposed to &amp;#34;tame wild hairs&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think it does that so well. I even tried the Honest Amish Wax in an attempt to try to get my beard to relax a bit, and that it did not work. I am giving this five stars because it is all around an awesome product. I use it on my whole face as a moisturizer and to soften my beard. It is as good as if not better than the expensive facial lotions. I visibly have less wrinkles under my eyes and a nice healthy sheen on my face. The smell is great too. I will use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> works as described.  just greasy until it dries.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, he really likes using it on his beard. Smells great and is all natural. It is making his beard softer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cool idea, but the container is TINY for the price you pay and the balm is kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome produc!  Very nice for my beard, plus my lady loves the smell and how soft and smooth it makes my beard :)</li>
            <li> Before, Beard was a bit crude.  He was drinking Wild Turkey out of the bottle and smoking Marlboro Reds all day.  Though I can&#x27;t prove it, I believe at night while I was asleep he was going out, robbing liquor stores and pushing down old women in the street.  It was definitely putting a strain on our relationship.  I needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for answers and found a lot of options, but decided to try this in hopes of &amp;#34;refining&amp;#34; Beard.  At first, I was drawn to the novelty of the brand, packaging and description.  So, why not?  At least I would have a cool tin if it failed.  Maybe something to put a reminder of Beard in when we parted ways?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now?  After a few days use, I&#x27;ve noticed a change.  Beard has started to drink Scotch and smoke Cubans.  In fact, his drinking and smoking has cut back and he&#x27;s being a lot more polite.  Heck, he&#x27;s started to talk about wanting to go on a fox hunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Honest Amish, you&#x27;ve helped us start to rebuild our failing relationship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Jokes aside, my beard actually has begun to feel and look healthier.  Though not often, my job does require a professional appearance and I do feel this product will help me achieve that while retaining the manliness of a beard.  So, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.)</li>
            <li> I had an issue with flaking and serious irritation. but started using this product, and it all went away. my beard is now soft and seems to be growing much quicker.</li>
            <li> Just got my second can of this stuff.  I started using it back in November with probably 3-4 weeks of growth.  I basically follow the instructions as far as application, but I usually apply a little bit at the time through out the day.  If you put too much in at once it can make a dark beard look greasy.  If my beard ends up dry from some reason I will run hot water over the side of the can to warm it up to liquid then put a lot in.  Warming it up just helps in getting down deep in the hair and on the skin.  If it doesn&#x27;t work the first few times you try it don&#x27;t throw it away.  Stick with it for a few weeks and it will really do what they say it will, but it don&#x27;t happen in one application.  Smells great too...very woodsy, piney smelling stuff which goes well with a big burly beard.</li>
            <li> all you need to do is read the reviews.. this stuff is fantastic.. i love it and will continue using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;if you have a beard then you need to buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the urging of my vegan co-worker and I am pleased to say that I am glad that I caved in to the nudging. I have always had a full beard and mustache but it has not always been my friend.  After using these products my beard is twice as soft and much more tamed.  It leaves my beard nice and shiny with out being greasy or heavy and the mustache Wax is a life saver</li>
            <li> This has a very pungent smell. However! I wrote them and they sent me the unscented version which is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;So this one got 3 stars, but the unscented is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain I&#x27;m literally rubbing actual butter into my beard. But in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mine arrived, some of the ingredients had separated, but the instructions tell you how to re-mix them (basically heat and shake, I chose to heat it under hot running water, but the instructions also suggest just leaving it on a windowsill, which would also work, it has a very low melting point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to describe, but pleasant. My wife says it&#x27;s lemony, but I&#x27;m not so sure, and I don&#x27;t see any citrus fruits listed in the ingredients (though I&#x27;m not sure they listed all of them). I see a lot of people describing it as a black licorice smell, but no. The Honest Amish beard *WAX* smells like licorice (anise, actually), but this product does not. It&#x27;s a very different smell from the wax. The scent fades pretty quickly anyway, so it shouldn&#x27;t noticeable to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have their nose buried in your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the beard goes, this product really does help with softening and even some mild styling/straightening of the beard (it doesn&#x27;t have any real *hold* but it does make the beard more manageable). And it does eliminate the occasional itch, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of butters and oils, so if you overdo it, you&#x27;ll be a bit oily, but it absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted something special for the beard hair to make it more manageable over the day. I get him this balm after reading reviews in Amazon for different products. He uses since Valentine Day (10 days ago) and he told me that he really like it how keeps the beard hair in place, but feels soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes for a a shiny beard! I understand that it states on the paper that came with it that skin is fair game too, I find if you get it anywhere but your beard you get really oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it does a fairly good job of taming all the fly-aways, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate them. I&#x27;m glad I purchased as going in I really knew nothing about it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard silky smooth and I actually like the smell of it.  A little bit will go a long way so not a lot is needed when rubbing into your beard.  I receive many compliments about my beard and i belive part of it has to do with this stuff.  I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I bought it for my husband and his super curly beard. Its a very subtle clove scent, you can&#x27;t smell it when you&#x27;re standing by him or he walks by, but when I hug him I can smell it :-) Along with a beard brush his beard is now much smoother and neater.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, softens my man&#x27;s beard, and a little goes a long way.  If you love the man but hate the scratchy, stinky beard...this is for you!</li>
            <li> my husbands REALLY long beard is now REALLY soft too:)</li>
            <li> Love this beard balm. Works as stated, smells great. and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  I had horrible skin itching/burning during last Septembeard through Decembeard and had to chop off everything.  This year with Honest Amish no itching and burning! Great Job!</li>
            <li> I have tried many beard products offered on Amazon and in my home town.  Nothing comes close to this.  Have you ever seen Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium?  Well, when I run out of this stuff like he did with the shoes, my beard life will be over.</li>
            <li> i guess it does what it says it will do, but i dont really like the way it smells and i wish it wasnt so sticky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this beard balm! Smells great and works even better! Was skeptical about the size of it but let me assure you if you use it like the company says it does go a long way!</li>
            <li> The day I received my delivery it was a pretty warm day so the product had separated.  There are instructions included on what to do if this happens so I followed the directions.  The next day the product was fine...however the very following day the product was clumpy and had separated again!  I would look for another product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and literally got a compliment the day after using it. However, I was looking for a little more hold so I ordered the Heavy Duty Beard Balm and will update this review after using it for a while. Otherwise, excellent conditioning balm that does not clog my pores, smells great, conditions, and makes my beard look good and healthy.</li>
            <li> Tamed the husband&#x27;s beard perfectly! If you&#x27;re worried about the scent - it dissipates after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This balm is great.  My beard was getting pretty long and brittle after 3 months of growth.  I bought this balm and a boar hair bristle brush and now it is really soft and smells great too.  More importantly, the ladies love it.  My girl likes the feel and smell of my beard now and constantly likes to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply, and I noticed a difference immediately after the first application.  Now I just run a little bit through my beard after every shower.  It made it more manageable and it feels healthier/softer.  I will continue to use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now. Although I didn&#x27;t notice anything the first week, by the second week the dry, flaky skin under my beard started to go away. By the 3rd week, my beard is looking thicker. I don&#x27;t have to use much, just about the size of a dime is enough for me.</li>
            <li> Smell is not what some people make it out to be, it is a something different, but it only lasts a little bit and its NOT BAD.  The main reason I needed it was to tame a wiry beard, and it works great there!</li>
            <li> In short: quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The packaging was sweet, came with instructions and advice, nice bag and the sorts.&lt;br /&gt;2) The price was on the higher end, but with the size of the can given the amount used per apply, it is well placed.&lt;br /&gt;3) The scent is not bad, not especially good either. Non of the people around me commented on its existence even when I asked if I smell funny; guess it does disappear after a while. Just be aware that it exists once you apply.&lt;br /&gt;4) The delivery was one day late, but the likes happen, so I would say arrives on time more or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the important stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) My beard did feel considerably smoother after about a week of daily applying; but I did also oil my beard with olive oil (balm in the morning, oil at night; my beard is very dry, so I need all the oils I can get).&lt;br /&gt;6) It does not have any significant hold, so don&#x27;t count on it getting the wild hairs down; trimming does that job better. Or, just apply balm daily till your beard soften at a longer length allowing better combing down.&lt;br /&gt;7) It does help give the beard a thicker, fuller look... My beard is not the thickest, but also not patchy, yet it feels darker after balming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;- Balm does help get a better beard look.&lt;br /&gt;- Balm does NOT equal wax; try the heavy balm or simply wax to keep your hairs down</li>
            <li> This Beard bomb works awesome but my wife does not like the way it smells it does have a weird smell</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Fast shipping, warm packaging. We will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no more beard itching, great product!</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. The smell is really nice and subtle, not too strong!</li>
            <li> I will be a regular customer moving forward - dig this product!  My wife likes the smell and the fact that my beard is now noticeably softer and manageable.  Plus a little seems to go along way so should last a good while on my first canister purchased.  Thanks guys...good stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; leaves my beard soft &amp; manageable all day. Great ingredients &amp; perfect consistency. I&#x27;ll never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> works great and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to help moisturize his beard. It smells fresh and slightly of anise, but not overpowering and it does wear off during the day. He says it feels nice and does help soften it while growing it out. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This product worked well in keeping the beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my feel moisturized without the greasy feeling of using hair moisturizer products.  Great buy!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Ive had a beard for over 10 yrs, and i always assumed that it just was supposed to be rough and scratchy. Someone recommended that i try a beard oil, but i saw the reviews for this product and it sounded better for my needs. Well, two weeks in, and it really works. I love this balm, and i actually get annoyed if i cant put it on right after my shower. My beard is softer, healthier, has no beardruff, and very few split hairs or rogue hairs. Not only that, but its much more comfortable on my face, which has resulted in me growing my beard out to a longer length.&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is that Im not crazy about the smell. Other scents, or even an unscented option would be great. Admittedly, this complaint is nit picking a great product. If you like the smell of black licorice, you&#x60;ll probably not mind the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i&#x60;d say Give it a try, youll love it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!!! Keeps his beard super soft and smells great. Great product will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that does what it promises. My beard has never looked better.  I was a bit hesitant to order the product because some users complained about the anise scent. The product does have a light anise scent but it quickly dissipates once the product is rubbed in to your beard.</li>
            <li> Very good balm makes beard very soft,shiny,manageable and it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not too oily.  Takes most of the itch out of initial growth.  Smells like gingerbread cookies.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this beard balm.  Just rub it in your fingers a bit before putting it in your beard.  It leaves my beard shiny and healthy looking!!</li>
            <li> I tried Beard Balm (which is made in Detroit) before I gave Honest Amish a try. The Honest Amish smells like a spicy gumdrop at first, and then later on it kind of reminded me of a ripe fruit scent of which I&#x27;m not a big fan. It contains a few more ingredients over Beard Balm, like Argan oil. That said, Honest Amish melts in my hand a lot faster and easier than Beard Balm. Heck, I think I could melt the can just by holding it in my palm for a few seconds. The Honest Amish canister arrived in a small burlap sack, but the can was pretty well dented! It doesn&#x27;t look like it was dented during shipment, because Beard Balm arrived in a separate (but same sized) box without any problems. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the feel of my beard after using Honest Amish. If I had to do it again, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought any beard balm/oil since they don&#x27;t seem to do anything. I just shampoo and condition my beard the same way I do with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I had heard good things about beard balms in general and wanted to try one, adn this was listed as one of the most popular varieties on Amazon with a lot of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The tin came in a small useless burlap bag that I immediately threw away, which seemed wasteful. The product itself has a mild scent that is neither pleasant nor particularly objectionable. That&#x27;s not what bothered me. It was the performance that I disliked. In a nutshell, it didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I applied it daily for several days, increasing the amount each time. There was absolutely no perceptible change in beard softness, manageability, or sheen. It seemed like a lot of money for no results whatsoever. If I wanted no results, I could easily get that for free. The one good thing was their satisfaction guarantee, which I took advantage of to return the remainder of the product for a full refund. That part was great. Even better would be not buying it in the first place. I give them two stars for taking their useless product back.</li>
            <li> My beard hasn&#x27;t been softer, my wife actually likes it now.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> Smells like a dirty hippy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but so worth it. I put this on after I get out of the shower, maybe two or three times a week. It softens my beard, reduces the itchiness, and has elimited my beard dandruff. I should mention that it, also, smells great. I wish there was a cologne that smelled like this.</li>
            <li> Like most all the other reviews of this product, it worked very well.  My beard was so dry with a sweep broom like texture, if fact it was so bad that it actually hurt my face when I rubbed my hand through it.  It this product did not work, the beard was coming off.  It did not work overnight, by beard was so bad it took 3-4 days for it to get better and then only after using it 3 times a day.  Now after a month, I only use it once in the morning and my beard/face feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aroma:  I like it!  My wife, not so much which means that I will probably be ordering the unscented tin next time.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected. The smell was nice and the packaging neat, but it left a very greasy feel to my beard that I didn&#x27;t like. I used about a dime&#x27;s worth (for my thick, full beard) and even a few hours later my beard was greasy to touch. Rather stick to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. This is my 3rd purchase it leaves the beard soft all day and it looks clean and healthy. I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> MY BEARD HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell some have complained about. It&#x27;s not strong at all. I get rosemary out of it. For me, this balm keeps my beard hairs as well groomed as they&#x27;re going to get. I have scraggly-coarse beard hair, and this, with a beard brush get&#x27;s everything looking well groomed.</li>
            <li> Smell is not the best and it is a bit greasy. It does seem to relax the wiry hairs pretty well for a few hours but wears off/dries out before to long require multiple applications throughout the day. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> this stuff will last you longer than you expect, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Came in cute packaging and will be a good gift for my hairy son!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. softens my beard right up. The scent is a little strong, but dissipates quickly, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re using this for the first time, try using a little less than what you think you&#x27;ll need, otherwise you could end up a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Made my beard look amazing. Was really iffy of it. But it turned out great. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really softens up and moisturizes my beard and at its cost, is a real value compared to pricier oils and alternative products. I don&#x27;t mind the smell and it pretty much dissipates within a few minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!.  The only reason it isn&#x27;t four stars is that sometimes I think it&#x27;s &#x27;separating&#x27; and I have to mix it in my hand before applying.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> This I like! I regrew my beard so I could try this product. My son in law turned me on to it. He has a very manly set of whiskers where my chin will only support a light goatee. I starting using the balm as soon as I stopped shaving and it really made a difference in the thickness and look of my once scraggly face moss. My skin is less dry and smoother. I even use it on my eyebrows. The skin on my hands looks better. What is left on my hands after I rub down my face, scalp and hands, I rub on my Dachshund. It makes her smell nice. It looks like a can of balm could last me about 6 months. It only takes a dose about like a small pea rubbed between wet hands to cover my face. Then I comb it in with a fine comb. Don&#x27;t forget the eyebrows and the weenie dog.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Work well keeping rouge hairs manageable during the day with out having your beard be stiff from gel.</li>
            <li> Really nice natural oils aroma and feel, not sticky, a real must for the bearded soul.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend that needed to ease up his fast growing beard. It did.</li>
            <li> Very good product! I have been using this for 6 months now and will continue to use this for my beard.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff… unfortunately, so do my dog. I can’t buy anymore because he licks my face so much it is gross.</li>
            <li> Soothes, tames and smells good. Interesting texture, wax that you melt in your hands, I like it</li>
            <li> I got this because I have been looking for a way to soften my beard.  My beard is pretty course and always feels dry and brittle.  I have tried commercial beard oil (it was ok) and a cream hair conditioner that I actually leave in (works the best but doesn&#x27;t last long).  Reading the reviews, I was hesitant about this one.  There were far more positive reviews than negative so I went for it.  The smell is pleasant while in the tin.  When you put it on, the pleasant earthly smell doesn&#x27;t last long and for me it was replaced by this slight smell of rancid oil.  I have smelled shae butter than has gone off and it was similar.  I was running errands and had to just deal with it.  After a few hours the rancid smell was gone.  The part I don&#x27;t like is how oily this stays.  Jojoba is usually quickly absorbed and my beard doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but something in this made it a mess.  While driving, I looked down at my steering wheel and noticed one side was very shiny and slick.  I thought that was weird and then I noticed oily finger prints as well.  It hit me that it was on the left side and I had been stroking my beard with my left hand.  Later I took a phone call and when I lowered the phone, oil was smeared all over the screen.  I am sending this back and will stick with a homemade beard oil that is pure jojoba and some essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great! Lasts forever, and it works</li>
            <li> awesome product..helps tame an unruly beard (or hair)</li>
            <li> BEST EVER...MY BEARD LOVED IT</li>
            <li> Last year I let my beard grow with minimal trimming from August to December. I believe I would still have that beard had I purchased this then. I&#x27;m currently at 4 or so weeks of growth and this product has tamed the itch and discomfort considerably. The thick, and still stubbly hairs below my jaw feel softer. The scent is wonderful. I&#x27;ve tasted real chartreuse before and I agree with that description. The scent is noticeable but only just, and dissipates within an hour or so. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay, stop looking.  This is the best product for your beard...period.  It does exactly what it says.  Shine, softness, control, stray hair taming -check.  Only have to use a dime size amount (I have a 4\\&quot; Whaler beard) lasts all day, not too greasy and the smell is a little like Jaegermeister :) but it shouldnt be over powering at all if you only put a small amount on.</li>
            <li> ...unless you want one awesome kick-ass beard. This stuff conditions great and helps shape my beard fairly well. I just got it this morning right before I showered (perfect timing FedEx!) and promptly used it after washing and drying my beard. Seriously, upon putting the stuff on, I could start to feel a difference as I massaged and combed it in. Will definitely by this and other products from these good folks again. I&#x27;m currently using Grandpa&#x27;s black tar soap to wash my beard, but am seriously considering using the Honest Amish soap after trying this product. Great stuff Honest Amish!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was nice. Only used once so far but my beard already feels softer and looks shinier. Stray hairs are more controlled. I just ordered the Honest Amish beard wax as well. Can&#x27;t wait to get this. I will use the balm at night after the shower when my beard is wet and use the wax in the morning for more control.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a tree guy, so in the winter he likes to grow a beard.  I was pretty dismayed about this last winter because, to be quite frank, it was scratchy and terrible.  This greatly improved the texture of my guy&#x27;s beard, and he loves it too!  It comes in an adorable little tin inside of an adorable little pouch.  It leaves a slight bit of residue on the hands, but it&#x27;s moisturizing so who cares?  I personally enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I like this beard balm very much. I enjoy it more after it has been in for about an hour and the smell mellows out a bit. It smells like licorice to me and I am not a real big fan of that in my beard. Fragrance aside, this is great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves beard soft and clean feeling not greasy or slimy&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use container&lt;br /&gt;+ Cost/Value&lt;br /&gt;+ Protects the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is a negative for me but of course fragrance is subjective as others may enjoy it but I give 4 stars for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom line_ Yes, I would recommend it as it is natural and works very well at softening the beard and protecting the skin underneath. I do not have dry skin/flakes in my beard and my face does not itch. This is good stuff but I do not care for the smell so I will be looking for alternatives when this is gone.</li>
            <li> The setting:  Late October, USA; East Coast, 50 deg F, clear skies, 2:08 am.  An early-rising bird is heard chirping in the distance.    The merchandise:  5&#x27;10\\&quot;, 170 lbs  6 weeks of thicket-like growth    The proof:  \\&quot;Wow, it doesn&#x27;t scratch at all...I never thought--\\&quot; -- pretty girl in mid-kiss    The bottom line:  What was once a normal scraggly beard is now a majestic bear, on my face.    Less is more (too much is a little greasy). The scent is manly and woodsy but could be a bit stronger. The texture is like wet sand, until you work it into your finger and it liquefies.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my mustache/goatee. It is TERRIFIC! My mustache is thick, and this product makes it feel softer and less course - and it seems to tame the goatee. Smells great, slight herbal/lemon scent. Very dude friendly stuff. I also ordered a Kent mustache comb - I highly recommend the combo! Thanks for coming through, Amazon! I could not find any beard products locally.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, but he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet. I know it would make his beard softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this stuff. My beard is fluffy and soft. No more pricky itchiness to deal with. The smell is sort of reminiscent of a fine black licorice but lacking the pungent smell of the actual candy. Would recommend anyone to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Just bought this for my boyfriend. He&#x27;s definitely a beard man, and was looking for something of good quality. I, however,  was more concerned about how a beard product would smell. I was skeptical...and then he used it. It smells great! Not too heavy, and my goodness within ten minutes his beard went from coarse and annoying to soft and manageable! We will always buy it now!</li>
            <li> Great Balm especially used in conjunction with Beard Oil and a beard brush.</li>
            <li> Another great Amish product! I really like this conditioner w/ it&#x27;s great smell and non-oily properties. While it doesn&#x27;t provide much control, it makes up for it w/ great conditioning power and shine! Makes my beard feel/look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for extra control and sculpting power, I recommend their Extra-Grit product which is more like a wax.</li>
            <li> Never has my beard smelled more delicious.  Well...aside from after eating a prime rib sandwich....nothing compares to those steak juices on your chin!  In all seriousness, I love this product and plan to buy more in the future.  When I received it, it was a hot day, so the jar was a puddle of goo.  But after I let it congeal in the air conditioning, it went back to its proper state.</li>
            <li> Can is tight and hard to close.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very (seriously, *very*) picky about scents and he loves the way this smells on both his beard and his hands. He&#x27;s only been using this for a few days but so far, he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and provides good conditioning to your skin that lasts all day. The smell leaves something to be desired, and my girlfriend definitely knows when I&#x27;ve used this product. Not a good thing. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint what it smells like, but you sort of smell like a hippie. The smell gets annoying throughout the day and can leave your skin and beard feeling greasy if the right amount isn&#x27;t applied. What works extremely well is Mane &#x27;n Tail leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s costs about $6 and you can even find it at dollar stores. Smells better than Honest Amish, conditions your skin as well, and also makes your beard feel thicker since the leave in application also acts as a texturizer. I&#x27;m really particular when it comes to beard care and products and would pick Mane &#x27;n Tail leave in conditioner again and save the money. Solid product.</li>
            <li> Beyond amazing, Love everything about it and this company. Speedy, keeping you in the loop with tracking, and just a great experience all around. They certainly made a customer for life!</li>
            <li> It is a great product it does make your beard be nice and soft and shiny , but.... I don&#x27;t care what people say, the scent is very very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Forget about wearing cologne and this stuff at the same time, and I am the kinda guy who wears cologne every day.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the strong scent, buy this product , works great.</li>
            <li> I gave this product to my husband for Christmas.  He has used it at least 5 times since opening it Christmas morning.  He and I both can tell a difference in the texture and condition of his beard.  Everything about this product is great with the exception of the scent.  It is a little offputting and takes some getting used to.  That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t quite give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and it is amazing. He puts it on after the shower and it makes his beard soft, shiny, and neat. It smells a little like licorice but it is not super noticeable and goes away after an hour or so. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the price, very expensive for such a small canister.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this except for the fact that when I have it, I can&#x27;t stroke my beard without having oils on my fingers. That&#x27;s not very ideal for my office mouse and keyboard.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because I wanted to be able to manage my beard, in particular few of the whiskers which are hard to direct because they grow out instead of down with all the other whiskers. Upon applying the product I have noticed very pleasant scent; it is a natural not overpowering and very refined. The conditioner definitely does its job by allowing me to better control my beard although I think I need a bit longer whiskers for optimum manageability. There is something ceremonious about applying the conditioner in the morning. I would definitely recommend this product; the fact that it is hand made with natural product is very appealing to me. The fact that it is made in the USA is desired, and greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d actually consider getting a product for my beard. But, like anything you care about, you should invest in it and get the most out of it. I had tried basic lotions and other products but this one really  made a difference. At first, I was surprised by the size of the container, but quickly learned size isn&#x27;t everything. It takes but a small dab to add life to your facial hair. In your hands it has a partial sandy texture, but after a quick rub together it&#x27;s ready to be applied. The aroma is something I thought would bother me, but it&#x27;s mild and dissipates after a few minutes. It&#x27;s almost minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product rubs in quickly and easily. There are essential oils in it so there will be a slight oily feel. Once applied, rub into beard, mustache, whatever. I used a beard comb to work in thoroughly. It really helps all the wild hairs and areas that grow faster lay down properly. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and not sure how I&#x27;ve grown a beard without it.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised it is greatly reducing itch and making my beard soft and helping it grow fuller. A little for a long way of this product which is a good thing. This is a must have addition to your grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of taking care of the beard.  Really like the light scent of the oils used and the fact that they don&#x27;t overpower and don&#x27;t linger all day.  When I finally use up this tin, I&#x27;m not even going to look around at other possibilities, I&#x27;ll just order this again, and again, and again......you get the idea.</li>
            <li> This is some great beard balm. It really moisturizes and leaves your beard feeling great. I recommend.</li>
            <li> We received it quickly and my husband loves the way his beard feels now that he&#x27;s been using it for a week or so. It definitely makes a difference for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This compound is absolutely grand, and it has turned out to be a great investment for my beard and the health of my facial follicles. Genuine surprise greeted my psyche after I began using a beard conditioner (this is the only brand of beard conditioner I have ever used, so take my review with a grain of salt, for there could be something equally good on the market - I would not know). I immediately noticed a different in the texture and quality of my whiskers from the initial use, and have continued to use the tin nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;This is a leave-in conditioner, as the site label asserts, so to really receive the complete benefit of using such a product, it is necessary to put it in sometime in the morning and leave it in for at least eight or nine hours, but I generally leave it there until right before I decide to climb into bed. I would say my whiskers are on the prolific side of things, but only about 4 inches long; I use slightly under a large lima bean-size amount, work it into a non-sedimentary oil on my palms, and then just rub it as evenly as I can throughout my beard. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Perchance I shall try others in the future, but as a first-round pick, I believe I did very well selecting this product. If you are considering others, I would try a small two ounce tin of this first.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beard balm. I have tried a few others, but they don&#x27;t compare to the Honest Amish Brand. This is more of a conditioner rather than a balm/wax to hold your beard in place. I love the scent, it is a little anise based - but it dissipates quickly if that is a concern of yours.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised works very well with my beard.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer after he mentioned beard oil. Figured this would be a little less messy for it. He lives it. Made his beard nice and soft</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and the scent is nice!</li>
            <li> I think the can I got is bad, it is granulated and feels like a paste with sand that does not dissolve.  Not sure, but maybe it goes bad or was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Hubby LOVES it - I like the way it makes his beard feel.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but as I said about the beard wax (Honest Amish Original Beard Wax) - - the texture leaves something to be desired. If your ok with having a &#x27;vaseline&#x27; type texture on your face, then no problem. It does, however- soak your beard with nutrients, (and some control) and I have noticed my facial hair much softer, and more controllable in just a few uses. So, overall- it&#x27;s a good for a bad, the smell and texture is more like something you would find in the automotive industry (thick, waxey, greasy texture)- but it does keep your beard healthy-given that it&#x27;s a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; conditioner- I tend to use it at night, rather than out in public.</li>
            <li> Okay okay. I couldn&#x27;t grow my beard cause of the itch. Id have bumps and random ingrown hair and maybe even pimples. Couldn&#x27;t tell but wow they itched. It stopped me from growing my beard every time. Ive now used this for two beards and wow the itch is gone. The bumps are not present and the beard is rocking! People talk about the smell, I like it. if you want to switch it up add a drop of essential oil to your beard rub down. I use cedar wood!!!! Man up!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.  I was worried the smell would be strong after reading the other reviews, but I would say it is very mild and shouldn&#x27;t keep anyone from using it unless they&#x27;re very seneitive to fragrance.  I can really tell a difference since he&#x27;s started using this product.  Not only does his beard feel softer, it also looks a lot better.  It has a nice shine and really brings out the color while smoothing it.</li>
            <li> An interesting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;Instructions on heating the balm if it starts to separate (I assume the wax beads)&lt;br /&gt;When it is gel like, it goes on easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;It separates and forms the wax beads again within 2 days of being melted&lt;br /&gt;When it forms the beads, it is more of a bother to melt in your hand and apply and seems to penetrate less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it is too much labor to apply and at least the one I got simply wasn&#x27;t suitable for use regularly. Their products seem well reviewed and I may have gotten a bad batch. I can&#x27;t imagine it is standard that you have to melt the product down every two days to keep it ready for application. I also didn&#x27;t notice any particular softening of my beard in 3-4 weeks of application, but that may have been again because the product wasn&#x27;t really a gel often when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try their products again, but probably not this one.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, you need this.</li>
            <li> Absolutelly perfect. People would for sure talk about your good smell and your beard got shine and beatiful. Best product for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be carefull when you open it after delivery since content get liquified. Wait some time to open it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather this was scent free.  It&#x27;s not a great smell, though not bad, and you&#x27;ll be smelling it all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different beard oil and was less than impressed and it gave me a rash in fact. Nevertheless - my wife insisted that if a beard was to be - it&#x27;d need to be tamed. Alas, I found this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it neat that it comes out gritty balm, but melts quickly in your hand and you rub in. It does leave an after smell - which I enjoy, but my wife doesn&#x27;t. I think they make an unscented... I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - my beard does feel softer and more manageable just after the first use!  I&#x27;m impressed with that!  It never did scratch, so that wasn&#x27;t a problem I can comment on.</li>
            <li> My bearded men love it and the consistency of the product is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in a little burlap bag, which was great because this was a gift. I opened it to have a little smell - sort of woodsy citrusy? Anyway since I don&#x27;t have a beard, I can&#x27;t tell you more. But the recipient&#x27;s beard has seemed particularly glorious lately, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly the best one I have used for keeping my beard soft and clean. I only give 4 stars because it makes my beard really oily therefor I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> So far this stuff is great. I purchased it 1/14/15 and I have only been able to use it once but I loved it. I helped me get rid of those random hairs that would stick straight out. It also has made my beard softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband who&#x27;s had a beard of various styles and lengths for nearly 8 years. His beard hair is very coarse and thick and difficult to manage, but he loves this!!! Will definitely be a return costumer.</li>
            <li> My husband said he does not like the smell.</li>
            <li> The balm has great texture and feels very nice, but the smell is awful. The smell is not strong so I can use it on my beard without having to endure it too much, but I cannot put it on my mustache. I&#x27;m sure it works well, but it&#x27;s not worth the smell.</li>
            <li> works great, my beard is silky and smooth. needs to be sold in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried growing out a beard with and without this balm.  Without I had pretty bad beard itch and my whiskers were still pretty sharp.  This balm almost completely eliminates the itch and greatly softens the beard hairs.  I&#x27;d describe the scent as light and earthy/woodsy; I don&#x27;t find it to be very strong at all.  I haven&#x27;t grown a beard long enough to speak to its styling properties yet (I usually abandon ship after about a month), but it does make the initial growing-in phase a lot less unpleasant.</li>
            <li> great stuff. I am growing out my Moustache and have always had problems with itch. This softened the hairs quickly and was not over oily. It seemed to be a bit seperated/granular when I got it. I followed the instructions and hit is with my wife&#x27;s hair dryer and then put it in the fridge, now its a nice consistancy. It made my short stubbly moustache hairs softer and less bristle like. It does have a smell to it that I cant quite put my finger on but it no not bad in any way and the smell is fairly mild. The can is larger than I anticipated and looks like it will go a LONG way for me, and would last a good while with a beard as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would HIGHLY recommend this Item.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like liquorice. It&#x27;s nice. Makes hair softer.</li>
            <li> Bingo! Love this stuff. Just the right consistency for applying it to my beard without putting on too much.The smell is nice, very subtle and I have a K-9 nose so if I can put this balm in my mustache and not be bothered by it then that&#x27;s saying something. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff and smells good</li>
            <li> Works OK. Very overpriced</li>
            <li> My husband loves how this makes his beard feel soft after a shower and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Has a slightly nutty smell to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. My beard seems to feel softer. I definitely seems to work.</li>
            <li> Amazing and on time delivery great product for great price.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me. It&#x27;s not the greatest smelling balm, but I can&#x27;t smell it 30 seconds after applying it. Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about as far as having trouble washing it off.</li>
            <li> Calms the beard itch, for sure! The scent is very easy-going.</li>
            <li> I realize it doesn&#x27;t show that I purchased this item from Amazon, however a friend of mine ordered it for me off here using their account so I did indeed get it from Amazon. Anyhow, I love this product. I just recently decided to make the jump from having a beard to &amp;#34;growing my beard out&amp;#34; for about 2 years I had a beard grown that I trimmed every other week to keep it at a size 5 on my hair clipper setting. So I made the decision to purchase this product because basically every time I&#x27;d let my beard get longer than a size 5 it would start to get wiry and sort of curly. Basically it would start to look kind of &amp;#34;scraggly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to order this, not only to help tame my beard hairs but also because I thought &amp;#34;well it claims to promote healthier beard growth&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s basically like a win/win situation. Anyway, since day one of using this product I have loved it. It spreads very easily among my beard. It smells not girly in the slightest and the scent fades rather quickly even if you don&#x27;t dig it. The thing I love most about it is it does help manage your beard. Goes on kind of greasy however throughout the day my beard hairs absorb the product so by the end of the day when I feel my beard it feels like there isn&#x27;t any product in it at all. My only gripe about this product is that it does add a shine to your beard. I don&#x27;t really see a perk to having your beard &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; except maybe to draw people&#x27;s gaze to the amazing piece of art on your face known as a beard. You can however tell by my 5 star rating that the shine it produces isn&#x27;t bad enough to dock it a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using about half of this container which seems to last a rather long time, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price paid, I decided to try a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; beard product also in a can known as &amp;#34;Beard Balm&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t know if I am allowed to discuss other products by name? But I just did. Anyway, that product was terrible, it had a disgusting bathroom cleaner antiseptic smell (that lingered for hours) and it made my beard feel very thick and dirty (not &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; in a good way). No matter how little of the that balm that I used it still made my hairs clump together and feel dirty and unlike this balm, at the end of the workday it still felt as dirty and clumpy as it did at the time of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for Honest Amish but I can say without a doubt that as long as I have a beard I will have a tin of Honest Amish in my bathroom. ALSO, just a hint that I learned recently to help manage your beard, after you shower style your beard the way you&#x27;d like it to stay while it&#x27;s still wet and let it dry naturally (if of course you&#x27;ve got like an hour before you need to leave the house). It really works. Then just apply some of this balm (once dry) your good to go. I usually rub two fingers in the balm and then smear it together in my left palm and apply in sections to my beard, takes about 2-3 minutes to work through my entire beard.</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of Jaegermeister.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have tried a number of beard balms over the years and I have found the Honest Amish is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, easy to apply, fragrance is natural and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Itchy beard? Get some of this today!</li>
            <li> Best Stuff Ever for your Beard....LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner for beard with nice aroma.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and I won&#x27;t go near him. Smells awful!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just as advertised, pleasant initial smell that dissipates, controls beard and softens it as well.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with a strong beard wash, this balm is as much as expected, if not more. It is extremely reasonably priced for what you get, and you use very small amounts for a moderate (4-6&amp;#34;) full beard. Personally, I just run what&#x27;s left on my hands through my hair or into my hands. Use as directed and you&#x27;re certain to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple beard conditioners and this one is great.  Works best if used daily.</li>
            <li> I just recently retired from the United States Marine Corps and as most veterans do, I am growing my post service beard. EPIC! Things have been going very well, I get lots of compliments, I love looking at it, and combing it, and washing it, I could actually go on all day about how much I love my beard. Unfortunately this review isn&#x27;t about how awesome my beard is, the focus is on Honest Amish Beard Balm. Ive been researching all these cool ways to maintain your beard and give it the proper moisture, comb it correctly, etc. I wanted to try out a beard comb and a beard oil, because of the reviews this brand came to the top of my list. There were also a few websites that suggested Honest Amish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the size of the container but don&#x27;t worry, I have had this same little guy for over a month and have barely used the top layer. A little bit goes a long way, the moist feeling makes your beard feel so soft and enjoyable (so the ladies say), and I really enjoy the smell. So some said it smells a bit like licorice but I prefer more of a Pine smell. I like it and my lady friends enjoy it as well. Great product, depending on how long I grow this awesome, super sweet, really good looking beard will decide if i buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I read some reviews where people said it was too oily. It looks a little shiny right after putting it on but the shine goes away pretty quickly. It works well if I use it every day. If I stop for a day or two I notice my beard feels scratchy again. Originally I got the wrong order but they were excellent in sending me the right stuff right away.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here. Your doing a disservice to your beard by not having this.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. His beard smelled terrible from work. Sweaty, stinky grossness. This balm has helped take away most of the &amp;#34;been living under a bridge in my shopping cart&amp;#34; smell ... I mean not that there is anything wrong with that. It&#x27;s just not my favorite scent.  Has helped tame the beast as well! Great product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for our son as a last minute stocking stuffer. He absolutely loves it, and will definitely getting more, when he runs out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells nice, keeps my beard and skin conditioned.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, smells, and makes my beard look. Definitely a great purchase for any bearded man out there. I also purchased a beard oil to use whenever I shampoo my beard (about once or twice a week), but on days I don&#x27;t shampoo my beard, I use my beard balm to keep it nice, tame, soft, and smelling like I just rubbed my face against a pine tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Take care of the skin beneath your stache. I found that my skin would get dried out and this stuff really helped. Recommended</li>
            <li> First, I am funny about smell. I generally don&#x27;t want to smell anything. And I  do not like the taste or smell of cloves or licorice. That said, I am addicted to the smell of this product. I don&#x27;t know why, but the smell makes me feel good. It is subtle. My wife had difficulty smelling it after a few hours of application, and she is a super smeller. I wish the odor lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of 53, this is my first beard. I never thought I could stand it. This product is phenomenal. I liked it on the first application. But, the real difference came a week later. My beard became softer and softer. This product is not about hold. It is about softening and conditioning so that hold is not needed. I started my beard 3 months ago. It was scratchy and itchy beyond belief. A co-worker talked about beard balm. I had some jojoba oil that I started rubbing in, and that was an improvement. Next I bought a dollar (from Dollar Tree) tin of cocoanut oil. It also had jojoba oil, but included paraffin and petrolatum. This seemed nice, but everything I touched afterwards became greasy. It was very difficult to wash off my hands. And stray hairs even became more stray. So I ordered Honest Amish Beard Balm from Amazon. This product is the antithesis of greasy. I need not wash my hands after application. This stuff is really good for the skin. I couldn&#x27;t believe now much nicer my fingernails and cuticles became after just one week of beard application. I would use this stuff anywhere on my body. Probably really good for your feet. I use it on my beard more than once a day. I detect no build up. My beard is just soft and clean feeling. I have searched Etsy and Amazon for products that might offer alternative scents. But, I think none of them could probably match the conditioning of all the ingredients in Honest Amish. I highly recommend it. I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but I felt compelled to share the joy I am experiencing. Get you some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, only one. The product is gritty in the can. Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying. Otherwise, you may be combing out little nuggets of product.is gritty in the can. Solution, make sure you give a few seconds of rubbing in hands to totally liquify before applying.

            <li> Bought this for my husband...he says, &amp;#34;leaves my beard more shiny and manageable...there is a mild, not overwhelming scent and is easy to use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will purchase this over and over again!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of beard products this one is by far the best.  It leaves hair soft and helps straighten my hair some.</li>
            <li> It reduces itch, makes my beard softer and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. You only need a little dab and it works great to make your beard smooth. Also really helps a lot with the itch when the beard is just beginning to grow. A little goes a long way so this tin can last months.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps keep my beard soft and less frizzy during the day.  I use the balm during the day and the oil at night.  If I miss a day or two the difference is incredible. Using this product helps me maintain my beard.  A man without a beard is like a lion without a mane.</li>
            <li> Another Christmas hit.  My son loves this.  And his beard really feels much softer.</li>
            <li> could be thicker paste somewhat liquidly when applying by hand</li>
            <li> Making my beard nice and soft, what&#x27;s to hate?</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the initial results. I&#x27;ve been using Honest Amish Beard Balm for the past couple of weeks. It definitely has made my beard softer and eliminated much of the itchiness that I&#x27;ve had as it&#x27;s been growing in. It has a faint scent of licorice but it isn&#x27;t noticeable after a few minutes. Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> The scent is, for me, unbearable.</li>
            <li> It reduces skin and beard dryness. Also, helps with beardruff, but you have to you it fairly regularly. Although it&#x27;s a small tin, it lasts quite a while because of the small amount needed each use. If you have thicker hair, go with the heavy duty beard balm.</li>
            <li> I have no beard too, although it&#x27;s what I wanted. I bought it the cream to help me growing a beard. I&#x27;m not sure if it worked or not,but I&#x27;m sure after use and a complete shave the beard grew much faster. It did not grow a beard where none existed before. But the beard grew faster. I like the scent too.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Makes my beard glisten and smells fantastic. Hand made quality products from Amish country. Have yet to try their other products</li>
            <li> has a nice scent and is very easy to apply but as far as conditioning and didnt see much difference with my beard but I have only been using it 3 weeks now..time will tell CHECK OUT THERE BEARD WAX ITS GREAT !!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my beard oil to arrive and I am excited to put it on everyday. The container is very small but a little bit of oil does go a long way. Im curious to see how long exactly this batch will last me and I will be sure to post about it here for any future buyers. Don&#x27;t expect this product to work as a gel or styling oil, that really isn&#x27;t the purpose. What you get from this is a soft and moisturized feeling in your beard which was such a relief for me. The ladies were starting to complain so I had to make a minor change. The oil has a light smell to it that i actually enjoy, and I think my lady friend did as well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff can put a whoopin&#x27; on even the toughest beard. It really does work. Softens, untangles and tames roque whiskers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who refused to shave the beard, So I figured if I can&#x27;t beat him join him. He absolutely loves it and it does make his beard a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Great beard care product ... wont use anything else</li>
            <li> So I bought this despite the mixed reviews I read about it being greasy and a waste of money. The fragrance is nice, but it really doesn&#x27;t condition my beard. The oils don&#x27;t really seem to be absorbed by the hair. It just kind of sits on the hair. It&#x27;s greasy for sure and I honestly get better results using my Mane-n-Tale conditioner as a leave-in on my beard. So now I am debating on if I want to bother with sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he says it helps control unruly hair. It also helps when he trims his beard.</li>
            <li> Very nice helps my beard feel smooth and helps soften it. I think it smells good my wife likes it too. But subtle.</li>
            <li> Very scented not as manageable as desired.</li>
            <li> A little too greasy for my taste.  Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I&#x27;m leaving stains on the pillow case</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about growing a beard without this.  Not sure why people have complained about the smell, as this stuff smells great.  Goes on great after a shower, or later in the day when things are getting a little frazzled.  Helps curb the itch when you&#x27;re initially growing your beard too.  Seriously this is an everyday (sometimes more than once a day) application for me.</li>
            <li> Bought both heavy duty and regular and love them both. Heavy duty works better on my beard. Love the feel it gives, although doesn&#x27;t provide much hold for rogue hairs...</li>
            <li> I just bought this and it works great on my beard. I never used beard balm before but I will be a repeat customer. My beard is a bit curly and this seems to hold it all day in a more relaxed way.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s an organic product so it comes sort of like a buttery concoction that you have to work in between your hands before you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that a tin doesn&#x27;t last a long time for me. Since it is a more solid product, I feel like you get lesser coverage than other products that are more liquid.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have previously tried to grow a beard, and decided to trim and shave my whiskers because of the dreaded beard itch. I tend to have dry skin problems in the winter, and while I&#x27;ve always wanted to grow my beard during this time of year, it also tends to dry my face. After browsing a few beard forums and seeing this product mentioned a few times, I decided to wander over to Amazon and purchase this beard balm. I now use it daily. It has made my beard very soft and manageable, while taming some of the stray whiskers that tend to stick straight out rather than fall with the flow of my beard. If the right amount is used, then it will present a nice softness to the skin that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL - I have seen mention of a smell in some reviews of this product. While it certainly does have a unique smell to it, the smell is natural. My nose doesn&#x27;t detect any sort of artificial fragrance, and the smell seems all natural. If you are familiar with the smell of Cocoa Butter, then you will instantly be able to pick it up. It was definitely the main scent that I could detect. My wife cannot smell any distinct scent, even when her nose is touching my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SIZE - Be warned, you may be disappointed in the size of this product when it arrives at your door. While I was certainly surprised, I can say that a little bit of this product really does go a long way, and it really does help with growth and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS - Attached is a photo of the amount that I use. It is plenty to allow for entire beard coverage, while any remaining balm I have left, I apply to the rest of my face to prevent any dryness. The excess balm works great to hydrate and protect skin all day! Simply take a small amount with your finger tip, and rub well in between your hands. The paste will melt down into the consistency of an oil, and spread evenly throughout your beard. If too much of the balm is used, it will leave the beard looking slightly oily and over-conditioned in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing how much this product has helped maintain my beard, I am interested in trying some other products from the company! The quality is great!oking slightly oily and over-conditioned in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing how much this product has helped maintain my beard, I am interested in trying some other products from the company! The quality is great!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel nice and friendly smells good too</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.... I on the other hand, find it smells funny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell. Really easy to use</li>
            <li> Not as good as the heavy duty version.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure magic, my beard is so much softer already. Its also very easy to work with. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and keeps my skin from drying out and keeps the beard looking it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now. So far, I am very pleased with the results. My beard is not overly long. It&#x27;s a little over 1&amp;#34; but, it&#x27;s very thick. This has just the right amount of hold to let me style it like I want. The scent is not my favorite. But, it is not bad and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be a staple in my normal beard care routine and I&#x27;ll most likely get some of the heavy duty balm when my beard gets a little longer and needs some more hold.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish are the best, face products for men you will find. Their customer service is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Nice mild aroma that dissipates in an hour. Small tin, but should last 2-3 months.  Well worth it.I use it after I shower/wash my beard. Keeps it soft and not greasy. For those who complain that it is not wax and fails to melt on contact: Patience, grasshopper! Give it a chance to melt on your fingers for a few seconds before rubbing it into your beard.</li>
            <li> very strong musky smell - but works great!</li>
            <li> Really is fantastic. Smells great, and softens up your beard. Thank you for the stellar product!</li>
            <li> I am not one to buy into cosmetic products nor trendy things like this.  I bought this on recommendation from a friend and I have to say I love it.  I have a very curly and wiry beard, this product makes it soft, smooth and supple.  It tames the face bush and eliminates the itch. I use it every day now and won&#x27;t go back to an un-balmed beard.  Are other products better?  I have no idea but this one works great and the smell is subtle yet enigmatic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I grew my first beard starting this November, and it took care of the itching and it did make the beard much softer as it was growing in.</li>
            <li> I was an on again off again beard grower for years until now. I&#x27;ve been using this for twenty one days and my beard is great to the point where people are starting to think they havent seen me for months. Same beard, been trimming it the same for about 4 months now but this balm has started to give the beard a more full look and shine to it. The can is small but in three weeks I still have about 3/4th the can, I use it every night. I love the smell. The girl friend likes it (I think she would like it more if I did not force her to smell it when I get out of the shower.), the dog loves it he trys to lick it when im not paying attention. ordering more just so I can have a reserve. I would describe the smell as slightly rugged, the smell is not for sissys like those who hose themselves down with axe body spray. Well worth the money for a first time buy.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and works, but is not good for sensitive skin.  Caused burning, redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and really can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in my beard. I&#x27;ve seen videos on YouTube and read great reviews about it, but for the short time being, I must say I&#x27;m really liking it alot!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the beard is happy</li>
            <li> I love it! I was using normal conditioner before, but after having used this I will never go back. It doesn&#x27;t do a lot for control, but definitely improves the texture of the beard. I read some comments about the smell, but it does not bother me at all. Arrived fast with good packing. Definitely going to order again.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Makes beard hair soft and keeps the hairs under control when beard is really long. Washes out no problem.</li>
            <li> Fine product but the scent is something that needs to be worked on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so not sure how this would work for me. Well, after a couple of weeks my skin is actually clearer. I love it and highly recommend it. I know there are some sissy&#x27;s saying the smell is too strong. If they are not man enough to handle the smell, then they are not man enough to have a beard. I got the beard soap from H.A. yesterday and can&#x27;t wait to use it. Next I&#x27;m gonna try the heavy duty beard balm, heard great things about it. My only problem was the tin was dented on both sides, which makes it harder to screw back on. That kinda sucked, but still get 5 stars out of me. Hopefully this helps for people like me who have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Suddenly I am a lumbersexual after 35  years of trimming a beard. Well, okay then, let&#x27;s try putting some oily stuff that smells like tea ( according to a surprised co-worker). It feels like gritty wax that melts into perfumed oil in your hands as you rub them together and to then rub them into your beard. At first oily and shiny, the next day the beard feels soft and springy and stays that way until you re-apply the balm. I expect the little tin will last a few months of twice weekly applications (maybe three times) and then I&#x27;ll see how I feel after its been gone for a while. A nice experiment, this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this lumberjack fashion will sink out of sight before then and I will return to my preferred mode of disinterested determined fashion denier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Awesome.  For the first time in my life I have actually been able to grow my Beard out.  Previously I find myself trimming around a week in due to the itching and uncomfortableness (yeah I know that&#x27;s probably not a word, so what)  This product delivers.  It is Awesome, and I have actually talked friends of mine into purchasing some, and every one of them agree.  This stuff works.</li>
            <li> A good product, you have to work it between your fingers to break it down to a oil/lotion consistency as it is a bit clumpy at first. Put it on when your beard is still damp from the shower as this is best, work it through then rub with towel. The only issue I had was I had to be careful cleaning your hands afterwords as I found out when touched around my eye hours later and it was mildly irritating to my eyes. The rest was great, delivered fast and fulfilled its promise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great! It gets quite addicting to put on your facial hair and face due to the fantastic smell. The one question I have though is in regards to it&#x27;s consistancy. It comes as a solid balm that you are supposed to rub into your hands and then apply to your facial hair. I currently have the Honest Amish Bread Oil as well, and I noticed that once you rub the Beard Balm into your hands that it basically turns into the liquified Beard Oil. They both smell exactly the same and achieve the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these products are fantastic, I just wonder what the true diffrence is between both the Beard Balm and the Beard Oil.</li>
            <li> Great natural product. My tin was dented and it was for gift so it was a little disappointing</li>
            <li> If your beard is turning into steel wool, this is what you need. This is definitely the most moisturizing beard product I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s noticeably more effective if you use it once you get out of the shower, while your beard is still wet. It will look and feel healthier instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent won&#x27;t please everyone. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m looking for in a beard oil. Thankfully it&#x27;s not particularly potent--unless someone else is within inches of your beard, you&#x27;re likely to be the only one to notice. If you want an idea of what it smells like, go to the spice aisle at the store and open a jar of Chinese Five-Spice (think clove and anise). This is exactly what it smells like. My brain associates this scent with stir fry. I don&#x27;t want to smell stir fry all day. When I&#x27;m ordering my third can I&#x27;ll be getting the unscented, melting it, and adding a few of my own essential oils to craft my own scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Honest Amish Beard Balm for over a year now, and it makes the difference between my growing a &amp;#34;homeless beard&amp;#34; or a fluffy beard that has a character all its own. In fact, I recently shaved, and now all my friends are begging me to grow the beard back. They love it. I get the fun of sharing the secret of Honest Amish with all my bearded friends, but my baby-faced friends just know that my beard works and theirs don&#x27;t. My wife especially loves the fluffiness.</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended this product and I think him everyday. I use this in combination with the Leven Rose Beard Oil and my beard is soft and scratch free. You have to give this product a try. I was a bit concerned by some reviews discussing the smell but I have to say I cannot go a day without it now.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. I bought it once as a stocking stuffer and now it&#x27;s his brand. He uses it after he showers and it&#x27;s really made his beard and stache softer, plus I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Don&#x27;t need to use a lot which helps make the balm last forever. Great consistency as well. Really softened up my beard.</li>
            <li> Made my beard grow faster, thicker, stronger. Thanks Amish</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I hate it but I don&#x27;t love it either. I&#x27;m not fond of the scent and it hasn&#x27;t really softened my husband&#x27;s beard but the shine is very nice and it has not given him any bumps.</li>
            <li> Keeps wild beard in place</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on October 24, 2014 and honestly could not be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a long beard (relatively, about six inches from chin to tip). It&#x27;s thick and the sides can be extremely unruly. Like most beardsmen (and anyone who knows a little bit about hair at all), I do not wash my beard every day, as doing so strips it of all of the natural oils which can lead to a dry, wiry, and coarse beard, which nobody wants. However, my face under the beard is prone to become extremely dry and even painful after a day of not washing it. The dandruff that would come out of my beard by the second day would rival Buffalo, NY&#x27;s snow storms. Hence my reason for purchasing this particular beard balm. No beard oil I have ever purchased did anything to subdue the terribly itchy, dry, flaky skin under my magnificent face fur. I would even get particular patches on my chin where I could almost peel the dry skin off in one big piece. Gross, I know, but bear with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Honest Amish beard balm for almost a month now and the difference is incredible.Though the flaky skin has not been entirely eliminated, my face is not itchy, or painful at all. The dry patch I spoke of before is totally gone. For the sake of testing, I have gone an entire week without washing my beard and only using the beard balm. The flaky skin never got any worse. It&#x27;s very mild and extremely manageable with just a bit of brushing. So, in short, this balm has helped my dry and flaky chin skin significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said before, my beard is naturally soft. But with this beard balm, it&#x27;s nearly as soft as the hair on my head, which is just remarkable. There&#x27;s basically no difference in softness if I run my hand from the side of my head, down my sideburns, into my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, to address the previous issues with the smell and feel. The first time I used it, I used way too much and my beard was greasy. However, I discovered that for mysize of beard, I need less than a fingertip&#x27;s worth of balm to work through and condition my entire beard. A little goes a very long way. When using just the amount I need, there is no greasy feel. Also, it helps to actually massage it in, as per the instructions. The beard absorbs the balm very well. And for the smell, it does not smell like licorice. I suppose to the untrained nose with no other reference to go by, licorice could be the most accurate description, but I assure you, anise is not the primary smell. It smells wonderful and it wears off after awhile (or perhaps my nose just gets used to it). It&#x27;s more of a woodsy, slightly smoky smell with a hint of anise, if anything at all. I rather enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will continue buying this product as long as I have a beard (or, forever). I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a better product for their beard and for a solution to dry skin. This stuff is the full monty, worth every penny. Do not hesitate to make the purchase. For you, and for your beard.</li>
            <li> He uses it all the time</li>
            <li> I really like this beard balm! This has been the single best product that I&#x27;ve used for my beard that produced the best results.</li>
            <li> Product was for my son - he loves it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but there are two things to know;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) less is more, use too much and your beard is an oily mess, overly saturated and gross.&lt;br /&gt;2) The container will go relatively quickly if applied daily, but it smells great and is easy to apply, unlike the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I would need to buy more if I still had a beard, damn job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and it gives my beard a nice shine. I would advised anyone to get it.</li>
            <li> This product helped improve my sex life. How may you ask? Well i&#x27;ve always had facial hair and it really didnt cause a problem, but since using Honest Amish Beard Balm my moustache has gotten softer and my girlfriend loves it. In just a short time my folicles have grown much softer and thesmell is both manly and pleasent. I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in he skin around my moustache as well. Fantastic product, i will be purchasing again when i&#x27;m running low</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse, wiry beard and nothing I&#x27;ve used has been able to get it under control. I&#x27;ve tried various conditioners and oils and nothing has worked to my satisfaction. Its always been difficult to manage so I&#x27;ve refrained from letting it grow out much.  But after using the balm I noticed an immediate difference and I&#x27;ve been able to let my beard grow out without it becoming unmanageable. It softened and shined my beard, as well as helped me shape it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and its just getting better. It did take some time to get used to the scent. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but because its just below your nose you can always smell it.  I have recently ordered the Extra Grit Beard Wax to see if it will help manage my beard even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet. I keep a pretty short beard, which is always at the stage of being ultra itchy. I have used many different products, including most oils on the market. This is by far the best product on the market. It smells great; It is easy to apply with no messy, oily fingers afterwards; It lasts a long time in the beard itself, even after a shower; You don&#x27;t need a lot of the balm to apply to your beard; And it makes my beard super soft. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. Smell is unique. Minty oatmeal? For me it&#x27;s making a huge difference. A note... Use this when your beard is still wet from a shower or just soak your beard a little first. I don&#x27;t like the smell very much but the conditioning works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I bowl shave using Taylor of Old Bond Street &amp; a Gilette Fatboy from the 50&#x27;s. I wash the soap out of my bear where it&#x27;s gotten in there from the brush. But without the balm, I&#x27;ll still get flakes here and there because I didn&#x27;t get it all out. The balm is magic. No flaking. Calms down the wiry hair around the edges, smells pretty good (I&#x27;ve grown to like it), and really enjoy using it when I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li> I rotate a few products but use this several times a week. I put off buying this for a while due to the consistent comments about the &amp;#34;licorice smell&amp;#34;, which I don&#x27;t care for. I&#x27;m not getting that at all. I smell cardamom... maybe some clove. It&#x27;s a good smell that doesn&#x27;t offend and isn&#x27;t perfumey at all. It helps my beard stay soft and lay down just a little but has no hold quality. I wish I would have had this to get me through the itchy phase way back when I grew it. I&#x27;ll buy this again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend thinks it smells funny so he didn&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Hydrates my beard and gives it a nice healthy feeling. Only downside is the overpowering anise smell.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend to use on my first-ever beard (bucket-list decision after 70 years), I followed instructions (massage into damp beard after shower) and went for dinner with family.  There two folks commented how nice/trim my new beard looked (after several scraggly months) -- clearly attributable to Honest Amish.  Smells nice, makes beard softer, fewer stray hairs sticking out -- altogether wonderful product.  Strongly recommended, even for beard newbies like myself.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unpleasant, particularly to my girlfriend, rendering the product useless (or worse) to me.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell but love the texture and feeling after applied</li>
            <li> My man loves this stuff and I do too! Makes his otherwise scruffy red Nord. beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Much better than the highly rated oils on Amazon. If smelling like an Amish is wrong than I don&#x27;t want to be right! It barely has a smell, it has a hint of natural smell. Smells just fine. I once had a one night stand with an Amish girl...  she never expected me to call her back.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes this beard balm.  He said it smells good, it keeps his beard nice and manageable.</li>
            <li> not that great. wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff, use it daily to soften and moisturize my beard.  The wife even uses it to help with her psoriasis.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchasing for the boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my beard and mustache look and feel.....smells great..</li>
            <li> My first beard balm and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.  My only cons with it would be the smell and how shiny it gets even if you put on a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless great product and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few beard balms and oils, this stuff is still my go to. Every single time I come back to this.</li>
            <li> I am currently involved in a beard growing contest with myself. Prior to purchasing this product I was losing because my beard more resembled that of a homeless person rather than sophisticated bourgeois. I purchased this product and upon first use I knew that I would clench the title. When I rubbed the material between my hands it went from a solid state that resembled wet sand to a semi-liquid cream. Once I applied it to my disheveled beard I knew right away that things were going to start looking up for me. The smell resembles the supplements isle of a health foods store, but I imagine that is because it is organic. Not a bad smell really and not overpowering. I consider my sense of smell to be my strength and I wasn&#x27;t bad, in fact my wife enjoys it and seems to have laid off the&amp;#34;You need to trim that disgusting beard!&amp;#34; conversation. That&#x27;s when my luck began to turn. I won $7 playing powerball, got that promotion at work that I was already given, found out that my car can run WELL below the &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; mark without refilling and got two sodas out of the machine when I had only paid for one (albeit both were lemonade when I pushed the Dr. Pepper button but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your luck will turn around with this product and you may be just as fortunate as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Given the cold weather we&#x27;ve been having recently I decided to I needed to do something for my under-beard dry skin. I chose Honest Amish and after a week of use I&#x27;ve been wondering why I took so long to start using a beard balm. It&#x27;s easy to apply, has an innocuous yet pleasant scent and keeps my beard in great condition. The dry skin/dandruff is gone and my beard feels a lot more smooth than before. 10/10 - would buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently received my balm and the wife and I love it.  I am using it with a beard oil to moisturize skin and control the bush.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful stuff. I was recommended Honest Amish by a friend of mine and after much debating I took the plunge. Besides what&#x27;s the worst that could happen? I use a tin and if I don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;ll never buy it again. Pretty simple. Now, however, you&#x27;ll never see my bathroom without a tin of this balm!!! First off, the scent is wonderful! Light, yet woodsy but definitely not a strong odor at all, pleasant would be the best way to describe it. Second, it really does condition your hair, and even more, your skin. For about the first week I was very skeptical. I wasn&#x27;t amazed, or wowed, I didn&#x27;t really notice any changes right away honestly. I&#x27;d apply at night. leave in, and my beard looked like....my beard. However, after about two solid weeks of nightly application I noticed how much thicker my beard looked from photos I had taken of myself the week before,(yes they were selfies, ohh the vanity). Mind you, my beard didn&#x27;t grow new hair, that&#x27;s up to genetics, but just like healthy head hair looks thick and voluminous even if it&#x27;s less than that, beards are the same. My beard looked healthy, thick, and brimming with pride! My skin is soft all over and under my beard, my beard is soft, easy to maintain, and very healthy looking. This product does work. I&#x27;ve been using the same tin for a solid near two months and I am a believer! Just a simple addition to my nightly routine and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results. If you&#x27;re unsure at first, give this product some time to work its nourishing magic. You&#x27;ll definitely appreciate this product, I can guarantee it!</li>
            <li> On time and a nice product! My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and very easy to use. An added bonus is that my wife loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Only started using it, but I love the smell and how it helps the hair lay down.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price. Keeps the beard soft and clean looking throughout the day.</li>
            <li> definitely softens your beard, shines a little more that I would like, actually got accused of glitter in my beard once.</li>
            <li> My beard is very coarse, and Honest Amish really did the trick. After using the product my beard responded to a brush for the first time. It soften the hair and made it lay down. the more I used the better it got. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a friend who was growing his beard. I really like this product. It helps with the itchiness of longer facial hair. Also it makes your skin and the hair itself nice and soft. It even has a welcome smell!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner, keeps your beard manageable at the cost of smelling like an unscented candle. Wish they would add a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my rough beard feeling soft and smooth.  There was a noticeable difference after the first couple applications.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Does what it says. Has a unique aroma. It does tame my beautiful beard.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!  Use this product daily and would highly recommend!  Has a nice woodsy/licorice smell that&#x27;s not too overpowering.  I will be purchasing this same product when I run out!</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, the product does work very well!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Wife hates the smell, does help with irritation under the fur. Not sure I will buy again. Use too much and it leaves the beard greasy, but any less and it doesn&#x27;t cover the whole beard. So I only use it couples times a week.</li>
            <li> Order this product in the winter, or a week your sure it&#x27;s going to be cool.  I ordered in Summer and got a melted mess that didn&#x27;t congeal back right.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I use it daily no matter the situation. My beard is getting quite long so I will probably move up to the heavy duty in the near future but this stuff does amazing things to my face. Highly recommended to anyone with a beard!</li>
            <li> So after I opened the can of &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; that turned out to be liquid oil that spilled on the front of my shirt, I noticed a pink slip of paper inside the bag the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; came in.  This paper had a warning about how if it was hot outside when the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; shipped it may be liquid and should be cooled before use.  Ok.  I did that.  Now the &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; has granules in it and is not smooth at all.  It is hard to apply and I have to comb the granules out after each use but does keep my woolly beard from being too woolly.  It does not, however, make it soft at all.  The scent is pleasing to me and my wife can take it or leave it.  I wish I could have some of this that was never too hot. I think if you order this in the middle of winter it may be OK.  If you order it in August in Arkansas you will have a mess on your hands when you get.</li>
            <li> It does keep your beard looking more professional. My wife and kids love the smell. I havent noticed any other benefits of using this product though.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is helping to keep the hair in check, and not stick straight out from my face, but this does help to keep the  hair soft.  Its got a pretty good smell.  A little sweet, a little woody.  Not too musky nor feminine.  Its a little waxy when it first goes on, but dries a bit over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> There are good things to put in your beard, and there is this. Does my beard feel softer? Absolutely. Is my beard shinier than it was before? No doubt.    Does the shine come at a cost? Yes. The first issue is the &#x27;balm&#x27;. It&#x27;s just oily. They put a lot of oils in it, so go figure. I expect a conditioner I put in my beard to be absorbed by my beard, not fun all day. It&#x27;s a good thing I carry a handkerchief, because I&#x27;m going to need it with this product all day long. I even tried wiping it off my beard, no luck. This is a concern because what man doesn&#x27;t stroke his beard? You can&#x27;t not touch your beard. When you think real hard, when you think real soft, and even when you&#x27;re not thinking at all! Secondary to me stroking my beard is a significant other being touched by my beard when I give them a kiss and leaving them with greasy skin. That&#x27;s a sure way to get me sent to the shower to clean it off.    At 80 degrees this is a liquid that has a thinner consistency than honey at the same temperature. Since I keep my honey at room temperature, I can make this comparison. I suppose it could use a higher beeswax content. I have Firehouse Moustache Wax, live in the high desert, and that stays fairly firm even though I keep it in my pocket all day during the summer.    The smell. Some people have likened it to Anice (Licorice). That was my first impression. Until about 10 minutes later. Now it smells like the fish cleaning table at the lake. Not rotten, not rancid, just like fresh fish out of the lake being cleaned and gutted. It&#x27;s not a terribly bad smell, I enjoy fishing, but it&#x27;s not a smell I want to follow me for the first hour or two of my day.    So, it&#x27;s too greasy for a conditioner (I expected more of a lotion than an oil), and the smell is just unpleasant. If the choice is between the smell of beeswax and licorice, please choose to make your product not smell like licorice.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps beard soft and shinny !</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME! Just began growing another beard bout one month ago, this conditioner smells great and really prevents the intense itching that has stopped me before! This balm will enable me to grow the beard I&#x27;ve always wanted!!!</li>
            <li> Honest Amish Beard Balm is a good beard care product. I have been using it for about 2 months, 3 times a week. It has a decent smell that I would describe as pleasant and leaning toward a cocoa butter flavor. My beard is about 2\\&quot; long, coarse and tangly. When I apply Amish Balm it does a noticeable good job in smoothing out my beard and allowing my beard comb to pass through nicely. It also helps me mold my beard into more of a V-shape rather then a fat H-shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again for a couple of reasons. First, when it arrived it had a completely different chemistry then it does today. When I first opened the container the oil had separated from the cream which gave the product the consistency of grits. I&#x27;m not sure if this is how it was meant to be but in that form it was gross to look at, gross to touch and the oils dripped down my fingers like melted butter. Over time, the formula has congealed into the more common \\&quot;wax\\&quot; form that you see in their other products. It is much nicer to look at and apply when it is solid like this. Second, in either form (oil or solid) the product will coat your fingers and washing does not really get it off right away. I&#x27;m sure it is good for your hands but it is still pretty messy. Also, once you have it on your fingers and get any on the container, it is IMPOSSIBLE to open the container again because it is so slippery. The packaging could of used a little more thought put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I like Amish Beard Balm pretty good but its changing chemistry and messiness will most likely keep me from buying it again. The frustration at trying to manipulate the container when your hands are slippery from applying the balm is also a lower rung reason why I would reconsider my purchase. Although it does not smell bad, it does not smell AWESOME either. And you could probably achieve the same results with a good store bought conditioner (with a smell you really like) without the messiness.ness.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! My fiance loves it! it conditions the beard without irritating the skin and helps your beard grow! I recomend this to beard lovers!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my beard soft.  My wwife loves to play with my beard now.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The customer service as well as the product itself is outstanding, and my beard has never felt softer. Thanks Again!</li>
            <li> I bought a can of this and loved it. Added a little bit of hold and made my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff really conditions my beard.  You have to make sure that you don&#x27;t use too much, as it can become a little too greasy should you put too much in.  But WOW, does it work.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have tried other beard leave-in conditioners and this one works the best. I would highly recommend this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Really like this balm.  Have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how well this product works or not because as soon as I put it on my beard, the smell was so terrible I washed it off.  Such smell may be appealing to others, but it definitely was not to me.</li>
            <li> Man o&#x27; man, is this something here! For anyone one out there growing a serious beard, and I mean a SERIOUS beard, this is the elixir to facilitate just that! Makes your beard soft in a hurry, which is good for the lady folk!</li>
            <li> Does not irritate the skin, smells great, feels even better. I only wish there were more of this. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. I predict at least a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this helps my beard.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Other reviews are right - this stuff does smell kinda strange. Sort of an old-timey medicine/licorice thing. But, that it really a minor drawback to this awesome, funky product. I&#x27;ve got a close trimmed beard (its an actual beard, not one of those &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t shave for few days&amp;#34; things) and beardruff has always been a problem. I even use a beard wash, but still, flaky white stuff. No more!!! My beard was super soft with just one use and the flakes are totally gone. I will be using this forever.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Apply after shower and gives a great, soft feeling for beard entire day. Even next day you are still OK. I apply it once in every two days, so it works great.&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it is a bit too scented. I would try to reduce the smell if I were to advise producers.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product for the last week and so far it seems to be helping to soften my beard.  I expected quicker results but I can afford to be patient.  My beard is not going anywhere.  I received the product in the time frame promised.  I rather like the packaging.  I a civil war reactor and it will not standout from a distance if someone sees me using it in the morning after I dunk my face in a bucket of water.</li>
            <li> Nice Valentine&#x27;s gift for my husband. He loves it. Makes his beard so soft.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell, non-greasy, and leaves your beard silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Hubby loved it!! Perfect! Gonna get the rest of the products in the line! Also, side note, when u open up and look at the actual product in the can, it looks curdled. Like u know how dairy does if u boil it. But once u grab some in ur hand and rub it around it blends together. No big deal, just don&#x27;t be caught off guard. Ur product isn&#x27;t bad, that&#x27;s just the way it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the last week and can already feel the difference in the softness and manageability of my beard.  I noticed the smell when I first starting use it, it wasn&#x27;t bad - just noticeable.  I like the smell and enjoy the soothing comfort both my beard and face feel.  I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> My beard is not instantly soft.  But I do not have anything to compare to.  It feels a lot like the wax you rub into your hair similar to spiker gel.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but it&#x27;s like grits you have up rub into grease before you put it in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the way this smelled.</li>
            <li> Very nice, natural product.&lt;br /&gt;Natural beard products are difficult to find - Honest Amish tops the list.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well - even easier to use on daily basis than the beard wax.&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky or heavy but gives beard a nice feel, texture and conditioning for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Works great, I notice a big difference in the smoothness and softness in my beard when I use this balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions, as you may need to remelt the conditioner if the oils have separated. I found the easiest way to be to ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Boil some water.&lt;br /&gt;B. Place the tin in a shallow bowl.&lt;br /&gt;C. Pour the boiling water in the bowl up to the height of the lid of the tin.&lt;br /&gt;D. Wait a few minutes, then use a tooth pick or a skewer to stir up the oils&lt;br /&gt;E. Allow the balm to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had to do this two times in the few months that I&#x27;ve had this product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and container tells you to be careful because it may have turned into a liquid state if it was too hot. Well it was too hot when it was delivered, but luckily they warned me before opening so I did not spill it all. After letting it cool, it returned to normal and works great. Recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. The smell alone is AMAZING. I have tried other products for my beard and this one is the easiest and most comfortable of all. I have been using it for a few weeks and it really makes my beard look and feel fuller and shinier! My skin as well has been affected by the product, I no longer have any itching from new growth or stiff wirey hairs! Plus my wife even loves it! and thats saying a lot since I have a 4 month untrimmed beard. The balm starts as a semi solid substance and quickly turns to an oil after rubbing in your hands. Like I said, its very easy to use and it feels and smells wonderful, many of my friends now want this product and i will deffinatly be purchasing more in the future! THANK YOU HONEST AMISH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-GEOFF</li>
            <li> Works very well with sensitive skin to boot!</li>
            <li> It does what it says.</li>
            <li> I just started growing my first beard this winter and realized as it grew that I would like to maitain it a bit. I looked around on amazon a bit and this one really stood out to me and seemed to have a good reputation. I am happy to say now, that I see why. It works great, smells great and I really like knowing just what exactly I&#x27;m putting on my face. Excellent job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding. Ive tried other oils and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and he loves it!  It&#x27;s a great leave-in conditioner for him, and I love the smell! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Stopped the dandruff, itching, and hair falling out.  Do yourself and your beard a favor and go ahead with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I will be a customer for life! This product is great and tames my beard like a champ.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because Is facial hair was so prickly. I have noticed a significant difference since he started using this balm. So much softer!! Also he says that it is easier to manage his beard now. Hairs are not stick out all over!!</li>
            <li> Like G.Scott Parkinson says in the other comments, put it in the sun for a day and it was great right after it cooled down and solidified a little. The next day was good as well. The third day it went somewhat bumpy, sort of like beads. The 4th day the product became unusable and left little ball like piece everywhere in my beard. I ended up just washing it out. So unless you have a hotplate on your vanity to set this on I would stay away. Also I live in Arizona and I never have my house below 72 degrees so for it to separate like it does is strange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. The tin arrived really dented on the bottom (almost crushed) but still sealed so not a big deal. It does make my beard softer, but that&#x27;s almost worse since now it&#x27;s kinda frizzy and little too &amp;#34;full bodied&amp;#34; when I did want some control. I&#x27;m contemplating trying the Heavy Duty Beard Balm instead since it sounds like it has better control. I&#x27;m not ready to go full on wax though cuz I&#x27;m not a fan of how it looks/feels but my beard is really curly so I need something more than what this has to offer. I think if my beard hair was straight this would probably work well. I do like the smell.</li>
            <li> Good balm that tamed my beard.  However, it has more of a scent than expected and  did not dissipate as quickly as hoped.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price. The balm is very pleasant smelling and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stick around all day. If be overwhelmed if it did. Perfect for the Beard. The natural oils and butters tend to melt very quickly so makw sure its sealed tightly if you&#x27;re traveling. A little goes a long way with this so it will last me a while, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the content but it seems good for beard . It regulates the shape of the beard.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this so I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought this. Works great on my beard, leaves it soft an smooth. Me being a black male my beard is curly an sometimes dry. The beard balm helps soften an lays my hairs down, can get greasy if you use too much so you only need a dab. I&#x27;d say about a dime sized amount should be more than enough. I really love this stuff! Now on to the smell, a lot of poster&#x27;s say it&#x27;s bad an stinks or whatever but not so to me. It&#x27;s more of Jager smell (you know the liquor), sweet an lemony with a hint of spice. But don&#x27;t be fooled it is manly.This is one of my beard products will be using for life! Thanks for reading. Now go get you some...</li>
            <li> Like others who have reviewed this product my biggest complaint is the smell. It works great and is easy to apply. Lately I have been blending it with some of my other beards oils to help with the smell. This seems to keep my beard softer and longer than regular beard oil alone does. The tin that it comes in is pretty cool too. Overall I like the product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> 5 star rating on this product. Goes back to the old days when everyone wore beards.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it&#x27;s advertised. I used beard soap, oil for the skin, and this. At first it looked like an awfully small can but after using it I&#x27;ve realized that it&#x27;ll last me quite a while because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to work!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> My son in law uses this stuff.  Beards!  He will want the pipe and hat next.</li>
            <li> This product does what it states in it&#x27;s description. It has &amp;#34;softened&amp;#34; my beard slightly but not to the point of amazement. It has helped with the dry skin under my beard that I was experiencing. It helps keep my beard in shape and keeps the wild hairs down. The only downfall to this and this is why I gave it 4 stars is the odor. It can be quite distracting and if you wear cologne it will cause a mixture of overwhelming sense of smell. I wish they could tame the strong smell and it would be a definite hit for me. Other products I have tired have returned similar results. If you can get past the odor then you will love this product.</li>
            <li> excellent product. softens my beard and makes it more manageable. I ordered this a couple times and will order again.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is right for you, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  If you use this, and none of the reviews mentioned this for me, but it will leave a sheen on your beard.  If you stroke your beard after using this, it will leave a greasy residue on your hands after.  I like the feel of my beard, and stroke it all day, so the sheen was annoying to me.  and it did not make my beard lay flat.  I bought a close bristled brush.  This one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HJM1Q/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 , and it did more to lay my errant beard hairs down than this product.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot, but watch out, because it&#x27;s REALLY oily, so if you can&#x27;t wash your hands right after applying it, you&#x27;ll end up destroying everything you touch. That said, it is a very nice beard conditioner/controller with a lovely scent and shine. I alternate between this and Bluebeard&#x27;s Beard Saver, which is much less greasy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this around 12:30 on a Friday night. It was in my mailbox Monday. I only paid for a 3-5 bus day drlivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be working well for me. It feels like it adds volume to my beard and isn&#x27;t greasy. I can&#x27;t stand black licorice but the sent is light enough that it just smells a little sweet. I think I may try out the slick wax too.</li>
            <li> The product works OK I suppose, it can be a bit of a nuisance to apply it evenly. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell either, but that&#x27;s probably just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars from me, but I wouldn&#x27;t like that hold you back and it&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> Really made the beard look nicer. I got many compliments.</li>
            <li> Works good, strong odor</li>
            <li> Pretty nice stuff -- though don&#x27;t expect the miracles some reviewers claim. That said, I have a fairly wiry and curly beard - not much short of shellac will probably straighten it out! Maybe tamer hair will benefit more along the lines of other reviewers; experiences. I think of it more a as nice conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll happily finish the tub, but when it runs out I&#x27;ll probably try the heavy-duty stuff or their wax instead.</li>
            <li> This product did not produce the results expected or promised.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. He digs it, because it makes his beard pretty. I dig it, because it smells pretty great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing really helps with the beard itch and for those complaining about the smell you must have a problem with smelling like a man</li>
            <li> Simply awesome product! And as for the scent, it&#x27;s fantastic! I wish they&#x27;d make a long lasting cologne with this scent, my wife loves it! It&#x27;s has a nice but masculine smell. The balm itself had my beard softening in just a couple of days. My beard is soft, looks well groomed, has a nice light shine and smells great. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected; however, fair price, fast shipping, and really cool packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Although this procuct was not for me, it seems to be a quality product.  Too oily feeling for my taste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!&#x27; Smells horrible!!</li>
            <li> Great product,  will certainly use it again</li>
            <li> works well, I like others above put it on in the morning and leave it in all day. Big difference in texture, my beard is much softer.</li>
            <li> I like it. The smell isn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be. Nevertheless, this product works well and has made my beard very soft..</li>
            <li> Solid product. A little goes a long way! Directions say beard should be damp, but I have the best results when applying to my beard dry. Had some separation issues initially, but after heating product up and remixing it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this, only because of the price. But I bought it based on the great reviews. I was even more doubtful when it arrived and the can is much smaller than the picture appears. only about 2.5 inches around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something to quell the dreaded &#x27;new beard itch&#x27;. I was at my wits end, ready to shave off another fledgling beard because it was irritating my face something terrible. I&#x27;m talking red skin, and wanting to scratch my face off itchy. I ordered, and toughed out the two days with witch hazel and various other general purpose lotions that just weren&#x27;t doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after using this product, complete beard comfort! Hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely read the directions, it takes a little getting used to. A _very_ small amount is plenty, just enough to cover a fingertip. Put it in your palm to &#x27;melt&#x27;, and then apply, preferably after a shower. It comes out of the can as sort of soft sandy texture, and you get it good and melty in your palms, and then rub in. Great mild licorice smell, absorbs in fully, no greasy beard feel at all. I would say this is more for beard/skin conditioning, with a minimum amount of corralling wild hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while expensive, it works like magic, beard looks and smells great, and you use so little it should last a good long while.</li>
            <li> I had read about this beard balm and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a month and I&#x27;m happy I bought it! There is a big difference in the way my beard looks and feels after using this product. I would highly recommend if you are serious about your beard.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my husbands beard look.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my beard feel and look good</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He LOVES this stuff! It makes his beard soft and glisteny. He was so excited he had to share it with all of his guy friends. I don&#x27;t love the smell as much as all the guys do, but it does smell good. Overall a great gift!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel amazing and look healthy</li>
            <li> Feels and smells good in the beard</li>
            <li> This, combined with a nice oil leaves my beard shiny, soft, and all extremely sexy.</li>
            <li> Works as indicated and smells good.</li>
            <li> Awsome really makes your beard soft, left it on over night and results where cool, will be ordering more, great customer service and really nice people!</li>
            <li> For the beard lovers: this is probably the best you can get for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;The smell alone is fantastic and the results are fast and outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was an option to rate 10 starts out of 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save $15 and buy this for ALL NATURAL nourishment and maintenance of your beloved beard!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is one of the first beard products I have purchased or used. I&#x27;ve had a beard for several years but only recently heard about the benefits of using a product like beard oil or conditioner. I prefer this brand over the other popular brand I bought for its smell and texture. This has become my go to bread conditioner!</li>
            <li> Just a supposed conditioner, leave it in and just makes my hair look super oily and still doesnt make it softer.  The smell is decent, which is the only reason i keep putting it on.</li>
            <li> Works well, costs to much</li>
            <li> My husband loves this so much we&#x27;ve bought several cans now! Normally, I am very sensitive to smells and was worried at first that this would bother me, but even being very close to him, I can barely smell it and when I do, it&#x27;s not overbearing. Makes his beard very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Really helps condition the beard, and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Only been using it about a week so far but it has already softened up the beard hairs. I like the consistency of product and ease of how it breaks down into an oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Every guy that wants to have a beard (or other facial hair) and ended up shaving it for his significant other needs this. I personally have a van dyke, and after a week of using this regularly my beard is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; my wife whenever we kiss. It&#x27;s also easier to shape, and feels better on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months and gotten several friends to acquire this too on my recommendation. I suggest using it liberally ever night before going to bed for about a week, then just enough to cover the beard each night after that. You&#x27;ll definitely see a difference in your beard, and wonder why nobody told you about this sooner!</li>
            <li> This has made my beard more manageable and given it some softness. Being half black and Chinese, it was growing in kinda coarse and curly..Honest Amish has tamed my ethnicities quite nicely.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay once you get used to it, but it is extremely greasy no matter how little of it is used.  It&#x27;s so greasy that I can&#x27;t talk on my smartphone without getting the screen covered in grease.  Not only is the product bad, but these guys are now in partnership with the clowns from Duck Dynasty.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and soothes well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have seen that this product has done was make my beard smell awful. I would not spend money on this product again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and it comes in a cute little burlap bag!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the smell is really terrible, its very strange that people are writing reviews that the smell is not a concern, IT IS A CONCERN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smell like very strange oil being kept on you at all times, i even stood next to my frined while talking to him and asked him if he smelled it and he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product really softens it the hair but i dont think im gonna use it anymore due to the smell. I Wont recommend this product unless your desperate and dont care about how you smell</li>
            <li> Smells nice and blends well.  Beard feel very soft</li>
            <li> Really great! It is a small package.. but this stuff goes a long way. You&#x27;ll notice a difference the first time you use it. After a few days you&#x27;re beard will be super duper soft.. A+</li>
            <li> Makes my beard feel awesome.  Wife loves running her fingers through it.  I should have bought the unscented though, as the clovey-ness of the scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.  Some people would love it though.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes me beard look fuller. I don&#x27;t think it really makes it that much softer.. and it takes forever to dry!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, my beard is growing fast!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been able to grow a thick beard, and having spent 6 years in the military, I was never able to see it come to full fruition.  Once I got out, I started trying to grow my beard as thick and full as I could, but my skin became extremely irritated underneath.  Huge red spots of dry, irritated skin would thrive under the thick whiskers, and I would have to itch all over my face like crazy, especially the upper lip area in my mustache.  With visible flakes being embarrassing aside from the discomfort, I would always keep it relatively short so I could get moisturizer to the skin relatively easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year my friends and I started a friendly competition and I was hoping my skin would have matured or changed, but sadly, this was not the case.  This year, I started researching ways to help me maintain a pristine and full beard, while avoiding the itchiness, and came across this product as a result of reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like rubbing lukewarm oily butter on your face, that&#x27;s the consistency I can most closely compare it to, but man does it work!  I love the smell; it smells like peppermint pine.  You&#x27;ll know what I mean when you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going 3 months strong and there is not one flake and I do not itch in the slightest.  I wish this stuff came in gallon size.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was as advertised</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into beard balm. It came in a little burlap bag. The initial impression by my graphic designer wife was how terrible the label/logo are. Whatever, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that counts, right? Well, the lid to the mustache was was so tight I ended up leaving it barely attached so I wouldn&#x27;t have to fight with it. For the balm, the &amp;#34;wet sand&amp;#34; meets tapioca pudding consistency was interesting if not weird. It makes a creamy oil when warmed up in your hands and leaves your beard pretty oily throughout the day and builds up even more so during a week of use unless you shampoo your beard daily. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the scent or product very much but I thought maybe the earthiness scent would translate to manliness. It was when my 8 daughter would turn her nose up at kisses saying my beard smelled like vomit that I realized this product had to go. The mustache wax that was a pain to apply had to go as well. I switched over to Beard Brand for beard oil and mustache wax and realized caring for your facial can be downright pleasurable for you and your loved ones. Their scents are great, the oil is light and easy to apply, and the mustache wax is light and soft and comes in an applicator similar to chapstick that can run across the &#x60;stache and eyebrows easily. I gave Honest Amish an honest month of use and honestly can say I this product was objectionable for me and my family.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;i alternate between this and beard bomb. the smells are two different worlds but i like them both.</li>
            <li> This stuff has just the right consistency, and it does do a great job at holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is just awful. I read that it very much resembles black licorice, which I think is spot on. Now you may love the smell of black licorice, or may hate it. I personally can&#x27;t stand that smell, and I certainly don&#x27;t want my beard smelling like that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the smallest to the biggest of beards, When I put in the second time my friend finally notice it and said damn that beard is shinny. Not only does it shine but it feels good as well after getting out of the shower and drying your beard off and putting in the beard balm feels like heaven.</li>
            <li> This balm works well to soften a wirery beard. I&#x27;m ok with the scent, however the wife is not a fan of the scent. All in all the product is fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really mind the smell at all like some other reviewers complained about. But it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for me anyway. My beard did look a little neater but it wasn&#x27;t much less itchy than before.</li>
            <li> Works great in my beard. Small container for the money. I would like to see it in a larger portion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a small tin but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Been using daily for about 4 months, still not even half gone.  Does not take much.  Helped keep the beard thick and healthy, and tame down those crazies that just don&#x27;t want to behave.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because i think it should not be nearly as expensive as it is. With that being said, the product is very good. On a scale of 1-10 id give it a solid 7. It applies great on my beard and leaves a nice shine and keeps my beard moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome!!! A friend referred me to this awesome beard balm. I was so excited when it came in the mail that I did not read anything (BIG MISTAKE) and went on directly opening the package to find it spilling a good amount on my shirt &#x3D;( I didn&#x27;t deduct anything in the review because I should have read the paperwork telling me it could possibly be melted. After it cooled is when I was able to notice the shine it give my beard and how it shapes it. Ive gotten compliments from a lot of friends if you have a beard and don&#x27;t use product like I used to be, you are missing out. I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it as much as I do. Step your beard game up!</li>
            <li> I picked this at random and am pleasantly impressed with the results. Follow the instructions and I believe you will like this product also. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Not gonna make this too long so let me say this... AMAZING you don&#x27;t use a lot at all (pea size- amount you put on your tooth brush), rub it in your palms and it melts like a hot knife through butter into what id like to call the ultimate oil to put in your beard it smells amazing and it softens your beard almost instantly... I also use a soft bristle 100% boars hair brush to help distribute oils evenly and man this stuff is the best when combed through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT NOW</li>
            <li> If your looking at this product im sure you were in the same boat I was. Which product to choose because th are so many?&lt;br /&gt;This product has definately made my facial hair softer. I have long scruffy chin hair and this stuff has made it super soft. I can even run a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;This will not allow you to \\&quot;control\\&quot; your hair. You will definately need a wax if you want to go that route. That is a whole other ball game as well. I ended up with hndlebars moustache wax to try basically due to price. I dont use it all the time though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he was growing a beard.  Well he kept the goatee but got rid of the side fuzz.  I also bought him the Swissco Tortoise Hand Made Folding Comb and his goat is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m looking for something that doesn&#x27;t exist, but I want something that softens my beard and tames it without making it greasy.  If I use enough to get it all in my beard, then it&#x27;s greasy for a couple hours.  Then it&#x27;s soft.  If however I don&#x27;t feel like being greasy, then it really doesn&#x27;t do that much.  Still doesn&#x27;t do much to tame the wild hairs.  The search continues...</li>
            <li> Kinda waxy..  Container smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in 2013 when I was in Alaska working at a salmon hatchery, growing one hell of a beard. And now once again my beard is supurb and I purchased the conditioner again but I believe your pricing has now gone to high! I love the product but please lower the price a tad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jason Webster</li>
            <li> i love this product is works really well with making sure that my beard does not go all crazy through out the day. the product is easy to use and apply. just make sure that you don&#x27;t apply to much a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my beard and this has helped considerably with fullness and softness of beard.  My wife ran her fingers through my beard after two weeks of use and was impressed by the softness of beard.  And she had always complained about my beard being to rough whenever I grew it out.</li>
            <li> To start, I don&#x27;t have a very long beard, but I like to let my beard grow for 1-3 weeks before shaving it.  Once I get past the 10 day mark or so, it starts to itch and bother me a bit, to the point where I crave to shave it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something to moisturize it and ease this itch a bit.  After reading such rave reviews about the Honest Amish Balm, I decided to give it a try.  My first impression was that the container was super small for the price tag it holds, but now several months later I&#x27;ve realized a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the balm itself, it&#x27;s really good, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t blow me away.  The scent is fine...it&#x27;s clean, good smelling, not super strong.  Before I was using pure jojoba oil, and that worked pretty well too.  My one complaint about the honest amish balm, is that it leaves your face a bit oily/greasy looking.  I&#x27;ve tried using much less, but it still happens to a minimal degree.  I feel as though it can sometimes make my face shine a bit, and I&#x27;m using have a fingertips worth.  For that reason alone, I sometimes prefer to use it at night, because it does soften the bristles for sure.  It seems to do most of what it claims to do, but not sure if I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I talked about this stuff to a friend and he said I had to get him some.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost. $16+/- and a tiny jat arrives....Great product though.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. The smell is great, not over-powering. It really helps out with the dryness that can happen under the beard. Overall, I will be ordering more, probably in the bigger tin though.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do keeps my beard in line and helps to soften it.</li>
            <li> Some time ago, I purchased this product as a bearded man living a lonely life.  I loved my beard but felt it wasn&#x27;t achieving its true potential so I did some research and landed on this product.  When the package came, I immediately tried it out.  First, I was impressed with the smell.  The aroma entered my nostrils and filled my brain with a feeling of happiness and accomplishment.  I went straight out to my yard and fixed the lawnmower.  The true benefit comes over time.  As I continued to use the balm, my beard continued to grow softer and fuller.  This better beard raised my confidence level to an all time high which led to me asking a beautiful woman on a date.  She obliged and we proceeded to have an incredible evening.  We are currently planning our 3rd date.  Date number 2 was nothing short of paradise in that it included several hours of cuddling and a beard massage.  That&#x27;s right, a beard massage.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, if you buy this beard balm, you will get a beautiful girlfriend and have a much better life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, with both this product but also that with so many positive reviews, it still failed me.  Why, Amazon, has thou forsaken me?  I&#x27;m still learning my way in bearddom, and was looking for a product to help give some control as I continue to grow out this 2 month wonder.  No matter the amount I use, or how much i rub it in my hands, its gritty with a hateful smell.  It does NOTHING for beard control or conditioning.  MAJOR CRAP!</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is necessary to moisturize the beard and easy to apply.  No greasy feeling and I really like the mild anise smell.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> It arrived granulated (as opposed to a paste), a friend recommended me this product and that didn&#x27;t happen to him. I have to warm it up before using and it is a pain. It works after warming it up but too much hassle. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my beard. Smells nice and softens my beard nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. Has a nice smell and he loves it. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I used this during my &amp;#34;no shave November&amp;#34; to help with itching as my beard grew out. The Balm smelled nice and worked well keeping the hairs soft, but did not work that well keeping stray hairs down.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things just buy it</li>
            <li> I have been using the Bluebeard beard &amp;#34;after shower conditioner&amp;#34; and figured that I would give this a try.  Just seems to leave my beard a little to greasy feeling.  Sticking with Bluebeard.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and i am letting it grow out long,and it is was getting wild looking with hairs sticking out all over.So i got this and the first time i used it i could tell a big change in how much softer it made my beard feel and the hairs are starting to lay down!! I put it on after i shower and my beard is damp in the morning and then i will use it again later in the evening and again at bed time and man this stuff is great!! I just have placed a order for the larger can and also for the lip balm and there healing salve! I am a male 41 years old and i have been a farmer all my life and i can not say enough good about Honest Amish products!!!!</li>
            <li> My beard is shorter and my hair pretty course. I was hoping&lt;br /&gt;for a conditioner that might soften it a bit. This product&lt;br /&gt;does not do that, at least not for me. It feels too greasy&lt;br /&gt;and has not had any noticable affect on my beard&#x27;s texture or&lt;br /&gt;softness. Might work for longer beards.</li>
            <li> Like the conditioning. My goatee is softening up nicely. The only draw back is the scent. If I didn&#x27;t wear cologne it might not matter as much but if it were toned down or odorless that would be 5 stars. It&#x27;s not so strong that I don&#x27;t use it but it would be nice to have a choice.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my beard soft as ever, helped hold it in a good position all day. Great product, does everything they claim.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, just a little pricey, which is why the one star is missing.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff! I have a 6&amp;#34; billy goat I&#x27;ve been coaxing to stay groomed this last year and after finding Honest Amish I gotta say-this beard buddy works well. My goat was wiry but now it&#x27;s soft and stays in place. Slight smell of Anise which fades after a few minutes. Rub a small amount into your palm, work it around to melt and work it through damp hair. Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You have a beard? Buy this product immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this I had:&lt;br /&gt;- Very thick beard (hair is thick as horse hair)&lt;br /&gt;- Daily flacking, looked like my beard had dandruff&lt;br /&gt;- A lot of scratching&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application the following happened:&lt;br /&gt;- Beard very soft, easy to manage and comb&lt;br /&gt;- Flacking disappeared! Immediately! I could not believe it.&lt;br /&gt;- No more scratching. ZERO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Girlfriend loves it&lt;br /&gt;- Beard looks healthier&lt;br /&gt;- Beard does not look dry any more&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is amazing! Comes in a small burlap bag!&lt;br /&gt;- Organic&lt;br /&gt;- All natural&lt;br /&gt;- No animal testing</li>
            <li> Great product, works as described. Scent is that of licorice, not overly strong though. Leaves whiskers and skin feeling soft and moist. I use about a cranberry size dollop each application and the tin lasts me approximately 30 applications. Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Helps with itch. Smells good too</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  His face is not itchy-not as puffy-and smells good.  The stuff has an earthy smell which goes away after about 10 minutes but we like the smell.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. It calms my beard, but didn&#x27;t control as much as I expected. It was also a little difficult to turn into full liquid form in my hands. All in all, it was decent.</li>
            <li> This stuff freaks me out. My beard is wonderfully smooth, and the beard dander is but a memory.</li>
            <li> I really like this balm. It helps control hairs that want to go every which way, and seems to reduce beard itch too. I avoid colognes and fragrance as much as possible, but like the outdoorsy smell of this.</li>
            <li> After growing my beard out for months and having complaints about how rough and narley it had gotten from my wife and daughters, I figured it was time to try to tame my face-forest. Honest Amish did the trick. A quick application after a shower made for a soft and manageable beard. My daughters now love to fall asleep while &amp;#34;petting&amp;#34; it. The anise smell took a little getting use to but it&#x27;s performance quickly made me overlook this initial singular negative aspect of the product. I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the aroma actually. Good stuff, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to any other bearded brother out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Recommended this to a couple guys at work and they&#x27;ve been really into it as well. Help soften the hairs and give it a nice look. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. Pretty pleasant!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love it!</li>
            <li> although it arrived and I didnt realize it was melted. it smells great and is soft!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my beard (and the skin underneath) happy</li>
            <li> good stuff.  it&#x27;s a little off-putting at first if it separates in shipping, but as the info card says - don&#x27;t worry about it.  it&#x27;s got a great, earthy smell without being overpowering, and it&#x27;s not super heavy. be prepared to make a mess though, it comes as a solid and you liquefy it in your hands.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well even on my sensitive ginger skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You get a sufficient amount for the price.  I love the smell and it makes my beard feel great.  The only problem is that it does not travel well due to its low melting point. I would definitely recommend this product to my fellow beards.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Leaves my beard soft and healthy looking! Wifey is happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to help condition and manage the scraggly bush that has invaded his face.  It has a lovely clove fragrance that is masculine and clean without being too strong and which fades to a barely noticeable scent not long after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product conditions well without leaving a shiny residue.  I wish it had a stronger hold because his beard is a little on the unruly side and this product doesn&#x27;t tame the strays.  In the future, I think I&#x27;ll get him one of the Honest Amish products better suited for control.</li>
            <li> I find this product greasy and feel very little softening.  One must rub it in the hands to get the grittiness out, so then they must be washed.&lt;br /&gt;I find a good conditioner used in the shower works just as well</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend. He likes it!</li>
            <li> Some complain that it is greasy, but that&#x27;s only as you melt it between your palms. Once applied, it simply softens the beard and leaves it soft and easier to manage. Those scraggly fly away hairs have met their match. Nice smell, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and Beard Balm at the same time as I was new to the beard conditioners, waxes, etc. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t care much for the product. It did not give me the same look or feel that I got with the Beard Balm. I had to shave the beard off a couple of times and went through the dreaded beard itch here and there (stick with it newbie beard growers; the itch will pass!). Anyhow, not only did I not notice much of a change with the beard look, but it didn&#x27;t help with the itch like Beard Balm did, regardless of how much I used. It&#x27;s a decent product, but didn&#x27;t quite do it for me.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, I like it.  I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, it smells a little like ginger to me and I&#x27;m guessing there may be beeswax in it.  What is left on my hands after applying to my beard I rub into the skin on my face and then clean it off rubbing into wet hair and brush it immediately.</li>
            <li> I like the product until it melted then hardened back up in my bag. Now it&#x27;s like trying to put on candle wax...</li>
            <li> This is a really nice facial hair conditioner, keeps my facial hair soft and flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually keep my goatee short but I recently started to let it grow thicker, and as a result my facial hair and face started to get dry. My face started to flake, almost resembling dandruff.  But since I started using Honest Amish I have not had any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and apply. I&#x27;m not a big fan of black licorice/anise, but the smell is tollerable, overall it&#x27;s a pretty mild scent.</li>
            <li> makes your beard very soft after a couple of days. Its easier for me to comb my beard without it getting caught on the comb. I think its going by quick though. but considering my beard is around 3 inches long. 8/10th of full beard.</li>
            <li> Before using beard balm my beard was scraggly and rough. After purchasing honest Amish beard balm and a boar bristle brush, my beard is soft to the touch and has a uniform look.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a higher rating except that it really has a strong odor. Since you apply it right beneath your nose, this is an important feature. Also, I don&#x27;t know that the ladies would like snuggling up to you with that kind of strong herbal odor all around you. Maybe the Amish aren&#x27;t sensitive to this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does help to soften and detangle your beard. Its easy to apply. It comes in a convenient tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first beard balm I have tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other products, but I hope they do not have such an overpowering smell. I will try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> The company was able to quickly and efficiently correct a shipping order that I had made. The products themselves smell incredible and my fiance (who has extremely dry skin) is very pleased with them. Will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Very good product for taming a unruly beard like mine, leaves beard a little too shiny for my taste. Smells amazing without being over powering.</li>
            <li> I hate the tyranny of maintenance. The shaving, showering, brushing, flossing, scrubbing, exfoliating, plucking, trimming....all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that annoys me the most is no matter what I tried I kept getting a decent amount of bearddruff. Or dandruff of beards. Then I heard about Honest Amish and gave it a shot. I cleaned my beard with Neutrogena T-Gel (let it sit for a couple minutes) then right out of the shower I applied a small amount of Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  No more flakes, the beard is softer, a little shinier, and overall in better health than at anytime since I&#x27;ve had a beard, (over ten years now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on expanding into the Honest Amish product line as time goes on, for now I&#x27;m sticking to the conditioner and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This balm keeps my short beard and the skin underneath it from becoming dry and irritated. I rub it into my face, neck, ears, hands, and even elbows. It smells great and keeps everything soft and non-greasy. Fantastic product -- only wish it were slightly cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> Softens the beard and makes it manageable. Got rid of beard dandruff. Smells like sandalwood I think. I would recommend to any one who has a beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a couple hundred dollars trying to find the perfect products to tame the beard. I wanted a simple beard care routine, not multiple products to use each shower. Best results of any product I&#x27;ve used. Just use this now after the shower. Beard is softer, manageable, moisturized, and not at all itchy. That&#x27;s no simple task for a construction worker forced to wash beard daily. No dealing with oils, soaps, shampoos, conditioners, etc. if you want a simple, one product beard care regimen, you won&#x27;t find any better than this. Smells like the natural butters used (if you&#x27;ve ever smelled shea butter you know what I mean) with an ever so slight peppermint/anise smell. Not offensive even if you don&#x27;t care for licorice smell as I don&#x27;t care for that either.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  My beard looks healthier and growing faster than before.  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a healthy looking beard.  All natural ingredients is a plus also.</li>
            <li> For a thinner goatee like mine, it works great. I find that I use a bit more than the recommended amount. The shine goes away after a bit and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Arrived quickly and really helps to bring out the colors and nuances of the beard. I don&#x27;t know if it would be great for styling crazy beards, but it works well as a regular leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The good:  Conditions and smells nice, but a LITTLE goes a LONG way!  Makes your beard shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  Enhances curling, be careful of build-up, as it becomes greasy.  Skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/28/2014:  Not using it anymore.  The skin irritant only increased, buildup is tough to wash out (and, yes, I used a little, VERY little at a time).  Washing the grease off your hands is difficult.  After a week, it started to smell rancid in the tin. I think I basically threw away $15.  Really not pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband because his bread was getting scraggly and thought he ought to have something for it. Found this wax online and the reviews were great.  He tried it out and what a difference it made. The bread looked healthier, smelled great and a few days later felt soft and smooth. Giving it a five because it’s awesome, nothing negative to say. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have a standard length beard that that is a tad bit on the thin side.  This helps fill it out and make it more manageable while bring out more of the natural coloring. The smell is pleasant,barely noticeable, and fades after a few minutes.  At first I was surprised by the small container but a little bit goes a long way.  If you are into having a sweet looking beard, this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li> My husband let his beard grow and had problems with the &amp;#34;fluffiness&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sticking out&amp;#34; of the beard. He loved the Beard Balm! It makes it very soft and stay in place.</li>
            <li> i like it, it works, it smells great, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this once and it was a hard wax, now its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its ok ill probably order again. maybe ill try something new</li>
            <li> It does have a smell, i dont know what others are saying. Got it because of the reviews, but it left my beard(1 inch) greasy, shiny, and the smell drove me mad. Not happy :/</li>
            <li> I suffer from bad split ends on my beard. I use this product every other day and it&#x27;s done wonders for preventing split ends. Also, while the product comes in a small tin, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works really well into my beard. Nice scent and, although initially greasy, dries quickly. I had only used it several times over the course of two weeks but it definitely made my beard softer and itch a little less. Only downside (and maybe I didn&#x27;t read the size of tin it came in or just didnt see it) is that the size of the product is TINY! Honestly half the size I thought it would be. Now it&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way as it will be months before I buy more (and I will) but for the price........just a little disappointing. Again, maybe I didn&#x27;t read or see the container size in the info above but other than that this is an amazing product. I may try buying it in bulk to see if the price equates to a good deal.</li>
            <li> Super awesome stuff. Smells good, feels great, and is really high quality. I&#x27;m very glad I bought this, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Was super excited when I got my package from honest Amish till I opened it to find a dog harness. Now I have to return the package.</li>
            <li> First, this product does a great job of conditioning a dry beard and skin. In just two applications, my beard is darker, softer, less knots, and lays flatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product is best compared to Jagermeister! heavy clove and spice notes...definitely not a scent for everyone...but it does remind me a lot of the amish country where i spent time as a child...it smells like a thanksgiving or Christmas kitchen! I thought I would not like the scent on me, but after an hour or so, you get used to it, and it starts to smell more like root beer.</li>
            <li> This beard balm is a moderate improvement over liquid oil I got from somewhere. I tried the liquid oil from another vendor. It was nice stuff. However, my beard is scarcely more disciplined than before. Rather it remains Wavy and Curly. After all how would YOU feel if you had to carry around one of the Three Stooges holding onto your furry mug? Lacking a degree in folicular science, I don&#x27;t know what comes next. Perhaps if I raised rabbits, the hare raising experience would impact my facial fuzz? When I was younger, there was a popular practice of bronzing baby shoes. Would my beard be compliant if I bronzed it? At least I&#x27;d get Curley out of my face.  These Honest Amish people are prompt and provide good service, just like the folks for whom the company is named.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he&#x27;s been using this for three days now and his beard is already so soft! The balm isn&#x27;t too greasy and it smells nice, too. It doesn&#x27;t offer hold, but definitely increases the softness and shine of his beard.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this and the fact that it is all natural is a huge selling point for me, but I found a local company that I think is better. I will not post who unless you ask because I do not work for them. However, the Amish Balm shipped nicely and came with great instruction. If you are a bearded person or have a loved one that has a beard it needs to be taken care of and this product will that! I just found something better.</li>
            <li> Product is missing from container and has leaked out.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.  It really helped with the itch from new growth.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It makes my beard fuller and takes the itch out for most the day. I do recommend a beard oil in combination with this because the oil prevents itching longer. Just a small amount is needed and it goes on easy. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really loved the product. Smell is interesting but not bad. Plus not a very strong smell. But like I said it isn&#x27;t a bad smell at all. Smells very organic! My parents are Dominican and my facial hair is very curly, thick, and wiry. This definitely tamed my beard. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When you need to condition the beard, make sure you have the right gear.</li>
            <li> Easy instructions.  Easy to use.  Does what it says.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the product-it definitely made his beard softer, although he didn&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> Haven been using for about two weeks. Smell is ok, but no itching or flaking. Price is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, if you are in the growing proces of a beard you have to buy one of this thinks.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my discerning husband&#x27;s beard. He loves it. I think it smells like licorice.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this as well as the Honest Amish Original Beard Wax as I could not decide which to buy. They were stocking stuffers for Christmas for my 23 year old Grandson. ADORE the Grandson, not so sure about the beard.....but chances are that at 23 he will make several &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; choices in his lifetime! And as a doting Grandmother, I will support them all! Thankfully he only makes &amp;#34;legal&amp;#34; and acceptable choices. He does love the Honest Amish products though, so we wiil be rebuying them!</li>
            <li> This is super stuff for a beard</li>
            <li> Earthy smell, good feel on the face. It takes a bit of work to get it all melted and consistent, but when you finally have, it&#x27;s probably my favorite beard product out there.  Excellent at taming frazzled hairs and keeping everything in place.  I don&#x27;t get beard itch at all, even in Iowa winters so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness there, but combine it with a Boar&#x27;s Hair soft brush and you will be the talk of the town.</li>
            <li> Nice and smells clean! Makes my beard soft!</li>
            <li> I am trying to grow a beard. It may not work out but this stuff really does improve what I&#x27;ve got. And it feels soft and smells great. My wife always runs her hands through it. Which is nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product!</li>
            <li> Great product, A++++++</li>
            <li> Smells so good I catch myself trying to make out with myself when I put it on.</li>
            <li> NO chemicals?  So can I assume it&#x27;s just an empty container?&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy your product but the chemical-phobia nature of these &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products is disingenuous and aggravating nonsense.</li>
            <li> it is a bit greasy, and has a unique pleasant odor, but holds the wild hairs in check. It is &amp;#34;congealed&amp;#34; in the tin at normal room temps, so you need to warm it up in your hands before applying. Keeps the beard conditioned and managed longer than oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loves it. The smell is good and it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Great product. It truly made my beard look and grow better. Loved the smell too. Pretty cool packaging too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - on my 2nd order and will continue ordering. No regrets on this purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like the smell.  Bought at around $16.  I think is all it&#x27;ll high should be I. The $8 range.  Good product does leave bears so and smell good.  I stared using coconut oil and it works just as well and is cheap.  I suggest buy this and use 1 day a week to keep cost down because I will still use it along side coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and have never had more than a 3 day growth of facial hair. You see, genetics were not nice to me. Most of my family are either Irish, Italian or Samoan. Most of my traits are more common with the Italian and Samoan sides of my family. This means all of my hair is unruly. I also do shave my head so shaving my face is just a natural swipe down from the head, but I decided to give the beard a try. First week, there was a tremendous amount of growth. Everyone loved it. It itched. My flesh under the beard, that was visible, was red. I&#x27;m guessing I can thank my Irish skin for that. The beard itself was fairly soft to the touch, but it was very irritated. I picked up some Organix conditioner that is supposed to be good to use a couple times a week for washing the beard. That helped some, but not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this product and decided it&#x27;s worth the try. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but there&#x27;s a lot of talk in the reviews about the scent. As someone who has shaved my head for 20 years, the scent to me is not much different than Bay Rum. I&#x27;ve ran out of my favorite shave soap before and had to fall back on bay rum scented shave soap. It&#x27;s very similar to this scent. Which means I&#x27;m not particularly fond of it, but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, after using this beard balm for a week, all of the redness is gone and so is the itching. I&#x27;ve found out from an older bearded man whom I work with that it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more my hands wanting to pull at the beard. I&#x27;m also not for sure if I&#x27;m using it the way most do. I simply pinch a little bit out, wet my hands and rub my hands together. Then rub it into the beard in a circular motion. It feels really nice. It instantly caused the irritation to cool and took away the itchy feeling. If anyone is wondering about the texture, it&#x27;s sort of grainy. It feels like something that is good for your skin. By rubbing it in my hands it has even softened my hands. That&#x27;s a pretty big deal since I use heavy machinery outdoors and have rough, calloused hands. You can look at that as relative to what it does for your face/beard. As of today, I&#x27;m 14 days without shaving my face and have a nice beard that feels clean and healthy. That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted from this product and it has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies to my fellow bearded brethren reviewers for not believing it worked as good as they said.ce I use heavy machinery outdoors and have rough, calloused hands.

            <li> Plain old lanolin was better. And cheaper.</li>
            <li> My husband love this.  It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> its ok a little greasy for my liking</li>
            <li> This was my second balm that I&#x27;ve tried, after being quite happy with Irish Beard Balm, but wanting to see what all the scuttlebutt was with the Amish brand. The tin came in a cool little burlap sack packed with beard care instructions (which I particularly loved, I think that&#x27;s a class act thing to include). My first impression of the balm itself was a little....odd. It has a grainy consistency which no one else seemed to have mentioned in the comments and had a very distinct licqorice odor, which again want really mentioned in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, after getting over the scent I&#x27;ve come to find that it&#x27;s the best damn balm I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried four total as of this review). It moisturizes while providing a moderate level of hold and stray taming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not only recommend this, but I&#x27;m certainly buying some as a gift for other beardos.</li>
            <li> Good product . Feels good on my beard and has a pleasant scent. Hopefully over time I will notice a change in beard fullness and fewer broken hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the smell and I&#x27;m addicted to using it. I would use it a couple times a day if I could. Only disappointment was the size of the container was about half or a third of what I thought it was going to be. Especially for the price</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves the beard feeling smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Great product. My chin is happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  My only request would be it come in a small container to keep in my pocket and a much larger container for my bathroom.  Thanks for a great procuct and will be buying lots more.</li>
            <li> This is really good beard oil.  I used it before I shaved my beard and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Growing my winter beard in and it was real coarse,  this all natural product smoothed it out and made it more manageable and it smells good too...definitely would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Friend says it works great to calm stray hair and keep beard smooth. Great product and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; makes the beard look great, but I&#x27;m not Amish yet :(</li>
            <li> Are you a man....no?  Do you want to be a man?  You can start with smelling like one.  Honest Amish beard lube is like taking Moby Dick by the cojones and single handedly felling the tallest redwood in California.  It&#x27;s like starting a bar fight with chuck Norris and winning after seven double scotches and hog tieing yourself just to make it a fair match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> helps with beard itch as well as keeping stray hairs down.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! It seems to be making my husband&#x27;s beard softer and he loves it. The container is small, but the amount used per application is minimal, so it should last a while. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Scent is a little too strong at first but it softens and keeps everything nice looking.</li>
            <li> I liked it alot.  Nice and smooth going on and leaves you feeling good.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with beard itch! A little goes a long way!  Great product.</li>
            <li> I rarely do reviews, but this stuff warranted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to grow my beard out and it always ended up coarse and unruly. This stuff is great!  A small amount softens the hair, straightens it and I don&#x27;t get stray hairs all over the place. It keeps me from looking like a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and also helps with my dry skin that tends to come out of growing beard that can lead to &amp;#34;beardruff.&amp;#34; This stuff takes care of all that and I just use it once a day. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend&#x27;s beard smells and looks WAY better. Rad, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this product. After a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed my beard is not as stiff and wiry. I keep my beard pretty close cropped, but even at that length it can be prickly,  dull and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; gray.  This product softens, shines and gives life to my beard.  Also, I&#x27;d read some comments about the smell. I think it smells great and it&#x27;s very subtle.  My wife hasn&#x27;t even mentioned it once; and she&#x27;s super sensitive to fragrances. So, it definitely passes the &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; test with me. It comes in a cool burlap bag and a retro styled tin. It would make a great Christmas stocking stuffer for your hirsute loved one(s). I Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but the scent is not for me. Smells like musty anise flavoring</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know my beard could look as good as it does when I use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works great! Helps with the beardruff and makes it nice and soft. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Cool stocking stuffer! The hubby loves it and so do I</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband loves how it makes beard feel and personally we both love the light scent.</li>
            <li> Works really well, just the smell isn&#x27;t for me.  It has a licorice/anise scent.  But Honest Amish is amazing and sent me a full refund because I didn&#x27;t like the scent!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for someone with a beard and started a new trend! He loves it!  He uses it every day now. The jar is small but will last a while, you only use a very small amount. He said he loves the smell and it does go away after a few minutes. Can also use on your hands if you want! Great stuff and will buy again!</li>
            <li> This helps control my husbands wild beard - it makes it look nicer and softer.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks and I can really notice a difference in my beard. It has softened my really coarse beard, has a really great scent, and my wife loves it too. (My beard and the balm!)</li>
            <li> Great stuff, does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! After a few days of using it my beard is much softer! Smells great to!</li>
            <li> Smell is very nice - not over powering at all.  Works great too according to the hubs.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the beard balm more than the wax.  Easy to apply and work into your beard.</li>
            <li> Never used a salve like this, liquifies as described, relieves itch, keeps skin and hair smooth. Will purchase this balm again.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin? The smell. If you could capture the fragrance of heart crushing defeat and mix it with soul shattering disappointment, and you put it in a tin, you would not be able to tell the difference between that and this product. Licorice and cloves on steroids, I swear, it&#x27;s one of the worst smelling things I&#x27;ve ever smelled and I served 3 tours in the Middle East, so that&#x27;s really saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It emulsified easy enough, but to the same consistency as a very oily butter. And that doesn&#x27;t go away. It stays oily. Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched and researched for about a month before buying this. I figured 1,800+ people can&#x27;t be wrong, right? WRONG. SO WRONG.</li>
            <li> Great on the beard...  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. Pleasant smelling. Helped tame the beast!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a conditioner for my beard, it worked nice there...but I actually like it for the soft hold and use it on the hair on top of my head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other beard moisturizer so far, but I found the weird consistency to be a little messy and off-putting.  However, the job it did softening my growing beard was spot on.  I was able to get through that itchy phase finally.  It works.  The smell wasn&#x27;t great, but my wife and I didn&#x27;t mind it.  If I try other brands of similar products, I&#x27;ll add more to this review.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews may have mentioned, this is not to take care of every little stray hair, but more to soften that rough beard and keep your skin from itching. Excellent quality. It DOES smell great, at least to me. Honest Amish has made an impression on me. Would buy/try all their products. The time/effort that they put into packaging this item alone made me feel like a prized customer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Keeps my beard manageable and brings out a deeper color.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for when I start getting scruffy. Keeps the dry skin at bay like a boss. Smells good and gives my beard a little more &amp;#34;pizaz&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever bother trying another brand if these guys keep producing.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with a nice spicy scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the beard game. Simply because my previous employers didn&#x27;t allow them. I purchased this based off all the 4-5 stars it got. The described scent had me interested. I love the smell. It has a licorice hint along with subtle notes of nut/woods (to me). It&#x27;s pretty simple and straight forward to apply. Put a little bit into your balm, rub and work around until it melts into a oil type substance on your hands and work in into your beard. Pretty simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend of mine loved the smell, she encouraged I strictly use this only from now on. After I apply it, I like to comb my beard. It provides a nice shine, which brings out your highlights. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm. It almost single-handedly convinced me to keep growing my beard and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with my decision. Also, it smells amazing(like the wood from a barrel of wine)</li>
            <li> The beard wax is a little too stiff for my preference.  This Beard Balm is very soft - not liquid, just not as hard as the wax.  It is easier to apply, smells good and hold my beard nicely all day long.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work well, smells nice and lasts longet than i would have thought.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my Stepdad for Christmas. At first he thought it was a gag gift, but was pleasantly surprised by its usefulness. Spells like anice and keeps him nice and groomed!</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my overly bearded husband.  I like that it is natural &amp; has a pleasant, not overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for more boyfriend, who is growing a giant beard but wanting something to soften it up and keep it healthy. He loves this stuff. Helps his beard soften, strengthens it, gives it good shine and smells great. The smell reminds me of black licorice mixed with Jager (yes...the liquor) so if you&#x27;re not into that then maybe go another route. I think it&#x27;s refreshing when I smell it on him. I will definitely buy more of this and their other products in the future. Oh....and I loved the way they packaged it!</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised!  works well with my beard.</li>
            <li> My husband has never used any type of beard product and has had his beard for 10 plus years. He really likes how little it takes to condition with this product and the smell is spicy, which he likes and so do I... It is a good little product to enhance his beard!</li>
            <li> I rubbed this in my beard before going on a jog and I literally ripped the air in half. Beings from another dimension crossed through the time rift, but luckily I was able to use this wax to forge my beard into a great sword that shot laser beams and I banished the evil beings back into oblivion. Thanks Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> I wish the balm had some scent to it.  It sort of smells like bees wax, which is OK, but I would prefer a nice masculine scent.  Also, the material doesn&#x27;t melt readily on your fingertips, leaving little tiny bits to melt into your beard.  I would prefer a material that melts fully in your hands.</li>
            <li> The smell on this stuff can get super bothersome when it&#x27;s on your face. If you are sensitive to cologne smells or chemical smells this is not for you. Gave me a nasty headache when I used it from breathing in the scent.</li>
            <li> Package came as described, fast delivery. Too soon to say it worked to my expectations</li>
            <li> Great stuff really softens your beard and helps control the curls 😃</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  My beard is a little wiry and the grey is starting to be more prominent.  I needed something to calm it down and bring it under control.  I didn&#x27;t want something too spicy or oily.  This fit the bill.  After apply a little bit in the morning and combing it through my beard it&#x27;s more inclined to lay down and look presentable.  It&#x27;s not totally scent free but I like the smell and it goes away after a few hours.  It&#x27;s kind of a cross between vanilla and cloves which is relaxing.  I&#x27;m also allergic to a bunch of spices, nuts and fragrances and this doesn&#x27;t bother me or irritate my skin.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This was pretty expensive and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the course beard that much just yet. Maybe it takes a while?</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. The key is to use it when your beard is still damp after a shower. If you&#x27;ll do that, then put a bit on your palm and add a little water with it then rub your hands together until it becomes more oily, it will do its job. It helps me shape my beard properly as well as adds a nice sort of light sheen to mine. My beard is red salted with a bit of white and the Honest Amish does a really nice job on it. Scent doesn&#x27;t bother me either. Sometimes I will finish off my beard with just a bit of beard oil for good measure, but this stuff really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not working as stated on package. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> A GREAT PRODUCT!! I was initially worried it would leave my skin oily but it doesn&#x27;t!! It sottens my beard and makes it more manageable!!! A Great Beard Product!!</li>
            <li> Smells good but still manly and leaves my above average size beard softer and manageable. On my second tin.</li>
            <li> Very nice but subtle musk scent. A little goes a long way, and you learn that the first time you use it and accidentally grab too much.</li>
            <li> ive had a beard for a while, and used numerous products, this is easily one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 1st time i used it, i didnt think it was anything special, but since then i actually think its one of the best products out there&lt;br /&gt;when applying you need to rub it vigorously thru your hands until your hands are nice and shiny, then rub thru your entire beard, a little goes a long way in taming the beast!&lt;br /&gt;dont be concerned about the small size, ive been using it everyday for the past 2 weeks and i barley dented the surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and as far as people complaining about smell, maybe they were expecting some fru fru crap, this product is for men with a little dirt under there finger nails, pampered men look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I love the Beard Balm, I used oil in the past but so far this product I feel is much better.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend. His beard is quite coarse and fluffy when long. After him trying many other products (including my Moroccan hair oil) I was on a hunt to find the perfect beard moisturizer for him. I even had to give it to him earlier than christmas because he was unsatisfactied with other products. After a month of use it had been the best product thus far. His beard is soft and conditioned without leaving it oily and shiny. Great product! A must have!</li>
            <li> Wonder product, my husband loves it makes his beard not so pokey.</li>
            <li> easy to use and does a nice job</li>
            <li> Good, mild smell, very effective and easy to apply, no brush needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two cans now, it works great, I cannot go without it.  The smell is very mild and pleasant.  I&#x27;m used to it now, but it is not overpowering in the least.  #5-trimmed beard stays oiled for almost the entire day from about a pea-size worth applied in the morning.</li>
            <li> Slippery and soft stuff. Leaves my mustache feeling well lubricated and conditioned when it isn&#x27;t waxed up. I love the fact that it&#x27;s an organic product and smells great. The one problem I have found is that I left it in a hot car during the summer and the ingredients separated a bit when it cooled, it formed into hard little nodules and got a little &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34;. Still performs the same- you just have to get it melty in your hands before applying. Great product and I have re-ordered since growing a full beard.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I get comments on the look and feel of my beard daily and I owe it all to this product. Grab one for your beard!</li>
            <li> This makes my husband&#x27;s beard SO SOFT! It takes a very small amount, and it makes him smell and feel good. He had a lot of &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; beard hairs before, and this seems to keep them tamped down. Been using it since December, and has barely scratched the surface of the product. We are both big fans and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Makes my beard look more alive and more manageable.  It is easy to use and also leaves your hands in great shape.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gives my beard a nice shine and makes it feel so much healthier. I use it almost everytime I hop out of the shower. Only giving it 4/5 because it&#x27;s a little pricey for such a small canister.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it for his short beard/stubble. Keeps it neat looking. I think he may even use it in his eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  A must for any beard!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, it smelled great and made my beard softer almost instantly but my skin didn&#x27;t agree with it, it started to cause pimples so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great product... Thorough instructions</li>
            <li> My big bearded boyfriend uses this and raves so much about it i got some to give as gifts to our friends, love it.</li>
            <li> good stuff.  i would buy it again and again. i would recommend it to friends family and enemies.  Your welcome</li>
            <li> I love this beard balm! No beardrift and the itchy beard days are behind me!</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my beard for four months at the time of this writing. I have been using this product for about half of that time. It has made my beard possible! It has erased any itchiness, and dryness my beard caused. It has also done wonders for the skin underneath the beard. It has also helped my lips keep their moisture. It smells great! A licorice/spice smell, but it is only really noticeable the first few times you use it. The price tag seems steep when you receive the small can, but once you use it for a week you will understand why I will never try any other product for as long as I have a face blanky. There&#x27;s simply no need! My can looks like it will end up lasting 4 months, being used 4-5 times a week. Remember this is mainly a moisturizer/conditioner, so dont plan to sculpt with it. It leaves your beard soft and moist. Hurry up and buy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all,not for me it didn&#x27;t work at all for me sorry I need something better then that but thanks anyway</li>
            <li> Very good, as advertised. Definitely softens very course facial hair and helps alot with itching. Thanks honest Amish guy</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Does a lot to keep my beard soft and clean, as well as keeping skin moisturized underneath. It has a pretty low melting point - which is stated by the company, and they say to just put in the fridge if that happens, but that can be kind of annoying in the summer months when the house is above 70 during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of this product. It isn&#x27;t bad, but it also isn&#x27;t good, yet still noticeable, I just ordered their &amp;#34;PURE&amp;#34; version, which is supposed to be scentless, so I may like that better!</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my hair instead and it seems to moisturize great. It has kind of a weird scent but I actually like it. It&#x27;s an interesting composition too. When you scoop it out, it seems kind of gritty and rub it together in your hands and it makes a nice oil. I&#x27;m not sure if it would matter for a beard but I only put it in my hair at night because it will make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this and so do I. Smells nice, makes beard soft. I have ordered him some of the Beard Wax to tame the few hairs that this doesn&#x27;t control.</li>
            <li> I purchased this is as a stocking stuffer for my husband this christmas. He LOVES it. It has a nice smell to it and leaves his beard looking very well-kept and feeling soft. I highly reccomend this line!!!</li>
            <li> So I am a fan of the Honest Amish products. My beard leans toward Moses or bedlam patient in its natural state, their beard wax is my go to beard tamer. At the weekends it needs a little gardening to remove the small rodents and nesting birds that moved in during the week. I use a bluebeard wash conditioner (which is awesome) and this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is like a clarified butter, which you rub between your palms to liquify. It becomes an oil in seconds. you rub in and it softens and adds a gloss to your beard.  It has some control but if you need to tame your unruly man pelt you need to use the wax as well.  I do not notice any smell good or bad from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thought is is an oil so make sure an use a paper towel to dry off any skin that you have the balm on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumspringa!!!!</li>
            <li> Light scent. Refreshing. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff: it&#x27;s got a nice smell (though my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t love it), and it makes your beard smooth and shiny. It also helps with itching of facial hair. I got it mainly because my beard/facial hair is incredibly course and scratchy, and so can be really uncomfortable at times. So I bought this hoping it would make my beard softer. And while it did help with the itching, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really made it softer. But I simply might not be using it regularly enough. The other reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the container is pretty small for the price. But overall, a nice product.</li>
            <li> Simply regarding the concerns: Yes, it is a bit oily, but less is more. If you put 10 pumps of lotion on your hands, they&#x27;d be slimey too. It does have a scent, though it&#x27;s much more complex than anise (way to go to all the savvy dudes who knew how to describe licorice); it smells like chai and cedar, which I find rather pleasant. The one thing that I did have some difficulties with on rare occasion is melting the product. You take a very small amount of the paste and rub it between your fingertips to make a liquid that&#x27;s easy to apply. If your fingers are cold for some reason (say you just rinsed your toothbrush in cold water), this can be difficult. I employed a few solutions. One, simply putting some of the paste into my beard and allowing the heat from my face to melt it for dispersion worked fine, though this can leave one area bit concentrated. The easier solution, if you know your hands are cold, is to just run them in hot water for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for fathers day. I love the ingredients and the way it smells. I noticed a softening of his beard hairs rather quickly. I also use a little tiny bit on my own hair to tame fly aways. My husband has also started using a little bit in his hair and loves it there as well. It just seems to had a nice conditioned sheen. Its a little expensive but will go a long way if you use the amount you are supposed too. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Unlike some others, I like the scent. And it does dissipate rather quickly. The product does make my beard softer and more manageable. I just have to keep my dog from lapping it off. She seems to love it.</li>
            <li> Nice product. My first beard conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells quite masculine, like a mixture of licorice and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is practically solid when it arrives -- like a bunch of very fine pellets pressed into the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a relatively short beard, so I use just a little bit -- a little goes a long way. You have to melt it in your hand first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining this with a beard brush has made my beard more manageable, and keeps my face from getting dry underneath my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I first got it, expected it to be larger.  A little goes a long way, I spend time combing it in.  It does have a scent to me but I can&#x27;t imagine how much someone would have to put on at one time to be bothered by it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had people start conversations with me by asking about my beard.  More women seem to be joining that group.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift. While the product did a great job keeping his beard healthy and neat, the smell was a little bit much for me.</li>
            <li> I *almost* didn&#x27;t buy this stuff because of all the reviews that said it smells of black licorice. I HATE black licorice. If I could eliminate one taste from existence, it would be black licorice. But, the stories said the smell fades after an hour or so, and the product was highly rated so I went with it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually very relieved to receive the product and find that it smells like cloves, and not black licorice. Cloves I can handle. It&#x27;s a nice, warm smell instead of the cold and hateful stink of black licorice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the reviews are spot on - this stuff makes my beard feel nice. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to feel any conditioning effects yet, but it does make my beard behave. It&#x27;s naturally frizzy so I look forward to seeing what it looks like after a few weeks of using this balm.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Has a great scent; and when I don&#x27;t have time to use the Original wax it does a pretty good job of shaping my beard. Don&#x27;t have that itchy new beard feeling anymore. Softens my beard and gives just a little shine.</li>
            <li> The can is made to look larger in the picture which is deceptive.  The product is very greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the beard thus, even hours after application, if you stroke your beard you&#x27;ll be left with a greasy hand.</li>
            <li> Just a fantastic beard product! The smell is one of a kind and very unique, I enjoy it a good bit. It is a clove like smell with hints of other scents. The customer service is absolutely fantastic as well. Plus, you aren&#x27;t putting chemicals on your face. I was using a beard oil prior to trying this product, and was not one hundred percent satisfied due to still having problem areas with dry skin. This product helped for the better. Try this balm, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other beard balms and this one is pretty nice. The smell is not too strong at all...but you have to be careful and not apply too much or you will have a greasy weird beard. Just a dab will do. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and the scent is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product really works, beard feels soft and has a slight scent of licorice. It gets your hands a little greasy-&lt;br /&gt;If your growing a full beard, do yourself a favor and try this product--you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> Any man with a beard needs to invest in this conditioner. It improves feel, shine, and manageability. Plus I love the smell and so do the woman lucky enough to get close to it. This is not a substitute for beard wax and will not make truly rogue hairs lay down however Honest Amish makes beard wax as well. This is a every day leave in that just makes your beard even more awesome than it already is.</li>
            <li> Although I am not the wearer of this product I can attest that is DOES make a difference. This is truly not a wax like product, a little goes a long way though! Great to tame a few wild hairs but really noticeably softens the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman who has to smell the after-effects of anything that my significant other wears, I actually like the scent. It slowly fades to a barely there scent that reminds me of a sexy mountain man (think hot stud/not burly &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t shower man&amp;#34;).  On a side note, the burlap satchel packaging that it came in made it a great stocking stuffer!!</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this product! It has made his beard grow nice and full. It feels so soft too.</li>
            <li> Starting to become a fan of Honest Amish products ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been growing a beard (or atleast what I call a beard) on and off for the past couple of years.  Once she gets to be about 1&amp;#34; or so long ~ My hair follicles start to get extremely dry.  This dryness happens after the strong urge to itch ~ which I also can&#x27;t stand.  Once the itching faze starts, I start putting this in after each shower.  Smells good, a bit chunky, but dries clear ... Helps with the itch, and it keeps my beard looking fresh &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to having a beard. Most mornings I wake up and it feels like my face is covered with straw. Now, I just rub in a little Honest Amish and it feels normal. As others have mentioned, it softens your beard without being too greasy. Love this stuff, going to buy a tin for my brother.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have been using it for almost a full week now and already have good results from it.</li>
            <li> This was given as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it! He swears his beard is softer!! Thanks for a Great Product!!</li>
            <li> good beard wax, comes out of tin a bit grainy, but I rub it between my hands and it heats up and it melts. It smells a bit too much like wax, but good stuff. Would be 5 stars if it smelled better, but smell fades after the first 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> All I can say is perfect.  Leaves my beard silky smooth and smelling fresh.  I have been using other products for years and this one is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days but already seeing improvement in my steel wool. Pleasant smell, wife approves.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my second order! This is the softest my beard has ever been. There is a slight spice scent, but not over-powering. So far, I have found no oil residue on my collar shirt or jackets.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish gives your beard that healthy shine that you always wondered how someone else got</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I grow my beard out every winter and been look for some thing to keep it looking good.  This is the suff that does it.  My wife likes the feel of it and the smell.  I live in Wyoming and work out side every day.  This product keeps my beard soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I like it. Smell tones down after 15-20 ...depends on whether you have a strong sense of smell and whether or not you like the smell to start with. It&#x27;s a manly clove/outdoors scent. My beard itches 75-90% less now. Would and have recommended to others.</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I was a little concerned I wouldnt like this stuff, however, it is great!!!!! I will Fore Warn men though, This stuff is great in your beard, hair, and on you skin, HOWEVER, wash your hands after use. This product can irritate &amp;#34;Sensitive AREAS&amp;#34; if you catch my drift!!!! Other than that mishap, This product is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! The smell of Anise (licorice) is a little unpleasant but very subtle, most people might like it but I didn&#x27;t so I melted the balm and added a little scented oil of my own to change the smell. I poured it back into the tin and it&#x27;s been great. If they removed the anise oil, or whatever make that scent I&#x27;d buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li> It starts off as a solid and turns into oil as you rub it in your hands.  It initially smells like medicine (think Vicks vapor rub), but the scent goes away quickly.  Overall, I would probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  Like the smell too!  I have had a beard for years... Always unruly.  This has helped calm down my ADHD hairs.  Delivery was quick and just what I expected.  Would have given 5 stars, but this is the first product I have used on my beard and only have used it for about a week, so want to see how it goes over time.</li>
            <li> Works Great Smells Great</li>
            <li> This is the first beard balm/oil I have ever used so I cannot compare it to other brands, but I can say that it smells good, works its way into your beard easily and does not feel greasy or look greasy. It also, after extended use, leaves your beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Well this came in on time and I bought it right before I left for a mountain biking trip. My beard game was on point and I was excited to get this balm all buttered up in my brown strands. During the trip though, I hate a horrendous accident requiring an ER visit with lacerations to my head, around the eye and cheeks. Needless to say, they shaved the damn beard after I protested pleaded and almost damn near cried. I told them to leave the beard and let it heal, but they said I needed 20 stitches and that it would disfigure if I didn&#x27;t shave and get the stitches. So, in order to keep on my track as an amateur face and beard model, I had to take this blow (like a 4 yo hitting you under the belt) and man up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard&#x27;s gone...product looks great sitting there in my bathroom mocking me.</li>
            <li> awesome, best product for my beard, use when your beard is wet, smells good and is a great natural product</li>
            <li> Softens beard, ha odor but is not overwhelming. Put less under nose if odor is to strong. Makes beard less ichy does not poke spouse.</li>
            <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Ordering more today!! My beard has never been more full and soft after just one tin of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this Product.. Honest Amish RUles</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I like the smell of this beard treatment; the pleasing odor is half the point. After using it a few days, I have noticed my beard feels less itchy and brittle. I also feel less of a need to comb it every day.</li>
            <li> Got this and a beard comb for my husband and if your man is trying to grow a beard, this is a must to keep it neat and in check.</li>
            <li> The Cadillac of Bread balms..</li>
            <li> Great product love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now. My wife Loves the smell and says it has made my beard very soft. I love the product and will continue to use it, as long as I keep my beard.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It is not wet or greasy. A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good scent, not greasy, ordered again</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! A litte goes a long way; also using the heat of your palm rub it around to smooth it out.  After daily use, my husband&#x27;s beard is glossy, healthy, and shows less signs of split ends.  Thank you Honest Amish, we will purchase this time and time again.</li>
            <li> My score for this product might be different if I maintained a beard year-round; however, my knowledge is limited as I temporarily develop facial hair annually in order to have it removed along with the hair on my head as a fund-raising incentive for the supporters of a national campaign that raise money for childhood cancer research. For that reason I do not consider myself an authority when it comes to beard-care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this product lives up to its claims and unless I am introduced to something better, I will likely buy it again when I grow a beard for next year&#x27;s and future fund-raising campaigns.</li>
            <li> Im a bit disappointed, not really of the product but the tin it comes in. When i got mine, the box it came in had no shipping damage but the tin the balm is in was dented where the threads in the cap are. It got delivered on a hot day here in co-cal so the balm was melted. So most of it leaked out into the box due to the damaged tin. I cleaned it up, tightened the cap as much as i could, and put it away to firm up. It really sucks because this stuff is pretty expensive and im left with about 1/4 of it left before even using it. The tin is very thin almost as thin as a soda can so it bends to easy.... it would be nice if they could make the tin a bit more sturdy for what you pay for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the Beard balm itself. I put some in my beard when i got home from work after a shower. It made my beard more manageable, looked good, and smelled good. If it was not for the crappy tin it came in i would give it 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for sometime. When I had a duck dynasty like beard it worked great to soften the pube like hair on my face. I had to trim close for a business meeting and works well on a neatly trimmed beard also. Lastly myself and my wife like the smell.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS SO GOOD I CANT BELIEVE IT. IT&#x27;S REALLY JUST CRAZY OILS BUT THEY SMELL SO GOOD THO. GET A BOAR BRISTLE BRUSH AND WORK A TINY BIT OF THIS GOOD SMELLUM INTO YOUR FACE BUSH. SILKY, SMOOTH, SOFT, MANAGEABLE, NO TANGLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM AN OLD BEARDO.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t wait to purchase other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Great product. The smell takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff but the jar wasn&#x27;t completely full and it&#x27;s already a small container to begin with.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  Smells pretty nice.  The photo is a little misleading, looks like the size of a tobacco tin and its not its about the size of a half dollar.  Would recommend the wax if you expect the balm will hold shape, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a chance despite the strong black licorice smell, since I paid a fortune for such a tiny little tin.  I like the balm, don&#x27;t care for the scent, but that does fade after you apply it. I MIGHT buy it again</li>
            <li> It did marginally soften up my beard, but it has an overwhelming smell of licorice to it which I suppose isn&#x27;t so bad if you like that smell, but I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li> I was using various oils in my beard, all of which left my beard feeling oily and just wouldn&#x27;t soak in. This on the other hand works great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about an oily beard smearing oil all over my cloths and if I were to stroke my beard I&#x27;m not left with an oily residue on my hands. If your going to grow a beard, you&#x27;ll need a good beard oil to manage it properly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Really softens up coarse beard and give it s nice shine! It&#x27;s a little pricey for me to pay for a beard product, but you can tell its high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> OK, I guess has a rather strong medial order ...can&#x27;t use on my mustache.... I&#x27;d need to trim off like an Omish man</li>
            <li> I have very wiry beard hair and was hoping that this balm would help to soften it up. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any real softening after 2.5 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes yer beard soft(er)! One tin lasted me about a year. You only need a small pinch of the stuff to rub into your wet beard.</li>
            <li> Smells good, like the fact that leave in all day.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few days and beards feeling doll hair soft already. Plus the emails checking in on their customers are a nice touch. Good company all around.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It really does make my beard much more manageable.  This is my first attempt at a long term beard and I&#x27;m telling all my friends about Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. It definitely makes the beards softer and easier to manage. Came way faster than expected, too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband liked this product a lot. He wanted something natural for his beard, and it does a great job of keeping it smooth and moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Works good and smells good too. Wish it came in a larger size but if you use it as directed it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Works well, my wife says it smells like &amp;#34;Whole Foods&amp;#34;. Not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad ;-)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product as any of the other reviews will tell you. One tub lasts me about a year and i use it 4-5 times a week. Smells very nice also, like how i would imagine an honest amish to smell. Great product, go for it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked this beard balm for his grizzly winter beard. It&#x27;s definitely oily, but smells clean, not chemically. He grows a pretty thick beard, so this doesn&#x27;t work to keep all of the wirey hairs smooth, but helped it stay soft. Not a big container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product. The only thing that is off putting is the smell. I don&#x27;t mind it so much but my wife says it makes me smell like an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Rub some between your palms for two seconds and it completely melts in to a nice uniform oil. Works well and and I find that the [nice] smell fades away pretty quickly after application.&lt;br /&gt;Also, on I days I feel like using mustache wax, it is a lot easier to apply after I have used my Amish Beard Balm</li>
            <li> Smelled great and left my beard smooth, but after two uses, I realized I&#x27;m probably allergic to it. I got a massive headache both times I used it and my skin felt numb. My wife chucked it the morning after my second use. Just be really careful if you have a nut allergy.</li>
            <li> BIL had some, hubby tried, and I bought! :) Everyone is happy with the results, and less complaints of scraggly beard now! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best beard conditioner on the market, honestly.</li>
            <li> The stuff works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Gives beard a nice gloss but other than that not much conditioning to beard. Its like rubbing olive oil in your beard so if you dont want oil on your face then this is not for you. I used it a few times and that is it.</li>
            <li> Made my beard feel amazing from the first time I used it .,,. The scent is faint so I doesn&#x27;t clash with my normal cologne I use</li>
            <li> I have been using Honest Amish Conditioner for about 4 months now daily! This makes my beard feel smooth all day! I use to dry out in the evening, but not with this product. Buy this if you love your beard!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but . . . in the last few tins the conditioner has been beaded up into little balls. Makes it much harder to use.</li>
            <li> It leaves my glorious beard shiny and increased my testosterone. I can now leap tall buildings in a single suspendered workbooted bound. since using the product on my pride and joy I can miraculously build the best furniture ever. I&#x27;m pretty sure they stuffed cherub angels in the tin that blow kisses to the strands of my beard all day long. What I mean is, I like it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this balm and am about to order 3 more containers</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  It does have a nice smell and it did make his beard softer.  I was skeptical but it did what it said it would.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and well worth every penny. Smells great, conditions your beard nicely, and stays true to its claim that you do not need to use this every day to get the full effect. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright beard balm, but the smell is nasty. Definitely not using it again.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife not only is not disgusted by its fragrance, but actively enjoys it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5: Would buy again. (and have).</li>
            <li> Using along with a beard oil and have seen dramatic change in the moisture of my facial hair. My beard use to be extremely dry but now it&#x27;s more healthy then ever.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cool...it melts right in your hand and blends nicely into the beard...for several hours my beard looks very shiny and healthy...often times a beard looks dull...but this stuff makes it look dapper</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has a mild odor of clove oil, and my beard hair sucks it right up! It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling once applied and absorbed to my beard, and my beard has never felt more soft! I&#x27;m a new loyal customer!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - really helps keep my beard soft.  I do not like the scent because I do not like licorice but after it is on I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference the first day I put this balm in my beard.  Keeps my beard fresh and looking well kept.</li>
            <li> It does softer the beard but it doesnt tame it as much as people claim and the scent is so so. The worst part is dealing with the company which doesnt take customer questions very well. First and last time I buy from Honest Amish,.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves it. It smells great and keeps those wispy whiskers in place. Yay!</li>
            <li> Great gift! Great Product!  Asset to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Will order more.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and at times it seems to have mind of it&#x27;s own.  A year or so ago I ordered Honest Amish Beard conditioner from Amazon.  Along with it I ordered the Heavy Duty Beard Conditioner.  I loved both.  They make my beard softer and more manageable and it has a healthy sheen, almost a glisten.  But the best part was the smell.  It smelled like citrus, manly citrus, and was a nice refreshing scent that you got throughout the day.  Best, my wife loved the fragrance too.  When both of those were used up I ordered more of the regular beard conditioner.  It appears to be the same stuff but there is no scent. None.  To me, not having that citrus scent really diminishes the pleasure of using the product.  Now it is just another product, a treatment rather than a treat.  Don&#x27;t know why they would take the scent out but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll  buy it again without the scent. If they put it back I&#x27;d give it five stars and buy some more.!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve just got to the point where I have full coverage on my face, but I have problems with dryness, itchiness, random stray hairs sticking out in odd directions etc ... after using Honest Amish for a little over a week, my beard looks better than it ever has: fuller, thicker, softer and way easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice.. kind of weird smell but fades nearly instantly</li>
            <li> Great smell, gives your beard a nice sheen, and softens it up</li>
            <li> Fantastic beard balm!&lt;br /&gt;I grow a beard every November, which usually stays with me through the duration of the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;This beard balm provides a clean, quality ingredient profile that acts fast and provides a shine and smoothness where other products have fallen short. A little bit goes a long ways, and as a result, I suspect I&#x27;ll easily get another winter season out of my single container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out, I will absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Helped me grow my beard fast!</li>
            <li> This will give your beard a decent moisturizing and a bit of a sheen. It does have a stronger smell that will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this product. The smell is weak, but it&#x27;s kind of grassy, and not to my liking. It is oil, so it does leave your skin oily if it gets outside of your beard. Other than making me oily, I really can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s doing anything for me. I guess if you have a long beard then it would probably look good and work well, but for a short beard it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> I have one of those mustache and goatee combos that looks like I just rolled out of bed even after I shower and trim it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the strength of the reviews and I am gald I did. My facial hair is much softer and easier to groom. Now I look like I actually did pay attention to how I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. A single tin will last a few weeks of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle and manly. And it soon fades. By the time I get to the office I am barely aware that I have put anything in my facial hair aisde from how pleasantly soft it has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it I asked my wife to \\&quot;smell my beard\\&quot;, which out of context is a very strange request. She did and reported the scent to be quite faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and have recommended Honest Amish Beard Balm to friends.</li>
            <li> Looks bigger in the picture. &amp;#34;that&#x27;s what she said.&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a solid product. it should last me a long time mainly because you really don&#x27;t need much. And I have a fairly sized beard.</li>
            <li> This is actually kind of a difficult product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I bought this because I wanted a beard that wouldn&#x27;t make my wife hate me.  See, I like my beard.  But my wife doesn&#x27;t fancy kissing a hobo so I had to tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing to know is that this is NOT some kind of shaping or styling balm.  It will NOT keep down unruly hairs or help you style a long bear.  This product, at least for me, was purely about keeping my beard soft and pleasant for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does the job in that respect, but there are some things you need to know.  While it may soften your beard, it will also make it a bit oily for a while.  As someone who constantly plays with his beard, this kind of got me to stop doing that.  I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.  However, if you like running your hands through your chin forest, be advised they will come away like you&#x27;ve been cleaning up an oil spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is quite easy to use and even Mungo Man could have figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s the hard part of the review; will YOU like the scent?  I can&#x27;t tell you.  It&#x27;s...unique.  If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who enjoys the smell of mud and greasy car parts or who inhales deeply the burning lawn debris of your neighbor, then you will probably like this stuff.  If you wear cologne made by wealthy Frenchists or you get your hair cut once a week and shop for underwear in catalogs, then you probably won&#x27;t.  Is that vague and mildly offensive to some?  Yeah, but it&#x27;s the best way I can try to be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife doesn&#x27;t seem to even notice the smell and for me it&#x27;s usually gone in 10 minutes after application so it&#x27;s kind of a non- factor.  Still, it seems to be a point of contention among the reviewers here.  I don&#x27;t think anyone will be able to tell you whether you will like it or not.  You&#x27;ll just have to take the risk.  Scent aside, this is a pretty good product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off a star because it hasn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  Since I don&#x27;t have a control beard growing somewhere else on my body, I don&#x27;t know what it would feel like if I weren&#x27;t using the stuff, though.asn&#x27;t made my beard as soft as I would like since I started using it.  Since I don&#x27;t have a control beard growing somewhere else on my body, I don&#x27;t know what it would feel like if I weren&#x27;t using the stuff, though.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my brother who grew his beard out.  His girlfriend thanked me for getting it for him because his beard looked sharper and it was softer.  My brother really liked it and bought more when he finished this tin.  It was definitely pricey for the quantity you get.  But hey.... when you are sporting a sweet beard what is money?</li>
            <li> Goes in easy and I use it everyday. Great stuff for my beard (now a goatee). I would like to see them come out with a bigger can though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that actually works! I use it right after I get out of the shower and my facial hair is noticeably softer and shinier. It also helps keep those pesky stray hairs in check and promotes good beard growth. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s daunting to spend that much on so little product, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  It&#x27;ll make your beard softer than an asthmatic&#x27;s dying breath.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my beard is coming along in leaps and bounds in a controlled fashion. Good for dudes with beards.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my beard has grown better, felt better, and looked better. Literally since day one using it I started getting compliments on my beard. No joke… from day one.</li>
            <li> Smells like black liquorice. Will update if it is worth fighting the smell.</li>
            <li> Great beard softening cream. Well packaged, good instructions for use, top value.&lt;br /&gt;They are an eco conscious company and I would definitely order more of their product in the future.</li>
            <li> I thought it was OK.  Felt like it was too greasy for me.  I stopped using it after about a week, because it was just too greasy.  I guess I expected it have the consistency of wax instead.  It does smell great though!</li>
            <li> A mild, earthy smell. It goes in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your hands and it does a good job of softening the beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow beard on and off for years could never get past the itchiness in the dry skin any ingrown hairs.i found this product which has stop the itching and has stopped the ingrown hair feels and smells wonderful and it&#x27;s all natural love it</li>
            <li> I am just starting down the journey of growing a beard, this beard balm works well and is easy to apply.  I have noticed that the growing itch while not completely gone is not near as bad.  If you are wanting to try and tame your beard while growing it this works great for that.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Better than I expected Thank You Kindly.</li>
            <li> Been using for a week now and am pleased. I always took good care of my beard (Argin oil, natural shampoos and conditioners and even some home made family recipe balm) So I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in my facial hair using this. But anyone out there who has neglected their beard or just shampoos and conditions it will probably see huge improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good-&lt;br /&gt;Works well to condition my beard and skin.&lt;br /&gt;Works well to keep my beard hairs in check.&lt;br /&gt;Is a suitable replacement for my families home made balm that my grand parents made (Trust me that is a huge complement from me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less than Good.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have commented on the smell of this balm. Some love it, others don&#x27;t mind it, I nearly hate it! The good news is that I am going to make it REALLY simple for you to decide whether you will like it or not! Go to the store and buy a bag of black licorice and smell it. It&#x27;s THAT simple! It smells EXACTLY like that. I don&#x27;t much like licorice, and I hate the smell. Since this balm is sitting under my nose it makes me very self conscious for about an hour till the scent luckily dies down and nearly vanishes. This however I won&#x27;t hold against them as they DO sell an unscented one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thing I don&#x27;t like. A weird cross promotion with Duck Dynasty makes me take this otherwise great brand slightly less seriously.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I was afraid of previous reviews that said it smells like anise (I hate black licorice). I think maybe it kinda does, but more of a natural spicy woodsy scent. Smells clean, and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Only had it for a week, so trying to adjust how much to use. But, my beard is already more manageable, softer, cleaner - just looks more healthy! I feel better about my appearance, and since it is right on my face, I feel better about myself! I wish I could use it more.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this stuff! He isn&#x27;t the grooming sort so I wanted something masculine he would use. He always comained his beard was itchy and this took care of that. The smell is wonderful, I can&#x27;t quite place it...maybe homemade pie, citrus, spices, and man! His bear is shiny and healthier looking. I will for sure order more.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my beard shine! :)</li>
            <li> I never used anything in my beard before.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t imagine not. This makes it soft and the scent is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I Like the way it feels on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and organic so what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> Today is the second application and I like it so far. My only small gripe is the scent, which is very not overpowering, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is almost like Menthol, sans the cooling effect. It&#x27;s 10 degrees out today and I&#x27;m happy to declare there is no itching.</li>
            <li> First, do not use too much if you have a short beard. My beard is not that long, a good 4 1/2 inches, and I only use the back of my thumb nail for measuring the amount. Next, it is kind of gresy, but not a whole lot. Like I said, the longer the more you&#x27;ll need; if shorter like mine, just the back of your nail is fine. It is grainy but not that kind of grainy that you have to rub and rub to disappear. In less than 5 seconds, the grains will disappear as soon as it gets warm. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold but will straighten out rogue hairs (I have a few). Once straighten, they pretty much stay like that while  being soft and no greasy or heavy feeling to it. I noticed that If I keep combing it all day the hairs stay straighten, so keep that in mind. MOST IMPORTANTLY, The SCENT. One reviewer described it as \\&quot;in the middle\\&quot; and I have to agree. When first applying it, it smells kind of strong. But it goes away after maybe 20 -30 minutes, maybe sooner. Then , you can barely smell it, if at all. I think if you can manage it the first few minutes after applying it, I think you&#x27;ll like it. Plus, I love that it&#x27;s a nice quantity. The tin is pretty big compared to two other balms I&#x27;ve tried.  Ultimately, I like it plain and simple. Like other researchers, I hope this helps. #Keepbearding</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. My beard is so soft. I touch it all day lol.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt or seen an long term benefits to using this cream, but it works great for a clean and healthy look for a few hours.  The smell is very manly, but my wife is not a fan.</li>
            <li> Pretty new to caring for my beard and heard about this stuff. After applying it, my beard definitely got softer and was easier to shape. I actually like the scent of the stuff, but I&#x27;ve read that others do not like the smell. It&#x27;s a sort of black licorice smell though. Definitely going to get the larger size one next time though. Overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my beard soft and manageable, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Have been growing beards on and off since the age of 21. Now at the age of 61 a new beard surfaced and it is presently 7&amp;#34; long, who knows how long it will grow at my age. Anyway, was reading about all the new age, organic, botanical, feel good advertisement on all the stuff you can improve your beards health and appearance with and tried a few things at the grocery store and pharmacy............. forget that. Now, let&#x27;s be honest ( Amish ), appearance has not been the top of the priority list when beards frequented my life, wash, comb, go......... but I was thinking that what I was reading may have some validity to it, that beards were no different than head hair, you spend time and money on that so........ I&#x27;ll give it a try. Why did I select Honest Amish ? Fantastic sale, all the ingredients except the kitchen sink, and, a money back guarantee, not to mention the cool packaging. Using it lived up to it&#x27;s billing, great stuff. It does what it says it will do and I believe that if I grow this sucker out to a foot it will be healthy and look good for a long time. I like Honest Amish so much that my urge to try another balm or oil has been subdued. If you have a beard with any length to it try Honest Amish, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. P.S. They also have soaps, lip balms that are great as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my beard.  Easy to use.  Keeps it smooth and in-shape.  Better than other oils that I tried.</li>
            <li> My Beard loves Honest Amish.&lt;br /&gt;Beard™ approved. +++++</li>
            <li> First time really growing my beard out and wasn&#x27;t sure how to best &#x27;keep&#x27; it.  This stuff is exactly what I needed.  It goes in easy, smells good and I&#x27;m not putting any chemicals in.  My beard looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times so far I am definitely liking it. I was trying to decide between the Honest Amish beard balm or their light-hold beard wax and the balm ultimately won out due to the fact that it had far more benefits than the wax, or it at least listed more in the write-up. The main reason I was in the market for a product like this was because I wanted to get my beard more under contol, which implies using wax instead since the balm made no mention of using it for styling purposes, and the usual grooming just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Luckily my beard isn&#x27;t very long, so the balm at least helps with styling somewhat, but I also have the added bonus of reduced itch and a moderatly pleasant scent. Perhaps in time the occassional itch/dryness will be completely gone and my beard will become more full, as the balm indicates it should do, but only time will tell</li>
            <li> Its kind of gritty, greasy, and messy. Smells like America.</li>
            <li> Order arrived in a timely manner. Made a perfect christmas. This gift along with the beard and mustache comb that I ordered have really helped my boyfriend with his new beard.</li>
            <li> This is great for a beginner in beard grooming. I will order more soon</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!  It tames the fly aways and softens the scraggly hairs.  It makes his beard look much better and softer!</li>
            <li> A little oiler than my husband prefers, but he likes it. Does the job.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wicked good. Love the feel and what it does for beards!</li>
            <li> Feels really great on my beard and applies really easy. Makes my beard feel soft, moisturized and non greasy for a full day. Definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I personally did not like this stuff. Only bc of the smell. It reminded me of black liquorice and i cant stand that smell.  Good stuff, minus the smell.</li>
            <li> Hub said this worked well he could definitely tell a difference in his beard....as can I.....softer :-)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly to wrangle in those loose strands. Leaves my beard smelling great and feeling fantasticly soft.. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have already been recommending this product to my friends! It helps with your beards grooming, shaping and softens your beard too.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply evenly to my beard. The smell is not something I enjoyed. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have decided to try growing my beard out, as I normally shave every other week or so. As you more gifted beard growers may know, this results in a itchy, dry, flaky beard. I was close to shaving it off when I learned of beard oils (who knew something like this existed? Not I). I ended up finding Honest Amish here and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night and this morning, I have no itch and very little flakes in my beard (or under it), the only place flakes reside now is on my upper lip area, where I didn&#x27;t apply Honest Amish. After just one use, my hairs feel less coarse as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product itself. Yes, it is a bit greasy, but if you use the amount suggested (a pea size amount), it&#x27;s not too bad and works well. The smell varies on you, it won&#x27;t be the same for everyone, and by that I mean your bodies chemistry may result in a slightly different smell, either way, for me, it wasn&#x27;t terrible or over-powering and I&#x27;ll use it again with no reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with Honest Amish so far (AFTER JUST ONE USE!), so I eagerly await further results and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Happy Guy, Happy Beard</li>
            <li> The aroma made me think of a sawmill, not unpleasant, but not as nice as some other balms.  Also felt a bit more oily than other balms that I have tried.  Provided a nice shine to the beard, but did not provide much control.</li>
            <li> First: when you get the product, if it&#x27;s not cold outside - put it into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes - else, it may be melted into a liquid. At minimum - unscrew carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, you&#x27;ll notice right off how small the container is. The picture makes it look like a large can of shoe polish, but it&#x27;s really tiny for the price. However, credit where it&#x27;s due: a little goes a long way, and it really adds a great shine to your beard. If you have a mixture of hair colors and coarseness - the oil will bring out subtle highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a short goatee &amp; permanent 2nd day stubble, and use this on both. It takes matte hair and gives it a lot of character. It makes it slightly softer. Slightly. Reduces itch better than moisturizer, though I rarely am bothered by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the smell, I wish it were neutral because I feel like it&#x27;s competing with my cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crunchy granola at all and don&#x27;t give a rip about its ingredients other than it has the butters and oils I read are good for beards. I&#x27;m on my second tin now and it really does improve the condition and shape of a good 2&amp;#34; or longer beard and keeps 1&amp;#34; beards from getting split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dab will do for each section and, while it is a tad on the strong side, the smell is not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> makes your beard feel amazing</li>
            <li> Works so insanely well on my thick beard!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and keeps my beard much softer. My wife thinks it&#x27;s too strong, smells like herbs rosemary but I like it a lot.apply then brush the beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help control my beardruf. It eliminated it. Will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Adds a great sheen and some control for stray hairs. This stuff really takes your beard to the next level.</li>
            <li> Got this in conjunction with a boars hair brush and another beard treatment (Beard Oil) product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of an odor with this, but I like the smell so it&#x27;s not a problem to me.  Can see it being an issue for some though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like how it helps my beard lay down and look clean/straight all day.  The control is definitely what I wanted out of the product.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for my 2.5 Inch beard. Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, really guys? It smells like a wood shop, or pine. You&#x27;re growing a beard--not an herb garden. Sack up boys.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I can definitely tell a difference in my beard when I use it vs when I don&#x27;t.  It just feels softer and cleaner and it&#x27;s more manageable.  That being said, I&#x27;m not sure a tin will last me terribly long, and I kinda wish it was bigger, but maybe I&#x27;m being a little greedy.  Still, I give it full marks.</li>
            <li> A healthy beard makes my wife complain like 5% less. I&#x27;ll take what I can get. Also, I noticed less crying due to my hair daggers no longer piercing me.</li>
            <li> I Love the scent and feel of this amazing thing. And I thing my stubble beard feels the same too. :)</li>
            <li> My beard rarely itches since I started using this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling waxy or oily, either.</li>
            <li> my son loves it even more than expected thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> On time, I&#x27;ve tried it, and works well.</li>
            <li> Arrived two days earlier than expected.  First time using any kind of products on my beard.  Love the look and feel of my beard more than before.  Will definitely buy this product again...</li>
            <li> Smells great but it didn&#x27;t last long and it separates in the jar a lot. Have to shake it up often.</li>
            <li> Could not tolerate the smell of the product - used twice.</li>
            <li> its my first beard balm so I dont really have a good opinion, its ok. also the smell is not bad, but my girlfriend doesnt really dig it, so next time prbably will go for the option with no smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Bought this after doing some research on Reddit and saw this was highly recommended as an alternative to oils. Obviously it was hot when it arrived but the included instructions (in case it happened) were very useful. Scent is like licorice or Jaegermeister but goes away in about 5 minutes. Left my beard soft and smooth. After a bit in my air conditioned (read as cold) house it separated and because hard to mix but all I did was place it in a cup with a little hot water and then let cool and was good as new. Will totally buy more products from Honest Amish.</li>
            <li> Awesome, leaves my beard soft and smelling great. Does a good job of taming most stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Well, after using this for the better part of 2 months, I&#x27;m in love. I enjoy it even more than beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is addictive, the conditioning is just right, and my beard looks and feels better than ever. Now I&#x27;m dying to try their other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have is that, after application, the scent fades so quickly. I wish it were a bit stronger and could last through the day.</li>
            <li> I dont know why others complained about the smell: my boyfriend and I, both like the herbal fragrance. The product is a bit greasy, but this doesnt seem to be a problem for my boyfriend. He said the product helps manage his beard better, but he is not sure about its conditioning abilities.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. The gritty texture is not appealing to me and the scent is really bad. I also found it to be overall not very effective on my beard.</li>
            <li> Got this stuff a while back. The smell is not even nearly as bad as people make it up to be unless you have a sensative K9 nose. It smells manly, not like cologne but more of a woodsy, plant type smell. It works fantastic and helps make the hairs soft, shiny and keep them down. Word of advice, don&#x27;t put too much or it&#x27;ll get oily. A small amount goes a long way with a damp beard.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in beard conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  It goes in easy, helps control my beard, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too oily.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> great! definiteyl recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells way better than some of the other balms I&#x27;ve tried. Feels buttery and natural. Keeps my beard soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Softens and tames the wildness that is my beard. Love the scent. Took once or twice to get used to smell but now I love it. An integral part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Very weird smell. Not easy to get past. It worked on beard but I stopped using it from fragrance. It&#x27;s like black liquorice and lemons in a old wood trunk</li>
            <li> Just takes a small bit on a finger for my long goatee. I put it on right out of the shower. Its a little oily at first, but after a couple of hours it soaks in. I believe my can will last me a 3 months using just a dab every other day. If you have a large beard probably 1 or 2 months. smell is nice &amp; mellow. Makes my Large Goatee soft &amp; easy to run my comb thru.</li>
            <li> I use all there products there beard oil and balms are great.I like to mix it up I use both.</li>
            <li> This product looked A LOT bigger on Amazon than when I received it. It&#x27;s extremely small for the amount paid. However, it smells really, really, great and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> works wells and is great toknow its natural, my beard seems to like it</li>
            <li> Read the directions and wash your hands after!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Simple, natural, and works perfectly. A pleasant anise scent, which is not overpowering. Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the wax as well to test them out. This conditioner is really good at giving your beard a softness without feeling too greasy. It is not really for styling but is all about conditioning. I use it if I just want the beard softened, especially in drier weather. I live in Vegas so the summers can be a bit brutal on skin and hair. The scent is on the manly side but also a bit mediciny. My wife likes the scent and how it makes my beard feel so I will stay with this product.</li>
            <li> Pleasant hippie-esque smell.</li>
            <li> Prompt, trouble-free service. The product, as advertized, helps in grooming my relatively new beard. It would have been helpful to have more complete information about the variety of products  available</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell blends in well, easy to apply beard not as dry and helps with the&lt;br /&gt;itch. I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised</li>
            <li> Makes my face way too oily and stinks</li>
            <li> This BEAR BALM is AMAZING. Its great for my beard  and I use daily and ALSO LOVE\. I also have the This BEAR SOAP and its also AMAZING. Its great for my beard and for my my head and body. The aroma it releases is also great/ My girlfriend is always complimenting and honestly I enjoy that my bathroom now smells like it all the time. Its great on my sensitive skin as well, doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything for that matter. I use their BEARD BALM, which I use daily and ALSO LOVE and I&#x27;m waiting for the BEARD WAX for control that should arrive soon. Thank you for making a great product and for having great customer service so far. Smooth transaction from start to finish and reply to any concerns.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product.  It helps keep my beard manageable and it conditions as well.  It also has a good smell.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products but none are close to matching up to this quality.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sported a short beard on and off for the last several years. I had the consistent problem of my chin becoming unbearably itchy every time I let the beard grow past a certain length. After some research online I was led to beard balms and eventually to Honest Amish. From the first time I applied it, the itching issue disappeared. Simply melt the wax between your palms and apply. The balm will keep your beard and more importantly, the skin underneath well hydrated. While some other reviews have complained about the smell, I find it mildly pleasant and it&#x27;s generally extremely light unless you apply a lot of the balm. It will cause your beard to become somewhat oily, depending on how much you use. It will rub off on your hands if you run them through your beard, even hours later. It does give some extremely light hold, but on &amp;#34;bad beard days&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s not up to the task of taming stray hairs. 4 stars only because of the lack of any hold. All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li> One can has lasted me 3 months, it is oily on the hands after application, but it truly stops beard dander and itchy face. The trick is to use just enough and apply long past after you think you used up on your fingers. The smell is nice, kind of seasonal like fresh cloves and honey. Apply in the morning or it might grease up your pillow.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell, just personally dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> Used on goatee and mustache.  Left beard very soft but a little greasy at first.  Nice fragrance.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> After using many beard oils, I was worried about trying another one.  This product is great!  But beware, a little bit goes a long way!  The microbeads melt in your hand and a small amount is all you need.</li>
            <li> Gift for don who failed to tell me he shaved long beard off for Christmas!! So I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t say. He said it would had been great for when he was itchy! Lol Came quick!</li>
            <li> Smells great (fades after about 20 minutes). Definitely does what it says by making your beard smooth and soft, and appear much more groomed.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff, smells great, and I generally hate scented things. Works great</li>
            <li> I never have had an issue with scented oils, cologne, or anything else I put on my body/face. But after applying this to my beard I immediately had an outburst of allergy reactions in my nose and I&#x27;ve since been fighting a high irritable sense of smell that causes my nose to run and symptoms of a cold running down into my throat. It turns out I am allergic to this beard balm because the scent is too strong for me. I reapplied it after waiting 5 days of non-use and sure enough my nose started reacting heavily to the scent again. I definitely cannot use this product. Note, this product did NOT irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one am not happy with the smell. Smells like a hippy + licorice and is not pleasant for someone that wants to smell nice to colleagues in the office. Strangely I like the smell of licorice but something isn&#x27;t right with this scent. It&#x27;s quite obvious to people near you where the smell is coming from, and overall I do not think it is very pleasant. My girlfiend does not like it. Nor do any other girls I&#x27;ve asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the natural conditioning properties it has... I&#x27;m sure it works well and can soften your beard, it&#x27;s easy to apply and adds a bit of shine to the beard. But after using this product for a short while I don&#x27;t feel any better and realize that a freshly washed and groomed beard is better than a pungent hippie beard.</li>
            <li> I live in a town where organic rules, and I&#x27;ve smelled this smell many times. So I&#x27;m used to it, and actually like it. Some people it might take some getting used to. I lose the smell after about an hour, maybe more if i lay it on thick. I use it every other/few days and I totally feel I made a great purchase with this. This is what you need to put on your beard if you&#x27;re trying to grow one at the beginning. It helps prevent split ends and smooths the hairs down for a softer feel. I felt a little girly getting this(conditioner... for a beard nonetheless), but now I&#x27;m convinced I made a pretty decent choice.</li>
            <li> This is the only product l will use on my beard!!!  Always arrives quickly after order, one can lasts about 2 months for me, l highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works really well. the Smell can be a bit strong, although not particularly unpleasant. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Husband loves that it seems to make his beard softer and more conditioned. Smells kinda like hippies though.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice if you like earthy, slightly menthol smells.  Regardless of your tolerance for fragrance it doesn&#x27;t stay strong for long.  It does seem to immediately make the beard more manageable.  this, along with a good shower beard routine will help your beard grow nice and strong.  Rub it in, and comb it through.  Added about 20 seconds to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in the feel of my beard. I keep a shorter beard and a small amount of this balm goes a long way. The scent is nice. It&#x27;s so subtle I hardly notice after a few minutes. My girlfriend noticed the difference immediately. Looking forward to trying out more Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit musty, but the odor goes away within minutes.  The instructions that are included in the product are a useful guide to having a softer, cleaner beard.  4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and great product.  makes my beard soft and smells good.  I will be ordering the larger size when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! This is my 1st time using this brand of beard balm but I am impressed! Thimbs up!</li>
            <li> it has a weird texture but u can tell its organic, I loved using it, it seems the one is enough for 2-3 weeks, i really like the feeling it gives my bear and also it has a nice honey vanilla to it,,, its an absolute the best beard balm</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this product!</li>
            <li> Item works well. And it the smell keeps my wife away. Great product if you want a softer beard.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he LOVED it. He hasn&#x27;t found a beard balm he enjoys more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much. And it softens and tames that hair on my face. I can really tell the difference if I fail to apply it. The can is bullet-proof with a manly threaded lid. The whole thing comes in a small burlap &amp;#34;ditty bag.&amp;#34; Just do it.</li>
            <li> smells a little licorice-ish, but if you like that this cream will give your beard a shine she will remember :-)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon, ever. The smell of this conditioner is superb. So much so, that every time I use it, I make my wife smell my beard. She may be getting tired of me telling her that, but with such an amazing smelling product in the hairs on my face, I&#x27;m going to keep telling her.&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday after I take a shower. I dry off the beard that I just washed in the shower. While it is still damp I pull out just a bit, rub it in my hands until completely liquidated, and then rubbing it through my beard. It&#x27;s the best morning ritual I have. (I excluded the last part about where I have my wife smell my beard, but that&#x27;s because I just told you all about it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product as I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My beard is better than ever! I use it in my hair too to give it that same look.</li>
            <li> Smells good on my husband and has a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping like everything from Amazon. After using Honest Amish Beard Balm now for a week, I&#x27;m very impressed. No more beard itch which was putting me close to shaving it off. Now it feels soft and so much more comfortable to wear. Great product and I&#x27;ll be buying some more!!</li>
            <li> I received my item extremely dented! Not to happy that I spent money on something that was in such poor shape.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of softening and conditioning your beard.  Any woman can confirm that.  Subtle fragrance and gentle shine.  This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Smells nice,remember just a little dab will do ya.&lt;br /&gt; Too much and beard will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> You get an insufficient amount of product for the price and I feel it does a less than average job. I was using Proraso Beard Balm before this and wanted to try the natural/organic route and it didn&#x27;t pay off. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Smells bad and doesn&#x27;t soften beard.</li>
            <li> Product separates easily -- came separated even when new. They sure put a lot of extra packaging on it to make the claim that they&#x27;re trying to be &#x27;all natural&#x27;, as part of being natural is not using excessive packaging. The smell is ok but tends to linger all day... so if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells then maybe this isn&#x27;t the right beard balm for you. Overall it is comparable to other beard balms, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Very impressed, makes my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend decided to let his beard go full Duck Dynasty there was no changing his mind so I figured if i can&#x27;t beat him, make it manageable. This product is definitely leading us in the right direction. His beard is way softer than before although there is still some courseness to it. He only uses it abt every other day to avoid greasiness and the smell is a bit strong at first but it dissipates fairly quickly and it (slowly) starts to grow on you. Other than that, he loves it and  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very bad smell and not effective at all, plus it melts pretty quick</li>
            <li> My SIL loves thi product. My daughter isn&#x27;t wild about the fragrance, but he really likes it. He has a very long beard and this product does much to keep it healthy and looking good. We will buy it Spain.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it and I will definitely continue to buy it.  First time I&#x27;ve grown a beard and it helped ease the itchiness at first.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves small granules in beard, makes beard oily not soft. A leave in hair conditioner works much better.  Also it smells like herbal tea and mothballs for 2 hours after application.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a very smooth and slightly glossy look to your beard. It also does not have the petroleum-like residue that other lotions do. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome balm for the beard and mustache.  My beard used to itch, but not anymore thanks to this balm.</li>
            <li> Feels great in the beard.</li>
            <li> my beard loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and have been thoroughly satisfied. It works very nicely on controlling unruly gray whiskers.a</li>
            <li> I had never grown a beard long enough to require any maintenance, but I must say this stuff worked great.  Kept my beard from going crazy, and gave me some shine.  My wife didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but it didn&#x27;t bother me any.</li>
            <li> Tried a few beard oils, this worked a lot better for me. I love the smell and feel of it on my skin. Great product, will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Made a noticeable difference in the texture of my beard almost immediately. It got even better after a week of use. Not too oily with a nice, woody aroma.</li>
            <li> My beard was growing in all directions but within a week of using this product its manageable and looks healthier. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells awesome and feel like my beard is much healthier and growing better than before I used it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Smells great and does soften the beard as soon as it&#x27;s applied!! Two thumbs up! Definitely recommending :-)</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a colder climate and found that my beard was cracking and my dandruff was getting to be a problem. I received this quickly and after a week of using it regularly, my beard is as soft and majestic as a lion&#x27;s. You only need to use a dime-sized amount every morning after a shower (make sure your beard is dry before applying), and let it do it&#x27;s work. It smells nice, keeps the hairs softer and more conformed to your desired shape, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any distinct dandruff from dry skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? It works. Ladies, if you&#x27;re sick of your man&#x27;s beard stabbing you when you go in for a kiss, buy him a can and you both can reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> Was not looking for conditioner when I bought this as an add on to the beard wax but I  am so happy I did. Smells great and soothes the skin underneath the beard . I didn&#x27;t think the skin underneath the beard was much of a problem until the irritation went away. I will use it as long as I have facial hair only wish I had found it twenty years ago when I first grew my goatee.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!. It makes my beard feel great and not so coarse. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Received as a gif from gf. It feels great, gives a nice glossy look and does hold a little. Not like wax. Gives a nice natural shape. All great except it smells like black licorice.IE jäger.And it&#x27;s pretty strong. Your beard will look nice but you&#x27;ll smell like a drunk hobo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to address several issues that repeatedly come up in reviews of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The tin that this product comes in is very small.  I find it a little hard to justify the price versus the quantity of what is essentially wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The wax base has microbeads in it.  This bothers some people, but I found it a non-issue.  The beads probably serve to facilitate the melting process when rubbing the hands together before applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The smell.  I am not sure what some people are smelling.  I have heard it referred to as an overpowering black licorice (anise) scent.  I did not have this experience, myself.  I found the scent to be nothing offensive at all.  Not overpowering in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) People saying it helps to grow a thicker / longer beard.  This is complete nonsense.  I don&#x27;t think the manufacturers ever state this in their advertising, but some people have been putting this out there.  Genetics is the main determiner of your beard growth pattern, not wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) My own personal overall impression ... middle of the road.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I&#x27;m not sure that it does anything terribly beneficial.  My beard is perhaps a little softer, but the effect is short-lived.  I generally use normal hair conditioner on my beard once or twice a week and get the same benefit at a much better cost per application over this product.  It just seems a little expensive for what you actually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an open mind and reserve the right to alter my review in case further experience changes my perceptions.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great - light fragrance, not cloying, faintly of anise. My husband uses it and his beard is softer since he started. I love this balm. I have a hard time not leaning in to get closer right after he uses it because he smells and looks so dang good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, his beard has never smelled so good.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on various beard products before buying this. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase, even considering the seemingly steep price. It&#x27;s a small, 2\\&quot; wide tin of grainy yellow goop, but a small dab lasts all day. It smells like mild licorice and herbs... very pleasant and unoffensive smell that lingers through the day. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or cause zits. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Brings out the color in my beard, making the hairs translucent. Noticeably softer and fuller after use. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product, as well as consider other Honest Amish products.</li>
            <li> 1st can arrived this week and so far so good. I use this in addition to another Beard Oil and like it just as much for different reasons.</li>
            <li> I was trying to grow my beard out and was tired of the itching and irritation. This stuff keeps my beard soft, smelling good and does a fair job of keeping under control.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty organic smell. I like it. My gf says I smell like an herb, but it&#x27;s growing on her</li>
            <li> Love this product. My wife bought this for me and it makes my beard feel great and the scent is very pleasant. A must have if you want a great looking healthy beard.</li>
            <li> works well for my beard</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad it&#x27;s not even funny! Hard to use. You have to melt the little pellets by rubbing them in your hand and it creates a mess. I won&#x27;t be buying again......</li>
            <li> This made a difference to my bird&#x27;s nest of a beard in only three days. Gone is the beard dandruff. Soft and silky is the feel and my wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good but the density is a problem.  It takes considerable efforts to degrade the sandy viscosity down to something more manageable.  I love the natural feel and scent, but it certainly is a pain to fully rub in.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of any type of balm. It has a pleasant smell and does not build up. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, it makes my beard nice and full.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first. It smells pretty much like every Amish crafty type store I&#x27;ve ever been in.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad smell but it&#x27;s not a good smell either, but it doesn&#x27;t last so long as to be cloying.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times so far, but it seems to moisten/hydrate my beard upon application.  As to long term effects, too soon to say.  The smell is not bad.  Kind of like a wood shop.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago and have been applying it twice a week after showers. I bought it because my beard tends to be unruly and course past a certain length. I trimmed my beard short before I started applying the balm, hoping that when it reached its earlier length and density that I&#x27;d notice any improvement. Weeks later, I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After repeatedly applying the product as instructed (by taking a small dab and melting it between your hands, then rubbing it through your beard) I noticed one thing immediately: despite applying it as an oily liquid, it would dry in minutes and create ugly flakes in my beard that I would then have to wash out - effectively nullifying it as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner. The mealy, oily texture I could forgive, but not the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell the balm doesn&#x27;t even achieve its primary purpose of being a conditioner - beard is still course and wiry, only now with flakes of balm residue to rinse out. At best this product is wildly inconsistent and only ships usable balm some of the time, at worst all it leaves you with is a greasy, flaky beard and a $15 hole in your wallet. I doubt I&#x27;ll finish the tin I purchased.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this stuff!! His beard smells yummy, too!!</li>
            <li> Good Stuff!.......use everyday............</li>
            <li> Sent this to my boyfriend as a little surprise gift and it shipped quick and he loved it! He said the quality was great and I&#x27;m happy with the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with this stuff at first. Realized that you really have to smooth it out and break down the clumped up parts before applying. I use the palm of my hand to smooth it out and it works very very well. Make my beard softer and smell great.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does keep your beard conditioned when you decide to grow it out.</li>
            <li> Works Wonders, and makes my beard smell Great!</li>
            <li> I like it.  It is different than any other type of conditioner that I have tried.  Works well once you figure out the best way to apply it.  The smell is not an issue for me - I would describe it as faint.</li>
            <li> Good product, smell is kind of strong but it does not smells bad.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff- I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Being Living life without this Great product..Just makes a beard look fuller and perfect..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He could tell immediate results, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a Neutrogena Triple Moisture Touch Leave In conditioner/hair cream, and felt that my beard was &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34; throughout the day, but soft.  I wanted to try something different, something more geared towards beards, so I tried this stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would give slightly more control and conditioning, but this just leaves my beard feeling greasy and coarse.  It might have slightly better control than the Cream/Conditioner mentioned above, but It also leaves my face kind of greasy when applying it, so I need to towel off my cheeks after applying.  It has been pretty warm on the East Coast (mid to upper 80s), so maybe temperature has something to do with it not taking to the beard.  Unless my beard miraculously feels softer from this and/or their Heavy Duty Beard balm (which seems to last a little longer into the day), I won&#x27;t be buying again.  I&#x27;ll try to come back here in the fall and update.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. My partner can&#x27;t keep their hands off my beard.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would soften my beard but right now I see no real benefit to using it. I would not purchase this product again or recommended to others.</li>
            <li> Goes on greasy and stays greasy.  If you inadvertently touch your beard after after the balm, your hand will be greasy.  I&#x27;m going to try another non-greasy balm next time.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I am a repeat buyer. Works well without the overpowering fragrance of some others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it on a 4in beard and loved it. It does stay on your beard through out the day, which I preferred. I ended up shaving my masterpiece, but still use it with a smooth face b/c it hydrates and works great as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Works Great! Smells Great!</li>
            <li> The tin was a bit smaller than I had expected but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I have always had a beard but I rarely let it get soooo long. But, I am in a mood where I want to see how long I can get it. I use this only when I get out of the shower cause it calls for a clean beard. I will definitely keep this in my routine from now on.</li>
            <li> My beard has never been happier! Love this product! Not too fragrant, makes the beard feel like a unicorn is prancing inside!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Kind of light but smooth for the beard. I like the smell but have a  brother who doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product really does work to soften the beard and make it more manageable! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of my husbands beard, but I can see a difference when he uses this and it definitely looks better. We will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use. Already seeing results after a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. Love it. As a bonus benefit, it has helped my dry hands heal.</li>
            <li> Love this great smell and works well</li>
            <li> Initially I wanted the heavy beard balm but it was out of stock. So instead I received the vegan beard balm which initially I was hesitant due to the review about its texture , but after using it for 2-3 weeks every other day I love it. Definitely for conditioning and scenting only, since it has next to no styling hold. The scent is amazing I am a big fan of Jaegermeister liquor and the light licorice smell accompanying this product is delightful (the smell wears off quickly). Initially I hated how beady the balm was but I found if you just run your finger in a circular motion it melts down to a more fluid wax and that&#x27;s when I twist my horse hair beard brush soft on it and apply. Works nicely, bear is definitely softer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend&#x27;s beard, he really likes it because it keeps it under control and is softer.</li>
            <li> This Beard Balm really works to soften and condition beard hair. I felt it was expensive but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Helps control the beard and keeps it from being so stiff!</li>
            <li> Smells good. - For me, like cloves. Almost too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Fun packaging - branding.&lt;br /&gt;Oily for the first half hour or so after applying, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably explore other similar products, with different scents, consistencies, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend others to try.</li>
            <li> Great Smell!! Tames my unruly beard!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my beard tamed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used! The only problem is the smell. It&#x27;s WAY too strong! I feel like every time I walk past someone they&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;what the heck is that smell?!\\&quot; I use a lighter pine smelling conditioner during the day but when my beard needs a really good conditioning I use this before bed. It truly is the best. I just wish the smell was more pine or sandle wood (hint hint to the Honest Amish company!)</li>
            <li> Yes! It does have a faint licorice scent, but it&#x27;s not overbearing. I quickly got used to it and found it to be a pleasant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to grow a beard several times, but put an end to my new hirsute look when the itches attacked. My new beard balm beat the bothersome itch and allowed me to successfully grow my whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Honest Amish Beard Balm daily and comb out my beard and mustache with a little comb made especially for beards. If you&#x27;re growing a beard for the first time I recommend you buy a beard comb along with your balm.</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves a very soft beard and has a pleasant feel in your hand.  Smells nice too.  Works best if a little warm - cold counters leave the product a lot harder and more difficult to work into an oil in your palms.  It also doesn&#x27;t all stay stuck to your beard, so not a good choice for those who touch their beard a lot, or long beards that rub against clothes.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon. Ever. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never been as satisfied with a product before. I&#x27;m really just echoing what pretty much most people have said. Love this stuff and I&#x27;ll be ordering again once it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good.</li>
            <li> My husbands all time favorite. Smell is very mild and container is deeper than how it appears in the picture. Great product for taming that beard. Fast shipping and neat packaging.</li>
            <li> Decent conditioning, but the smell leaves a bit to be desired. Too much on the medicine side.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  This, used in conjunction with beard oil, gives me the conditioning I want for my beard.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to the product but can tell a difference in my beard now versus before when not using any product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but it&#x27;s going great</li>
            <li> Works and smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and undamaged. Makes facial hair shine but I use dove conditioner to get the softness. Save beard balm for special occasions when you want your beard to look and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> I can use mustache wax at night and after two nights super soft...  This is oily, pain to melt and apply after 4 nights very little difference in softness.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> Guys don&#x27;t generally go in for &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; oneself, but go for it with this product. I Like the way it makes my whiskers feel, and also a very subtle aroma that is most pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool. It has worked very well on my bread. I had beard dandruff, my beard was rough like a brillow pad, and I had dry patching skin under my beard and after using this beard balm for about a week my beard has softened, darkened and just looks better. You can also use it if you have dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is very oily.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this stuff and I do too! It really does make his beard softer. Also, I use it on the ends of my hair at night sometimes and it makes them soft too. Love the packaging too. Nice beard balm!</li>
            <li> makes my beard nice and soft...</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and I do as well! His beard looks and feels so , much softer. Thanks again for a great product!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I enjoy the scent of the product and that it does a good job conditioning my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I had with this product is that it turns to soup in the container at a rather low temperature. I live in southern California, and when I first received the product, it included a warning about the products consistency due to shipping temperatures which made perfect sense to me. I went ahead and opened it to take a peek, and it was liquid, not unlike melted butter. &amp;#34;No problem&amp;#34;, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just put this in the fridge for a bit to let it firm up and that should be the end of it.&amp;#34; I pulled it out of the fridge later and looked at the product again and it looked exactly as I expected it to, so I placed it in my bathroom. Unfortunately my bathroom is directly hit by the afternoon sun, so on the afternoon I first tried the product, it was soup again. So now I keep it in the coolest room in my house which maintains it at a usable consistency. However, during the cooling process the ingredients that have a higher melting point congeal together first which requires me to work it a little longer on my beard to get the little wax beads to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works great and smells good, but the products consistency is a little off putting to me.</li>
            <li> It works really well, I&#x27;m just not so sure about it&#x27;s scent...</li>
            <li> Good stuff, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve put up with dry frizzy beard for so long!</li>
            <li> First I have to mention how fast the product got to me in my current APO location.  8 days (including the weekend)!  That&#x27;s simply amazing.  I&#x27;m still waiting on products I&#x27;ve ordered from other vendors from 2.5 weeks ago.  Nice work Honest Amish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never tried anything like this before.  Wish I had known about it the last couple of times I grew my beard out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still experimenting with the quantity that I use per application.  Even if I have to order more I won&#x27;t be upset in the slightest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a naturally wirey beard with a defiant personality.  This balm allows me to train my beard in the direction I want it to flow and keeps those defiant hairs in line with the other.  Not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t feel brittle anymore but closer to &#x27;top of the head&#x27; type hair.  The occassional itch seems to be repressed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that with this stuff in my beard, the red (I have auburn color hair) doesn&#x27;t just stand out, it explodes in the sun light and has completely caught some people off guard.  Guess I don&#x27;t look like a natural red head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the application, it rinses easily and clean from the hands.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, beard looks great.</li>
            <li> Tin arrived dented and I was not impressed by the smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff came a bit grainy but dissolves as you rub palms together.</li>
            <li> Honest Amish was the first beard balm I used when I started my beard several months ago. I&#x27;ve since tried two or three other beard conditioners, but keep going back to the Honest Amish. I will only use Honest Amish Beard Balm from now on.</li>
            <li> To put it bluntly, this mess be like some type of BEARD CRACK, yo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard used to be scraggly and coarse, like an old sailor&#x27;s big toenail. Now it is smooth to the touch, exudes a rich but not overpowering scent of majestic herbs and lavish oils while flaunting a sumptuous shine to complete the mesmerizing trifecta of beard splendor that falls just short of hypnotizing any whose gaze may fall upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get stopped on the street, ogled on the train and put in precarious situations by the opposite sex more often than not (to my wife&#x27;s vexation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got a raise, which I&#x27;d be dishonest if I said was as a result of my strong work ethic and lack of tardiness. My wife recently became pregnant after 8 months of unsuccessful (yet relentless) attempts at procreation. Coincidence? Well let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve injected some Amish names onto the baby name list for good measure (Briskey and Whetstone are frontrunners, no doubt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, people don&#x27;t judge a man by his achievements, they judge him by his beard. When opportunity strikes, make sure you&#x27;ve spent the 4 minutes it takes to give you a leg up above the competition and lather that sweet victory in to every follicle.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to use it to like it. It&#x27;s a funny, whimsical gift, and you can use it on your bangs if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> great product great service</li>
            <li> I purchased this after wondering about beard care products. It seemed like it would be a good product from the description as well as the reviews/comments on Amazon. Well I got it in mail in a timely manner and tried it out, the smell is pleasant, not girly or fruity but not an overpowering man smell. After the second time I used it (the second being the only time I used it properly) my wife commented that my beard feels softer and I agree. The smell of the product goes away in a few hours and if used sparingly it isn&#x27;t greasy nor oily in my beard but my hands could use a good rubbing on dry skin or a wipe with a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product a lot but I don&#x27;t care much for the price which leads me to look for cheaper alternatives or making my own in large batches.</li>
            <li> Works Great on beard.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using a beard balm but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am super glad I did! This stuff not only makes my beard very soft, but it smells great too! Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my beard isn&#x27;t very long, but it didn&#x27;t seem to get any of the stray hairs under control. I used it a few times and stopped.</li>
            <li> Since my SO has decided to grow a beard, he needed a product that would soften the hairs. After using my hair conditioner to no avail, I bought this for him. Even after 1 use, there is a touchable difference in softness. A little goes a long way and it smells amazing. Very natural but not overwhelmingly crunchy. As other reviewers have stated, it does smell like licorice BUT a lot more subtle/fresh and slightly sweeter. I&#x27;d describe it as fennel. Yes, the vegetable.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of keeping your beard in check.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, organic -- what more could I want? I pretty much think I&#x27;m hooked. Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff and this grease. Gonna check out their soaps next.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the &#x27;oily&#x27; side, compared with other similar products and you better like licorice cause you&#x27;ll be smelling it for about an hour after putting this in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does what it advertises and it works fairly well. it doesn&#x27;t do a lot for actual control/management, but it definitely conditions and moisturizes. I alternate this with another similar product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it came in is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, a little goes a long way. You want just a small &#x27;swoop&#x27; with your fingertip, which you then rub together between your hands and apply/rub into your beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, just dont use too much or it will make your beard too shiny and somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> My son love this on his beard</li>
            <li> I was thinking about trying a beard balm since it was starting to get longer. I was recommended Honest Amish and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Having never used a beard balm before, I was expecting it to be thicker feeling on my beard, but it wasn&#x27;t at all. I love the slight licorice smell that it has, it is just enough to smell it and not be over powering. I didn&#x27;t get much styling ability from it, not that it claims to, so if someone is looking for something to style with I would recommend something with a stronger hold. Overall, I am more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I keep a short beard (most would consider it stubble) It is prickly, but using this product really does soften it up. When you trim every 3 days its hard to keep it from getting rough and I love this product. Its a small jar, but lasts me about 6 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight black licorice smell, but goes away after a tick. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed with the conditioning aspect/quality.  Bluebeards beard saver is a better all-around product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my boyfriend. Unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The odor is too strong for an office environment.</li>
            <li> I have tried to grow out my beard in the past but the itching became unbearable and when I inevitably shaved I could see that my skin was genuinely irritated and flaky. I tried this product out with the sort of amused skepticism one approaches a 5 star rated Amazon product and it was amazing. No itching, my beard was soft and manageable. The smell of the product is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I will note that the user instructions recommend using this once every other day or something and I used it at least once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I also liked the presentation. Rustic yet precise.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t start to soften your beard right away, but after a few days it is much softer.  It smells great and releves the itchy phase as advertised.  A must buy for anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> Growing out a beard for no shave November and it was itching like mad.  This product is priced high, for such a little container.  But it works!  And you really don&#x27;t use much at all.  Out of the container it is grainy, but after warming it up in the palms of your hands, that graininess disappears.  Not a fan of the scent, but that two disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> Great Product with Great Scent!  Update - Its been around a year and while my husband really enjoyed his Honest Amish Beard Balm, he has moved on to other Balms. It was a good working and excellent product, but just couldn&#x27;t quite manage my husband&#x27;s unruly face locks. The smell was great though!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really satisfying. I was very impressed by the formula, the packaging, and the quality.</li>
            <li> Skin still was dry, I don&#x27;t like the smell, and my beard didn&#x27;t feel any different.</li>
            <li> This product has taken my beard to the next level of smooth, manly, and being well-kempt. And I&#x27;m not just saying that, other people comment on it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes there is a light scent (anise) but it is not overwhelming, or offensive. Just buy this stuff and make yourself, your beard, and your colleagues happy.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Don&#x27;t worry about the small can as I was, a little goes a longggg way.</li>
            <li> I really like this balm.  I used to use beard oil but I like this a lot better.  My 4&amp;#34; beard is definitely softer and more manageable after I use it.  Smells decent, too!</li>
            <li> A nice leave in conditioner. I have not noticed any sent to it. I like that. I don&#x27;t want anything perfumy. I have not had any adverse reactions to it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this very much,  keeps my beard healthy and well conditioned and looking good! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really softens my beard.</li>
            <li> Smells great but very greasy.</li>
            <li> Been using this after every shower for nearly 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference. Before using this, my beard was very bristly. Now, it&#x27;s not baby soft but it&#x27;s wayyyy smoother and softer than it was. I can&#x27;t comment on skin health because my beard blocks my sight of my skin but I don&#x27;t have flaky ass skin so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in good health. The black licorice smell is noticeable for about 5 minutes but goes away quick. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it&#x27;s not overbearing. I don&#x27;t consider it an issue. I recommend this to any bearded brother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this beard balm for about a month and this is the first time in my life I grew a beard with no itching at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  makes my beard look and feel good.</li>
            <li> Bought this tin as I was growing in a beard for the winter.  This is the first time I have used a product for my beard.  In the past grow in would be itchy for the first month or so, but this time I had no beard itch.  It also cleared up my beard dander.  I used the whole tin about 3 months, and have moved up to the heavy formula to add some control as my beard get bushy.</li>
            <li> Great beard balm, I love Honest Amish products. I use there beard oil at night time and have switched to there heavy duty beard balm to use in the mornings to control the wild hairs a little better. Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of there products. In my opinion they make the bestimate beard products available.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and got here fast</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I have chronically dry skin, and my beard was visibly flaky (especially in my mustache and chin area).  My skin was getting very irritated from rubbing my beard to get rid of the big flakes.  I love my beard, have had it for over 1 year, but it was getting to the point that I was fed up enough to consider shaving it off.  Then I bought the Honest Amish Beard Balm, which almost immediately made it better.  I really only use it around once per week and I no longer have the visible flakiness and my skin is not irritated at all.  I would recommend this to any bearded folks with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only very minor gripe, is that I am not crazy about the smell.  Because it is 100% natural, it doesn&#x27;t have any aroma&#x27;s added.  The first time I used it, I kept on getting whiffs of a waxy black licorice type aroma... and I HATE black licorice.  But I really don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, just try it.  From the product description, it is apparent that the manufacturers stand behind their product and will accept returns for unsatisfied customers (as long as at least 50% of the product is left).  No risk.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. My beard and face are happier for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty gross. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it daily.  I switched to balm from oil when my beard got beyond 3 inches because balm makes it much easier to manage and work-in with a comb.  I love the smell, it has undertones of clove with is almost therapeutic.  They don&#x27;t list their ingredients (and I don&#x27;t blame them), but I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s a shea butter base (but I&#x27;m only guessing here).  Bottom line, it&#x27;s great stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, daily and my beard is so soft and shiny, while not greasy.  It&#x27;s great stuff and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yea, the 2 ounces last a lot longer than you would imagine. To apply it, put a bit on your finger tip.  Rub it together in-between your palms until it&#x27;s nice and thin... then rub it all over your beard, even down to your skin.  Then take a comb and use the tight side of the comb to gently comb your beard (while combing, make sure you can feel the comb gently raking the skin of your face... this will get the conditioner deep into your beard and close to your skin).</li>
            <li> Got the beard balm yesterday. Used it twice. My wife would not come near me with it on. She said &amp;#34;I stunk terribly&amp;#34;. So I can&#x27;t comment on the efficacy as I was no longer allowed to use it in the house. My son also told me I smelt funny. Me personally, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it! Beard is softer, easier to handle and not itchy but what I like the most is that it helped with dry skin on my chin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bearded boyfriend. Smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. After a week, his beard is really soft, his skin feels much better. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Product really softens my beard.  Control also improves.  Hopefully infusing Heath into beard, time will tell!</li>
            <li> So,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, I purchased this thinking I could deal with the slight licorice scent; I can not. Smells like I have last nights Jagermeister still in my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have posted their product came granulated; mine did too, but I dont think it affected what the balm is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be my beard, but the balm made my beard overly curly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Could ask for any more</li>
            <li> this stuff is great works well smells good chicks dig it</li>
            <li> Its an okay product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks.  It hasn&#x27;t really worked for my beard and that&#x27;s probably more me than the product. Smell isn&#x27;t bad. At least I didn&#x27;t think it was. Its strong for a couple of minutes after you put it on but fine after that. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the heavy duty hold next.</li>
            <li> Smells good and shipped to us right on time.</li>
            <li> A little hard to work with, yet still worth the effort...enjoying it for now but might try something else (a gel or liquid maybe?) next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A great, not-overbearing smell that only really lingers for a couple hours tops&lt;br /&gt;* Smoothes, softens, and shines</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes the beard look amazing!  My girlfriend loves it because it keeps my beard looking clean.  It does add shine to my beard specially in sunlight which others may not want.</li>
            <li> Smell turned me off. Should let people know it has a distinctive Vick vapor rub smell</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband awhile back and it did wonders for the itchiness of his face and inclination toward ingrown hairs from the odd assortment of textures he has from his mixed heritage. The hairs were softer and much healthier looking after just a few days use. He has also been able to grow his beard much longer with this balm since it keeps a good level of moisture in the hair and prevents breakage. I don&#x27;t recommend daily use since it can build up a bit being an oil base, but my husband uses a small fingertips worth every 1-2 days. Didn&#x27;t have the issue of grittiness that some have commented on, just have to warm it up in your hands before applying. Every once in awhile I notice a small bead of the stuff that hasn&#x27;t been worked in but nothing major. Personally I love the smell of this stuff, nice earthy scent that fades after a little while.</li>
            <li> The smell is stronger than what others have posted. It&#x27;s why I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My beard doesn&#x27;t grow neatly. Stray hairs everywhere. This helps with that. Makes it looks nice, conditioned and well-maintained. Even though I don&#x27;t trim my beard at all. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, my beard feels soft and shinny. And easy to comb!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, as he ventured into beard-mastery.  He had a thicket of pubes under his chin, and I thought this would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit feminine to him, I tend to agree.  Too stinky.  I assumed this was a balm, a smooth, maybe creamy concoction of oils that would make his beard illustrious and much more supple.  Instead, we received this disgusting stuff that you have to dig out of the container with your fingernails that goes on smooth as granulated sugar mixed with butter, only clumpier.  After applying beard balm, we assumed that it would dissolve immediately when warmed with the skin.  It does not.  Instead, the user gets the bonus of having their beard look like it has lice, or maybe some sort of animal&#x27;s semen in it.  This is a heterosexual beard, so that was a bit difficult to walk around with all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, buy vitamin e oil, argan oil, anything but this stuff.  Poor Amish are getting a bad rap on this one.</li>
            <li> Conditions very well! Not a fan of the scent, but a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He loves it!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Pleasant scent. I was given my first container by a friend. Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use or apply (my first substantial beard). When I received my order with instructions it was a &amp;#34;eureka!&amp;#34; Moment. Invest in a good beard brush and/or comb.</li>
            <li> Love this Bard Balm ... and I do prefer it over the oil. The consistency is exactly what I need to help keep those few wild hairs under control on cold windy days.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Has a great smell and does a good job of keeping my beard looking good!</li>
            <li> Looking for a quick easy way to condition your beard? Look no further. Any man with a beard should consider this. I will tell you up front that some people think there is a strong smell to this. There is a hint of black licorice smell to it but it is not strong in my opinion. It actually grew on me over time and now I enjoy it. You can, and I do, put a couple of drops of something like Essential Oils into your hands and rub it in after you apply the Honest Amish to give a different scent. Choose wisely your scent. I use this by itself daily and it really keeps my beard nice, controls split ends and gives a nice shine especially when outdoors. I ride a lot in a Jeep with no top or doors and this stuff conditions very well all day. Its easy to apply. Good stuff guys.</li>
            <li> It took a few months for me to really fall in love with this balm. What I discovered is less is more. I was using too much and it was leaving my beard feeling greasy. Just a little of the balm and a good comb and you&#x27;re all set. Beard is soft with a slight gloss and it even moisturizes your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other have said, it does have a bit of a natural smell. It goes away in a few minutes after applying, but it&#x27;s definitely there. When I asked my wife what she thought it smelled like, she described it as &amp;#34;sexy lumberjack&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;testosterone and manliness.&amp;#34; If I were to kill a bear and fell a tree with my pocketknife and then combine the oils of both and use them on my beard, that&#x27;s how this stuff smells. Some say it smells like black licorice, but that&#x27;s misleading. I can see why they describe it that way, but I hate the smell of black licorice and I really like the smell of this stuff. Each time I put it on, I feel like I should cook a steak and then go kill ISIS bastards in the Middle East.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas. Nice odor and does the trick, though it leaves his beard a bit too shiny for his liking.</li>
            <li> It smells like beef jerky</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he has been very happy. He said it&#x27;s easy to use, definitely helps tame the hair and soften it. It has a light fragrance but really after the first couple times I didn&#x27;t notice the smell and you can&#x27;t notice from a distance, just up close. We went on to order beard and body soap and beard oil from Honest Amish after this purchase.</li>
            <li> I make my own Beard Oil and it works fine. I had read several very good reviews about this product. Lived up to the reviews. Excellent beard balm. I alternative between this and my own beard oil. Has helped with conditioning. I have now purchased their soap and just ordered the slick wax!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my partner for Christmas. He has become obsessed with this balm; which I am ok with! His beard is so much softer and smells amazing! We will definitely order more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the balm is for me. This product seems to be more for styling, rather than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son, he loves it!  Especially the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s especially nice that it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrance.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not to oily or solid and it has a very mild manly wonderful smell. Will be getting more!</li>
            <li> I ordered this recently, and was really pleased with how it felt in my beard. I personally also enjoyed the scent. I had a chance to interact with the Honest Amish team after my purchase, and was totally impressed with the awesome customer service. I&#x27;ll be recommending this product to some of my bearded friends.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, the ordering process was great. From the time I placed the order, to the time I received it was fast. That said, this is my first time growing a beard - and I am 38. Over the Christmas break I decided to quit shaving and when I got back I was complaining to some office mates about the beard being uncomfortable, etc. I had more than one person tell me to get some Honest Amish. I watched a few YouTube videos and I can honestly say the product matched the reviews and recommendations. The smell is like black licorice, a manly smell. The texture is like little beads, but after rubbing a little bit on your hands it liquefies fast. In the end it made my whiskers soft and manageable. Good product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing beards off and on for over a decade.  I&#x27;ve never used any products but curiosity got the best of me, so I ordered this a few days prior to this review. Let me tell you, this stuff is fantastic. I love the woodsy (kinda black licorice)  smell but due to only using a little bit at a time, it fades fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a dry beard with plenty of stray hairs, this is a great solution. No more itchy skin and the beard looks and feels incredibly smooth! Thanks to all at Honest Amish. I&#x27;ll be back</li>
            <li> I like this product. Seems to make my beard feel softer.  The only negative is the smell can be a little much.</li>
            <li> Consistency is strange, not bad but too grainy. Product is good for the beard, personally prefer the oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product once a day for a week now and can actuall see and feel a difference. My beard feels softer and looks cleaner/neater. Also love the fact that it is all natural and made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> No more flaking from my beard. This stuff really works, and I was suspicious that it would do what it said. I read comments about the odor smelling like licorice, but it&#x27;s a mild smell and it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this, despite having a beard for more than 30 years, but lately I&#x27;ve been letting it get a little longer and regular hair conditioners don&#x27;t really do much. After a few days of use, I can&#x27;t say that my beard is any softer, but it&#x27;s more under control. There&#x27;s sort of a spice-like scent when I first put the balm in my beard; it fades fairly quickly (or my nose gets used to it fast). I have a strong perfume allergy, and I&#x27;m happy to report this doesn&#x27;t set it off.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency, works well with a faint black licorice scent.</li>
            <li> I dont hate it. But I dont like it. I used every day for 1 month before posting this review. I noticed no increased softness. I actually like the smell at first but it quickly grew unpleasant. It was definitely an oily substance for your beard but I seriously noticed zero benefits. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves it. Big hit!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have always kept my beard short to avoid a jungle on my face, but now I can let it grow to its manliest glory.</li>
            <li> Good product although the smell can take some getting used to,  and the product seems a litter expensive.  For a better value and similar experience you may want to consider Burts Bees salve.</li>
            <li> I hated the way this made my husband&#x27;s beard feel. So wirey, like a brillo pad, not soft at all :(  I like when he uses the&amp;#34; hsi argan oil&amp;#34; I bought for my hair, that made it soft and smells way better. No lady wants a scratchy beard face to snuggle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves it :). In fact he loved it so much we just purchased 2 more tins of this balm and 2 containers of the beard oil. He loves the smell, says its woodsy and masculine without being over powering. He noticed a difference right away with his beard softening and not being as scraggly. He also likes that its not greasy. He says he would recommend it to anyone that has a beard longer than an inch. He was also impressed with the packaging, from the little bag it came in to an appropriate size box for the product. Nothing arrived dented or opened in any way.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my husbands beard smell.  Before it smelled of beef and cheese.  Now his beard smells like herbs and berries, very nice.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of the balm. Used it once and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sensitive to the medicinal odor, it&#x27;s probably great stuff. Just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;My bad, other reviews had mentioned the smell. I should have paid more attention. Duh.</li>
            <li> First, the scent.  It smells like a wood shop.  I don&#x27;t care for that very much.  It isn&#x27;t terribly off-putting, but every morning for the last week I&#x27;m starting the day with the smell of a high school wood shop class in my nose.  Second, it works, but not to the degree that I thought it would.  I waited until I had used it for a few days before writing a review.  It is everything that it says it is, but I must say that I haven&#x27;t noticed a lasting softness to my beard throughout the day and after five days I haven&#x27;t noticed a overall difference in the coarseness of my beard overall.  This is a four star review and not a five star review simply because I am not in love with the scent and the consistent coarseness of my beard even after a week of application.  It is good, but I&#x27;m going to try another once this tin is gone.  As a final thought, though, I would like to note that the way it conditions my skin and the feel of my skin after a week is actually the best part of using the product.  That was a nice side-effect.  Also, major kudos on the packaging.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s beard is so nice because of use of this product. He doesn&#x27;t have a coarse hair to begin with, but this product makes it look almost like a beautiful lion&#x27;s mane, and feel like domesticated cat fur (except that I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it doesn&#x27;t get EVERYWHERE, like cat hair does).  If you want a soft, cat hair face beard, then definitely pick up this product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. He likes the way it makes his beard feel but says he can&#x27;t use it when he&#x27;s working.  The tiniest bit makes his beard a magnet for concrete dust.</li>
            <li> I tried different beard oils and conditioners but the Honest Amish Beard balm beats them all. My beard looks great; clean and healthy...</li>
            <li> I bought this to soften an unusually coarse beard. It does soften it some temporarily. I use it maybe every other day. Sometimes a little less. I really like the way it smells. The package may look small but you don&#x27;t need much so it will last a really long time. Odds are I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product, would buy again. Please, do read the instructions if the item arrives in liquid state, it worked for me since it arrived in that state.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a solid as opposed to an oil.  Much easier to use.  It melts quickly and easily when you&#x27;re ready to use it.  And the scent is good.  Distinctive but not overpowering.  Overall, a nice part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works well, smells good.</li>
            <li> bought a couple different beard conditioners, this one was the best,will purchase again</li>
            <li> I like the smell. I like the shine it gives my beard. Been using it for less than a week. I can tell my beard&#x27;s gotten softer. It still hasn&#x27;t tammed the wild hairs but I can tell it&#x27;s starting to so I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully we&#x27;ll get there.</li>
            <li> Compared to the &amp;#34;beard oil&amp;#34; that I purchased at the same time, I like this stuff the best.  It makes my beard feel softer and reels in the stray hairs.  The smell is also not unpleasant (though, not overly pleasant) and goes away quickly.  To my surprise my wife actually said &amp;#34;Oh, I like that smell&amp;#34; when I wore it around her for the first time.  I&#x27;m only giving this product 4 stars because even though it does seem to improve my beard, it does so in such a slight way that I could be just tricking myself into thinking its doing something and I&#x27;m making this all up.  I just expected an obvious benefit, and don&#x27;t feel like I got one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Softens my beard. Has a slight smell to get used to but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, shipped quickly. As someone with fairly coarse beard hair, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in how manageable and soft my beard feels after just about a week. Within a few minutes of application it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling; you can spread the rest on your skin, which has helped keep my face from drying out in the winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing to note is that the smell, while pleasant, definitely lingers for a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps my beard looking fresh and tangle free. There was an initial &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; to it, but after a few weeks of use I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  Will definitely get more once I run out, which is taking surprisingly longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product. It makes my beard look and feel great.  The scent is pleasant and very subtle. You just need to follow the instructions to melt the granules on your fingers or hand before putting it in your damp beard.  I also noticed recently it is really nice even after I shower at the gym and then blow-dry it. (I didn&#x27;t wash my beard in the shower, just rinsed a bit.)  I almost felt like the heat in the blow-drier reactivated the oils and butters.  I started using this shortly after trying another product that was pure jojoba oil.  I like this better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 months now (still on can number 1), and I love it. I firmly believe if one is to grow a beard or any Length of facial hair, Honest Amish Balm is the way to go. It solves the problem of &amp;#34;beardruff,&amp;#34; and it prevents split ends in a beard. The licorice smell was not my favorite at first, but it really is mild and light and fades as the hours pass. Now I don&#x27;t even notice it. I actually use another scented oil at times to enhance or synergize the fragrance. I&#x27;m applying this balm every 12 hours or 2 times in a day with great results. I receive complements every day on how well I keep up the beard, and how soft it has become. Thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> Spoiler....this is from a woman&#x27;s pont of view. I ordered this for my husband. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! After one application his beard was softer and more manageable. After three days, the difference is tremendous. I just ordered some for my brother in law. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for anything on amazon, or anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I had to come back and comment on this product.. because it is just so darn good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff last week, and received it on Friday.  I have used it twice.  Within minutes of first application, the difference was ENORMOUS.  Softer, easier to brush, staying in place, and cut down on &#x27;loose&#x27; hairs sticking up everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discussed this product with a few friends who were put off by the possible &#x27;scent&#x27; of the product.  I would NOT let that stop you, as the scent is very subtle and pleasant.  Certainly beats stinkbeard :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is easy, put a little of the product in the palm of your hands, rub together until the thick waxy product turns into an oil, then rub into beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried a beard product before, i cannot recommend this Honest Amish beard balm enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your beard, and anyone who loves it, will appreciate the small effort it takes to take it from hobo to Gandalf</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this product and I’m very happy it. As for the cost being a little expensive, I was happy to see that it is made here in the USA. What was on one of the pieces of paper that came with the conditioner “made by hand in the U.S.A. for an honest wage” is very important to me to support my fellow Americans, and getting a good product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s the best.  I use it on my face too, and it keeps it nice and moisturated.</li>
            <li> After all my beard hairs were becoming rebellious and had to use the balm. Great product.</li>
            <li> smells so good! keeps my face bush feeling really soft. also, I love the packaging and tin that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using this leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I can tell my beard is a lot healthier - it looks fuller &amp; feels softer.  Previously, I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Wild Man Beard Oil&amp;#34; which was good but definitely didn&#x27;t improve the health of my beard.  So, if you&#x27;ve got some split ends in your beard &amp; it feels more wiry than soft, think about using this stuff.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I don&#x27;t love the scent - it has a slight licorice smell to it; however, this is relatively minor considering how well the product works.</li>
            <li> Softens my beard, makes it shine, and helps control unmanageable hairs.  Great smell too.  I respectfully disagree with other reviewers who have stated that the smell is overwhelming.  It is a noticeable (but not overpowering) scent when first applied, but that wears off fairly quickly.  My wife, who was skeptical, is now a believer in the product.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my beard feel after applying it. Less coarse and more maintained. This stuff smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The husband loves it! Makes the beard shiny, softer and more manageable!</li>
            <li> Good product but if you wear contact lenses the fumes will irritate your eyes. I you wear contact lenses beware</li>
            <li> I was literally om the verge of cutting off my beard from sheer frustration with the dry and brittle feeling. I decided to give the balm a try, and I am very satisified with how soft my beard feels. No more suicidal  thoughts  :-)</li>
            <li> very oily. doesn&#x27;t really help with styling but it does make it shiny.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, has that odd, not quite herbal, not quite chemical smell shared by dozens of other, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; body products that is neither bad nor good and fades quickly. Thought it would last a little longer but appears to be absorbed quickly, haven&#x27;t been using it long so can&#x27;t address the dry skin issue. Overall a decent product that performs as advertised and leaves little to complain about.</li>
            <li> Accept no substitutions, this is the very best there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;The girl who lives with the man with the epic beard</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good!</li>
            <li> I have a short-ish beard, about 1&amp;#34; to 1.5&amp;#34;, and this seems to do a good job of relaxing the hair and softening the feel. It&#x27;s effective for a full day and a tin lasts a good while. The smell is somewhere between inoffensive and pleasant -- definitely nothing that detracts from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and has a nice smell. However, it really hasn&#x27;t done much to help the stray hairs on my beard lay down. Okay product to soften your beard, but it is not everything it&#x27;s advertised to be.</li>
            <li> As I have just received the product I can only say honestly that I have used it a little. As my beard grows slowly it seems to be getting softer and looking better. I will know more later. Thank you, Jim Gilkey.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and love the scent.  Thank you for making an affordable, great product!</li>
            <li> Very good product with great results</li>
            <li> Makes a shiny dark look</li>
            <li> This is a welcome product.  Does not have a greasy feel as the ones with bees wax do,  and does leave beard softer , as the ladies in my life say kissable!</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday. Face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> BF loved this, and makes his beard feels great. Smells pretty good too :)</li>
            <li> This is a great beard product! After a week I noticed a softer feel to beard and also helps with the split ends. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Have nothing to compare to, but a seemingly great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t soften beard, just makes it look shiny AF</li>
            <li> It arrived separated, so I put it next to my heated up over for a while to melt it, shook it up, and popped it I&#x27;m the fridge. No big deal, got it back to the way it should be. Seemed to absorb fast, and definitely made my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the issue...the smell. People say it smells like black licorice and then goes away. I&#x27;ll revise that to: it smells like anise, very strongly, and then faintly. My girlfriend hated the licorice smell, so this product lasted about three days for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the company&#x27;s idea, great packaging, and you can tell they care about the product, which is awesome. But from a personal standpoint, I just can&#x27;t go above three stats. I&#x27;ll be trying the scent free beard oil drops (from Amazon) next!</li>
            <li> Actually helped my spotty beard grow</li>
            <li> Having no previous experience grooming a beard, I had high hopes but low expectations.  I now have used several products from other vendors (almost all rather disappointing) and the following from Honest Amish:  Beard Balm, Original Beard Wax and Heavy Duty Beard Balm.  Each Honest Amish product has been really good in its own way.  You will have to find the right combination for your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to experiment with how to use these products and learn by trial and error.  My beard has shapes it doesn&#x27;t want to give up and one area that is really like crinkled wires.  My grooming now is to use the Heavy Duty Beard Balm after my shower, even if I used a conditioning shampoo.  Then as I comb it, add just a tiny bit of the Original Beard Wax to the area of crinkled wires.  For the first time in my life, my beard looks smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience will likely differ from mine, but by trial and error you will have as good an experience as mine, I suspect.  It is only once I tried,these products that I&#x27;ve begun to understand how my great great grandfather groomed his beard 100 or more years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is a little like putting a pat of butter in your hands, working it to liquid and putting it on your beard.  It does make your beard shine and gives it a bit of softness, but it is a little too greasy for me.  Even after being in your beard for several hours, it will leave a greasy film on anything your beard touches (hands, clothes, etc.).  I was somewhat disappointed as I really like the Honest Amish Beard Wax: great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am just beginning to grow my beard and this product is a real positive addition in the morning after my shower.  I rub it onto the tip of my fingers and the product turns into a very comfortable oil.  It applies easily and feels good too!</li>
            <li> I just started growing a beard and this product came recommended from a friend. So far it&#x27;s working great! It makes my beard softer and only has a slight scent to it. You only need a small amount in the palm of your hand that you rub together until the product become liquefied and then you rub onto your beard. That&#x27;s it...that simple. I haven&#x27;t found a better beard product.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working but i couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.  It had a unique smell and I couldn&#x27;t take it and neither could my wife.  If you can tolerate the smell you it may work when used for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda funky but the smell wears off fairly quickly.  Works well on my beard controlling the random hairs, especially the mustache ones that flip up and tickle my nose! haha</li>
            <li> Nice product. The scent is great and it is easy to use. Just put a little on your hands, rub together until melted then apply to beard and work down to skin. I immediately felt my skin tingle. My beard is starting to feel softer after using balm 3 or 4 times. I purchased more right away - the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; version this time to see if there is a big difference..</li>
            <li> I started using this oil daily to see if my beard would begin to soften up, and after 2 months my beard doesn&#x27;t feel much softer than before, the exception to this being if the oil is still in my beard. It makes my wife very unhappy when I kiss her and she gets a nice dab of oily residue on her face &amp; I was hoping it would dry a bit faster. It does at least smell very nice but I can’t honestly recommend this product based on the price, quantity and lasting effect (or lack thereof). The oil seems to be a bit strong, many have said this oil is also good for the skin and sooths irritation, and while I didn’t have any problems it did burn a bit if it got anywhere near my eyes. My suggestion is to look for another brand as this one seems to be either hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Superb balm keeps my beard healthy and attractive. I love the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft and shiny.... a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love what it does to the beard. No frizz at all.</li>
    </ol>
