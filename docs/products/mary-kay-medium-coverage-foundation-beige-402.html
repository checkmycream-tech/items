            <li>It matches my skintone perfectly, and nothing else I ever tried before has ever done that -- which is why I had a makeup-aversion in the first place.</li>

            <li>I was very satisfied with the product when I received it, it was in the original box and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>

            <li>I love Mary Kay Medium coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>A awesome product for daily use.</li>
            <li>I love this product, is wonderfull.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about how I have great skin, but little do they know lol.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my purchase, i got it exactly when I needed it</li>
            <li>This product is also pretty resistant to sweat so in the summer time, I wear the more bronze foundation and I look like a god!</li>
            <li>--spreads easily  --covers</li>
            <li>Super satisfied.</li>
            <li>Its perfect as usual.</li>
            <li>I have a light golden colored complexion and</li>
            <li>Quick  service and just the right color.</li>
            <li>This is tried and true, good coverage, last a decent amount of time, and does not break me out.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for carrying such good products.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>But my coworker (a part-time beauty-consultant) insisted on giving me a makeover one day after I showed up with bright blue eyeshadow on an otherwise bare face!</li>
            <li>Keep spending money to find the perfect foundation, I failed.</li>
            <li>(in my case, at least)  --does not come off on the pillow (useful if you intend on looking nice for after-hours and then want to roll into bed without cleaning your face -- not that I recommend that!)  </li>
            <li>It took me about 6 months of frequent-ish use (say, 3-4 times a week) to finish my first tube of this stuff I bought from her, before checking Amazon for a repurchase</li>
            <li>I also love to use it on my chest when I wear open shirts</li>
            <li>so I knew exactly what I was ordering when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It covers up redness really well, too.  </li>
            <li>This really blends well with my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, since I don&#x27;t really use much, one bottle lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Many other products I tried made it look like I was wearing a mask.      </li>
            <li>Mary Kay, is classic.  </li>
            <li>--NOT cakey  --looks extremely natural, once you get the correct one for your skin tone  </li>
            <li>It also looks completely natural, I always get complements when I wear it.</li>
            <li>this  really covers up my dark spots from acne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love the coverage of it. It is discontinued so I tried to switch to other foundation...I don&#x27;t like it. Keep spending money to find the perfect foundation, I failed. I love Mary Kay Medium coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> Product was excellent. Exactly what I wanted and arrived very fast. Super satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase, i got it exactly when I needed it, I have already used these products by mary kay and they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Perfect. I used to buy mk like couple months ago but it got too exprnsive for my budget. So i never thought of checking on amazon and bamm i looked and they head this one. Its perfect as usual. Came packaged in mk box too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a makeup person. But my coworker (a part-time beauty-consultant) insisted on giving me a makeover one day after I showed up with bright blue eyeshadow on an otherwise bare face! After the makeover, she struggled to convince me to buy anything else from her wide assortment, but I had no problem shelling out the cash for this.    This product stood out as DA BOMB DIGGITY. It matches my skintone perfectly, and nothing else I ever tried before has ever done that -- which is why I had a makeup-aversion in the first place. As a Trinidadian, I am extremely mixed-race, so finding the right foundation has proven impossible until I came across this... check all the numbers in this product and there should be something for you.      POSITIVES... it is:  --NOT cakey  --looks extremely natural, once you get the correct one for your skin tone  --spreads easily  --covers minor blemishes  --does not make you break out (in my case, at least)  --does not come off on the pillow (useful if you intend on looking nice for after-hours and then want to roll into bed without cleaning your face -- not that I recommend that!)  --lasts long, as you do not need to use a lot    It took me about 6 months of frequent-ish use (say, 3-4 times a week) to finish my first tube of this stuff I bought from her, before checking Amazon for a repurchase (shh... don&#x27;t tell her I went for a cheaper option!).    The best is that, when I look at photos of myself with the makeup on, you cannot tell I am wearing foundation at all. Many other products I tried made it look like I was wearing a mask.      ***  A tip: do NOT use sponges with this. It will last longer if you use your fingers to rub it into your face, as the sponges will just absorb the makeup and then the sponge will get cakey.  ***    Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have a light golden colored complexion and this  really covers up my dark spots from acne. If I have a zit, I just use a little bit of this and you can barely tell its there. It covers up redness really well, too.  It also looks completely natural, I always get complements when I wear it. It makes my skin glow! And, it doesnt break me out!</li>
            <li> This really blends well with my skin. I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t want it to be obvious that I wear cover. I get so many compliments about how I have great skin, but little do they know lol. Also, since I don&#x27;t really use much, one bottle lasts me about 3 months. I also love to use it on my chest when I wear open shirts and I look and feel so sexy! This product is also pretty resistant to sweat so in the summer time, I wear the more bronze foundation and I look like a god!</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past. It gives a flawless and make the skin look even and clear. Its not patchy at all. A awesome product for daily use. Will buy again and again. It was recommended by my sister. Love it!</li>
            <li> To get Mary Kay at a reduced price - how could you NOT go wrong.  Thanks again for carrying such good products.</li>
