    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It settles in for a flawless finish.  </li>
            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my oilier skin and covering blemishes and is easy to blend your perfect shade whether it&#x27;s winter or summer.</li>
            <li>I was and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li>It works great for under eye use as well as concealing redness around the face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great to customize a skin tone</li>
            <li>and I love that you can blend the two pans of concealer to find your perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise it is a fairly good concealer</li>
            <li>The SC-2 is a good match for my fair skin</li>
            <li>I have tried to find a good concealing product for YEARS and have always had problems...</li>
            <li>This is the lightest color and it&#x27;s too orange for fair skin.</li>
            <li>it also matches my own choice of foundation at a good price.</li>
            <li>Works well with the amazing Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation, which I&#x27;ll never do without again.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED UNDER MY EYES.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suggested that you pick up both colors and mix it on your hand to warm it up.  </li>
            <li>This is the best concealer I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I love that this concealer offers excellent coverage while still providing a natural/ non-cakey look.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to applying it with a brush it blends in well and even better, stays put.  </li>
            <li>This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I did so, and discovered that most of the reviews on you tube are negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use my finger to apply but it works as great when applying with a brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also blends very well.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Laura Mercier products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>After reading so many rave reviews of LMSC</li>
            <li>It hides blemishes beautifully and naturally.</li>
            <li>It covers beautifully without looking like a mask and the colors are natural and brightening.</li>
            <li>You do have to warm it up with your finger by rubbing the surface just to make sure the consistency is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is the best concealer.</li>
            <li>just--- not an easy to use product at all.</li>
            <li>Also it comes off easily when I try to pat on foundation over over</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to get the most coverup, so I did some research on youtube.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a good concelear, and I am so happy I got this.  </li>
            <li>I love that it, as the name accurately suggests, camouflages imperfections without caking on so much makeup that it calls even more attention to my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free, so it stays on longer.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this because to date</li>
            <li>This is great makeup and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty magical.  </li>
            <li>This is really good concealer! :) covers black circles very well, stays matte!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to prescription topicals and pills it is (mostly) under control, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Laura Mercier products and have always absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to blend the two shades together much like I&#x27;ve read about</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased as this concealer delivers on its promise ten fold.</li>
            <li>Other than that it covered everything else very nicely.</li>
            <li>color is very natural on my skin, which is something I have never been able to say about a concealing product before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When my boyfriend first saw me without makeup, he thought I had allergies or something!  </li>
            <li>but I imagine it&#x27;s quite useful for varying skin tones.</li>
            <li>only thing positive thing I can think of about the product is that it comes with two colors so that you can create your own custom color blend.  </li>
            <li>It is worth noting that if you haven&#x27;t used this before it might take some getting used to at first.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, it was hard to get out with my finger to apply, but after a week, it softened up and works great now.</li>
            <li>I use Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer first, then this concealer.</li>
            <li>What I like most is it&#x27;s ability to be customized to my individual skin</li>
            <li>when I have a breakout (or the inevitable scarring that follows) using a good concealer is essential.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, if you&#x27;re having issues with certain areas, this is you go to product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Once applied, this concealer doesn&#x27;t look very cake-y like some of the concealers that I&#x27;ve used and it blends well.</li>
            <li>not enough coverage, cakey, wears off too soon,  I wrote off concealer...until I found this product and the folks at Sephora were nice enough to give me a sample.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>This has a more yellow base and is PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>Finally I have found a concealer that doesn&#x27;t cake, goes on smoothly, stays all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>: Stays put and does not rub off either under or over foundation, coverage can be manipulated to hide small blemishes to spider veins [and probably everything between], very easy to apply and blend, the color dissappears into your skin but still hides the flaws</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, so much that i have purchased it two different times.</li>
            <li>Not sure why its getting so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles and have tried many different concealers.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, fragrance free, concealer that has two tones to blend or use in specific areas.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try as the many different brands of concealers I&#x27;ve used over the years were either too light or dark in tone or just not very effective in overall coverage.  </li>
            <li>, there are better, less expensive products available at the drugstore!  </li>
            <li>dont spend a lot of money on makeup, so I consider this little splurge totally worth it.</li>
            <li>what a great bad spots coverup.</li>
            <li>The Laura Mercier sales person told me this is ONLY for your face - not undereyes because it will dry that area out since the skin is thinner and more delicate.</li>
            <li>It got pretty cakey and creased a little bit.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Once I picked up a few tips, I have to say, I am plesantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I am hispanic with adult acne and dark spots which suck!</li>
            <li> : non, other than possibly price.</li>
            <li> But i find it dry and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also just check out a few tutorials just to give you that extra tips.</li>
            <li> at $25-30 it is pricy but there is a lot of product in the compact and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It works well like that, but it&#x27;s still not amazing for dry skin as it clings to everything (especially under my eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit stiffer than some of the other concealers I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so you need a light tough to start.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This concealer is somewhat dry and a little bit of a hassle to work with.  </li>
            <li> I sadly have adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Its very hard, not soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick.</li>
            <li> This one is comparable to Dermablend, which is less expensive ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> I picked up the wrong shade for me</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Watched online videos on how to apply, but was disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this is the best concealer. Covers well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I sadly have adult acne.  Thanks to prescription topicals and pills it is (mostly) under control, but when I have a breakout (or the inevitable scarring that follows) using a good concealer is essential.  I was excited to try this because to date I&#x27;ve used several Laura Mercier products and have always absolutely loved them.  This concealer is no exception.  The SC-2 is a good match for my fair skin and I love that you can blend the two pans of concealer to find your perfect shade.  It is worth noting that if you haven&#x27;t used this before it might take some getting used to at first.  It&#x27;s a bit stiffer than some of the other concealers I&#x27;ve tried but once you get used to applying it with a brush it blends in well and even better, stays put.  I love that it, as the name accurately suggests, camouflages imperfections without caking on so much makeup that it calls even more attention to my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this!</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have found so far. It&#x27;s oil free, so it stays on longer. The Laura Mercier sales person told me this is ONLY for your face - not undereyes because it will dry that area out since the skin is thinner and more delicate. It&#x27;s perfect for my oilier skin and covering blemishes and is easy to blend your perfect shade whether it&#x27;s winter or summer.

            <li> This is great makeup and goes a long way. It hides blemishes beautifully and naturally. Works well with the amazing Laura Mercier Silk Creme Foundation, which I&#x27;ll never do without again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It covers any imperfections well. You do have to warm it up with your finger by rubbing the surface just to make sure the consistency is right. It didn&#x27;t do so well with under my eyes. It got pretty cakey and creased a little bit. Other than that it covered everything else very nicely. I was and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  Not sure why its getting so many 5 star reviews.  Its very hard, not soft and creamy.  The directions say to use a brush, which it doesn&#x27;t come with.  After receiving the product, I remembered one review suggested watching you tube videos on how to use this product. I did so, and discovered that most of the reviews on you tube are negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing positive thing I can think of about the product is that it comes with two colors so that you can create your own custom color blend.  Other than that, there are better, less expensive products available at the drugstore!  This one is comparable to Dermablend, which is less expensive ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> Product met my needs as noted</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a concealer that doesn&#x27;t cake, goes on smoothly, stays all day and looks natural.Wish I had known about this years ago.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, fragrance free, concealer that has two tones to blend or use in specific areas.  Of all the concealers I have tried over the years, Laura Mercier is the only one I would consider.  It covers beautifully without looking like a mask and the colors are natural and brightening.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and have tried many different concealers. I love that this concealer offers excellent coverage while still providing a natural/ non-cakey look. It works great for under eye use as well as concealing redness around the face.</li>
            <li> This is really good concealer! :) covers black circles very well, stays matte!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth the price, it is creamy and stays in place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use my finger to apply but it works as great when applying with a brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also blends very well.</li>
            <li> I have red under eye circles.  Very red.  When my boyfriend first saw me without makeup, he thought I had allergies or something!  I have tried to find a good concealing product for YEARS and have always had problems...not enough coverage, cakey, wears off too soon,  I wrote off concealer...until I found this product and the folks at Sephora were nice enough to give me a sample.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED UNDER MY EYES.  The circles are GONE all day; I almost forget I have them!  It is very thick, so you need a light tough to start.&lt;br /&gt;The color is very natural on my skin, which is something I have never been able to say about a concealing product before.&lt;br /&gt;I dont spend a lot of money on makeup, so I consider this little splurge totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This concealer is somewhat dry and a little bit of a hassle to work with.  It&#x27;s suggested that you pick up both colors and mix it on your hand to warm it up.  It works well like that, but it&#x27;s still not amazing for dry skin as it clings to everything (especially under my eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to customize a skin tone so I don&#x27;t have to re-buy for the summer, but it doesn&#x27;t make the application any easier.</li>
            <li> I wish i would have had this years ago! I ordered the C2.  I have blue eyes, blonde hair and fair/med skin tone.  This has a more yellow base and is PERFECT!  It settles in for a flawless finish.  I will never be w/o this product.</li>
            <li> what a great bad spots coverup. i like the idea of the powder to apply so the actual concealer STICKS. it also matches my own choice of foundation at a good price.</li>
            <li> I am hispanic with adult acne and dark spots which suck! I have been searching high and low for a good concelear, and I am so happy I got this.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure how to get the most coverup, so I did some research on youtube.  Once I picked up a few tips, I have to say, I am plesantly surprised!

I&#x27;d also just check out a few tutorials just to give you that extra tips.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Laura Mercier products that I&#x27;ve used. Once applied, this concealer doesn&#x27;t look very cake-y like some of the concealers that I&#x27;ve used and it blends well. I haven&#x27;t been able to blend the two shades together much like I&#x27;ve read about but I imagine it&#x27;s quite useful for varying skin tones.</li>
            <li> this actually works it like an eraser waiting for it to cover your face up i wish there was like a powder one cause i dont like the cream but it works so i will use it</li>
            <li> The product is thick. Warming it on the back of your hand helps. This is the lightest color and it&#x27;s too orange for fair skin. Also it comes off easily when I try to pat on foundation over over and I&#x27;m not blending I&#x27;m just dabbing.</li>
            <li> I have a portwine birthmark on my face What I used for 17 years is now exclusively sold in Europe. I went through countless brands before finding this. It is amazing I dont think there is anything it couldnt cover &amp; it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re even wearing it. Excellent</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews of LMSC I decided to give it a try as the many different brands of concealers I&#x27;ve used over the years were either too light or dark in tone or just not very effective in overall coverage.  I could not be more pleased as this concealer delivers on its promise ten fold. What I like most is it&#x27;s ability to be customized to my individual skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Stays put and does not rub off either under or over foundation, coverage can be manipulated to hide small blemishes to spider veins [and probably everything between], very easy to apply and blend, the color dissappears into your skin but still hides the flaws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: non, other than possibly price. at $25-30 it is pricy but there is a lot of product in the compact and a little goes a long way so the compact should last long enough to justify it&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I would recommend applying LMSC with a concealer brush as it blends esier with a brush than it does with fingertips.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Too expensive.  Watched online videos on how to apply, but was disappointed in the product.</li>
