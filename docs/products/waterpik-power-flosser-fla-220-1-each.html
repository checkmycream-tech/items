            <li>I had read the reviews before purchasing the product and they sounded great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know it was coming in with my water pik great deal</li>
            <li>Works great with my son&#x27;s braces.</li>

            <li>Is great for trips</li>
            <li>But my dentist tells me my teeth look great</li>
            <li>Great for the teeth/</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>Works great but just don&#x27;t like how the tips bend sometimes.</li>
            <li>worked great, received in great shape.  </li>

            <li>Now I&#x27;m a dental flosser and worried about how to maintain my great gums and teeth hygiene for the duration of braces.</li>

            <li>and it still works good.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t use it to often, my teeth don&#x27;t feel really good after i used it for 4 days</li>
            <li>The idea is good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on a good electric toohbrush.</li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>I have a dentist appointment soon and will get a report on how good a job the power flosser has done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and makes your between teeth gums feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this has a good description</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is good</li>
            <li>Good value and reliable functionality.</li>
            <li>good value</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This flosser does a good job</li>
            <li>received in good condition</li>
            <li>Serves as a good reminder to floss.</li>
            <li>They loved it.</li>
            <li>This looked good on paper, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>A really good flosser for going travelling and at home.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is a good compact tickler.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a good way to fix the problem.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and the grandkids truly enjoy it and I am in hopes it will help them with there teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>This is a very handy product to own.</li>
            <li>But the tips work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>but honestly, it increased the amount of work involved and didn&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li>my dad just love it~!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>You will love them, I do!</li>
            <li>so I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am a much better steward of my teeth now!</li>
            <li>I just bought 4 more after riding with a friend who pulled out string dental floss from his pocket and tried to floss lunch out of his teeth while driving!   </li>
            <li>Love this item!  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase and how effective this was.</li>
            <li>Love it and all the Swiffer products!</li>
            <li>Excellent, easy and comfortable to us.</li>
            <li>All my famly members are loving this product and I am planning to get one for each of them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the advantage, honestly.</li>
            <li>This item is not a Waterpik per se but a handy battery-operated flexible tooth pick to remove food particles between teeth in hard-to-get places with or without water.</li>
            <li>When you are at home or if you are away, this product will come in handy.</li>
            <li>liked it</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>was fooled by my hygienist&#x27;s telling me that portable WaterPiks were handy and affordable.  </li>
            <li>it is nice that it has wirking baterys</li>
            <li>but it is a handy tool, in my experience, to resort to between brushings or when brushing isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it delivers good flossing, but it sure makes your gums sore.</li>
            <li>Works awesome for some fast flossing.</li>
            <li>Nice for the car.</li>
            <li>I rely on my full size Waterpik and am happy to have this one for travel and visiting out of town.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Good to travel with, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Had great straight teeth still am told my jaw alignment and teeth are good</li>
            <li>My fam feels manual flossing is more effective.</li>
            <li>Even on the teeth it did fit between it didn&#x27;t do a good</li>
            <li>it is easy!  </li>
            <li>So, this is a great flosser for people that don&#x27;t want to keep all their teeth (unless you happen to have nice even large gaps between all your teeth).</li>
            <li>Tried this and liked it better than string, so I&#x27;ve been using it more, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good if you have bridges avoiding the use of those special hand flossers.</li>
            <li>The first flosser was great, but when I ordered another one, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this device, except that, fortunately, it is not very expensive.</li>
            <li>These WaterPiks are fine but can&#x27;t judge whether they are absolutely effective in removing bits of food.</li>
            <li>Just remember you will need to buy more of the flossers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Water Pik Flosser for many years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this power flosser and I love it.  </li>
            <li>After I got this product, I love to floss everytime after eating food.</li>
            <li>i do much better with this.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than manual flossing.</li>
            <li>I affectionately call this tool &amp;#34;Brutal Mars&amp;#34;... I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this gadget I find myself flossing more often.</li>
            <li>but i was charged more for shipping than the price of the product.</li>
            <li>my teeth often shred most floss.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth better than then string floss.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful device if you have a kid with braces where traditional flossing doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Love it though.</li>
            <li>This WaterPik Flosser works ok for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot understand why so many people are complaining about replacing the battery....</li>
            <li>Does this do a better job than string floss?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but if you have a waterpik, you shouldn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, wish I would have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li>Top section won&#x27;t detach and cant add water to battery compartment.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>This is better than anything else in respect to saving money for any dental treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this power flosser for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I like this better than a floss string</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still interesting.</li>
            <li>I love to go to the dentist now, saying &amp;#34;goodbye&amp;#34; forever to costly fillings or  periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>My dentist was pleased with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love this flosser.  </li>
            <li>try to get any gaps you can&#x27;t see, unless you want to use up a tip or more per day.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this power flosser for many years.  </li>
            <li>but I like the person more then to give them this.</li>
            <li>Great product and very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>Very happy, bigger, not pocket sized.</li>
            <li>Better than the humming bird tips, but not a pocket sized, take with you item.</li>
            <li>A more rigid pick would have been preferred.</li>
            <li>Infrequent flossers may floss more.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>This item is okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok item.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to get my treatment done yet.</li>
            <li>Of the many devices I have purchased for the care of my teeth, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>works OK</li>
            <li>5 Stars for sure.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is my mission in life to find products that are better than floss -</li>
            <li>So much better than toothpicks when on the go.l.</li>
            <li>Ok, the name got me confused!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE this device and am NOT associated with the company.</li>
            <li>Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li>(I keep it on me at work, I&#x27;m a grazer for my 12hr shifts) and the space is food free!</li>
            <li>This may not work for everyone, those with braces might find it challenging</li>
            <li>..use magnification or readers if need be to see it and put the indentation to the top end of the flosser.</li>
            <li>..use magnification or readers if need be to see it and put the indentation to the top end of the flosser.</li>
            <li>Bought these to get my kids to floss more often and more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>The machine itself would probably be okay, if not for the flossing tips, which are just too flimsy to be of any use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use a toothpick!  :-)</li>
            <li>it will be a better unit, if not, look for another brand</li>
            <li>This is a great product for an easy alternative to flossing when you don&#x27;t have time for the real thing.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good, I thought when i bought it I will have a place to pour water into it</li>
            <li>what a nice and effective purchase , thanks</li>
            <li>so much.so many good reviews,i really can not understand.</li>
            <li>Make sure you can return it free to try it</li>
            <li>Use ideal for trips or short term</li>
            <li>just wish it fit better.</li>
            <li>The tips&#x27; vibration is so intense that they must be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>It works real well and is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>but it is not as good as a real floss.</li>
            <li>This flosser is very easy &amp; quick to use if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>They are a little pricey with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a GREAT product &amp; good for people who are not flossing-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And it probably is highly effective in massaging the gums, more gently than floss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as easy &amp; painless as it gets</li>
            <li>easy to use and operate.</li>
            <li>This is so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so the Flosser would be in easy reach.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with braces</li>
            <li>compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Functional and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use, recommended.</li>
            <li>This electronic flosser is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I use as many things in an effort to keep my teeth and keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use</li>
            <li>This item is an easy to pack and go for flossing on the run.  </li>
            <li>It does remove those types of foods quite easily.</li>
            <li>This Item may be good for stimulating the gums, but It&#x27;s main purpose as a floss replacer.</li>
            <li>The vibration is way too strong; it can cause the gums to bleed.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, easily, nice to use, very fast.</li>
            <li>It does not remove the plaque between the teeth and the probe is so fine and limber that it does not do anything around the gum line.</li>
            <li>But works fine except</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will work fine for traveling</li>
            <li>Another fine use is in molar areas where gum recession has caused exposure of the root surfaces between the roots.</li>
            <li>They fit this flosser just fine and interchange either replacement piks in either flosser itself.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and very accomodating!  </li>
            <li>I find the little floss picks work the best for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and leaves my mouth feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li>The product is simple to use, works great and comes in pleasing colour.</li>
            <li>It claims to be as effective as thread flossing, and it very well may be.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll always use regular floss myself, but for those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for watching TV, especially the commercials.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets all the plaque as effectively as string might, but it&#x27;s much easier to use and will remove a lot of debris and plaque in between teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even more effective than regular floss since it vibrates &amp; stimulates your gums more.</li>
            <li>But cheap non water flosser.</li>
            <li>was a free gift with order.</li>
            <li>CHEAP PLASTIC</li>
            <li>Said it wouldn&#x27;t fit between some of his teeth.</li>
            <li>The cheap price reflects the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the Hummingbird&amp;#34;, which is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>They work great for front teeth, but once I get to my back molars it is too flimsy to squeeze between.</li>
            <li>This is the best tool for braces!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe these are not available in the orthodontist</li>
            <li>Stocking stuffers this year, as I&#x27;ve used one for years and gave great results with such ease of use.</li>
            <li>I have advanced gum disease</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using my flosser I will reccommend it</li>
            <li>Since Oral-B killed the excellent Hummingbird flosser (why??)</li>
            <li>They were purchased to use primarily around my tooth implant, as the doctor cautioned not to use any metal instruments to scrape the metal part of the implant, as happens when the dentist does their teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap made.  </li>
            <li>It too big to ever get under the gum line to do any good where It counts the most.</li>
            <li>This flossing device is one that I find very useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best way for me to get between my very tight teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it does not reach the many plaque prone areas between teeth that normal floss does, something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>While I am not overwhelmed, I am not necessarily disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be held in higher esteem by kids who would enjoy the novelty of it!</li>
            <li>This item used to be in drugstores not so long ago but disappeared, and it took a great deal of persistence to find it online</li>
            <li>It will get your family excited about flossing.</li>
            <li>It uses one AA battery, so it&#x27;s not that powerful, but it&#x27;s portable and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>illusions were quickly shattered when we discovered that the picks don&#x27;t fit well between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Works well and seems to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>With braces, you can clean the &amp;#34;in-betweens&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have lots of food traps, and the Power Flosser didn&#x27;t keep them clean.</li>
            <li>And for such a great price I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I automatically expect a device that uses water to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to get a special discount by meeting the minimum order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been far more user friendly than sticking my hand in my mouth!</li>
            <li>They come in cool kid colors too, which helps since it encourages usage for some reason</li>
            <li>I just could not see how full the bottom of the Water Pik was</li>
            <li>This tool is definitely a great addition to almost anyone&#x27;s dental care, as long as the more normal cleaning tools are still used.</li>
            <li>that is how much I really, really DON&#x27;T love floss.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dentist, and this is an easy, effective alternative to actual flossing.</li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of money; save up and get a better one!</li>
            <li>The tips are pretty fine</li>
            <li>Kind of like a super cheap alternative to a deep cleaning tool from the dentist</li>
            <li>I felt it just doesn&#x27;t adequately meet all needs like the Oral B Hummingbird flosser could.</li>
            <li>I wish the tips wouldn&#x27;t bend so quickly, but besides that I like this product.</li>
            <li>the pick does a super job.  </li>
            <li>The flosser tips must be meant for people huge gaps in their teeth, because they dont come near to being able to floss my teeth or have ANY effect on my gums at all.</li>
            <li>So as to those who have issues with the piks coming out or staying in your teeth and pulling off the flosser....there is a tiny indentation on the top of the pik itself that aligns it with the top of the flosser.</li>
            <li>Flossing is still better, but this thing does a decent job when youre not in the mood to floss.</li>
            <li>This seems intended more to help reach hard-to-get spots in conjunction with normal floss use.</li>
            <li>So just go there more gentle or skip it during the more sensitive periods..due to the brace work not this item.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t take the place of regular flossing, but for those who aren&#x27;t great flossers or for those with braces, it might be an incentive for better oral hygiene, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>So, while it is not bad, to me it&#x27;s about as useful as electrifying a pencil...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth at the gum level, and it can also be used long the gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular model is also great for travel since it&#x27;s battery-powered and smaller in comparison to versions like the one I use.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get into quite all the places that floss does, but super easy to use between teeth so much faster than dealing with messing, smelly floss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and really helps</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very helpful for flossing with braces.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Handy and quick when you can&#x27;t use regular floss, but it is not a substitute for string floss.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it didn&#x27;t cost much because after 3 days I tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay waterpik, expected more out of it, but still using it</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as useful oral aide.</li>
            <li>In my book, whatever motivates anyone to floss is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nifty oral cleaning product however would have liked longer brushes and they do not last over two uses.  </li>
            <li>so thought this would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li>But for the price, I consider it to be a fairly useful tool in my dental care arsenal.</li>
            <li>This is such a handy device</li>
            <li>almost makes it fun to floss</li>
            <li>and I do find it useful.  </li>
            <li>It is almost fun to use.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, its loud</li>
            <li>Replaces the regular old string for flossing in a great way.</li>
            <li>Have 3, they are so useful.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made only was able to get one weeks</li>
            <li>Seems to be working as they think it is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>This little device has resulted in some very nice comments about my teeth from the dental hygienist (who used to scold me for not flossing).  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of flossing, with so much less hassle than using ordinary dental floss--thus increasing the odds that I will faithfully floss my teeth--and keep my dentist happy.</li>
            <li>So many other flossing products are so much better and don&#x27;t cause gum problems.</li>
            <li>I like the power glosser more than I thought I would MEANING it is more convenient than string floss, less deliberate than a toothpick, and can be used quickly.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is super gentle!</li>
            <li>This is a great little flosser for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away right away to avoid an eye-sore.</li>
            <li>price was right but finding the refills is not.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good, not what I expected but it works.</li>
            <li>ok, but water pik just much better job with less effort</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people like me who are too lazy to floss</li>
            <li>Great for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li>You have to hold your finger on the Power button, otherwise it won&#x27;t operate, which is a good thing - it won&#x27;t just run down the battery.</li>
            <li>I particularly like how easily the nylon tips slip between one&#x27;s teeth, much easier than thread floss and threaders.</li>
            <li>But he doesn&#x27;t do NEARLY as good a job at cleaning your teeth as floss or those little portable floss</li>
            <li>What a new and exciting way to floss!  </li>
            <li>This product does have its uses though, it works great if you eat something like popcorn that can get under the gum-line or a hard, sticky food that has a tendency to get stuck to the teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to change battery and use, suits his requirements for keeping teeth clean and free of little bits.</li>
            <li>Works good, but kind of hard to get to back teeth.</li>
            <li>I found that regular floss works better and is even easier.</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was exactly like the one on tv that squirts water</li>
            <li>I used to feel like floss could slip in too deep into some gum pockets and make them bleed or hurt more.    </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like having the top of the unit open between uses, even though the tips are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is useful, it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This product makes flossing more of a hassle than using actual floss.</li>
            <li>It will only be able to work its way into the crevice between teeth where they meet your gums.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that this is not water flosser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and not expensive.</li>
            <li>A traditional floss will do the work better.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hit the gap exactly, you bend the tip and drastically reduce its life.  </li>
            <li>I love the flosser, and I&#x27;ve finally got my husband to floss.  </li>
            <li>now I floss more regularly since it is so much easier!</li>
            <li>This gadget will give you more incentive to attempt daily flossing.</li>
            <li>Started bleeding a lot after the first use .</li>
            <li>Not my first one.</li>
            <li>and it is not expensive to purchase</li>
            <li>I think regular flossing or a Waterpik is a better option.</li>
            <li>it is waxed for smooth action between your teeth.</li>
            <li>This was not that, BUT I was able to slide the tiny pick UNDER the food particles and it vibrated them out....</li>
            <li>I did think perhaps they were a bit more sturdy and lasted maybe a bit longer than the blue piks do.</li>
            <li>so no detection they do anything more than the blue ones do.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best little Flosser !!!!</li>
            <li>our 10-yr-old didn&#x27;t have the patience or coordination to floss on his own until we got him one of these, and now he calmly integrates it into his evening routine - he just needed some supervision &amp; guidance the first few times.  </li>
            <li>have just the smallest of queries about the design of the bristles; I reckon a little less flexibility and a bit more roughness on the bristle stem would improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>There were lots of positive reviews, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used it for a couple of weeks now and nothing but positive comments about it.</li>
            <li>Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company</li>
            <li>Not terribly expensive, really, but it is an ongoing expense if you continue to use this flosser.</li>
            <li>It is better in the long run.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and came with batteries and extra flossers.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s going great for the past 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>When I was reading the information about this product is said it was good for braces and those hard to get places.</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>came with the purchase of the and really an unnaccessary item.</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t have to replace the tip with every use.</li>
            <li>My son has braces and this works really well for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Power flosser works very well.  </li>
            <li>So, in the end, I&#x27;d have to conclude by saying this is recommended for use in addition to brushing, flossing and using a real water pick.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would make flossing easier</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one for years and wish they had been available when I was much younger</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li>Absolutely A+</li>
            <li>I really like this item</li>
            <li>Ours ended up in the electronic recycling pile very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It came fast and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be a straight up replacement for using floss.</li>
            <li>Really helps maintain dental health.  </li>
            <li>bought 2 and both are really junk.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do it nearly as much as dentists recommend.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient, and really does get into those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Sounds like it would not work on my teeth as they are close together</li>
            <li>I had no idea how much I would like this flosser.</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Really I did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the benefits of this unless you have braces?</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li>I never before appreciated wax they coat the floss with, but now I do.</li>
            <li>and it really works wonders.</li>
            <li>this thing only lasts a month, I&#x27;ll replace it every month, that&#x27;s how important and functional it is for</li>
            <li>So trying things that look promising or helpful.</li>
            <li>A happy consumer with this item but save money and stay with the regular basic blue piks.er.</li>
            <li>A happy consumer with this item but save money and stay with the regular basic blue piks.</li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have saved my money, and invested in a real water pick.</li>
            <li>For the slackers who dont floss everyday, this thing is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>There is just no way this is as good as plain old flossing.</li>
            <li>The Swiffer Cordless Vacuum is a great little vac for quick pickup of spilled items or as a \\&quot;between regular vacuuming\\&quot; sweeper!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t actually use water to clean.</li>
            <li>and you have to go through multiple pics to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>This works very well,  especially in tight places and good along the gum line....also runs on batteries.  </li>
            <li>Also provided are extra nylon tips that are soft and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>At first, my gums were a bit sensitive to the vibration, but that passed in a week or so.</li>
            <li>The thin, flexible pick doesn&#x27;t get between my more crowded teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get food out better than old school flossing.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had it long enough to need a battery change, but I like to take things apart when I first receive them, to make sure</li>
            <li>So I gave them a try and will finish using them but not worth more money.</li>
            <li>This little gadget works very well and may save my teeth from more dentistry, hopefully.</li>
            <li>Hope the new recipient likes it!...?</li>
            <li>The truth is that for a regular flosser, this thing can be more of an inconvenience or annoyance than actually flossing.</li>
            <li>It works ok so far, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>it would cost more to return than cost of 2 of same item, 2 of same sent in 1 order.,</li>
            <li>main problem is the pick, its too flimsy.</li>
            <li>Not a true waterpik, this is more like a floss stick.</li>
            <li>Not really much power to unit but may be good for traveling and can be used for overnight use but not very powerful.</li>
            <li>However, as a word of caution to those of you with tight tooth contact between each tooth it won&#x27;t be able to floss for you.  </li>
            <li>My contacts aren&#x27;t as tight so it works okay for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for flossing freaks.</li>
            <li>Small item, very easy to assembly the tips.</li>
            <li>Needs a little more firmness</li>
            <li>It seems to be a little more efficient about loosening food between the teeth than just flossing which I still continue to do.  </li>
            <li>Glad the price was no more than what it was, but you get what you pay and with this item I certainly did.</li>
            <li>I thought the inserts would be little brushes that would really do the job instead they are smooth and don&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just one of those pick thingies that you can buy at the dollar store, it just has a big handle.</li>
            <li>Take off the removable piece just below the tip to provide a better grip &amp; the handle can be pulled off without too much trouble.</li>
            <li>Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I imagined it to be and has quite simple way of disposing used picks as well as loading a fresh one.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool little flosser for the price.</li>
            <li>and I buy a new one of these every couple of years.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T on how to insert a new pik from the pik holding case</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T on how to insert a new pik from the pik holding case</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it completely, but every other day or so is just fine.</li>
            <li>teeth are tight together which makes using dental floss more difficult, this is a good supplement for flossing.</li>
            <li>The tips ARE pretty simple to replace, which is a relief after the difficulty with the battery replacement experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shall be interested to see what mybdentist says when I next visit.</li>
            <li>:  I have been using this product for several days, now; unlike the real Water-Pik I ordered to replace it with, it&#x27;s easier for a hemiparetic (me!)</li>
            <li>He was surprised and loves it!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in having a blue wobbly thing wiggling in between your teeth ...</li>
            <li>well, this one ranks pretty low on the list.</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for keeping my teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>But it was so cheap and inexpensive too, that it is not worth returning.  </li>
            <li>This cordless flosser is adequate but does not have all that much power and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for me.</li>
            <li>Not sure it the results will be as effective as using regular floss.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company or received a different product than I did (the WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser).</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, not very noisy and extremely efficient.</li>
            <li>I have braces and hate threading floss, so I saw this and thought it was a good, easy alternative.</li>
            <li>Also, the floss tips are way too flimsy to fit into tight places between teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but the only down side I can find is it is difficult to use on my back teeth, but with a little practice and patience, I found a way  The vibration does a great job of massaging the gums.</li>
            <li>You just go right past the braces right to the gum line and space between the teeth.</li>
            <li>the little brushes won&#x27;t fit into.</li>
            <li>During the 8-9 years that i couldn&#x27;t find them on the drug store shelves i felt lost &amp; actually pained, since the vibration of the appliance absolutely helps to calm gum trauma created by dental pockets that food tends to collect in as well as shake it loose while the flossing tip nudges.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old just got braces and flossing was a challenge.  </li>
            <li>It is not for someone with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li>Much easier for me to use than regular floss.</li>
            <li>I am already a frequent flosser.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say, but I alternate between this and string.  </li>
            <li>Overall very satisfactory...</li>
            <li>It is ready instantly with no pulling and wrapping difficulties like the string.  </li>
            <li>The tips are too soft to be used as floss to go between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I read some critiques about the tip on the Amazon site, but have learned how to insert it by sliding it along the opening between my teeth instead of trying to insert it directly in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have some teeth that are very close together and can&#x27;t use it there or back by my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>Had the old humming bird flosser, can&#x27;t seem to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>The unit is acceptable, but the picks themselves are extremely soft and often break or come out of the unit.  </li>
            <li>After reading your reviews I will not waste my money</li>
            <li>As far as battery powered contraptions go ...</li>
            <li>Tips are too soft and bend during use.</li>
            <li>There is an old joke in dentistry \\&quot;You</li>
            <li>Now for one negative observation: The whitening piks don&#x27;t seem to do anything except cost a bit more.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and you will actually use this daily.  </li>
            <li>Good thing it is not too expensive.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product is not good for cleaning your teeth and it&#x27;s set up for you to spend more money on those little pics as you know you only get so many</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the single AA battery lasts a good long while because changing/replacing the battery is not easy.</li>
            <li>First of all, the angle is such that you cannot reach the back teeth at all without contortion.</li>
            <li>Does a poor job at cleaning and the tip bend VERY easily.</li>
            <li>works great  easy for those of us who hate to floss!!</li>
            <li>The tip is kind of weak - a larger tip is preferred.</li>
            <li>The Sweeper Vacuum recharges quickly and the charge lasts long enough for me to all the wood and tile floors in my 2600 square foot house!  </li>
            <li>Just wish they sold the picks at a low price and that you would not have to keep purchasing new floss</li>
            <li>Someone made a disappointing decision to discontinue such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Real WaterPiks are much more expensive and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>The picks bend very easily, and the angle of the device makes it very hard to reach back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Simply pull the handle down, it pops off, the single AA battery is easy to pull out, simply snap in a new one.  </li>
            <li>The general usefulness</li>
            <li>The back teeth are nearly inaccessible to the head because of it&#x27;s angle.  </li>
            <li>After playing around with it awhile, I did get the battery out, and back together, but not without considerable effort.</li>
            <li>This interdental stimulator is not expected to take the place of flossing.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I found with this order was that the Flosser did not come with a stand, as my old one.</li>
            <li>it from the front only, near a mirror so you can aim it.  </li>
            <li>but it sure makes you want to floss and at least get the bigger gaps in the back.</li>
            <li>I did find several spots that are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>Not for me as far as flossing as it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and if anyone has ever done it, I would love to know what is the secret.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never actually seen it work very well, meaning, in the week I&#x27;ve tried it, I haven&#x27;t had it take out one single piece of food between my teeth, so</li>
            <li>This pik was a bit odd at first since no water was involved.</li>
            <li>eat a lot of popcorn, and hoped it would help with the stubborn hulls getting caught in my inside back teeth (along the inside gum line), but the tips are alittle too fragile to do that job well enough, so I&#x27;ll continue to look for an answer to that particular problem.</li>
            <li>lol I highly recommend these if your kids aren&#x27;t capable of flossing themselves yet (I get sick of doing it for them), or are like me and just lazy.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s bad about using normal floss, I think he is finally doing a good thing for his teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser comes with 15 disposable tips, which doesn&#x27;t really last that long, as these are really single-use tips only.</li>
            <li>The tip bends so frequently as you try to manipulate it in between those back teeth that you might as well reach for the regular floss and get it all over with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flossing is such a drag, but this product makes it much easier.</li>
            <li>I used my first one for YEARS before it finally started to slow down, so I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth before buying this new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that it will replace regular floss completely (too early to tell), but is very efficient to have around.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into teeth gadgets, you may like this for a while, but you&#x27;ll get quickly bored of it (about as fast as the cheap internal battery lasts).</li>
            <li>I used to have braces and know how hard it was to clean them with regular floss.</li>
            <li>Not ideal, but better than not flossing (or equivalent) at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, gets down at the gum line and fits between teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is really just a little jackhammer that drives a bit of fishing line at your gums.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>

            <li> Great for the teeth/</li>

            <li> The idea is good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> Spend your money on a good electric toohbrush.</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> I have a dentist appointment soon and will get a report on how good a job the power flosser has done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and makes your between teeth gums feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this has a good description</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is good</li>
            <li> Good value and reliable functionality.</li>
            <li> good value</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> This flosser does a good job</li>
            <li> received in good condition</li>
            <li> Serves as a good reminder to floss.</li>
            <li> They loved it.</li>
            <li> This looked good on paper, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> A really good flosser for going travelling and at home.</li>
            <li> Anyway it is a good compact tickler.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be a good way to fix the problem.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and the grandkids truly enjoy it and I am in hopes it will help them with there teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> This is a very handy product to own.</li>
            <li> But the tips work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> but honestly, it increased the amount of work involved and didn&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li> my dad just love it~!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You will love them, I do!</li>
            <li> so I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am a much better steward of my teeth now!</li>
            <li> I just bought 4 more after riding with a friend who pulled out string dental floss from his pocket and tried to floss lunch out of his teeth while driving!   </li>
            <li> Love this item!  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase and how effective this was.</li>
            <li> Love it and all the Swiffer products!</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy and comfortable to us.</li>
            <li> All my famly members are loving this product and I am planning to get one for each of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the advantage, honestly.</li>
            <li> This item is not a Waterpik per se but a handy battery-operated flexible tooth pick to remove food particles between teeth in hard-to-get places with or without water.</li>
            <li> When you are at home or if you are away, this product will come in handy.</li>
            <li> liked it</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> was fooled by my hygienist&#x27;s telling me that portable WaterPiks were handy and affordable.  </li>
            <li> it is nice that it has wirking baterys</li>
            <li> but it is a handy tool, in my experience, to resort to between brushings or when brushing isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it delivers good flossing, but it sure makes your gums sore.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for some fast flossing.</li>
            <li> Nice for the car.</li>
            <li> I rely on my full size Waterpik and am happy to have this one for travel and visiting out of town.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> Good to travel with, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Had great straight teeth still am told my jaw alignment and teeth are good</li>
            <li> My fam feels manual flossing is more effective.</li>
            <li> Even on the teeth it did fit between it didn&#x27;t do a good</li>
            <li> it is easy!  </li>
            <li> So, this is a great flosser for people that don&#x27;t want to keep all their teeth (unless you happen to have nice even large gaps between all your teeth).</li>
            <li> Tried this and liked it better than string, so I&#x27;ve been using it more, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good if you have bridges avoiding the use of those special hand flossers.</li>
            <li> The first flosser was great, but when I ordered another one, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this device, except that, fortunately, it is not very expensive.</li>
            <li> These WaterPiks are fine but can&#x27;t judge whether they are absolutely effective in removing bits of food.</li>
            <li> Just remember you will need to buy more of the flossers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Water Pik Flosser for many years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this power flosser and I love it.  </li>
            <li> After I got this product, I love to floss everytime after eating food.</li>
            <li> i do much better with this.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job than manual flossing.</li>
            <li> I affectionately call this tool &amp;#34;Brutal Mars&amp;#34;... I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this gadget I find myself flossing more often.</li>
            <li> but i was charged more for shipping than the price of the product.</li>
            <li> my teeth often shred most floss.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth better than then string floss.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful device if you have a kid with braces where traditional flossing doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love it though.</li>
            <li> This WaterPik Flosser works ok for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why so many people are complaining about replacing the battery....</li>
            <li> Does this do a better job than string floss?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but if you have a waterpik, you shouldn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, wish I would have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li> Top section won&#x27;t detach and cant add water to battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> This is better than anything else in respect to saving money for any dental treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this power flosser for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a floss string</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still interesting.</li>
            <li> I love to go to the dentist now, saying &amp;#34;goodbye&amp;#34; forever to costly fillings or  periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> My dentist was pleased with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this flosser.  </li>
            <li> try to get any gaps you can&#x27;t see, unless you want to use up a tip or more per day.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this power flosser for many years.  </li>
            <li> but I like the person more then to give them this.</li>
            <li> Great product and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I love this thing</li>
            <li> Very happy, bigger, not pocket sized.</li>
            <li> Better than the humming bird tips, but not a pocket sized, take with you item.</li>
            <li> A more rigid pick would have been preferred.</li>
            <li> Infrequent flossers may floss more.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> This item is okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok item.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to get my treatment done yet.</li>
            <li> Of the many devices I have purchased for the care of my teeth, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> works OK</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is my mission in life to find products that are better than floss -</li>
            <li> So much better than toothpicks when on the go.l.</li>
            <li> Ok, the name got me confused!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE this device and am NOT associated with the company.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> (I keep it on me at work, I&#x27;m a grazer for my 12hr shifts) and the space is food free!</li>
            <li> This may not work for everyone, those with braces might find it challenging</li>
            <li> ..use magnification or readers if need be to see it and put the indentation to the top end of the flosser.</li>
            <li> ..use magnification or readers if need be to see it and put the indentation to the top end of the flosser.</li>
            <li> Bought these to get my kids to floss more often and more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> The machine itself would probably be okay, if not for the flossing tips, which are just too flimsy to be of any use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use a toothpick!  :-)</li>
            <li> it will be a better unit, if not, look for another brand</li>
            <li> This is a great product for an easy alternative to flossing when you don&#x27;t have time for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good, I thought when i bought it I will have a place to pour water into it</li>
            <li> what a nice and effective purchase , thanks</li>
            <li> so much.so many good reviews,i really can not understand.</li>
            <li> Make sure you can return it free to try it</li>
            <li> Use ideal for trips or short term</li>
            <li> just wish it fit better.</li>
            <li> The tips&#x27; vibration is so intense that they must be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> It works real well and is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is not as good as a real floss.</li>
            <li> This flosser is very easy &amp; quick to use if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a GREAT product &amp; good for people who are not flossing-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And it probably is highly effective in massaging the gums, more gently than floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as easy &amp; painless as it gets</li>
            <li> easy to use and operate.</li>
            <li> This is so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so the Flosser would be in easy reach.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with braces</li>
            <li> compact and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Functional and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use, recommended.</li>
            <li> This electronic flosser is lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I use as many things in an effort to keep my teeth and keep them clean.  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to use</li>
            <li> This item is an easy to pack and go for flossing on the run.  </li>
            <li> It does remove those types of foods quite easily.</li>
            <li> This Item may be good for stimulating the gums, but It&#x27;s main purpose as a floss replacer.</li>
            <li> The vibration is way too strong; it can cause the gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, easily, nice to use, very fast.</li>
            <li> It does not remove the plaque between the teeth and the probe is so fine and limber that it does not do anything around the gum line.</li>
            <li> But works fine except</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will work fine for traveling</li>
            <li> Another fine use is in molar areas where gum recession has caused exposure of the root surfaces between the roots.</li>
            <li> They fit this flosser just fine and interchange either replacement piks in either flosser itself.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and very accomodating!  </li>
            <li> I find the little floss picks work the best for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and leaves my mouth feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li> The product is simple to use, works great and comes in pleasing colour.</li>
            <li> It claims to be as effective as thread flossing, and it very well may be.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll always use regular floss myself, but for those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for watching TV, especially the commercials.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets all the plaque as effectively as string might, but it&#x27;s much easier to use and will remove a lot of debris and plaque in between teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even more effective than regular floss since it vibrates &amp; stimulates your gums more.</li>
            <li> But cheap non water flosser.</li>
            <li> was a free gift with order.</li>
            <li> CHEAP PLASTIC</li>
            <li> Said it wouldn&#x27;t fit between some of his teeth.</li>
            <li> The cheap price reflects the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Hummingbird&amp;#34;, which is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> They work great for front teeth, but once I get to my back molars it is too flimsy to squeeze between.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool for braces!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe these are not available in the orthodontist</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffers this year, as I&#x27;ve used one for years and gave great results with such ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have advanced gum disease</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using my flosser I will reccommend it</li>
            <li> Since Oral-B killed the excellent Hummingbird flosser (why??)</li>
            <li> They were purchased to use primarily around my tooth implant, as the doctor cautioned not to use any metal instruments to scrape the metal part of the implant, as happens when the dentist does their teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cheap made.  </li>
            <li> It too big to ever get under the gum line to do any good where It counts the most.</li>
            <li> This flossing device is one that I find very useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best way for me to get between my very tight teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it does not reach the many plaque prone areas between teeth that normal floss does, something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> While I am not overwhelmed, I am not necessarily disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might be held in higher esteem by kids who would enjoy the novelty of it!</li>
            <li> This item used to be in drugstores not so long ago but disappeared, and it took a great deal of persistence to find it online</li>
            <li> It will get your family excited about flossing.</li>
            <li> It uses one AA battery, so it&#x27;s not that powerful, but it&#x27;s portable and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> illusions were quickly shattered when we discovered that the picks don&#x27;t fit well between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> With braces, you can clean the &amp;#34;in-betweens&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have lots of food traps, and the Power Flosser didn&#x27;t keep them clean.</li>
            <li> And for such a great price I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I automatically expect a device that uses water to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to get a special discount by meeting the minimum order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been far more user friendly than sticking my hand in my mouth!</li>
            <li> They come in cool kid colors too, which helps since it encourages usage for some reason</li>
            <li> I just could not see how full the bottom of the Water Pik was</li>
            <li> This tool is definitely a great addition to almost anyone&#x27;s dental care, as long as the more normal cleaning tools are still used.</li>
            <li> that is how much I really, really DON&#x27;T love floss.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist, and this is an easy, effective alternative to actual flossing.</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money; save up and get a better one!</li>
            <li> The tips are pretty fine</li>
            <li> Kind of like a super cheap alternative to a deep cleaning tool from the dentist</li>
            <li> I felt it just doesn&#x27;t adequately meet all needs like the Oral B Hummingbird flosser could.</li>
            <li> I wish the tips wouldn&#x27;t bend so quickly, but besides that I like this product.</li>
            <li> the pick does a super job.  </li>
            <li> The flosser tips must be meant for people huge gaps in their teeth, because they dont come near to being able to floss my teeth or have ANY effect on my gums at all.</li>
            <li> So as to those who have issues with the piks coming out or staying in your teeth and pulling off the flosser....there is a tiny indentation on the top of the pik itself that aligns it with the top of the flosser.</li>
            <li> Flossing is still better, but this thing does a decent job when youre not in the mood to floss.</li>
            <li> This seems intended more to help reach hard-to-get spots in conjunction with normal floss use.</li>
            <li> So just go there more gentle or skip it during the more sensitive periods..due to the brace work not this item.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t take the place of regular flossing, but for those who aren&#x27;t great flossers or for those with braces, it might be an incentive for better oral hygiene, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> So, while it is not bad, to me it&#x27;s about as useful as electrifying a pencil...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth at the gum level, and it can also be used long the gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular model is also great for travel since it&#x27;s battery-powered and smaller in comparison to versions like the one I use.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get into quite all the places that floss does, but super easy to use between teeth so much faster than dealing with messing, smelly floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and really helps</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very helpful for flossing with braces.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Handy and quick when you can&#x27;t use regular floss, but it is not a substitute for string floss.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it didn&#x27;t cost much because after 3 days I tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay waterpik, expected more out of it, but still using it</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as useful oral aide.</li>
            <li> In my book, whatever motivates anyone to floss is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nifty oral cleaning product however would have liked longer brushes and they do not last over two uses.  </li>
            <li> so thought this would be worth trying.  </li>
            <li> But for the price, I consider it to be a fairly useful tool in my dental care arsenal.</li>
            <li> This is such a handy device</li>
            <li> almost makes it fun to floss</li>
            <li> and I do find it useful.  </li>
            <li> It is almost fun to use.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, its loud</li>
            <li> Replaces the regular old string for flossing in a great way.</li>
            <li> Have 3, they are so useful.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made only was able to get one weeks</li>
            <li> Seems to be working as they think it is fun to use.  </li>
            <li> This little device has resulted in some very nice comments about my teeth from the dental hygienist (who used to scold me for not flossing).  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of flossing, with so much less hassle than using ordinary dental floss--thus increasing the odds that I will faithfully floss my teeth--and keep my dentist happy.</li>
            <li> So many other flossing products are so much better and don&#x27;t cause gum problems.</li>
            <li> I like the power glosser more than I thought I would MEANING it is more convenient than string floss, less deliberate than a toothpick, and can be used quickly.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is super gentle!</li>
            <li> This is a great little flosser for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away right away to avoid an eye-sore.</li>
            <li> price was right but finding the refills is not.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good, not what I expected but it works.</li>
            <li> ok, but water pik just much better job with less effort</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people like me who are too lazy to floss</li>
            <li> Great for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li> You have to hold your finger on the Power button, otherwise it won&#x27;t operate, which is a good thing - it won&#x27;t just run down the battery.</li>
            <li> I particularly like how easily the nylon tips slip between one&#x27;s teeth, much easier than thread floss and threaders.</li>
            <li> But he doesn&#x27;t do NEARLY as good a job at cleaning your teeth as floss or those little portable floss</li>
            <li> What a new and exciting way to floss!  </li>
            <li> This product does have its uses though, it works great if you eat something like popcorn that can get under the gum-line or a hard, sticky food that has a tendency to get stuck to the teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to change battery and use, suits his requirements for keeping teeth clean and free of little bits.</li>
            <li> Works good, but kind of hard to get to back teeth.</li>
            <li> I found that regular floss works better and is even easier.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was exactly like the one on tv that squirts water</li>
            <li> I used to feel like floss could slip in too deep into some gum pockets and make them bleed or hurt more.    </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like having the top of the unit open between uses, even though the tips are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is useful, it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This product makes flossing more of a hassle than using actual floss.</li>
            <li> It will only be able to work its way into the crevice between teeth where they meet your gums.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not water flosser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and not expensive.</li>
            <li> A traditional floss will do the work better.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hit the gap exactly, you bend the tip and drastically reduce its life.  </li>
            <li> I love the flosser, and I&#x27;ve finally got my husband to floss.  </li>
            <li> now I floss more regularly since it is so much easier!</li>
            <li> This gadget will give you more incentive to attempt daily flossing.</li>
            <li> Started bleeding a lot after the first use .</li>
            <li> Not my first one.</li>
            <li> and it is not expensive to purchase</li>
            <li> I think regular flossing or a Waterpik is a better option.</li>
            <li> it is waxed for smooth action between your teeth.</li>
            <li> This was not that, BUT I was able to slide the tiny pick UNDER the food particles and it vibrated them out....</li>
            <li> I did think perhaps they were a bit more sturdy and lasted maybe a bit longer than the blue piks do.</li>
            <li> so no detection they do anything more than the blue ones do.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best little Flosser !!!!</li>
            <li> our 10-yr-old didn&#x27;t have the patience or coordination to floss on his own until we got him one of these, and now he calmly integrates it into his evening routine - he just needed some supervision &amp; guidance the first few times.  </li>
            <li> have just the smallest of queries about the design of the bristles; I reckon a little less flexibility and a bit more roughness on the bristle stem would improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> There were lots of positive reviews, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used it for a couple of weeks now and nothing but positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company</li>
            <li> Not terribly expensive, really, but it is an ongoing expense if you continue to use this flosser.</li>
            <li> It is better in the long run.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and came with batteries and extra flossers.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s going great for the past 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I was reading the information about this product is said it was good for braces and those hard to get places.</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> came with the purchase of the and really an unnaccessary item.</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t have to replace the tip with every use.</li>
            <li> My son has braces and this works really well for them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Power flosser works very well.  </li>
            <li> So, in the end, I&#x27;d have to conclude by saying this is recommended for use in addition to brushing, flossing and using a real water pick.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would make flossing easier</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one for years and wish they had been available when I was much younger</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Absolutely A+</li>
            <li> I really like this item</li>
            <li> Ours ended up in the electronic recycling pile very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It came fast and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be a straight up replacement for using floss.</li>
            <li> Really helps maintain dental health.  </li>
            <li> bought 2 and both are really junk.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do it nearly as much as dentists recommend.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient, and really does get into those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Sounds like it would not work on my teeth as they are close together</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much I would like this flosser.</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Really I did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the benefits of this unless you have braces?</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> I never before appreciated wax they coat the floss with, but now I do.</li>
            <li> and it really works wonders.</li>
            <li> this thing only lasts a month, I&#x27;ll replace it every month, that&#x27;s how important and functional it is for</li>
            <li> So trying things that look promising or helpful.</li>
            <li> A happy consumer with this item but save money and stay with the regular basic blue piks.er.</li>
            <li> A happy consumer with this item but save money and stay with the regular basic blue piks.</li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have saved my money, and invested in a real water pick.</li>
            <li> For the slackers who dont floss everyday, this thing is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> There is just no way this is as good as plain old flossing.</li>
            <li> The Swiffer Cordless Vacuum is a great little vac for quick pickup of spilled items or as a \\&quot;between regular vacuuming\\&quot; sweeper!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually use water to clean.</li>
            <li> and you have to go through multiple pics to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> This works very well,  especially in tight places and good along the gum line....also runs on batteries.  </li>
            <li> Also provided are extra nylon tips that are soft and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> At first, my gums were a bit sensitive to the vibration, but that passed in a week or so.</li>
            <li> The thin, flexible pick doesn&#x27;t get between my more crowded teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get food out better than old school flossing.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to need a battery change, but I like to take things apart when I first receive them, to make sure</li>
            <li> So I gave them a try and will finish using them but not worth more money.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works very well and may save my teeth from more dentistry, hopefully.</li>
            <li> Hope the new recipient likes it!...?</li>
            <li> The truth is that for a regular flosser, this thing can be more of an inconvenience or annoyance than actually flossing.</li>
            <li> It works ok so far, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> it would cost more to return than cost of 2 of same item, 2 of same sent in 1 order.,</li>
            <li> main problem is the pick, its too flimsy.</li>
            <li> Not a true waterpik, this is more like a floss stick.</li>
            <li> Not really much power to unit but may be good for traveling and can be used for overnight use but not very powerful.</li>
            <li> However, as a word of caution to those of you with tight tooth contact between each tooth it won&#x27;t be able to floss for you.  </li>
            <li> My contacts aren&#x27;t as tight so it works okay for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for flossing freaks.</li>
            <li> Small item, very easy to assembly the tips.</li>
            <li> Needs a little more firmness</li>
            <li> It seems to be a little more efficient about loosening food between the teeth than just flossing which I still continue to do.  </li>
            <li> Glad the price was no more than what it was, but you get what you pay and with this item I certainly did.</li>
            <li> I thought the inserts would be little brushes that would really do the job instead they are smooth and don&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much just one of those pick thingies that you can buy at the dollar store, it just has a big handle.</li>
            <li> Take off the removable piece just below the tip to provide a better grip &amp; the handle can be pulled off without too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I imagined it to be and has quite simple way of disposing used picks as well as loading a fresh one.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool little flosser for the price.</li>
            <li> and I buy a new one of these every couple of years.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T on how to insert a new pik from the pik holding case</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T on how to insert a new pik from the pik holding case</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it completely, but every other day or so is just fine.</li>
            <li> teeth are tight together which makes using dental floss more difficult, this is a good supplement for flossing.</li>
            <li> The tips ARE pretty simple to replace, which is a relief after the difficulty with the battery replacement experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shall be interested to see what mybdentist says when I next visit.</li>
            <li> :  I have been using this product for several days, now; unlike the real Water-Pik I ordered to replace it with, it&#x27;s easier for a hemiparetic (me!)</li>
            <li> He was surprised and loves it!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in having a blue wobbly thing wiggling in between your teeth ...</li>
            <li> well, this one ranks pretty low on the list.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for keeping my teeth and healthy gums.</li>
            <li> But it was so cheap and inexpensive too, that it is not worth returning.  </li>
            <li> This cordless flosser is adequate but does not have all that much power and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure it the results will be as effective as using regular floss.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company or received a different product than I did (the WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser).</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, not very noisy and extremely efficient.</li>
            <li> I have braces and hate threading floss, so I saw this and thought it was a good, easy alternative.</li>
            <li> Also, the floss tips are way too flimsy to fit into tight places between teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but the only down side I can find is it is difficult to use on my back teeth, but with a little practice and patience, I found a way  The vibration does a great job of massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> You just go right past the braces right to the gum line and space between the teeth.</li>
            <li> the little brushes won&#x27;t fit into.</li>
            <li> During the 8-9 years that i couldn&#x27;t find them on the drug store shelves i felt lost &amp; actually pained, since the vibration of the appliance absolutely helps to calm gum trauma created by dental pockets that food tends to collect in as well as shake it loose while the flossing tip nudges.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old just got braces and flossing was a challenge.  </li>
            <li> It is not for someone with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li> Much easier for me to use than regular floss.</li>
            <li> I am already a frequent flosser.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say, but I alternate between this and string.  </li>
            <li> Overall very satisfactory...</li>
            <li> It is ready instantly with no pulling and wrapping difficulties like the string.  </li>
            <li> The tips are too soft to be used as floss to go between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I read some critiques about the tip on the Amazon site, but have learned how to insert it by sliding it along the opening between my teeth instead of trying to insert it directly in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are very close together and can&#x27;t use it there or back by my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Had the old humming bird flosser, can&#x27;t seem to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> The unit is acceptable, but the picks themselves are extremely soft and often break or come out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> After reading your reviews I will not waste my money</li>
            <li> As far as battery powered contraptions go ...</li>
            <li> Tips are too soft and bend during use.</li>
            <li> There is an old joke in dentistry \\&quot;You</li>
            <li> Now for one negative observation: The whitening piks don&#x27;t seem to do anything except cost a bit more.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, and you will actually use this daily.  </li>
            <li> Good thing it is not too expensive.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product is not good for cleaning your teeth and it&#x27;s set up for you to spend more money on those little pics as you know you only get so many</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the single AA battery lasts a good long while because changing/replacing the battery is not easy.</li>
            <li> First of all, the angle is such that you cannot reach the back teeth at all without contortion.</li>
            <li> Does a poor job at cleaning and the tip bend VERY easily.</li>
            <li> works great  easy for those of us who hate to floss!!</li>
            <li> The tip is kind of weak - a larger tip is preferred.</li>
            <li> The Sweeper Vacuum recharges quickly and the charge lasts long enough for me to all the wood and tile floors in my 2600 square foot house!  </li>
            <li> Just wish they sold the picks at a low price and that you would not have to keep purchasing new floss</li>
            <li> Someone made a disappointing decision to discontinue such a great product.  </li>
            <li> Real WaterPiks are much more expensive and cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> The picks bend very easily, and the angle of the device makes it very hard to reach back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Simply pull the handle down, it pops off, the single AA battery is easy to pull out, simply snap in a new one.  </li>
            <li> The general usefulness</li>
            <li> The back teeth are nearly inaccessible to the head because of it&#x27;s angle.  </li>
            <li> After playing around with it awhile, I did get the battery out, and back together, but not without considerable effort.</li>
            <li> This interdental stimulator is not expected to take the place of flossing.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I found with this order was that the Flosser did not come with a stand, as my old one.</li>
            <li> it from the front only, near a mirror so you can aim it.  </li>
            <li> but it sure makes you want to floss and at least get the bigger gaps in the back.</li>
            <li> I did find several spots that are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> Not for me as far as flossing as it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and if anyone has ever done it, I would love to know what is the secret.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never actually seen it work very well, meaning, in the week I&#x27;ve tried it, I haven&#x27;t had it take out one single piece of food between my teeth, so</li>
            <li> This pik was a bit odd at first since no water was involved.</li>
            <li> eat a lot of popcorn, and hoped it would help with the stubborn hulls getting caught in my inside back teeth (along the inside gum line), but the tips are alittle too fragile to do that job well enough, so I&#x27;ll continue to look for an answer to that particular problem.</li>
            <li> lol I highly recommend these if your kids aren&#x27;t capable of flossing themselves yet (I get sick of doing it for them), or are like me and just lazy.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s bad about using normal floss, I think he is finally doing a good thing for his teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser comes with 15 disposable tips, which doesn&#x27;t really last that long, as these are really single-use tips only.</li>
            <li> The tip bends so frequently as you try to manipulate it in between those back teeth that you might as well reach for the regular floss and get it all over with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flossing is such a drag, but this product makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> I used my first one for YEARS before it finally started to slow down, so I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth before buying this new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it will replace regular floss completely (too early to tell), but is very efficient to have around.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into teeth gadgets, you may like this for a while, but you&#x27;ll get quickly bored of it (about as fast as the cheap internal battery lasts).</li>
            <li> I used to have braces and know how hard it was to clean them with regular floss.</li>
            <li> Not ideal, but better than not flossing (or equivalent) at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, gets down at the gum line and fits between teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is really just a little jackhammer that drives a bit of fishing line at your gums.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li> A neat very competitively priced little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to in a toilet bag when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be about the only such device on the market at present.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That being said, it will reach areas that are virtually inaccessible by any other dental instrument except by a dental professional.</li>
            <li> The flosser piks are too wimpy,the little plastic ball on the end breaks off easily &amp; after that it&#x27;s just a piece of floppy plastic that is hard to get between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The directions on the pkg back are a bit too brief (in English &amp; French), so not much help there, IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that interdental brushes with either the brush tip or the less expensive ones that have the green rubber tips to be very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and reach those difficult to reach spots and comes with plenty of replacement pick tips.  </li>
            <li> Also the cheap cardstock that the bubble pack of this machine and the piks come in tears instantly and leaves all directions torn to bits and difficult to read.</li>
            <li> Also the cheap cardstock that the bubble pack of this machine and the piks come in tears instantly and leaves all directions torn to bits and difficult to read.</li>
            <li> If you are careful with the tip, it can last several days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WRONG, it sucks and opens up gaps between your teeth, and doesnt leave you feeling clean and minty fresh like floss.</li>
            <li> It can fit between the base of your teeth, but doesn&#x27;t fit in the tight spaces further towards the tips of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I use a Reach flosser for my back crowns and I feel that I&#x27;ve improved my gums overall due to these 2 flossing tools.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth/gums, and flossing with string was difficult for me to maneuver around necessary places very well.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I water an actual water flosser.</li>
            <li> Wow what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I feel that it is not really a replacement for regular flossing.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take with me on a long trip.</li>
            <li> Hope it continues for a long time.....</li>
            <li> there is no clear place for water.</li>
            <li> However, this was useful but not a great product to resolve my flosser needs.</li>
            <li> works as expected nothing great or bad to say it does what its supposed to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little picks don&#x27;t last too long, I change it daily.</li>
            <li> ALL the other extra heads that come with It</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t work it around my back teeth however in part due to rings set around them for the braces I think.</li>
            <li> So I definitely can&#x27;t see how it would stand up if I had braces or other dental work in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This flosser pik is difficult to use on the back molars because you can&#x27;t quite angle it back there, but i use it for all my other teeth which are exposed when I smile.</li>
            <li> though I still need to use regular floss where space between teeth is extremely limited due to shifting teeth.  </li>
            <li> For me that means missing only four places, between the back two molars in each quadrant.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have braces, perhaps I&#x27;m missing out on what a major benefit might be.</li>
            <li> TOO ROUGH, HARD TO USE, BULKY, GETS DIRTY EASILY, AND CONSTANTLY HAVE TO KEEP SWITCHING FOR NEW RUBBER USERS.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and went back to conventional floss.</li>
            <li> The tips supplied with this device are so flimsy they don&#x27;t make it through a single flossing.  </li>
            <li> Gets deep down in my gums and cleans all of that excess plaque before it hardens</li>
            <li> The tips are thin enough to get between all teeth, yet sturdy enough that they last through several uses.</li>
            <li> No high pressure water .</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s also difficult to get into that far back area and my last two teeth in the back too..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a new, slight space between 2 back teeth, just enough for food particles to get forced down into.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are so close together that the floss is impossible to use in most areas.</li>
            <li> My recent purchase of replacement tips has been less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> The rubber tip is too long to point at the right spot, it just pokes at your gums in random places.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I would like</li>
            <li> I should have paid more heed to the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of stupid though.</li>
            <li> I tried it but am afraid I may hurt my gums so I am kind of afraid to use it much.</li>
            <li> There really is no non-mechanized devise that does both of those things at once.</li>
            <li> Water jets soothe &amp; help nudge stubborn food particles away, but do not really prevent gum desease between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Not what expected.</li>
            <li> thought it might just be gimmicky, but this thing actually works and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, unless you have wide even gaps between the teeth, this does not go in.</li>
            <li> For those of us who hate to floss,or if you just want a quicker way to floss effectively</li>
            <li> I ended up holding the base down on the bathroom counter top and pushing down until it finally snapped in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can find replacements locally.  </li>
            <li> For those who are looking for something other than a string floss, this may be the answer for you.</li>
            <li> Due to its name, I thought this would do the trick.</li>
            <li> My other one had a switch that turned on and off.</li>
            <li> I keep one at work, 1 at home and gave the other 10 to the fam.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Godsend to people with braces or other dental</li>
            <li> Pin used in flosser is really sharp ..</li>
            <li> Got braces due to problems with aging slippage of teeth.</li>
            <li> But descriptions should explain that and also include directions on how to use the replacement case due to falling apart might help too.</li>
            <li> But descriptions should explain that and also include directions on how to use the replacement case due to falling apart might help too.</li>
            <li> Had a very fine crack in base.</li>
            <li> I still use mine, but have to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased, not better than Soft Piks by Sunstar gum.</li>
            <li> I can barely slide the thick tips down the sides of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> When I could get an angle, the plastic tip often buckled under the pressure and went down into the gums instead of through to the other side.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this being used in those in between cases of gum problems that don&#x27;t need surgery but are very difficult to clean by a toothbrush, floss or toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> &quot; WORKS WITH WATER NOT LIKE A CONVENTIONAL FLOSS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was so excited about getting one because #1 flossing is nearly impossible with braces and #2</li>
            <li> so I can just pull it out anywhere, hard to reach the back of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty bad about remembering to floss, but I keep this next to my toothbrush now &amp; never forget.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is removing anything out of your gums.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is not useful to me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The plastic tip wiggles around in such a small diameter that I found it to be a waste of time as well as money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost and descriptions over stated.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the packaging is the kind you have to destroy to open, so I can&#x27;t return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have know better, base on price of item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t super expensive</li>
            <li> When I would floss, the particles were SHOVED down into the gums.</li>
            <li> Would buy again if it breaks down.</li>
            <li> I believe if you get that turned upside down in orientation it won&#x27;t hold onto the flosser end like it</li>
            <li> I believe if you get that turned upside down in orientation it won&#x27;t hold onto the flosser end like it</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at half the cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the tips were a little firmer.</li>
            <li> It just broke in half.</li>
            <li> No fuss, no muss &amp; takes about half the time.</li>
            <li> This is an odd device, it sort of flicks food bits out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration does help to get the pick into teeth that are closer together (with less space between them), or in between the gumline and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have less plaque buildup and ro</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that I have braces, this is not something that I would use everyday, but on the go it is a neat little tool.</li>
            <li> The power is not enough, so it is not a good choice to replace the flosser.</li>
            <li> so it gets into tight spaces and it makes you feel like you are getting a dentist-kind of flossing.  </li>
            <li> I think it would work quite well in those tight spaces.</li>
            <li> but when you are trying to floss between two tight teeth it stops</li>
            <li> Flossing is not something anyone looks forward to, but this little gadget helps out.  </li>
            <li> This little thing does the trick.</li>
            <li> I gave this little guy a chance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and this WaterPik also fits in my little cross-body purse I keep on me.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO look for that little indentation</li>
            <li> SOOOOO look for that little indentation</li>
            <li> Flosser base is fine, however the strips are too flimsy, they bend while you are trying to place them between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The thin plastic probe has little tiny serrated edges.</li>
            <li> Sort of a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble flossing</li>
            <li> My question is:  why is it not available in drugstores anymore, not even at Walmart?</li>
            <li> I found this a waste of my money with my disability limitations.</li>
            <li> I find it very sad that oral B has evidently discontinued their flosser</li>
            <li> The WaterPik Power Flosser was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the even small price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a few</li>
            <li> It appears the vibrating mechanism wasn&#x27;t firmly attached, as the motor still hummed, it just didn&#x27;t vibrate when touched to the gums or tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste money on postage to return a $6 itme</li>
            <li> waste your money on this; it may be made by WaterPik, but it isn&#x27;t one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter with braces,  waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to floss ALL your teeth everyday - just the ones you want to keep\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a waste and no taste or sign of anything released by the whitening piks and</li>
            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I toss my in waste can.</li>
            <li> does not fit in-between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too heavy for travel in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that people had a hard time replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> and i expect it would shred the little picks quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a poor excuse for a tooth pick.</li>
            <li> Having one finger on the button makes it a little difficult to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t floss everyday, you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re tempted to do it more often with this device than with that dreadful string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Requires very little effort, dexterity, suffering.</li>
            <li> As far as reaching those difficult spaces in the back, this is less than helpful because it&#x27;s impossible to manage for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It kinda really hurts my teeth badly every time I use it my gums start to bleed and gets sore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> What is wrong is simple.  </li>
            <li> It cleans out areas of my teeth that ordinary floss does not.  </li>
            <li> It looked like what I saw on TV, but, I am not able to floss with mouthwash with this one.</li>
            <li> Not a top of the line tech tool</li>
            <li> So in the mean time this little guy is saving my gums.</li>
            <li> I wish it had come in a small case as I like to take it with me when going out to eat.  </li>
            <li> Tickles a bit and is a little awkward on the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are spaced tightly together and floss gets stuck between them and tears leaving pieces behind</li>
            <li> It also has a hairtrigger that will start it without your intervention and that is hard to turn off.  </li>
            <li> Hard to floss in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t - for my braces it made my teeth to hard to use.</li>
            <li> does not work well; hard to place between teeth</li>
            <li> Hard to beat.</li>
            <li> you hate to floss with string, try this, it certainly beats no flossing at all.  </li>
            <li> Too late to return.</li>
            <li> Too late I learned that it could not be returned once it was opened.</li>
            <li> Waterpik  , the name is confusing .</li>
            <li> No more dental floss!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought that this held water like a WaterPik, a small portable one, but it doesn&#x27;t !</li>
            <li> So out came my old, still working, klunky water pick that I&#x27;ve had for well over a decade, hated the mess it caused and it was user unfriendly, but it worked great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is my fault or false advertising...</li>
            <li> hmmm, it&#x27;s a weird little device, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, I think flossing (with floss) is easier than trying to maneuver this into your mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to maneuver to get the backside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> the floss tip is very weak and shipped with few floss plastic tips</li>
            <li> I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t be bad for someone that has bigger gaps in their teeth but for me I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Especially annoying because the name Waterpic lead me to believe that it  would be worth buying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on this, its useless, I tried it once, and i tossed it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all ..</li>
            <li> This is not good.</li>
            <li> it help my daughter very well who is a very bad flosser</li>
            <li> but I have found that the motor is a bit on the weak side</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these at all.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of difficulty pulling the battery compartment OUT of its holder in the base, and snapping the unit back together.</li>
            <li> Amazon should stand behind the products they sell 100%.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m too tired to floss at night.  </li>
            <li> Keeping waterpik in the name is false advertising.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little knob/bulb at the end of the plastic flosser, which makes it impossible to get this between my teeth.</li>
            <li> hard to use.can not fit my teeth.just can use the front teeth.i hate it</li>
            <li> It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to get in between tightly spaced teeth...</li>
            <li> I found the picks to be quite painful if you accidentally slipped off location and any narrow spaced teeth</li>
            <li> But the product is a disappointment because it can even go in between the theeth because the flosser is too thick.</li>
            <li> Am disappointed because I thought it was a little water pick...</li>
            <li> No more string floss for me!!!</li>
            <li> A totally useless product which doesn&#x27;t work for anything .  </li>
            <li> I alays wanted to get a water pik, but they&#x27;re so expensive.</li>
            <li> The attachment is a struggle to replace, not impressed with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely not my best purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s 11 and has no patience for such boring activity.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> Im stuck with a useless battery powered flosser now since I cant return it.</li>
            <li> it is a weird thing that shakes</li>
            <li> anything, it&#x27;s just an expensive toothpick that vibrates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic picks are expensive (comes with 20 (I believe)), and they don&#x27;t have any fluoride on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, this has turned out to be useless.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I cannot use ---</li>
            <li> It has a very thin plastic probe that vibrates, but to no effect.</li>
            <li> The rubber tips are very thin and flexible and couldn&#x27;t even push a sesame seed out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a late 50&#x27;s periodontic patient and hate to floss.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so dirty feeling on the fingers.    </li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS DISAPPOINTING,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical!.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the end of the probe closest to the handle gets too close to the teeth and is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It  is impossible to change the battery</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t drown them out.</li>
            <li> If you are bad at flossing then this is for you.</li>
            <li> and/or teeth are too close together to manage to floss without cutting up your gums!</li>
            <li> All 3 of us got bloody gums trying to use this product.  </li>
            <li> because it works like crap.</li>
            <li> Bad Amazon policy!</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling on something stabbing your gums and the taste of blood, you might like this product ,but otherwise there is no use for this product!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> The picture is so terrible it is of no use to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> our 8-yr-old has braces, and even with those floss threader-thingies i was doing a terrible job trying to floss his teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase this product it will be the worst choice you have made.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> what a nice and effective purchase , thanks</li>
            <li> Tickles a bit and is a little awkward on the back teeth.  Still great as an add-on and enhances the value of the any tooth care purchase.</li>
            <li> this is great for getting between your teeth especially if you hate flossing like i do.  it works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay waterpik, expected more out of it, but still using it and it still works good. Just remember you will need to buy more of the flossers.</li>
            <li> came with the purchase of the and really an unnaccessary item.</li>
            <li> This product needs to make the statement that it is not a water flosser with the name waterpik. Keeping waterpik in the name is false advertising. The picture is so terrible it is of no use to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Great turnaround time from Amazon!  Article just what I wanted.  Excellent servoce  Mahalo nui loe from Hawaii!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was 😞</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old just got braces and flossing was a challenge.  Now he actually does it.  Seems to work well and you really don&#x27;t have to replace the tip with every use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best shipment and product</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not what I expected but it works. Due to the fact that I have braces, this is not something that I would use everyday, but on the go it is a neat little tool.</li>
            <li> The tips are thin enough to get between all teeth, yet sturdy enough that they last through several uses. The tips&#x27; vibration is so intense that they must be doing a good job. I didn&#x27;t expect to be this impressed.</li>
            <li> Flossing is not something anyone looks forward to, but this little gadget helps out.  It is not for someone with sensitive teeth or gums.  It works well at removing plaque and the tips seem to last for weeks (probably not the manufacturers recommendation)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything good to say about this device, except that, fortunately, it is not very expensive. I was surprised when I tried it for the first time. It has a very thin plastic probe that vibrates, but to no effect. It does not remove the plaque between the teeth and the probe is so fine and limber that it does not do anything around the gum line. Sometimes the end of the probe closest to the handle gets too close to the teeth and is very uncomfortable. I cannot see any use for this item. I tried it twice and went back to conventional floss. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Water Pik Flosser for many years.  My recent purchase of replacement tips has been less than satisfactory.  They have changed, have become flimsy and one does not last through one flossing!  I am not happy with these at all.</li>
            <li> What is wrong is simple.  The tips are so flimsy it is like trying to get tissue paper beyween your teeth. It is a TOTAL RIP OFF.  Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company or received a different product than I did (the WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser). I bought two and all the tips were the same).  It is literally unusable. It kills me to give it one star (which you are required to do) since it deserves none.</li>
            <li> my dad just love it~! But don&#x27;t use it to often, my teeth don&#x27;t feel really good after i used it for 4 days</li>
            <li> The waterpik does a great job...though I still need to use regular floss where space between teeth is extremely limited due to shifting teeth.  I would recommend it as useful oral aide.</li>
            <li> For the car!      I like this thing a lot, especially the way it can get under bridge work which I used to neglect b/c of the threaders.    Contrary to what others said, I get about a week per tip</li>
            <li> A totally useless product which doesn&#x27;t work for anything .  Especially annoying because the name Waterpic lead me to believe that it  would be worth buying.</li>
            <li> My son has braces and this works really well for them.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk . 1st time I used it. It just broke in half. Had a very fine crack in base. I had sent company an email what happened. Not even an apology.  Do not buy.  You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> My dentist always asks if I floss regularly, and of course I lie and say I do..I alays wanted to get a water pik, but they&#x27;re so expensive. When I came upon this one on Amazon I was skeptical!. But when it arrived and I used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works,,and for UNDER $15.00. It&#x27;s really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M Clarke&lt;br /&gt;Neenah, WI</li>
            <li> Not worth it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is removing anything out of your gums. The attachment is a struggle to replace, not impressed with the product at all.</li>
            <li> It works real well and is a good deal for the price. No need for a toothpick ever again.</li>
            <li> The push button should be underneath.</li>
            <li> No water.  Non functional.  Get something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this power flosser and I love it.  It cleans out areas of my teeth that ordinary floss does not.  It is very easy to use and very accomodating!  It also helps with gum stimulation. I do like that.</li>
            <li> Quit working, flimsy design</li>
            <li> Power flosser works very well.  Much easier for me to use than regular floss.</li>
            <li> I am already a frequent flosser. I saw this item advertised on TV and immediately looked it up on Amazon. There were lots of positive reviews, so I decided to give it a go. While I am not overwhelmed, I am not necessarily disappointed. The truth is that for a regular flosser, this thing can be more of an inconvenience or annoyance than actually flossing. So, while it is not bad, to me it&#x27;s about as useful as electrifying a pencil... What for??? Since I don&#x27;t have braces, perhaps I&#x27;m missing out on what a major benefit might be. As far as reaching those difficult spaces in the back, this is less than helpful because it&#x27;s impossible to manage for that purpose. The tip bends so frequently as you try to manipulate it in between those back teeth that you might as well reach for the regular floss and get it all over with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be held in higher esteem by kids who would enjoy the novelty of it! In my book, whatever motivates anyone to floss is worth the price. So, in the end, I&#x27;d have to conclude by saying this is recommended for use in addition to brushing, flossing and using a real water pick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this power flosser. It&#x27;s easy to operate and leaves my mouth feeling extremely clean. I totally would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Great Product. I did not like to floss using he traditional thread floss. After I got this product, I love to floss everytime after eating food. The product is simple to use, works great and comes in pleasing colour. All my famly members are loving this product and I am planning to get one for each of them.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting...it doesn&#x27;t work at all for its intended purpose. I thought the inserts would be little brushes that would really do the job instead they are smooth and don&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to get a special discount by meeting the minimum order. However, this was useful but not a great product to resolve my flosser needs.</li>
            <li> This flossing device is one that I find very useful. It claims to be as effective as thread flossing, and it very well may be. Also provided are extra nylon tips that are soft and easy on the gums. I particularly like how easily the nylon tips slip between one&#x27;s teeth, much easier than thread floss and threaders.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on this, its useless, I tried it once, and i tossed it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Best flossing system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The flosser piks are too wimpy,the little plastic ball on the end breaks off easily &amp; after that it&#x27;s just a piece of floppy plastic that is hard to get between your teeth.The idea is good but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.Spend your money on a good electric toohbrush.</li>
            <li> Just wish they sold the picks at a low price and that you would not have to keep purchasing new floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;But It works good it help my daughter very well who is a very bad flosser this turns her into a perfect flosser.</li>
            <li> what a relief to find this device.  our 8-yr-old has braces, and even with those floss threader-thingies i was doing a terrible job trying to floss his teeth.  i do much better with this.  our 10-yr-old didn&#x27;t have the patience or coordination to floss on his own until we got him one of these, and now he calmly integrates it into his evening routine - he just needed some supervision &amp; guidance the first few times.  i&#x27;ll always use regular floss myself, but for those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> It works.  Great value.  Makes the dentist happy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this flosser and am happy to have found it.  It does a better job than manual flossing.</li>
            <li> Nifty oral cleaning product however would have liked longer brushes and they do not last over two uses.  Not sure if I can find replacements locally.  I would recommend to others and wish I had when my hand was in a cast.</li>
            <li> I affectionately call this tool &amp;#34;Brutal Mars&amp;#34;... I love it.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would make flossing easier but honestly, it increased the amount of work involved and didn&#x27;t do a good job.  The back teeth are nearly inaccessible to the head because of it&#x27;s angle.  When I could get an angle, the plastic tip often buckled under the pressure and went down into the gums instead of through to the other side.  There is just no way this is as good as plain old flossing.</li>
            <li> Beware: THIS IS NOT A WATER FLOSSER.</li>
            <li> TOO ROUGH, HARD TO USE, BULKY, GETS DIRTY EASILY, AND CONSTANTLY HAVE TO KEEP SWITCHING FOR NEW RUBBER USERS. NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I found that regular floss works better and is even easier.</li>
            <li> I love this gadget I find myself flossing more often.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well. At first, my gums were a bit sensitive to the vibration, but that passed in a week or so. Now to see what my dental hygienist says about the results. For the price, what do you have to lose? I keep it in my desk at home. It&#x27;s great for watching TV, especially the commercials. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t drown them out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the advantage, honestly. The thin, flexible pick doesn&#x27;t get between my more crowded teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get food out better than old school flossing. Plus, I can see how it would sort of tear up your gum line after a while. The thin plastic probe has little tiny serrated edges. Sort of a waste of money, in my opinion. I would try to find a flossing head for my electric toothbrush instead</li>
            <li> this device is a joke. don&#x27;t waste your money on it. i would send it back but i was charged more for shipping than the price of the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and in good shape.  I have a lot of trouble flossing so thought this would be worth trying.  It&#x27;s been far more user friendly than sticking my hand in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was exactly like the one on tv that squirts water but, NO!!! It vibrates....</li>
            <li> I am a string floss hater- don&#x27;t want to stick fingers into the back of my mouth, and because I have a lot of dental work (fillings, and crowns) my teeth often shred most floss. and it&#x27;s so dirty feeling on the fingers.    This flosser pik is difficult to use on the back molars because you can&#x27;t quite angle it back there, but i use it for all my other teeth which are exposed when I smile. The nylon tips can bend funky until you get used to using them. But they never shred like floss. I don&#x27;t think it gets all the plaque as effectively as string might, but it&#x27;s much easier to use and will remove a lot of debris and plaque in between teeth and gums. And it probably is highly effective in massaging the gums, more gently than floss. I used to feel like floss could slip in too deep into some gum pockets and make them bleed or hurt more.    It uses one AA battery, so it&#x27;s not that powerful, but it&#x27;s portable and easy to pack. I use a Reach flosser for my back crowns and I feel that I&#x27;ve improved my gums overall due to these 2 flossing tools. Target also sells this flosser (but for $15) and also the nylon flosser replacements.</li>
            <li> Am disappointed because I thought it was a little water pick...hence the name.  I feel somewhat mislead.  So I gave it away.  Hope the new recipient likes it!...?</li>
            <li> Love this item. Cleans your teeth better than then string floss. The only thing you have to always hold the power button while cleaning your teeth. Would give 5 stars if it stayed with out having to hold the power button. Would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful device if you have a kid with braces where traditional flossing doesn&#x27;t work. I got one for me as well. In addition to flossing between teeth, it also can remove plaque at the gum line with it&#x27;s vibrating tip.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product although the vibrations cause my mouth tickles. I use this product every day. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years.  The dentist is always amazed that I don&#x27;t have any plaque.&lt;br /&gt;BUT... when the battery gets low, you might as well throw the thing in the trash.  It  is impossible to change the battery and if anyone has ever done it, I would love to know what is the secret.  You can take it apart (almost), but you can never put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;So... my remedy is to just buy about 4 of them at a time and they will last for aboiut 7 months.  Love it though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t get the power part. It doesn&#x27;t shoot water or vibrate or anything. I want to return it, but I paid more to ship it here, than to buy the actual item, so ill just keep it. It&#x27;s kind of stupid though. It&#x27;s pretty much just one of those pick thingies that you can buy at the dollar store, it just has a big handle. 😟</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m on the road and don&#x27;t have my cordless waterflosser with me.  It&#x27;s easy to use and really helps</li>
            <li> This WaterPik Flosser works ok for me. I have sensitive teeth/gums, and flossing with string was difficult for me to maneuver around necessary places very well. Tried this and liked it better than string, so I&#x27;ve been using it more, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the less-good news....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it until I actually tried it, but I would have preferred this unit have a cap, for sanitary&#x27;s sake, rather than having the unit open. I just don&#x27;t like having the top of the unit open between uses, even though the tips are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to need a battery change, but I like to take things apart when I first receive them, to make sure I know how stuff works. You have to hold your finger on the Power button, otherwise it won&#x27;t operate, which is a good thing - it won&#x27;t just run down the battery. I&#x27;m hoping the single AA battery lasts a good long while because changing/replacing the battery is not easy. The directions on the pkg back are a bit too brief (in English &amp; French), so not much help there, IMO. After playing around with it awhile, I did get the battery out, and back together, but not without considerable effort. I had a lot of difficulty pulling the battery compartment OUT of its holder in the base, and snapping the unit back together. I ended up holding the base down on the bathroom counter top and pushing down until it finally snapped in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser comes with 15 disposable tips, which doesn&#x27;t really last that long, as these are really single-use tips only. Amazon sells replacement tips - 30 for $3.62, I believe. Not terribly expensive, really, but it is an ongoing expense if you continue to use this flosser. The tips ARE pretty simple to replace, which is a relief after the difficulty with the battery replacement experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat a lot of popcorn, and hoped it would help with the stubborn hulls getting caught in my inside back teeth (along the inside gum line), but the tips are alittle too fragile to do that job well enough, so I&#x27;ll continue to look for an answer to that particular problem. But for the price, I consider it to be a fairly useful tool in my dental care arsenal. For those who are looking for something other than a string floss, this may be the answer for you.</li>
            <li> It took me a lot of surfing before I found it here on AMazon and realized that it is the same item I was looking for but under a  misleading name. This item is not a Waterpik per se but a handy battery-operated flexible tooth pick to remove food particles between teeth in hard-to-get places with or without water. Real WaterPiks are much more expensive and cumbersome to use. This item used to be in drugstores not so long ago but disappeared, and it took a great deal of persistence to find it online (of course, with the shipping costs added much more expensive but otherwise the same efficient gadget). My question is:  why is it not available in drugstores anymore, not even at Walmart? It is useful, it is reasonably priced.  Get it while it is still around (with replacement picks) and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Flosser base is fine, however the strips are too flimsy, they bend while you are trying to place them between your teeth. Needs a little more firmness</li>
            <li> The power is not enough, so it is not a good choice to replace the flosser. It is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why so many people are complaining about replacing the battery....it is easy!  Simply pull the handle down, it pops off, the single AA battery is easy to pull out, simply snap in a new one.  It is easier to me than replacing a flashlight battery.  This is a great product, but the only down side I can find is it is difficult to use on my back teeth, but with a little practice and patience, I found a way  The vibration does a great job of massaging the gums. Does this do a better job than string floss?  I can&#x27;t really say, but I alternate between this and string.  I have a dentist appointment soon and will get a report on how good a job the power flosser has done.&lt;br /&gt;If you hate to floss with string, try this, it certainly beats no flossing at all.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy product to own. When you are at home or if you are away, this product will come in handy. I recommend it ...</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I would like</li>
            <li> This Item may be good for stimulating the gums, but It&#x27;s main purpose as a floss replacer. Ludacrous.  It too big to ever get under the gum line to do any good where It counts the most. ALL the other extra heads that come with It In the picture, are all the same size replacements. All one size. I&#x27;d catoragize It as a gadget. I guess nothing can replace floss Itself. Not yet.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Recommend to everyone.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t like it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was gonna be</li>
            <li> Will be using it in the future</li>
            <li> This interdental stimulator is not expected to take the place of flossing. It does something slightly different and helpful. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is such a handy device</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best little Flosser !!!! I love it !!! I ordered one for my Granddaughter also. Now she flosses more !!!</li>
            <li> Before brushing and after flossing, I dip the tip in toothpaste and scrub between teeth.  It does a good job and makes your between teeth gums feel refreshed.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> almost makes it fun to floss</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i thought it was a water pik but you can not put water in it</li>
            <li> It really works!! The tips are pretty fine so it gets into tight spaces and it makes you feel like you are getting a dentist-kind of flossing.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more heed to the bad reviews. Definitely not my best purchase from Amazon. This product makes flossing more of a hassle than using actual floss. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t cost much because after 3 days I tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I water an actual water flosser. I don&#x27;t think this has a good description</li>
            <li> Thrown away after a week.</li>
            <li> This was a throw in when I bought my Waterpik.  It&#x27;s OK, but if you have a waterpik, you shouldn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Great gifts for those who have everything. I&#x27;ve used one for years and wish they had been available when I was much younger</li>
            <li> I was looking for a device that cleaned between teeth by spraying water. Due to its name, I thought this would do the trick. Instead it has a vibrating tip. This is not useful to me whatsoever. Great price though.</li>
            <li> Love this! would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Not what I  thought it was</li>
            <li> I love this thing, wish I would have bought one sooner. It takes any hassle out of flossing. No fuss, no muss &amp; takes about half the time. I&#x27;m usually pretty bad about remembering to floss, but I keep this next to my toothbrush now &amp; never forget. It&#x27;s about as easy &amp; painless as it gets &amp; I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s even more effective than regular floss since it vibrates &amp; stimulates your gums more. Absolutely A+</li>
            <li> I ended up having to find a replacement product for my Oral b Hummingbird flosser.  Someone made a disappointing decision to discontinue such a great product.  Anyway, this product is good and I do find it useful.  However, as a word of caution to those of you with tight tooth contact between each tooth it won&#x27;t be able to floss for you.  It will only be able to work its way into the crevice between teeth where they meet your gums.  My contacts aren&#x27;t as tight so it works okay for me.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months. Too late to return.</li>
            <li> I really like this item, it works great for braces!! I would suggest this for anyone who has just gotten braces and is having a difficult time flossing :)</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS DISAPPOINTING, I HADTHE IMPRESSION THAT \\&quot;WATER PICK POWER FLOSSER\\&quot; WORKS WITH WATER NOT LIKE A CONVENTIONAL FLOSS.&lt;br /&gt;THE FLOSSER IS QUITE FLIMSY.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is my fault or false advertising... but it doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to do. I assumed because the name is WaterPik Power Flosser that it was actually going to be one of those picks that spray water. It works ok so far, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This a great flosser- have used them for years</li>
            <li> These are great for kids! I didn&#x27;t wanna spend an obscene amount of money like I did on mine (I have a rechargeable, much more expensive Waterpik) so I opted for these. They come in cool kid colors too, which helps since it encourages usage for some reason lol I highly recommend these if your kids aren&#x27;t capable of flossing themselves yet (I get sick of doing it for them), or are like me and just lazy. These rock! This particular model is also great for travel since it&#x27;s battery-powered and smaller in comparison to versions like the one I use.</li>
            <li> there is no clear place for water. Top section won&#x27;t detach and cant add water to battery compartment. But cheap non water flosser.</li>
            <li> Bought one for each member of the family, including my daughter with braces.  All 3 of us got bloody gums trying to use this product.  I still use mine, but have to be very careful.  So many other flossing products are so much better and don&#x27;t cause gum problems.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product. It is quite different then using regular floss. I have had the item for a week and have used it each day. Not sure it the results will be as effective as using regular floss. We&#x27;ll see what my dentist says at my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works very well and may save my teeth from more dentistry, hopefully. Teeth are so close together that the floss is impossible to use in most areas.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfactory...I will order more. This is better than anything else in respect to saving money for any dental treatment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11-year-old daughter who wears braces. She was so excited about getting one because #1 flossing is nearly impossible with braces and #2 she&#x27;s 11 and has no patience for such boring activity. I was psyched- I thought I&#x27;d found the holy grail of flossing while wearing braces. And being a tween.&lt;br /&gt;My illusions were quickly shattered when we discovered that the picks don&#x27;t fit well between the teeth. The gadget just seems to buzz alot. There was no evidence (so to speak) of food removal when she used it. It didn&#x27;t seem to remove anything, actually. Would not recommend. Ours ended up in the electronic recycling pile very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. Threw away.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is not water flosser. it&#x27;s a PLASTIC flosser.</li>
            <li> easy to use and operate. i will buy another one for my daughter. recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is an odd device, it sort of flicks food bits out from between your teeth. It&#x27;s great for people like me who are too lazy to floss and/or teeth are too close together to manage to floss without cutting up your gums!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before purchasing the product and they sounded great. But the product is a disappointment because it can even go in between the theeth because the flosser is too thick.</li>
            <li> I found this a waste of my money with my disability limitations. I felt it just doesn&#x27;t adequately meet all needs like the Oral B Hummingbird flosser could. I found the picks to be quite painful if you accidentally slipped off location and any narrow spaced teeth just are not gonna be flossed with this approach of pick only. I find it very sad that oral B has evidently discontinued their flosser It has worked so wonderful for me for years.</li>
            <li> This works very well,  especially in tight places and good along the gum line....also runs on batteries.  The tips  are well priced especially on Amazon</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little knob/bulb at the end of the plastic flosser, which makes it impossible to get this between my teeth. At least it wasn&#x27;t super expensive but it&#x27;s completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this. She&#x27;s used it for a couple of weeks now and nothing but positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this power flosser for years and love it. It&#x27;s the best way for me to get between my very tight teeth&lt;br /&gt;that the little brushes won&#x27;t fit into.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a floss string</li>
            <li> The WaterPik Power Flosser was a waste of money for me. As soon as I tried it I realized that I would be throwing it away. The plastic tip wiggles around in such a small diameter that I found it to be a waste of time as well as money. I&#x27;ve found that interdental brushes with either the brush tip or the less expensive ones that have the green rubber tips to be very effective. Check out Inter-Dental Brushes before buying this.</li>
            <li> Got this bc I have bridges and caps iAnd I love it! Highly recommend it! I didn&#x27;t even know it was coming in with my water pik great deal</li>
            <li> this is my son&#x27;s go-to flosser for his braces.</li>
            <li> I came to rely on these flossers years ago &amp; then lost sight of them when they suddenly seemed to be withdrawn from the market. I felt lost. During the 8-9 years that i couldn&#x27;t find them on the drug store shelves i felt lost &amp; actually pained, since the vibration of the appliance absolutely helps to calm gum trauma created by dental pockets that food tends to collect in as well as shake it loose while the flossing tip nudges. There really is no non-mechanized devise that does both of those things at once. Water jets soothe &amp; help nudge stubborn food particles away, but do not really prevent gum desease between the teeth. Finally, i ran across the waterpik mechanized flosser 110 online where it has always been, &amp; i will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised. Good value and reliable functionality. I would recommend for purchase to anyone looking for such a product.</li>
            <li> I cant deal with those annoying floss strings and this power floss works great for me.  It&#x27;s easy to use and reach those difficult to reach spots and comes with plenty of replacement pick tips.  I use one about one tip and month before they start to get bent out of shape and I buy a new one of these every couple of years.  It is ready instantly with no pulling and wrapping difficulties like the string.  Well worth the price, and you will actually use this daily.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well. It just vibrates.</li>
            <li> Not pleased, not better than Soft Piks by Sunstar gum. Will probably never use it  even when traveling or at home.</li>
            <li> It came fast and undamaged. It was a gift for my husband I don&#x27;t know if he has tried it yet. Since it was in with the water pick merchandise I thought I was a water holding device but it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s ok. it&#x27;s still interesting. Thank you.</li>
            <li> No more dental floss!  This little device has resulted in some very nice comments about my teeth from the dental hygienist (who used to scold me for not flossing).  It is almost fun to use. I love to go to the dentist now, saying &amp;#34;goodbye&amp;#34; forever to costly fillings or  periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> Not well made and it doesn&#x27;t work well. Make sure you can return it free to try it</li>
            <li> For those of us who hate to floss,or if you just want a quicker way to floss effectively this is wonderful. I bought one for my sister, my father, and my husband. You will love them, I do!</li>
            <li> is as advertised and serves the purpose.  good value</li>
            <li> This is so convenient and easy to use. When I am traveling and do not have my waterpik flosser I take this in replacement.</li>
            <li> Works great with my son&#x27;s braces.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be a straight up replacement for using floss. It is not, nor does it seem to be intended as such. It can fit between the base of your teeth, but doesn&#x27;t fit in the tight spaces further towards the tips of your teeth. This seems intended more to help reach hard-to-get spots in conjunction with normal floss use. I read in other reviews that people had a hard time replacing the battery. This didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for me. Take off the removable piece just below the tip to provide a better grip &amp; the handle can be pulled off without too much trouble.</li>
            <li> I wish the tips wouldn&#x27;t bend so quickly, but besides that I like this product.</li>
            <li> i thought it was water pic but it was just a vibrator</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, but for the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> The tips supplied with this device are so flimsy they don&#x27;t make it through a single flossing.  Maybe it has something to do with the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; label. Like another reviewer said \\&quot;It does not rate even one star\\&quot;. Too late I learned that it could not be returned once it was opened. How else can you judge a product without opening it and using it. Bad Amazon policy! Amazon should stand behind the products they sell 100%. WDM.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I found with this order was that the Flosser did not come with a stand, as my old one.</li>
            <li> I just could not see how full the bottom of the Water Pik was</li>
            <li> It looked like what I saw on TV, but, I am not able to floss with mouthwash with this one.</li>
            <li> No more string floss for me!!! Fantastic price and product!!! I love how it feels like I just got out of the dentist chair!!! It would be great if I had this when I had braces!  It gets in  everywhere and has enough power to shake your hand!!! Strongly suggested!!!</li>
            <li> hmmm, it&#x27;s a weird little device, I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, I think flossing (with floss) is easier than trying to maneuver this into your mouth</li>
            <li> The plastic tab that holds the floss tip broke off within a month of use.</li>
            <li> It kinda really hurts my teeth badly every time I use it my gums start to bleed and gets sore.</li>
            <li> I have braces and hate threading floss, so I saw this and thought it was a good, easy alternative. WRONG, it sucks and opens up gaps between your teeth, and doesnt leave you feeling clean and minty fresh like floss. Save your six dollars and buy yourself some fancy floss.</li>
            <li> works as expected nothing great or bad to say it does what its supposed to do! i like it and use it</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the even small price. The pics are too flimsy and unless you have gaps in your teeth this will not work</li>
            <li> Got this per my daughter&#x27;s orthodontist. Works perfectly, easily, nice to use, very fast. Fits in the spaces above the braces line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty and not expensive. But honestly, it&#x27;s not quite useful. A traditional floss will do the work better.</li>
            <li> was a free gift with order. liked it</li>
            <li> I am not a dedicated flosser so I LOVE this thing!  Just FYI, there is no water involved but the motion and the pick does a super job.  I feel like I am a much better steward of my teeth now!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be. Glad the price was no more than what it was, but you get what you pay and with this item I certainly did.</li>
            <li> The tips are too soft to be used as floss to go between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I had a flosser for years. It finally broke. I looked everywhere in stores for one. Nothing. Did a search and found this! I was thrilled. Works well. Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is holding the button on for power. My other one had a switch that turned on and off. Having one finger on the button makes it a little difficult to get the back teeth. I&#x27;ll probably buy a few so I don&#x27;t run out. My dentist was pleased with my teeth. I don&#x27;t like flossing but use this daily!</li>
            <li> Purchased two for a friend so the Flosser would be in easy reach. Easy to change battery and use, suits his requirements for keeping teeth clean and free of little bits.</li>
            <li> This does the job.  2 of my daughters have permanent retainers and this was recommended by the orthodontist to get them flossing on the bottom.  Only 4 stars because the dentist still says nothing beats actually flossing with floss.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my periodontist.  I read some critiques about the tip on the Amazon site, but have learned how to insert it by sliding it along the opening between my teeth instead of trying to insert it directly in between my teeth.  That works and does not bend the tip as to make it unusable.  It seems to be a little more efficient about loosening food between the teeth than just flossing which I still continue to do.  I have some teeth that are very close together and can&#x27;t use it there or back by my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all and it doesn&#x27;t actually use water</li>
            <li> I loved it.  Perfect for someone wearing braces.</li>
            <li> Love this flosser.  Started using it when I had braces and have used it ever since.  Great for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li> Now I know why this product was only $6....because it works like crap.If you purchase this product it will be the worst choice you have made.It says \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot; but the only water you will be using it the water to wash the blood out of your mouth because of it puncturing your gums.I tried it once and will never use it again nor will I buy another WaterPik product because of this.If you like the feeling on something stabbing your gums and the taste of blood, you might like this product ,but otherwise there is no use for this product!!</li>
            <li> I use it morning and before going to bed I shall be interested to see what mybdentist says when I next visit.</li>
            <li> it doesnt spit water at all its not a water pik</li>
            <li> this is such a wimpy product.  Might as well use manual floss.  I ended up throwing it away right away to avoid an eye-sore.</li>
            <li> No need to worry about which size or type of floss to use.  Never gets stuck between teeth. Really helps maintain dental health.  Good to travel with, and easy to use.  I&#x27;m not sure that it will replace regular floss completely (too early to tell), but is very efficient to have around.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item. The flosser tips must be meant for people huge gaps in their teeth, because they dont come near to being able to floss my teeth or have ANY effect on my gums at all. Im stuck with a useless battery powered flosser now since I cant return it. I plan to contact the company.</li>
            <li> At Christmas time I bought 12 of these for the family.  I&#x27;m a late 50&#x27;s periodontic patient and hate to floss.  I keep one at work, 1 at home and gave the other 10 to the fam.  I LOVE THIS THING!!!!  I just bought 4 more after riding with a friend who pulled out string dental floss from his pocket and tried to floss lunch out of his teeth while driving!   For $7, it could be saving a life!  BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> The first flosser was great, but when I ordered another one, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  It stopped vibrating as soon as I put it against the tooth.  It appears the vibrating mechanism wasn&#x27;t firmly attached, as the motor still hummed, it just didn&#x27;t vibrate when touched to the gums or tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent a note to seller, and they suggested I return the item.  I&#x27;m not going to waste money on postage to return a $6 itme</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, not very noisy and extremely efficient. Small item, very easy to assembly the tips. I highly recommend for flossing freaks.</li>
            <li> Was great, just what I hoped for</li>
            <li> Was dentist suggestion. Is great for trips</li>
            <li> and only if, you use it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it from the front only, near a mirror so you can aim it.  If you don&#x27;t hit the gap exactly, you bend the tip and drastically reduce its life.  If you are careful with the tip, it can last several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to get any gaps you can&#x27;t see, unless you want to use up a tip or more per day.  For me that means missing only four places, between the back two molars in each quadrant.  Not ideal, but better than not flossing (or equivalent) at all.</li>
            <li> Handy and quick when you can&#x27;t use regular floss, but it is not a substitute for string floss. It&#x27;s a little difficult to maneuver to get the backside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Waterpik  , the name is confusing . This is just motor floss. No high pressure water . But works fine except the floss tip is very weak and shipped with few floss plastic tips</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY7A WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser, Battery Powered (Colors May Vary)]]&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this; it may be made by WaterPik, but it isn&#x27;t one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fooled by my hygienist&#x27;s telling me that portable WaterPiks were handy and affordable.  This is really just a little jackhammer that drives a bit of fishing line at your gums.  It also has a hairtrigger that will start it without your intervention and that is hard to turn off.  Worst of all, the packaging is the kind you have to destroy to open, so I can&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It woke me up this morning, buzzing like a bumblebee, and it took me five minutes to get it to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORRECTION:  I have been using this product for several days, now; unlike the real Water-Pik I ordered to replace it with, it&#x27;s easier for a hemiparetic (me!) to use and doesn&#x27;t inundate me and the bathroom when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of cleaning between my teeth at the gum level, and it can also be used long the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;ON\\&quot; switch has lost its trigger-happiness, too!</li>
            <li> I love it perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Have been using this power flosser for many years.  Easier than string flossing when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m too tired to floss at night.  It is easy to use with braces but it is not as good as a real floss.</li>
            <li> CHEAP PLASTIC NOT ENOUGH POWER</li>
            <li> This flosser does a good job but I have found that the motor is a bit on the weak side and I have to replace the AA battery about every couple of weeks. I wish Waterpik would improve the holder the tips come in too. They tend to pop out when inserting the flosser into the tips. But my dentist tells me my teeth look great and I attribute part of it to the use of this product.</li>
            <li> Wow what a waste of money. It was going to be a gift but I like the person more then to give them this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he did not like it at all. Said it wouldn&#x27;t fit between some of his teeth. So, it is back to regular floss while the decision is made on trying a water pix.</li>
            <li> What a new and exciting way to floss!  I may never go back to regular floss again!  Love this item!  I bought two!</li>
            <li> I carry this in the car and can floss whenever I need to .  compact and easy to use.  received in good condition</li>
            <li> Functional and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great for the teeth/ This Pik has been around for along time</li>
            <li> easy to use, recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I love the flosser, and I&#x27;ve finally got my husband to floss.  He&#x27;s bad about using normal floss, I think he is finally doing a good thing for his teeth.</li>
            <li> Gets the job. Cant say anymore about it. Its a flosser. The price was great also!</li>
            <li> If you are bad at flossing then this is for you. This doesn&#x27;t replace dental floss but it sure makes you want to floss and at least get the bigger gaps in the back. I love this thing</li>
            <li> It worked ok, its loud so I can just pull it out anywhere, hard to reach the back of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Does a poor job at cleaning and the tip bend VERY easily. Not worth the money at half the cost.</li>
            <li> it is nice that it has wirking baterys</li>
            <li> The head keeps popping off every time I turn on the flosser.  Not worth the money.  The cheap price reflects the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> My son actually flosses now</li>
            <li> I rely on my full size Waterpik and am happy to have this one for travel and visiting out of town.</li>
            <li> it serves its intended purpose well and when used properly. Makes flossing bearable</li>
            <li> As someone who has to floss after every meal - it comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand why the price is so low - because you make up the difference with purchase of the picks.</li>
            <li> It is a TOTAL RIP OFF. Any one who wrote a positive review either is being paid by the company</li>
            <li> Had the old humming bird flosser, can&#x27;t seem to find a replacement. So I ordered this. Very happy, bigger, not pocket sized. But the tips work exceptionally well. Better than the humming bird tips, but not a pocket sized, take with you item.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a water pick as the name suggests - it&#x27;s a flosser</li>
            <li> Flossing is such a drag, but this product makes it much easier.</li>
            <li> Not what expected. Np waterpik at all. Bought it for my daughter with braces,  waste of money.</li>
            <li> hard to use.can not fit my teeth.just can use the front teeth.i hate it so much.so many good reviews,i really can not understand.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Hummingbird&amp;#34;, which is no longer available.  The unit is acceptable, but the picks themselves are extremely soft and often break or come out of the unit.  A more rigid pick would have been preferred.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost and descriptions over stated.</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money; save up and get a better one!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool little flosser for the price. It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. I have had it for about a year now and the battery is still working. My only complaint is that I wish the tips were a little firmer. They work great for front teeth, but once I get to my back molars it is too flimsy to squeeze between. For that reason, I feel that it is not really a replacement for regular flossing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with braces. I think it would work quite well in those tight spaces.</li>
            <li> This electronic flosser is lightweight and easy to use.  It does a great job of flossing, with so much less hassle than using ordinary dental floss--thus increasing the odds that I will faithfully floss my teeth--and keep my dentist happy.</li>
            <li> I use as many things in an effort to keep my teeth and keep them clean.  I rotate the products.  I also have the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Awesome! now I floss more regularly since it is so much easier!</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk....bought 2 and both are really junk.  Buy the regular floss.  It is better in the long run.</li>
            <li> I am not a flosser...I don&#x27;t do it nearly as much as dentists recommend. This gadget will give you more incentive to attempt daily flossing. Even if you don&#x27;t floss everyday, you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re tempted to do it more often with this device than with that dreadful string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Infrequent flossers may floss more. It&#x27;s easier to maneuver than string floss. It&#x27;s a Godsend to people with braces or other dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to get in between tightly spaced teeth...I can barely slide the thick tips down the sides of my front teeth. It is costly to keep replacing the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does not reach the many plaque prone areas between teeth that normal floss does, something is better than nothing. String flossers, stick with your string...flossing slackers, give this device a try.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  The tip is kind of weak - a larger tip is preferred.</li>
            <li> This item is okay. I actually ordered this by mistake thinking it was a waterpik as I did not read that it was a flosser until it arrived. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for hubby because of its ease of use.  He was surprised and loves it!  Replaces the regular old string for flossing in a great way.</li>
            <li> I have braces and this works perfectly to remove lodged food between teeth and brackets. Plus it is super gentle!</li>
            <li> This is the best tool for braces!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe these are not available in the orthodontist offices!&lt;br /&gt;The price was right but finding the refills is not.  They are a little pricey with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a GREAT product &amp; good for people who are not flossing-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all ..Started bleeding a lot after the first use . Pin used in flosser is really sharp .. Not advised to use to anyone.</li>
            <li> ok, but water pik just much better job with less effort</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected. Like that it comes with 12 extra tips. Haven&#x27;t used yet, it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Cannot open battery site</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffers this year, as I&#x27;ve used one for years and gave great results with such ease of use.</li>
            <li> not actually a waterpik, just a piece of plastic vibrating on your teeth. do not buy</li>
            <li> I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t be bad for someone that has bigger gaps in their teeth but for me I didn&#x27;t like it. I find the little floss picks work the best for me</li>
            <li> This is a great product for an easy alternative to flossing when you don&#x27;t have time for the real thing. I used my first one for YEARS before it finally started to slow down, so I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth before buying this new one.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I like the power glosser more than I thought I would MEANING it is more convenient than string floss, less deliberate than a toothpick, and can be used quickly.  It is not a substitute for flossing but it is a handy tool, in my experience, to resort to between brushings or when brushing isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might just be gimmicky, but this thing actually works and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort and get&#x27;s in and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are tight together which makes using dental floss more difficult, this is a good supplement for flossing.</li>
            <li> I did not feel it works as a flosser. it is a weird thing that shakes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok item. It will get your family excited about flossing. Serves as a good reminder to floss. Not a top of the line tech tool but it works. My fam feels manual flossing is more effective. Whatever gets them going!</li>
            <li> Not my first one. I have one and bought one for my son who has braces. If you child has braces get one.</li>
            <li> This little thing does the trick. ... I have advanced gum disease and I haven&#x27;t been able to get my treatment done yet. So in the mean time this little guy is saving my gums. I do not use it daily, however several times a week works for me. My mouth feels cleaner and my teeth look a lil whiter (cofee drinker) inbetween.</li>
            <li> Of the many devices I have purchased for the care of my teeth, this is my favorite.  I wish it had come in a small case as I like to take it with me when going out to eat.  It is very convenient, and really does get into those hard-to-reach places. I love it.</li>
            <li> Not really much power to unit but may be good for traveling and can be used for overnight use but not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Works great but just don&#x27;t like how the tips bend sometimes. It&#x27;s does its job.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! I was very pleased with my purchase and how effective this was. It was easy to use and came with batteries and extra flossers.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> works OK but when you are trying to floss between two tight teeth it stops&lt;br /&gt;apparently the battery works when there is no struggle on it&lt;br /&gt;and stops working when it struggles&lt;br /&gt;It will work fine for traveling</li>
            <li> I find it easy to use and I enjoy using my flosser I will reccommend it and it is not expensive to purchase thank you</li>
            <li> stocking stuffer...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> After reading your reviews I will not waste my money Thanks again Sounds like it would not work on my teeth as they are close together</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much I would like this flosser. It is awesome and so easy to use! I would recommend anyone getting one.</li>
            <li> This flosser is very easy &amp; quick to use if you follow the instructions. It&#x27;s really good if you have bridges avoiding the use of those special hand flossers.</li>
            <li> Have 3, they are so useful.</li>
            <li> worked great, received in great shape.  Given as a gift.  They loved it. and wanted one for each member of the family</li>
            <li> Best way to floss without damaging your gum lines. Your mouth feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> As a dentist I think this is misnamed, as it does NOT floss in the traditional sense.  That being said, it will reach areas that are virtually inaccessible by any other dental instrument except by a dental professional. I recommend this being used in those in between cases of gum problems that don&#x27;t need surgery but are very difficult to clean by a toothbrush, floss or toothpicks.  Another fine use is in molar areas where gum recession has caused exposure of the root surfaces between the roots. This tool is definitely a great addition to almost anyone&#x27;s dental care, as long as the more normal cleaning tools are still used. 5 Stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I tried it but am afraid I may hurt my gums so I am kind of afraid to use it much.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made only was able to get one weeks Use ideal for trips or short term use  would not purchase again</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in having a blue wobbly thing wiggling in between your teeth ... this is the product for you. For anyone else - don&#x27;t bother. I bought this because it is my mission in life to find products that are better than floss - that is how much I really, really DON&#x27;T love floss. I gave this little guy a chance. I wanted to like him. Really I did. But he doesn&#x27;t do NEARLY as good a job at cleaning your teeth as floss or those little portable floss holding do-dads. And, as an aside, despite the fact that it&#x27;s made by WATER-Pik it doesn&#x27;t use water - go figure. As far as battery powered contraptions go ... well, this one ranks pretty low on the list.</li>
            <li> This item is an easy to pack and go for flossing on the run.  It&#x27;s great for travelling and works well and fits my needs.  So much better than toothpicks when on the go.l.</li>
            <li> The vibration is way too strong; it can cause the gums to bleed. Also, the floss tips are way too flimsy to fit into tight places between teeth. This product does have its uses though, it works great if you eat something like popcorn that can get under the gum-line or a hard, sticky food that has a tendency to get stuck to the teeth. It does remove those types of foods quite easily.</li>
            <li> Tips are too soft and bend during use. Hard to floss in hard to reach areas. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the benefits of this unless you have braces? I think regular flossing or a Waterpik is a better option.</li>
            <li> Great product! It is easy to use and very helpful for flossing with braces.</li>
            <li> This pik was a bit odd at first since no water was involved. It does an excellent cleaning and is perfect for travel or just having in your purse.  With braces, you can clean the &amp;#34;in-betweens&amp;#34; that others miss. Wish it came with a case. I have a WaterPIk and use both.</li>
            <li> The title of this product is misleading.  It is a vibrating rubber pick.  It does not use water as one would assume by the name WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Ok, the name got me confused!&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was a water flosser, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it&#x27;s a flosser, that uses plastic pins, that go between your teeth, and it vibrates the pins. Kind of like a super cheap alternative to a deep cleaning tool from the dentist, only this one is to remove food remnants, and basic plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never actually seen it work very well, meaning, in the week I&#x27;ve tried it, I haven&#x27;t had it take out one single piece of food between my teeth, so I can&#x27;t comment if it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, it&#x27;s just an expensive toothpick that vibrates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration does help to get the pick into teeth that are closer together (with less space between them), or in between the gumline and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic picks are expensive (comes with 20 (I believe)), and they don&#x27;t have any fluoride on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally would not recommend anyone to buy it, as I just see it as a wasted invention that won&#x27;t really work well. If you&#x27;re into teeth gadgets, you may like this for a while, but you&#x27;ll get quickly bored of it (about as fast as the cheap internal battery lasts).</li>
            <li> Since Oral-B killed the excellent Hummingbird flosser (why??) I have been on the lookout for an alternative. This looked good on paper, so I decided to give it a try. For me, this has turned out to be useless. First of all, the angle is such that you cannot reach the back teeth at all without contortion. Also, unless you have wide even gaps between the teeth, this does not go in. So, I can floss about 50% of my teeth with this thing. There is an old joke in dentistry \\&quot;You don&#x27;t have to floss ALL your teeth everyday - just the ones you want to keep\\&quot;. So, this is a great flosser for people that don&#x27;t want to keep all their teeth (unless you happen to have nice even large gaps between all your teeth). I wish I could return it, but since I have used it in my mouth, I doubt they will take it back. Good thing it is not too expensive.</li>
            <li> The picks bend very easily, and the angle of the device makes it very hard to reach back teeth.  Too bad, it&#x27;s a good idea.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE IMPLANTS AND THIS PICK IS PERFECT FOR THAT. MINE FINALLY BROKE, SO I WENT ON THE WATERPICK SITE, BUT I COULDN&#x27;T FIND THEM. I DID FIND THEM IN AMAZON, SO I GOT TWO OF THEM JUST IN CASE.  THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> These WaterPiks are fine but can&#x27;t judge whether they are absolutely effective in removing bits of food. Can be used after brushing and flossing including using mini brushes. Any bits of food still remaining can be dislodged by this device. They were purchased to use primarily around my tooth implant, as the doctor cautioned not to use any metal instruments to scrape the metal part of the implant, as happens when the dentist does their teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this device and am NOT associated with the company. It has saved my gums and roots because of the ease of use. I floss every day, sometimes twice, I have had years of dental care an do appreciate a device that helps me have less plaque buildup and ro</li>
            <li> I bought this to take with me on a long trip. What a dissapointment! The only thing it did was hurt my gums. I ended up buying a regular floss -  it is waxed for smooth action between your teeth. I never before appreciated wax they coat the floss with, but now I do. With this Waterpick FLA 220, you get rubber pushing between your gums with no lubrication. The rubber tip is too long to point at the right spot, it just pokes at your gums in random places. I don&#x27;t think it delivers good flossing, but it sure makes your gums sore.</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy and comfortable to us.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have water  too and it doesn&#x27;t - for my braces it made my teeth to hard to use.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t floss without it.  A really good flosser for going travelling and at home.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Gets deep down in my gums and cleans all of that excess plaque before it hardens</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what this is. I don&#x27;t know why I thought that this held water like a WaterPik, a small portable one, but it doesn&#x27;t !&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so that idea went out the window. I tried it anyway and it really works wonders. Here&#x27;s the reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a new, slight space between 2 back teeth, just enough for food particles to get forced down into.  When I would floss, the particles were SHOVED down into the gums. This is not good. So out came my old, still working, klunky water pick that I&#x27;ve had for well over a decade, hated the mess it caused and it was user unfriendly, but it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I went searching for a smaller portable WaterPik. This was not that, BUT I was able to slide the tiny pick UNDER the food particles and it vibrated them out....every time! A swish of water, or whatever, (I keep it on me at work, I&#x27;m a grazer for my 12hr shifts) and the space is food free! works great for my bridge too.&lt;br /&gt;If this thing only lasts a month, I&#x27;ll replace it every month, that&#x27;s how important and functional it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little picks don&#x27;t last too long, I change it daily. A small price to pay for keeping my teeth and healthy gums. This may not work for everyone, those with braces might find it challenging and i expect it would shred the little picks quicker than usual. I also bought the Panasonic portable water pick and I&#x27;m going to buy another. It works great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this WaterPik also fits in my little cross-body purse I keep on me. It&#x27;s always with me and no water needed!</li>
            <li> Not a true waterpik, this is more like a floss stick. Doesn&#x27;t actually use water to clean.</li>
            <li> A neat very competitively priced little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to in a toilet bag when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be about the only such device on the market at present.&lt;br /&gt;I have just the smallest of queries about the design of the bristles; I reckon a little less flexibility and a bit more roughness on the bristle stem would improve performance.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> Would buy again if it breaks down. So far it&#x27;s going great for the past 4 weeks. Got braces due to problems with aging slippage of teeth. Had great straight teeth still am told my jaw alignment and teeth are good but it&#x27;s an age related thing. So find myself in braces. Now I&#x27;m a dental flosser and worried about how to maintain my great gums and teeth hygiene for the duration of braces. So trying things that look promising or helpful. This works wonders and helps a lot. Won&#x27;t do anything for the upper tooth area between them but along the gums between the teeth it&#x27;s fantastic. You just go right past the braces right to the gum line and space between the teeth. And it cleans. I did find several spots that are sensitive to it. So just go there more gentle or skip it during the more sensitive periods..due to the brace work not this item. I can&#x27;t work it around my back teeth however in part due to rings set around them for the braces I think. It&#x27;ll catch on the rings. But it&#x27;s also difficult to get into that far back area and my last two teeth in the back too..but holding my cheek out with one hand I can get there...just wish it fit better. Again I don&#x27;t think the item can be blamed for that. I would by it again if it breaks like I said and replace it. Now for one negative observation: The whitening piks don&#x27;t seem to do anything except cost a bit more. They fit this flosser just fine and interchange either replacement piks in either flosser itself. So I gave them a try and will finish using them but not worth more money. I did think perhaps they were a bit more sturdy and lasted maybe a bit longer than the blue piks do. Otherwise a waste and no taste or sign of anything released by the whitening piks and so no detection they do anything more than the blue ones do. So as to those who have issues with the piks coming out or staying in your teeth and pulling off the flosser....there is a tiny indentation on the top of the pik itself that aligns it with the top of the flosser. I believe if you get that turned upside down in orientation it won&#x27;t hold onto the flosser end like it should and so give that a try. If you don&#x27;t follow the directions to a T on how to insert a new pik from the pik holding case this could be what&#x27;s going on. Also the cheap cardstock that the bubble pack of this machine and the piks come in tears instantly and leaves all directions torn to bits and difficult to read. SOOOOO look for that little indentation..use magnification or readers if need be to see it and put the indentation to the top end of the flosser. I bet it makes up all the difference. Why the sellers of these things can&#x27;t figure it out is beyond me. But descriptions should explain that and also include directions on how to use the replacement case due to falling apart might help too. A happy consumer with this item but save money and stay with the regular basic blue piks.er.

            <li> Pretty much what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, gets down at the gum line and fits between teeth.  It was recommended by my son&#x27;s orthodontist.</li>
            <li> does not work well; hard to place between teeth</li>
            <li> This works pretty good, I thought when i bought it I will have a place to pour water into it so i can use it with the water. Cause its called a water pick lol. omg. Cant put water into it but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have lots of food traps, and the Power Flosser didn&#x27;t keep them clean. Stick with the water pressure WaterPik which works great.</li>
            <li> I just got braces and this works great makes flossing my teeth around braces a lot faster&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling all my friends about this...</li>
            <li> Bought these to get my kids to floss more often and more thoroughly.  And for such a great price I figured it was worth a try.  Seems to be working as they think it is fun to use.  Hope it continues for a long time.....</li>
            <li> works great  easy for those of us who hate to floss!!</li>
            <li> When I see the name WaterPik I automatically expect a device that uses water to clean your teeth.  Buyer Beware!  This product does not use water. It&#x27;s a poor excuse for a tooth pick. And can&#x27;t possibly be considered an alternative flossing tool. It&#x27;s just a battery powered tickler.  The rubber tips are very thin and flexible and couldn&#x27;t even push a sesame seed out from between my teeth. The WaterPik brand has been severely tarnished.  But it was so cheap and inexpensive too, that it is not worth returning.  Anyway it is a good compact tickler.</li>
            <li> When I was reading the information about this product is said it was good for braces and those hard to get places. I used to have braces and know how hard it was to clean them with regular floss. When I do use this product the pic&#x27;s bend up before I can get on my second tooth. So I definitely can&#x27;t see how it would stand up if I had braces or other dental work in my mouth. In my opinion this product is not good for cleaning your teeth and it&#x27;s set up for you to spend more money on those little pics as you know you only get so many and you have to go through multiple pics to clean your teeth. Would not buy these product again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are spaced tightly together and floss gets stuck between them and tears leaving pieces behind so I thought this would be a good way to fix the problem.  Reality was this would not get between my teeth at all.  Even on the teeth it did fit between it didn&#x27;t do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and the grandkids truly enjoy it and I am in hopes it will help them with there teeth.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get into quite all the places that floss does, but super easy to use between teeth so much faster than dealing with messing, smelly floss.</li>
            <li> Works good, but kind of hard to get to back teeth. For the price its a good deal for making flossing easier!</li>
            <li> Not for me as far as flossing as it doesn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34;. This is an electric toothpick at best.</li>
            <li> The machine itself would probably be okay, if not for the flossing tips, which are just too flimsy to be of any use.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Cheap made.  I&#x27;d rather use a toothpick!  :-)</li>
            <li> The general usefulness</li>
            <li> Works awesome for some fast flossing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the product! It&#x27;s just what I imagined it to be and has quite simple way of disposing used picks as well as loading a fresh one.</li>
            <li> Advertizment mis leading.&lt;br /&gt;not a battery water pick. not cordless water pick. I toss my in waste can. it would cost more to return than cost of 2 of same item, 2 of same sent in 1 order., package.&lt;br /&gt;My mistake I should have know better, base on price of item.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> It took a lttle getting used to. but got better.&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is the pick, its too flimsy. Trying to insert between my teeth, it bent, and ruined the pick.&lt;br /&gt;Not giving up, I cut about a quarter of an inch off and now it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the company and told them about the flimsy pick They replied they would pass the information on to their R&amp;D  department.&lt;br /&gt;If they improve it it will be a better unit, if not, look for another brand</li>
            <li> The Swiffer Cordless Vacuum is a great little vac for quick pickup of spilled items or as a \\&quot;between regular vacuuming\\&quot; sweeper!  I use it on my tile and hardwood floors to pick up those things that the regular Swiffer might miss.  The Sweeper Vacuum recharges quickly and the charge lasts long enough for me to all the wood and tile floors in my 2600 square foot house!  Love it and all the Swiffer products!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t take the place of regular flossing, but for those who aren&#x27;t great flossers or for those with braces, it might be an incentive for better oral hygiene, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well! No complaints!</li>
            <li> For the slackers who dont floss everyday, this thing is a nice alternative. Flossing is still better, but this thing does a decent job when youre not in the mood to floss.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but unfortunately I cannot use --- does not fit in-between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t do justice. Wish I would have saved my money, and invested in a real water pick. Don&#x27;t buy save your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great little flosser for a very reasonable price.  I gave it as a gift to someone who wanted this itme.  (They once bought one at Wal*Mart 6-7 years ago, and they finally wore it out.)  It id simple to use and low cost.  Hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist, and this is an easy, effective alternative to actual flossing. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it completely, but every other day or so is just fine. Nice for the car. Requires very little effort, dexterity, suffering.</li>
            <li> This cordless flosser is adequate but does not have all that much power and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough for me. It&#x27;s also too heavy for travel in my opinion. But I still use it anyway.</li>
