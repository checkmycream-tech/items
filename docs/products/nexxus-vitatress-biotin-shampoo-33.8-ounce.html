            <li>Much Better!  </li>
            <li>The Nexxus Biotin Shampoo arrived more quickly than promised and it works great!</li>
            <li>I bought another Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Shampoo, and in the large container as it is the best price.</li>
            <li>This is great for thinner hair- have used nothing but this for 25 years, and am a huge fan.</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance and my hair always is very healthy, full, and bouncy after using.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo but</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a really nice shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a really nice shampoo.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;+Perfect size (33.8 oz) with nice pump dispenser</li>
            <li>this shampoo lathers nicely, and leaves my hair bouncy &amp; shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>kind of feel</li>
            <li>Until then, I am happy with it.- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to more effective with heavier application.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I started using this and after about three to four weeks I have about a centimeter in length of very fine spiky hairs poking through here and there.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been very fine.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended the Nexxus because I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ITEM-  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo hoping it would make my hair look thicker and more</li>
            <li>I have found better results from the Loreal products that strengthen hair and Nioxin Diamax.</li>
            <li>Now, after three months, my hair is growing better than before.  </li>
            <li>It is stronger and healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>As always, I love the Vitatress hair products.</li>
            <li>They have benefitted my hair in many ways.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better buy.</li>
            <li>Makes his hair feel a lot better, and thicker too.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li>He has been using for over a decade and still has significantly more hair</li>
            <li>(Note that the only thing I have done is to use the shampoo and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Now, lemme just sniff it one more time. . .</li>
            <li>ahhhhhhh :-)</li>
            <li>(Note that the only thing I have done is to use the shampoo and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Now, lemme just sniff it one more time. . .</li>
            <li>ahhhhhhh :-)</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo twice once in a while too for better results.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just now running out and need to order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those men who had used nioxin for many years, quite satisfied with the results until the dreaded formula change, when it became ineffective for me.</li>
            <li>You are missed by many.</li>
            <li>I will stick with this shampoo for sure.</li>
            <li>Have been using for over a week - it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>so I can tell when a product works if it makes it look thicker and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I just hope the results get better</li>
            <li>and I will be sure to keep you posted.  </li>
            <li>but I cant say for sure if its the result of this product or the hair supplement product.</li>
            <li>sure that I would buy this product again</li>
            <li>and I saw results of hair growth and mail growth over a period of many months.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve had this on/off love affair with this Biotin shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>Love is like that.</li>
            <li>When Nexxus was bought out by another company they moved most of their line out of the salon and into the stores.  </li>
            <li>(at the time, the price and size seemed a better deal).</li>
            <li>I feel like drugstore shampoo cleans better than this 2)</li>
            <li>It comes with a pump top.</li>
            <li>hesitate to purchase, you will be extremely pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this product will just keep getting better.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo it really cleans your scalp</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very clean and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it made their hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every shampoo for thinning hair and hands down the Nexxus Biotin shampoo I feel is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Still not quite as effective as nioxin USED to be, but more so than just the one pump and the normal washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for a month and don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m undecided if it is worth the price, but I will use this until I hear of something better.</li>
            <li>It has a light fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for about 10 years with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>but it does make his hair soft and smell good.</li>
            <li>IF THE CONTENT IS ORIGINAL FROM THE MANUFACTURER</li>
            <li>RIP original nioxin.</li>
            <li>I am really excited about the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly and gently but most important to me is the increased health and thicker appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>BTW, it is indeed most effective when left to lather on the scalp for two or three minutes, as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>When use as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for THREE MINUTES before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair literally squeaky clean but not dry/brittle clean-if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I came back to it recently, after dalliances with varied shampoo/conditioner combinations, and found that it&#x27;s among the best shampoos for me - fine hair - that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me about several of her clientele who had been using it with good results.  </li>
            <li>It has such a clean, fresh, pleasant, soothing smell.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has made my hair look twice as full.</li>
            <li>I cried every time I did cause my tub would be full of hair....</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my hair dresser because I was losing so much hair and had a bold spot showing on top of my skull.  </li>
            <li>Is great shampoo, smells light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>i have used this for over 20 years,  i stopped using this for about a year  BIG mistake, i am back on this product and very happy</li>
            <li>I have such a healthy scalp now that my hair is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>A bottle of Suave is only about $2.00, and it gets my hair just as clean, and smells sooooo much better!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment.</li>
            <li>They provided assistance and shipped their product at no cost to me when the first company I ordered the shampoo from did not have the product available and cancelled my order without notifying me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it so easy to obtain them.  </li>
            <li>55 years old still with a full head of shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement - giving it some more time!</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I chose Lemon because my hair is platinum to golden blond in color.usion of minerals.  </li>
            <li>I chose Lemon because my hair is platinum to golden blond in color.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>They never disappointment me.</li>
            <li>but, I am worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth it.  </li>
            <li>While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best for my hair so far - for some background, I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with scalp issues or fine hair.</li>
            <li>This met my expectations and soared right into what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>(I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)  </li>
            <li>(I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the goal right?  </li>
            <li>Appears to thicken your hair right after use</li>
            <li>and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker and, of course, clean.</li>
            <li>had any major scalp issues since I started using this :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past year and got great results.  </li>
            <li>Two full pumps into my palm and then lathering it up really well, then doubling the time I let sit lathered on my head during my shower.</li>
            <li>This Nexus product is fantastic and I&#x27;ve been seeing new growth since replacing Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and discuss share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels better after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>results after the first application.</li>
            <li>FUNNY</li>
            <li>Although my hair still looks great, it is not as thick as it was when I was 20, or 30, or 40, or 50.  </li>
            <li>I will check back in a couple months and let you know more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 3/28/10--I have used this shampoo several times now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I will check back in a couple months and let you know more.  </li>
            <li>have used this shampoo several times now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it&lt;br</li>
            <li>God bless ;-)</li>
            <li>Love this product and keep re-ordering because I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to get the larger one this time.</li>
            <li>So I started lathering first with my prescription and then with the Nexxus.  </li>
            <li>I think i would have gotten the same or better results if just took the biotin tablets.</li>
            <li>Nearly 1/2 price from original distributor.</li>
            <li>Whenever your hair is squeaky clean, that means it&#x27;s been stripped of the natural oils that it needs.</li>
            <li>The pump handle makes dispensing very convenient and consistent in amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I paid a lot of money for the large bottle, but I threw it away, because I just can&#x27;t keep ruining my hair with this shampoo just to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li>For the large size of this shampoo (33.8 oz.)</li>
            <li>By infusing certain stuff into the scalp and pores it provides a beneficial environment for optimal hair growth.  </li>
            <li>bottle says #1 for fine, fragile, thinning hair--eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair, adds thickness and body.</li>
            <li>Based on my first use of this product, my hair appeared much fuller than with other shampoos I have used and had more body  </li>
            <li>It also did not help my hair to fill out at all, which was the whole reason for trying it to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes in my hair though.  </li>
            <li>BUT HOW CAN YOU REVIEW A PRODUCT BASED ON THE PACKAGING AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR THIS SHAMPOO</li>
            <li>It has really helped.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have not noticed much improvement on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it looks much</li>
            <li>&quot; and also available at my local retail stores, but since its not available&lt;br /&gt;at retail stores, I can always rey on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I dont think I would use another shampoo since my hair looks much fuller.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticably thicker and didn&#x27;t fall out as much.  </li>
            <li>as much</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>Others, not so much.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for those who have thin hair or seem to be getting thinner.  </li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper buying through Amazon than through the Salons.</li>
            <li>If I stop my hair gets really oily.</li>
            <li>It is still only available in salons.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for about a month and really like what it is doing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Plus its supposed to remove dht which is something I really need.</li>
            <li>It causes thin hair to swell which gives you a fully head of hair which is great whether you are thinning or not.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too early to tell if my lost hair is growing back, but it feels like it&#x27;s getting stronger, and I love the way my hair feels now.</li>
            <li>It is not noticeable by others at this point, but I&#x27;m starting to be able to see my scalp clearly through my hair.</li>
            <li>biotin is listed pretty far down on the list of ingredients, so how effective is it really?  </li>
            <li>(Since my hair is blond, it is important to me that a product does not mess up my natural color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and not flat.</li>
            <li>The only way that I can see that this product makes your hair appear thicker is that because it is so dry, it doesn&#x27;t lay as smooth as healthy hair, but I will take healthy hair that isn&#x27;t as full over the straw-like fried mess that this shampoo left my hair.</li>
            <li>Due to A LOT of surgeries as well as the MANY beds my mother has to take her hair has been thinning &amp; falling out for years.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for a new product ever since, and based on the positive reviews I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans my hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to  use this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>, how ever my hair are thin, I do not wash my hair every day with this shampoo or any kind of shampoo, so with this being said I love this shampoo, because my hair are not oily next day and it does thickens my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that while washing my hair, it wasn&#x27;t getting tangled and even though I did use a conditioner after the shampoo it would have been fine if I didn&#x27;t use one because it left the hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li>The 33.8 fl oz bottle is HUGE and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower, without having to open and close tops or turn bottles upside down.  </li>
            <li>There was no apparent coating of any kind left by the shampoo, and my hair was as soft as cornsilk.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure that I am loosing less and it appears fuller.</li>
            <li>A bottle this size is likely to last for many months</li>
            <li>so, while the price is high, it&#x27;s not THAT high when spread over 4 to 6</li>
            <li>high recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and this product was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Many people say that shampoo builds up on your hair and you should change frequently to clean the build up, but I never experienced that with this product.</li>
            <li>I normally shampoo my hair 3 times a week and always use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair even more dried out than it already was, makes my hair fall out</li>
            <li>I bought this through Amazon as I got it at the right price, and the big bottle is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I can live without the tingling, it was probably a psychosomatic gimmick any way.  </li>
            <li>and it helped her with hair loss and new hair growth...</li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo for just a month and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>Well.... I started reading reviews, blogs, and various websites, and discovered a MUCH cheaper alternative!....</li>
            <li>Hair is so healthy and no more loss of hair</li>
            <li>I regret buying such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny and clean, not weighed down .</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo it completely went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I only gave 3 stars, it&#x27;s because it dries my hair out way too much even though I use biotin scalp crème.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for months now  so far my hair is not falling or breaking  </li>
            <li>I have order those twice, getting ready to order for a third time.</li>
            <li>I have just been using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, but I feel like it&#x27;s working so far.</li>
            <li>My hair loss has increased during my use of this product, though I know that it&#x27;s probably not due directly to use of this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any one trying to hand on to the last bit of hair they have.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this shampoo, especially with the price tag. 1</li>
            <li>highly recommend this shampoo and I re-purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used this product long enought to say if it works for me or not.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin blond hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying it won&#x27;t even prevent future hair loss whereas the nioxin product encouraged new growth in my thinning areas in addition to it&#x27;s conditioning and thickening properties.</li>
            <li>The hair loss is still present, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it is falling out at a much slower rate</li>
            <li>My hair in general has gotten thicker again as well.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly long hair and treat it gently, shampooing only once and massaging with my finger tips not nails.</li>
            <li>No better than cheap generic shampoos.</li>
            <li>It really squeaks if you rub your hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this product in the near future.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that is true</li>
            <li>Not so thin on top.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been rapidly thinning over the past year, I believe due to stress, but the hair I have is basically feels soft and healthy, considering the fact that I regularly have it highlighted.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s due to your hair and scalp drying out so much.</li>
            <li>I decided to do the big chop and go natural earlier this year</li>
            <li>Its worthless, its not any better then some cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair was becoming alarmingly thin.</li>
            <li>While in a men salon that mainly caters to middle aged males, I was shown this product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine,  thin hair and this shampoo when used as directed gives my hair body and thickness.  </li>
            <li>I came to find out that all it did was make what little hair I do have grow really fast.  </li>

            <li> Love all nexxus products!</li>
            <li> Much Better!  </li>
            <li> The Nexxus Biotin Shampoo arrived more quickly than promised and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought another Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Shampoo, and in the large container as it is the best price.</li>
            <li> This is great for thinner hair- have used nothing but this for 25 years, and am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and my hair always is very healthy, full, and bouncy after using.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo but</li>
            <li> Regardless, it is a really nice shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless, it is a really nice shampoo.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;+Perfect size (33.8 oz) with nice pump dispenser</li>
            <li> this shampoo lathers nicely, and leaves my hair bouncy &amp; shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> kind of feel</li>
            <li> Until then, I am happy with it.- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to more effective with heavier application.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I started using this and after about three to four weeks I have about a centimeter in length of very fine spiky hairs poking through here and there.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been very fine.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended the Nexxus because I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM-  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo hoping it would make my hair look thicker and more</li>
            <li> I have found better results from the Loreal products that strengthen hair and Nioxin Diamax.</li>
            <li> Now, after three months, my hair is growing better than before.  </li>
            <li> It is stronger and healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> As always, I love the Vitatress hair products.</li>
            <li> They have benefitted my hair in many ways.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better buy.</li>
            <li> Makes his hair feel a lot better, and thicker too.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> He has been using for over a decade and still has significantly more hair</li>
            <li> (Note that the only thing I have done is to use the shampoo and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Now, lemme just sniff it one more time. . .</li>
            <li> ahhhhhhh :-)</li>
            <li> (Note that the only thing I have done is to use the shampoo and have had wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Now, lemme just sniff it one more time. . .</li>
            <li> ahhhhhhh :-)</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo twice once in a while too for better results.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just now running out and need to order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those men who had used nioxin for many years, quite satisfied with the results until the dreaded formula change, when it became ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> You are missed by many.</li>
            <li> I will stick with this shampoo for sure.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a week - it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> so I can tell when a product works if it makes it look thicker and feel better.  </li>
            <li> I just hope the results get better</li>
            <li> and I will be sure to keep you posted.  </li>
            <li> but I cant say for sure if its the result of this product or the hair supplement product.</li>
            <li> sure that I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> and I saw results of hair growth and mail growth over a period of many months.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this on/off love affair with this Biotin shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> Love is like that.</li>
            <li> When Nexxus was bought out by another company they moved most of their line out of the salon and into the stores.  </li>
            <li> (at the time, the price and size seemed a better deal).</li>
            <li> I feel like drugstore shampoo cleans better than this 2)</li>
            <li> It comes with a pump top.</li>
            <li> hesitate to purchase, you will be extremely pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product will just keep getting better.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo it really cleans your scalp</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very clean and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it made their hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shampoo for thinning hair and hands down the Nexxus Biotin shampoo I feel is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Still not quite as effective as nioxin USED to be, but more so than just the one pump and the normal washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for a month and don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undecided if it is worth the price, but I will use this until I hear of something better.</li>
            <li> It has a light fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 10 years with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> but it does make his hair soft and smell good.</li>
            <li> IF THE CONTENT IS ORIGINAL FROM THE MANUFACTURER</li>
            <li> RIP original nioxin.</li>
            <li> I am really excited about the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly and gently but most important to me is the increased health and thicker appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> BTW, it is indeed most effective when left to lather on the scalp for two or three minutes, as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> When use as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for THREE MINUTES before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair literally squeaky clean but not dry/brittle clean-if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I came back to it recently, after dalliances with varied shampoo/conditioner combinations, and found that it&#x27;s among the best shampoos for me - fine hair - that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about several of her clientele who had been using it with good results.  </li>
            <li> It has such a clean, fresh, pleasant, soothing smell.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has made my hair look twice as full.</li>
            <li> I cried every time I did cause my tub would be full of hair....</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair dresser because I was losing so much hair and had a bold spot showing on top of my skull.  </li>
            <li> Is great shampoo, smells light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> i have used this for over 20 years,  i stopped using this for about a year  BIG mistake, i am back on this product and very happy</li>
            <li> I have such a healthy scalp now that my hair is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> A bottle of Suave is only about $2.00, and it gets my hair just as clean, and smells sooooo much better!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment.</li>
            <li> They provided assistance and shipped their product at no cost to me when the first company I ordered the shampoo from did not have the product available and cancelled my order without notifying me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it so easy to obtain them.  </li>
            <li> 55 years old still with a full head of shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement - giving it some more time!</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is worth buying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I chose Lemon because my hair is platinum to golden blond in color.usion of minerals.  </li>
            <li> I chose Lemon because my hair is platinum to golden blond in color.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> They never disappointment me.</li>
            <li> but, I am worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth it.  </li>
            <li> While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best for my hair so far - for some background, I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with scalp issues or fine hair.</li>
            <li> This met my expectations and soared right into what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> (I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)  </li>
            <li> (I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the goal right?  </li>
            <li> Appears to thicken your hair right after use</li>
            <li> and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker and, of course, clean.</li>
            <li> had any major scalp issues since I started using this :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and got great results.  </li>
            <li> Two full pumps into my palm and then lathering it up really well, then doubling the time I let sit lathered on my head during my shower.</li>
            <li> This Nexus product is fantastic and I&#x27;ve been seeing new growth since replacing Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and discuss share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels better after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> results after the first application.</li>
            <li> FUNNY</li>
            <li> Although my hair still looks great, it is not as thick as it was when I was 20, or 30, or 40, or 50.  </li>
            <li> I will check back in a couple months and let you know more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 3/28/10--I have used this shampoo several times now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I will check back in a couple months and let you know more.  </li>
            <li> have used this shampoo several times now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it&lt;br</li>
            <li> God bless ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this product and keep re-ordering because I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to get the larger one this time.</li>
            <li> So I started lathering first with my prescription and then with the Nexxus.  </li>
            <li> I think i would have gotten the same or better results if just took the biotin tablets.</li>
            <li> Nearly 1/2 price from original distributor.</li>
            <li> Whenever your hair is squeaky clean, that means it&#x27;s been stripped of the natural oils that it needs.</li>
            <li> The pump handle makes dispensing very convenient and consistent in amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I paid a lot of money for the large bottle, but I threw it away, because I just can&#x27;t keep ruining my hair with this shampoo just to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> For the large size of this shampoo (33.8 oz.)</li>
            <li> By infusing certain stuff into the scalp and pores it provides a beneficial environment for optimal hair growth.  </li>
            <li> bottle says #1 for fine, fragile, thinning hair--eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair, adds thickness and body.</li>
            <li> Based on my first use of this product, my hair appeared much fuller than with other shampoos I have used and had more body  </li>
            <li> It also did not help my hair to fill out at all, which was the whole reason for trying it to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes in my hair though.  </li>
            <li> BUT HOW CAN YOU REVIEW A PRODUCT BASED ON THE PACKAGING AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR THIS SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> It has really helped.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much improvement on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it looks much</li>
            <li> &quot; and also available at my local retail stores, but since its not available&lt;br /&gt;at retail stores, I can always rey on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I dont think I would use another shampoo since my hair looks much fuller.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticably thicker and didn&#x27;t fall out as much.  </li>
            <li> as much</li>
            <li> Sometimes it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Others, not so much.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for those who have thin hair or seem to be getting thinner.  </li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper buying through Amazon than through the Salons.</li>
            <li> If I stop my hair gets really oily.</li>
            <li> It is still only available in salons.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and really like what it is doing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus its supposed to remove dht which is something I really need.</li>
            <li> It causes thin hair to swell which gives you a fully head of hair which is great whether you are thinning or not.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too early to tell if my lost hair is growing back, but it feels like it&#x27;s getting stronger, and I love the way my hair feels now.</li>
            <li> It is not noticeable by others at this point, but I&#x27;m starting to be able to see my scalp clearly through my hair.</li>
            <li> biotin is listed pretty far down on the list of ingredients, so how effective is it really?  </li>
            <li> (Since my hair is blond, it is important to me that a product does not mess up my natural color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and not flat.</li>
            <li> The only way that I can see that this product makes your hair appear thicker is that because it is so dry, it doesn&#x27;t lay as smooth as healthy hair, but I will take healthy hair that isn&#x27;t as full over the straw-like fried mess that this shampoo left my hair.</li>
            <li> Due to A LOT of surgeries as well as the MANY beds my mother has to take her hair has been thinning &amp; falling out for years.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a new product ever since, and based on the positive reviews I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans my hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to  use this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> , how ever my hair are thin, I do not wash my hair every day with this shampoo or any kind of shampoo, so with this being said I love this shampoo, because my hair are not oily next day and it does thickens my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that while washing my hair, it wasn&#x27;t getting tangled and even though I did use a conditioner after the shampoo it would have been fine if I didn&#x27;t use one because it left the hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> The 33.8 fl oz bottle is HUGE and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower, without having to open and close tops or turn bottles upside down.  </li>
            <li> There was no apparent coating of any kind left by the shampoo, and my hair was as soft as cornsilk.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure that I am loosing less and it appears fuller.</li>
            <li> A bottle this size is likely to last for many months</li>
            <li> so, while the price is high, it&#x27;s not THAT high when spread over 4 to 6</li>
            <li> high recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and this product was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Many people say that shampoo builds up on your hair and you should change frequently to clean the build up, but I never experienced that with this product.</li>
            <li> I normally shampoo my hair 3 times a week and always use conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair even more dried out than it already was, makes my hair fall out</li>
            <li> I bought this through Amazon as I got it at the right price, and the big bottle is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I can live without the tingling, it was probably a psychosomatic gimmick any way.  </li>
            <li> and it helped her with hair loss and new hair growth...</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for just a month and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> Well.... I started reading reviews, blogs, and various websites, and discovered a MUCH cheaper alternative!....</li>
            <li> Hair is so healthy and no more loss of hair</li>
            <li> I regret buying such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out shiny and clean, not weighed down .</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo it completely went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I only gave 3 stars, it&#x27;s because it dries my hair out way too much even though I use biotin scalp crème.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for months now  so far my hair is not falling or breaking  </li>
            <li> I have order those twice, getting ready to order for a third time.</li>
            <li> I have just been using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, but I feel like it&#x27;s working so far.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has increased during my use of this product, though I know that it&#x27;s probably not due directly to use of this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for any one trying to hand on to the last bit of hair they have.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this shampoo, especially with the price tag. 1</li>
            <li> highly recommend this shampoo and I re-purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this product long enought to say if it works for me or not.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin blond hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying it won&#x27;t even prevent future hair loss whereas the nioxin product encouraged new growth in my thinning areas in addition to it&#x27;s conditioning and thickening properties.</li>
            <li> The hair loss is still present, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it is falling out at a much slower rate</li>
            <li> My hair in general has gotten thicker again as well.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair and treat it gently, shampooing only once and massaging with my finger tips not nails.</li>
            <li> No better than cheap generic shampoos.</li>
            <li> It really squeaks if you rub your hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is true</li>
            <li> Not so thin on top.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been rapidly thinning over the past year, I believe due to stress, but the hair I have is basically feels soft and healthy, considering the fact that I regularly have it highlighted.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s due to your hair and scalp drying out so much.</li>
            <li> I decided to do the big chop and go natural earlier this year</li>
            <li> Its worthless, its not any better then some cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair was becoming alarmingly thin.</li>
            <li> While in a men salon that mainly caters to middle aged males, I was shown this product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine,  thin hair and this shampoo when used as directed gives my hair body and thickness.  </li>
            <li> I came to find out that all it did was make what little hair I do have grow really fast.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s in the process of thinning and maybe my forehead advanced by half an inch in the past 10 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to open at first</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine and straight, however, with age it became very fragile too and would break, fall out and became thin and dull.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be sure, but it does seem like this has stopped (or at least vastly slowed)</li>
            <li> the bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I will use this shampoo for a long time and order it from the same place.</li>
            <li> What I think it does is make the hair stand up from my scalp rather than lay flat</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a miracle shampoo, but I&#x27;ll take a few new hairs.</li>
            <li> guess I don&#x27;t use it consistently either since I hate that it tangles up my hair easily, but meh</li>
            <li> I stuck with it for so long thinking</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> am in my 60&#x27;s with grey hair</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo also felt lighter than other shampoos, but you didn&#x27;t need any extra.  </li>
            <li> for some reason this make my scalp really dry.</li>
            <li> I have always had fine and thin hair, and that&#x27;s just not cute on a woman.  </li>
            <li> and I don’t look so bold, still thin but not bold.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try it because I have been so fearful of trying anything that could have a negative impact on my hair especially since it is so fragile.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft, not sticky or hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I will be getting back to my my previous brand (Nexxus Therape).</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and instantly it gave me volume and within 30 days I noticed less breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my hair in the last few days.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no feeling of discomfort while using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> After combing my hair, there are only a few strands instead of a handful of hair falling out into the brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to stop minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair appears thicker, but its really not helping with hair growth.</li>
            <li> After seeing my doctor, I&#x27;m alleged on one of the ingredients, so I have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am going to look forward to see what happens in the next few months.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive at first glance, but one of these bottles lots a real long time at two squirts per shower.</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day</li>
            <li> shampoo my family uses now-throw out your other shampoos people    and buy this product</li>
            <li> The other claim, that this shampoo slows or reverses hair loss</li>
            <li> Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract</li>
            <li> - Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.    </li>
            <li> Among other ingredients, it also contains panax ginseng root extract, biotin, ginko biloba extract, soybean germ extract, licorice extract, jojoba seed oil.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but it could be in combination with other things I was doing.</li>
            <li> It did stop my dandruff issue that was due to excess oil buildup-haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day and use the creme morning and night.</li>
            <li> Seems like with other things in life, you just gotta give it a chance once in awhile and be patient.</li>
            <li> otherwise my hair feels coarse and is hard to brush.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it hasn&#x27;t done much towards that.</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint.</li>
            <li> The formula is clear, nearly as thin as water and has no fragrance either.</li>
            <li> palmetto complex and use Minoxidil foam daily.  </li>
            <li> After only one month of use, I noticed a slow hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is long and thick, the conditioner makes it easier to comb when wet.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is long and thick, the conditioner makes it easier to comb when wet.  </li>
            <li> This product does not leave your hair feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> The down sides....</li>
            <li> The Biotin Shampoo gave my hair softness, shine and body without weighing it down, and it stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li> does not wear my hair down, and cleans it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My hair did get thicker and the falling slowed down</li>
            <li> so I was down to just the Nexxus.  </li>
            <li> I still use it to this day and my hair loss has come down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> So, in that respect, the shampoo costs a lot less.  </li>
            <li> Though it IS expensive I will be trying the lipogaine big 3 product next.    </li>
            <li> Since using it, my hair has thickened and I have stopped losing it at the rate I previously was losing it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm any of this, but when a hair growth promoting product suddenly causes hair loss, that&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;d like to keep the hair I have as long as I can, so after some research I chose to try this shampoo as a way to provide some extra nutrients to my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> MY LITTLE WARNING BELL IS TELLING ME NOT TO USE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitatress for over 15 years and can say I&#x27;ve lost little, if any hair during that time.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels healthier, am the hair feels a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I have curly, sometimes frizzy, medium short, thin, thinning, dulling, hair.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally I often had trouble with my scalp being itchy.  </li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I can say that after a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels healthier and my scalp does as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Free of harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Shampoo was old and alcohol had evaporated making it difficult to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like i wasted 25 dollars on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for a month and has done nothing to make my hair thicker or fuller or longer.</li>
            <li> lately, I&#x27;ve been losing my hair due to thyroid problems, so I looked into products that might help me to prevent losing my hair and get them stronger in addition to the thyroid medication.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so dry and unhealthy even after repeated conditioning with Nexxus intensive conditioners.</li>
            <li> This product also seems to be free of the nasty chemicals that are included in some of the other shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was helping or not, I was taking Biotin along with Vitatress Biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus shampoo may help hair growth if your hair is thinning, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I AM NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff works or not.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I&#x27;ve used this product, my hair falls out much more than before. :(</li>
            <li> its not overly expensive, this is definitely a step up from the bargain shampoo that can be picked up at the drugstore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched a lot into the matter and found that very few claims regarding hairloss out there are backed up by proven scientific facts.  </li>
            <li> I started out using VitaTress shampoo in the late 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> maybe it was a slow process.  </li>
            <li> (In truth, my hair is thick, but not as thick as before.)  </li>
            <li> my hair is really thick again</li>
            <li> gets really thick.</li>
            <li> After Nexxus went public, it became very difficult to obtain these products in the stores.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and leaves you hair a mess.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered the Biotin creme so that I get double the efforts of the Biotin &amp; will try to take the Biotin pills even though I am so bad with reminding myself when it comes to taking my vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I was taking Topamax for Migraines and my very thick hair was falling out in GOBS</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo for my hair which is thin</li>
            <li> If your hair has always been thin, this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; you&#x27;ve been waiting for.  </li>
            <li> I thought the dispenser was broken, just keep pumping it, do it like a thousand times and eventually shampoo comes out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin</li>
            <li> Losing hair is something that can be so frustrating and bothersome</li>
            <li> My daughter had hair breakage due to a bad reaction from relaxing her hair.</li>
            <li> THE THING IN THE BOTTLE SMELLED WEIRD</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they changed the products formulas’ and added fragrance</li>
            <li> and I was afraid to brush or wash it-</li>
            <li> This product works in this respect but has an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> It has Biotin in it which is a very expensive ingredient.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo + Equate - Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women with Minoxidil 2% and now hair loss is not as bad</li>
            <li> I think the bad spells had something to do with the time of year - humidity levels, etc.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for over 3 months, and frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> Very Bad Shampoo,I advice all ...</li>
            <li> Before Nexxus, I was prescribed a selenium product but found it too nasty, and ineffective.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt; Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I began using this shampoo about 8 months ago. My hair was becoming alarmingly thin. My hairdresser told me about several of her clientele who had been using it with good results.  I am very pleased with the results. It cleans thoroughly and gently but most important to me is the increased health and thicker appearance of my hair. I will continue to  use this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as promised. The price was fantastic.  Nearly 1/2 price from original distributor.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle.  It&#x27;s hard to open at first but it&#x27;s a good value for the amount you get.  I shampoo every other day and it seems like my hair feels thicker. This product does not leave your hair feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM-  will buy again - only shampoo my family uses now-throw out your other shampoos people    and buy this product</li>
            <li> My hair has been rapidly thinning over the past year, I believe due to stress, but the hair I have is basically feels soft and healthy, considering the fact that I regularly have it highlighted. I bought this shampoo hoping it would make my hair look thicker and more like it used to. I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it made their hair squeaky clean. Whenever your hair is squeaky clean, that means it&#x27;s been stripped of the natural oils that it needs. My hair never felt so dry and unhealthy even after repeated conditioning with Nexxus intensive conditioners. I paid a lot of money for the large bottle, but I threw it away, because I just can&#x27;t keep ruining my hair with this shampoo just to finish the bottle. The only way that I can see that this product makes your hair appear thicker is that because it is so dry, it doesn&#x27;t lay as smooth as healthy hair, but I will take healthy hair that isn&#x27;t as full over the straw-like fried mess that this shampoo left my hair. I have found better results from the Loreal products that strengthen hair and Nioxin Diamax. Save your money and your hair. Don&#x27;t use this product!!</li>
            <li> I started using this product by recommendation of my hair stylist.  After illness, I had lost a lot of hair and was starting to get bald patches.  My hair was thin and unmanageable.  After only one month of use, I noticed a slow hair regrowth.  Now, after three months, my hair is growing better than before.  It is stronger and healthier and more manageable.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Item as described; works well.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo for my hair which is thin and it is working for me.  It is worth buying this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus Biotin VitaTress shampoo for well over 20 years and it is the only thing that prevents a sort of acne I get on my scalp.  Before Nexxus, I was prescribed a selenium product but found it too nasty, and ineffective.  A beautician friend recommended the Nexxus product and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  Once in awhile, I forget to take it on vacation or a trip and within a couple of days I notice the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; coming back on my scalp.  Within a couple of shampoos with Nexxus Biotin, it gone again.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they quit making this product.  BTW, it is indeed most effective when left to lather on the scalp for two or three minutes, as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shampoo for thinning hair and hands down the Nexxus Biotin shampoo I feel is the best on the market. I have been using the shampoo for just a month and all I can say is WOW! It has restored my hair and makes it appear fuller. If you are debating as to try it or not let me help you - stop hesitating and order it - you will be VERY glad you did.</li>
            <li> lately, I&#x27;ve been losing my hair due to thyroid problems, so I looked into products that might help me to prevent losing my hair and get them stronger in addition to the thyroid medication. I stumbled upon this product on amazon and after glowing reviews decided to give it a chance. I started using this shampoo a week ago, and I absolutely love it! my hair looks shiny and voluminous. it&#x27;s too early to tell if my lost hair is growing back, but it feels like it&#x27;s getting stronger, and I love the way my hair feels now. I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my hair in the last few days. I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> i have used this for over 20 years,  i stopped using this for about a year  BIG mistake, i am back on this product and very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Biotin shampoo for almost a year now and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker and, of course, clean. I don&#x27;t believe I will be getting back to my my previous brand (Nexxus Therape). While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best for my hair so far - for some background, I have a full head of hair but it&#x27;s in the process of thinning and maybe my forehead advanced by half an inch in the past 10 years :) so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin is part of the VitaTress line of products, designed for those whose hair is in the process of thinning. It is claimed that Biotin eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair and adds thickness and body to it. I concur with these claims. When use as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for THREE MINUTES before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;. It really squeaks if you rub your hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me. There is absolutely no feeling of discomfort while using the shampoo. Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment. The other claim, that this shampoo slows or reverses hair loss I can&#x27;t verify. Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and discuss share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels better after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A bottle this size is likely to last for many months so, while the price is high, it&#x27;s not THAT high when spread over 4 to 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;- While it&#x27;s not stated anywhere, it seems to act as a conditioner. I would not use use a conditioner after Biotin myself.&lt;br /&gt;- The &#x27;pump&#x27; bottle is very convenient because it helps you get the proper amount without waste and it prevents water from the shower from diluting the contents.&lt;br /&gt;- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;- Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product. Until then, I am happy with it.- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.  - Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.

            <li> As always, I love the Vitatress hair products. They have benefitted my hair in many ways.  Thanks for making it so easy to obtain them.  After Nexxus went public, it became very difficult to obtain these products in the stores.</li>
            <li> results after the first application. I have curly, sometimes frizzy, medium short, thin, thinning, dulling, hair. now I have bouncy, curly, shinny hair--only third time I&#x27;ve used (I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday). high recommend.</li>
            <li> Some years ago I noticed that all over a sudden my hairline started to recede.  And it actually was doing so quite rapidly.  I researched a lot into the matter and found that very few claims regarding hairloss out there are backed up by proven scientific facts.  While in a men salon that mainly caters to middle aged males, I was shown this product.  I tried it and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  After using it for several weeks my hairline totally stopped receding and it has remained unchanged for all these years.  My hair in general has gotten thicker again as well.  I also like the feel and smell of this shampoo and how it makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally I often had trouble with my scalp being itchy.  Since using this shampoo it completely went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is great for thinner hair- have used nothing but this for 25 years, and am a huge fan. 55 years old still with a full head of shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while and like it a lot.  Helps keep your hair growing and the bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was helping or not, I was taking Biotin along with Vitatress Biotin shampoo. I only gave 3 stars, it&#x27;s because it dries my hair out way too much even though I use biotin scalp crème.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for years.  I have always had fine and thin hair, and that&#x27;s just not cute on a woman.  This shampoo cleans my hair very well, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most shampoos.  The down sides.... biotin is listed pretty far down on the list of ingredients, so how effective is it really?  It also did not help my hair to fill out at all, which was the whole reason for trying it to begin with.  I stuck with it for so long thinking maybe it was a slow process.  I came to find out that all it did was make what little hair I do have grow really fast.  I still continued to use it though because it did not leave a build up on my hair.  Well.... I started reading reviews, blogs, and various websites, and discovered a MUCH cheaper alternative!....Suave Professionals Volumizing Shampoo!  A bottle of Suave is only about $2.00, and it gets my hair just as clean, and smells sooooo much better!  The Nexxus shampoo may help hair growth if your hair is thinning, but I&#x27;m not sure.  If your hair has always been thin, this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; you&#x27;ve been waiting for.  Save your money and just get the Suave Professionals Volumizing Shampoo.  It&#x27;s a better buy.</li>
            <li> I have pcos and at the age of thirty I am experiencing some thinning hair. It is not noticeable by others at this point, but I&#x27;m starting to be able to see my scalp clearly through my hair. I started using this and after about three to four weeks I have about a centimeter in length of very fine spiky hairs poking through here and there. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a miracle shampoo, but I&#x27;ll take a few new hairs. I&#x27;m undecided if it is worth the price, but I will use this until I hear of something better. It has a light fruity scent. Lathers well and makes my hair feel clean. I use a conditioner on my hair length-not scalp otherwise my hair feels coarse and is hard to brush. I will continue to use this and see how it goes. If things continue to improve with the shampoo I will post again to update.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  For the large size of this shampoo (33.8 oz.) the price was very good for a biotin shampoo.  I would recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and got great results.  This is my second purchase.Leaves hair clean and not flat.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 10 years with fantastic results.  My hair has always been fine and straight, however, with age it became very fragile too and would break, fall out and became thin and dull.  The Biotin Shampoo gave my hair softness, shine and body without weighing it down, and it stopped falling out.  Many people say that shampoo builds up on your hair and you should change frequently to clean the build up, but I never experienced that with this product. I was mortified to learn that Nexus had changed their marketing and began selling to supermarkets, which made it unavailable in Beauty Supply stores. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here online!</li>
            <li> The Nexxus Biotin Shampoo arrived more quickly than promised and it works great! After combing my hair, there are only a few strands instead of a handful of hair falling out into the brush. I will use this shampoo for a long time and order it from the same place. This met my expectations and soared right into what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my thinning hair.  Sorry to say it hasn&#x27;t done much towards that. It is a nice shampoo but&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s about all I can say.</li>
            <li> I have fine,  thin hair and this shampoo when used as directed gives my hair body and thickness.  I have been using Nexxus Vitatress Biotin shampoo for a couple years now and hope Amazon continues to carry the shampoo.  The price is very reasonable and shipping was very fast.  Amazon&#x27;s  customer service was great.  They provided assistance and shipped their product at no cost to me when the first company I ordered the shampoo from did not have the product available and cancelled my order without notifying me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year gives hair strenghth, body, bounce and volume. Also prevents hair loss</li>
            <li> I already owned a smaller bottle of Nexxus Biotin Shampoo and bought this larger bottler as a refill.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  Makes his hair feel a lot better, and thicker too.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes in my hair though.  Thus the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast and the shampoo is great!  My hair comes out shiny and clean, not weighed down . I will purchase more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo my husband will use.  He has been using for over a decade and still has significantly more hair then his brother&#x27;s, he claims this shampoo is the reason why.  Not sure if that is true but it does make his hair soft and smell good.</li>
            <li> FUNNY I JUST READ ALL THE REVIEWS THEY APPEAR TO BY GOOD BUT HOW CAN YOU REVIEW A PRODUCT BASED ON THE PACKAGING AND FAST DELIVERY I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR THIS SHAMPOO IT ARRIVED ON TIME THE PACKAGING WAS GOOD BUT THE BOTTLE HAD NO SAFETY SEAL THE THING IN THE BOTTLE SMELLED WEIRD I AM NOT SURE IF THE CONTENT IS ORIGINAL FROM THE MANUFACTURER MY LITTLE WARNING BELL IS TELLING ME NOT TO USE IT SO I WONT !! PS I AM ONLY REPRESENTING MYSELF MAYBE IT WAS AN ERROR MADE SOMEWHERE IF THE BOTTLE WAS SEALED THEN I WOULD USE IT BUT NO SAFETY SEAL DONT USE</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  I purchased this product because: 1) I already like Nexxus Shampoo, and 2) Although my hair still looks great, it is not as thick as it was when I was 20, or 30, or 40, or 50.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  Based on my first use of this product, my hair appeared much fuller than with other shampoos I have used and had more body  There was no apparent coating of any kind left by the shampoo, and my hair was as soft as cornsilk.  (Since my hair is blond, it is important to me that a product does not mess up my natural color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a WONDERFUL smell, maybe like a creamy tangerine (not quite but the closest I can think of).  I could just sit here and sniff the darned bottle for awhile.  It has such a clean, fresh, pleasant, soothing smell.  The shampoo also felt lighter than other shampoos, but you didn&#x27;t need any extra.  The 33.8 fl oz bottle is HUGE and the pump makes it easy to use in the shower, without having to open and close tops or turn bottles upside down.  I took another reviewers advice and did not use a conditioner--and it turned out I didn&#x27;t need one.  So, in that respect, the shampoo costs a lot less.  BTW, it was a rainy weekend in Baltimore and my hair did not get the frizzies after using this shampoo.  That was truly remarkable because it rained ALL weekend, and I don&#x27;t always use an umbrella either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says #1 for fine, fragile, thinning hair--eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair, adds thickness and body. (In truth, my hair is thick, but not as thick as before.)  The bottle continues to say that it contains ingredients for treating hair loss with botanicals, amino acids, and nutrients to provide renewed life, increased thickness and incredible body.  By infusing certain stuff into the scalp and pores it provides a beneficial environment for optimal hair growth.  They also recommend VitaTress Food Supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to leave on for 3 minutes (which I did not do yet) to allow for infusion of minerals.  (I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)  They also recommend following with VitaTress formulation to counteract thinning hair.  (Note that the only thing I have done is to use the shampoo and have had wonderful results.  Also, my hair is not bleached or dyed and never has been, so I can only speak from that perspective.)  This shampoo does contain sodium laureth sulfate (which I understand is an issue for some people).  Among other ingredients, it also contains panax ginseng root extract, biotin, ginko biloba extract, soybean germ extract, licorice extract, jojoba seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!  Next time I will try leaving on 3 minutes, as the directions indicate.  Now, lemme just sniff it one more time. . . ahhhhhhh :-) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK.  I did the 3 minutes.  Seemed the same but it sounds like a cumulative thing, adding nutrients to your scalp everytime you shampoo.  I will check back in a couple months and let you know more.  Regardless, it is a really nice shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/28/10--I have used this shampoo several times now and still love it.  The last 2 times, I have used a conditioner with it.  Because my hair is long and thick, the conditioner makes it easier to comb when wet.  I have been using Avalon Organics Lemon Conditioner following this shampoo.  Avalon Organics has a couple of \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;.  I chose Lemon because my hair is platinum to golden blond in color.usion of minerals.  (I just shampooed twice and rinsed it right out.)

            <li> Is great shampoo, smells light and not too heavy. The shampoo is non stripping to hair. Makes hair very soft, not sticky or hard to manage. I enjoy the product very much</li>
            <li> My senior elf colorist recommend this years ago, and I am a believer, My hair is staying with me longer and softer!</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin blond hair. This product is a life saver! does not wear my hair down, and cleans it thoroughly. Would highly recommend. Shampoo twice once in a while too for better results. EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for a month and like it. It makes my hair feel very clean and easy to manage. However, I do use a Nexuus conditioner. I only have one complaint. When I  open the bottle the chemicals burn my eyes. Will probably use this once or twice a month and switch to Borage shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff works or not.  When I got mine I thought the dispenser was broken, just keep pumping it, do it like a thousand times and eventually shampoo comes out.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for a month and don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. My hair was breaking off and thinning I needed something to stop this. Did some research online and this product was highly recommended. I gave it a try and instantly it gave me volume and within 30 days I noticed less breaking.</li>
            <li> been using 10 plus years good good goood all gooood great crap for hair no worries works good unga bunga</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair was falling out with regular relaxer use. I was trying everything to regrow hair and keep what I have and came across this shampoo. I&#x27;m soooo glad I purchased it. It has really helped. It leaves my hair literally squeaky clean but not dry/brittle clean-if that makes sense. My hair did get thicker and the falling slowed down but it could be in combination with other things I was doing. It did stop my dandruff issue that was due to excess oil buildup-haven&#x27;t had any major scalp issues since I started using this :)&lt;br /&gt;When I decided to do the big chop and go natural earlier this year I continued to use this shampoo. It has helped with the transition and I will keep purchasing it. My whole family uses it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;This has been the only shampoo I used since Jan 2013. It&#x27;s now Feb 2014 and I&#x27;m just now running out and need to order more. The bottle lasts a really long time so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those men who had used nioxin for many years, quite satisfied with the results until the dreaded formula change, when it became ineffective for me. I have been on the search for a new product ever since, and based on the positive reviews I decided to try this. I have now been using this product for over 3 months, and frankly, I&#x27;m disappointed in this. My hair loss has increased during my use of this product, though I know that it&#x27;s probably not due directly to use of this product. I&#x27;m just saying it won&#x27;t even prevent future hair loss whereas the nioxin product encouraged new growth in my thinning areas in addition to it&#x27;s conditioning and thickening properties. This product also has relatively no conditioning properties whatsoever. The formula is clear, nearly as thin as water and has no fragrance either. It leaves my hair oily and without body. That&#x27;s just been my experience. RIP original nioxin. You are missed by many. Though it IS expensive I will be trying the lipogaine big 3 product next.    Update 8/20/14 - Once I was committed to using up the product to rid myself of it and gain shelf space I began to double up on the amount I was using. Two full pumps into my palm and then lathering it up really well, then doubling the time I let sit lathered on my head during my shower. My results gradually began to improve. It does seem to more effective with heavier application. Still not quite as effective as nioxin USED to be, but more so than just the one pump and the normal washing. That&#x27;s enough for me to stay encouraged about the product. We will see in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> Product adds volume and body to my thinning hair.  This is my second bottle purchased and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple of months now.. Have not noticed much improvement on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I don&#x27;t use it consistently either since I hate that it tangles up my hair easily, but meh.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as part of a hair thickening regimen. This summer I noticed that I had to wear a hat in the sun to prevent my scalp from burning. The part in my hair seemed wider. I started taking Biotin and three months later bought this shampoo and the scalp creme. I do not know if my hair is regrowing but I am sure that I am loosing less and it appears fuller. I shampoo every other day and use the creme morning and night. I have fairly long hair and treat it gently, shampooing only once and massaging with my finger tips not nails. What I think it does is make the hair stand up from my scalp rather than lay flat so it looks much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;My son is also using the shampoo. Not because his hair is thinning but because it is in the shower. I must say his hair looks good.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s with grey hair</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. I do not have a hair loos, how ever my hair are thin, I do not wash my hair every day with this shampoo or any kind of shampoo, so with this being said I love this shampoo, because my hair are not oily next day and it does thickens my hair a lot. I will stick with this shampoo for sure.</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels great after use.</li>
            <li> for some reason this make my scalp really dry. every time I use this I get dandruff. the it goes away when I use my regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened or started using this product yet. I look forward to using this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be sure, but it does seem like this has stopped (or at least vastly slowed) my thinning hair. It may seem expensive at first glance, but one of these bottles lots a real long time at two squirts per shower.</li>
            <li> great for thining hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in my hair loss .....but it leaves my hair very clean!!!!! It&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a week - it&#x27;s just okay.  Haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement - giving it some more time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some different ones over the years but I keep coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s not as drying as some.  I can&#x27;t even get it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about one month. I bought this product because I had been looking for a good shampoo for thinning hair. Since I saw the review is very good about this product, I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, since I&#x27;ve used this product, my hair falls out much more than before. :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to stop minimal hair loss. It did exactly what it said it&lt;br /&gt;said it would. I intend to keep using this shampoo, although I wish it was less&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;pricey\\&quot; and also available at my local retail stores, but since its not available&lt;br /&gt;at retail stores, I can always rey on Amazon.com. They never disappointment me.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo a few weeks ago. My hair has always been very fine. I have baby blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. My hair is starting to show signs of thinning. This shampoo has made my hair look twice as full. My hair appears thicker, but its really not helping with hair growth. I dont think I would use another shampoo since my hair looks much fuller. I am using the scalp treatment as well. I think the combo of the 2 products has done wonders for my hair. It is a bit pricey but, I am worth it.</li>
            <li> Balding hair runs in my family and now that I am approaching the age of 30, I&#x27;ve started to notice some thinning along my hairline. Needless to say I&#x27;d like to keep the hair I have as long as I can, so after some research I chose to try this shampoo as a way to provide some extra nutrients to my hair and scalp. I can say that after a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair looks and feels healthier and my scalp does as well. The hair loss is still present, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it is falling out at a much slower rate that before, which is what I was looking for. This product also seems to be free of the nasty chemicals that are included in some of the other shampoos out there. When I run out, I plan to buy Nexxus Biotin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--PROS:--&lt;br /&gt;+Reduction in my hair loss&lt;br /&gt;+Healthier looking/feeling hair and scalp&lt;br /&gt;+Free of harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;+Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;+Perfect size (33.8 oz) with nice pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--CONS:--&lt;br /&gt;-While its not overly expensive, this is definitely a step up from the bargain shampoo that can be picked up at the drugstore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--OVERALL:--&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;Very satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;Would recommend to others looking to improve scalp/hair health (NOTE: this product is not designed to RE-GROW hair)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I am really excited about the Nexxus Biotin Shampoo.  My hair has been thinning for the last couple of years and the front of my hair is beginning to bald.  After just one use of this shampoo I noticed an instant improvement.  My hair was noticably thicker and didn&#x27;t fall out as much.  I also noticed that while washing my hair, it wasn&#x27;t getting tangled and even though I did use a conditioner after the shampoo it would have been fine if I didn&#x27;t use one because it left the hair soft and managable.  I am so happy I decided to try it because I have been so fearful of trying anything that could have a negative impact on my hair especially since it is so fragile.  My hair is naturally thin so I can tell when a product works if it makes it look thicker and feel better.  I can&#x27;t wait to try this product again and again.  I just hope the results get better and I will be sure to keep you posted.  Losing hair is something that can be so frustrating and bothersome so if I could help someone else get a hold of something that actually works, that would rock.  Just ordered the Biotin creme so that I get double the efforts of the Biotin &amp; will try to take the Biotin pills even though I am so bad with reminding myself when it comes to taking my vitamins.  God bless ;-)</li>
            <li> perfect for cleaning all hair types and leaving moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for months now  so far my hair is not falling or breaking  as much but I cant say for sure if its the result of this product or the hair supplement product.</li>
            <li> I started out using VitaTress shampoo in the late 90&#x27;s. I switched to Nioxin 5 years ago; however it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product.  My hair started falling out recently.  I switched back to VitaTress and the molting stopped.  The only reason I switched to Nioxin initially, is that it seemed to work just as well and it gave a tingling sensation when using it.  I&#x27;ve read reviews stating that the company was bought out, they changed the formula, and relocated manufacturing to Mexico.  I can&#x27;t confirm any of this, but when a hair growth promoting product suddenly causes hair loss, that&#x27;s not good.  I can live without the tingling, it was probably a psychosomatic gimmick any way.  This Nexus product is fantastic and I&#x27;ve been seeing new growth since replacing Nioxin.  It&#x27;s not just the shampoo - I also take a saw palmetto complex and use Minoxidil foam daily.  I started loosing my hair when I was 27; I&#x27;m 45 now and still have it...that&#x27;s the goal right?  Somethings working and I believe VitaTress Biotin shampoo is contributing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> this shampoo lathers nicely, and leaves my hair bouncy &amp; shiny!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommmend this to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;About to purchase my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li> Nexxus Biotin Shampoo is a very good product it lathered and smelled great and it cleaned my hair and scalp well, this product is  definitely  a good value for your money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product and keep re-ordering because I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to get the larger one this time. Hair is so healthy and no more loss of hair</li>
            <li> Shampoo was old and alcohol had evaporated making it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> Very Bad Shampoo,I advice all ...don&#x27;t USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> excellent no problems</li>
            <li> I have order those twice, getting ready to order for a third time. I am post menopausal and my hair was thinning. Since using it, my hair has thickened and I have stopped losing it at the rate I previously was losing it. I now have my husband using it.</li>
            <li> Love all nexxus products! They have helped me repair my severely damaged hair! I couldn&#x27;t live without them!</li>
            <li> I bought this Biotin product and the capsules of biotin and I saw results of hair growth and mail growth over a period of many months.  It was worth it.  This is my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Susan R.</li>
            <li> My daughter had hair breakage due to a bad reaction from relaxing her hair. She has been using this shampoo since March and I have seen remarkable improvement in her hair growth. Her hair is halfway to being shoulder length again. I will definitely re-order this product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair dresser because I was losing so much hair and had a bold spot showing on top of my skull.  I use this shampoo + Equate - Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women with Minoxidil 2% and now hair loss is not as bad and I don’t look so bold, still thin but not bold.</li>
            <li> still using it, waiting to see results</li>
            <li> I was taking Topamax for Migraines and my very thick hair was falling out in GOBS and I was afraid to brush or wash it-I cried every time I did cause my tub would be full of hair....I did a LOT of research on shampoos and I found a review from a woman who used this shampoo and conditioner when she was on chemo and it helped her with hair loss and new hair growth...this was the only shampoo/conditioner that worked for me as well...I also got off the damn Topamax now my hair is really thick again (I don&#x27;t use this anymore cause the the Step 2 conditioner was a pain in the ass it was like a paste, I sometimes would use different conditioner, but IT DID WORK)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item and the entire &amp;#34;Vitatress&amp;#34; line.Perhaps i should start using this product for my hair too.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy delivered very quickly</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s did what it said it was going to do and my hair is fuller and feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this on/off love affair with this Biotin shampoo for years. Sometimes it seems to work very well. Others, not so much. I came back to it recently, after dalliances with varied shampoo/conditioner combinations, and found that it&#x27;s among the best shampoos for me - fine hair - that I&#x27;ve tried. I think the bad spells had something to do with the time of year - humidity levels, etc. And, sometimes it takes a couple of days to &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34;. Occasionally I double shampoo and it works well. I don&#x27;t abide the &amp;#34;3 min.&amp;#34; rule. Seems like with other things in life, you just gotta give it a chance once in awhile and be patient. Love is like that.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for those who have thin hair or seem to be getting thinner.  I love it and highly recommend it. It is so much cheaper buying through Amazon than through the Salons.</li>
            <li> Due to A LOT of surgeries as well as the MANY beds my mother has to take her hair has been thinning &amp; falling out for years. This product -Nexus Biotin - her hair has stopped falling out! I use all 3 steps - shampoo, conditioner, &amp; the Promend leave in treatment - &amp; now that I&#x27;ve used it for over. 6 months I&#x27;ll never anything but nexus from here on out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a month now.  I do feel it has increased some hair growth.  Not so thin on top.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with this shampoo.  Hair is manageable every time and gives lots of body.  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now. If I stop my hair gets really oily. I also noticed great strength in my hair and thickening as well.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea on my scalp and used prescription shampoo for years.  It is expensive and leaves you hair a mess.  My hairdresser recommended the Nexxus because I have very fine hair.  So I started lathering first with my prescription and then with the Nexxus.  Much Better!  Then, several years ago, I ran out of my prescription shampoo and the pharmacy did not have any in stock so I was down to just the Nexxus.  It was controlling the seborrhea by itself!!!  I have such a healthy scalp now that my hair is looking better than ever. When Nexxus was bought out by another company they moved most of their line out of the salon and into the stores.  Unfortunately they changed the products formulas’ and added fragrance so I had to stop using their cream rinse.  Thank goodness they did not change the Biotin shampoo. It is still only available in salons.  Since no salons within 100 miles of me carry it, I have to get it on the Internet.  I don’t even want to think about living without it if they were to change the formula or stop making it.  I highly recommend it for anyone with scalp issues or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo since 2004 and it works every time.  I use it for my thining hair and I get compliments all the time.  I highly recommend it for any one trying to hand on to the last bit of hair they have.  Its a miracle shampoo.  I still use it to this day and my hair loss has come down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Used for over a year. Appears to thicken your hair right after use but it&#x27;s due to your hair and scalp drying out so much. Biotin applied externally simply does not improve hair/skin health. Actually worsened my hair thinning. No better than cheap generic shampoos.</li>
            <li> I normally shampoo my hair 3 times a week and always use conditioner afterwards. This shampoo makes my hair even more dried out than it already was, makes my hair fall out and I do not notice any improvement in growth or strength. I regret buying such a large bottle. (at the time, the price and size seemed a better deal).</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this shampoo, especially with the price tag. 1) I feel like drugstore shampoo cleans better than this 2) no difference in my hair growing thicker or longer and I&#x27;ve been using it for atleast a month now.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since March, however, after two months, I felt something happened on my neck and face.  Redness and itchy around my neck and along my hairline.  After seeing my doctor, I&#x27;m alleged on one of the ingredients, so I have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I bought another Nexxus Vitatress Biotin Shampoo, and in the large container as it is the best price. It is like a year&#x27;s supply and I think it is great for my hair as it keeps my hair clean and color is there great also. I bought this through Amazon as I got it at the right price, and the big bottle is the way to go. It comes with a pump top.</li>
            <li> does a wonderful job on one&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitatress for over 15 years and can say I&#x27;ve lost little, if any hair during that time. This comes from a guy with a family history of pattern baldness. I only wish I had started using it sooner. I&#x27;ve urged friends to use it and their results have been the same..stopped hair loss in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase, you will be extremely pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. Lathers up nicely. Good value for the price. My hair seems to feel fuller since I started using it while also taking biotin vitamins.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this product long enought to say if it works for me or not. I do like the way it makes my hair look fuller though.</li>
            <li> I have just been using the shampoo for a couple of weeks, but I feel like it&#x27;s working so far. My scalp feels healthier, am the hair feels a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and really like what it is doing for my hair. I am going to look forward to see what happens in the next few months. Hopefully this product will just keep getting better.</li>
            <li> Best that I have found just love this product.</li>
            <li> kind of feel like i wasted 25 dollars on this. I think i would have gotten the same or better results if just took the biotin tablets.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo it really cleans your scalp and it&#x27;s a great value I use this then Toppik Keratinizing shampoo and my hair gets really thick. Plus its supposed to remove dht which is something I really need.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Its worthless, its not any better then some cheap shampoo. It&#x27;s a gmmick just to get your money. people will say anything just to get your money. I have used it everyday for a month and has done nothing to make my hair thicker or fuller or longer.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used.  It has Biotin in it which is a very expensive ingredient. It causes thin hair to swell which gives you a fully head of hair which is great whether you are thinning or not.  It has a great fragrance and my hair always is very healthy, full, and bouncy after using.  The pump handle makes dispensing very convenient and consistent in amount.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shampoo and I re-purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and the quality of the product. Have been using it all of the time and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist commented that biotin will strengthen hair but not grow it like Rogain. This product works in this respect but has an unpleasant odor.</li>
