            <li>kind of.</li>
            <li>holds well, nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>then you&#x27;d expect, and kind of leaves a coat of itself on your hands, so you might want to wash you hands afterwards.</li>

            <li>Good hold, leaves no residual residue in your hair, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>good price and very quick deliery</li>
            <li>Very easy to work with in your hair.</li>
            <li>No flaking/faux dandruff look, and is water soluble so washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>this is - by far - the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>Probably better for shorter hair but a nice product with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>But if this description fit your needs at all, then more power to you!</li>
            <li>Great hold with just the right amount of pliability and shine, easy to work with and lasts all day once it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell...</li>

            <li>My favorite hair gel—and cheaper than I get it at any brick &amp; mortar establishment I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>This is the best short hair styling product on the market period.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for many years</li>
            <li>better than mouse or gel.  </li>
            <li>It is the best stuff I have ever used for my short spiky hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair styling gel.</li>
            <li>I like this when I want a more defined look.</li>
            <li>Great gorgeous short hair.</li>
            <li>It is not a pomade, but more of a custard consistency.</li>
            <li>This is a product i have used for many years.</li>
            <li>works ok for me.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>but it is more of a hold</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>This is the best for short hair.</li>
            <li>Love it been using it for years.</li>
            <li>This is an ok styling product.</li>
            <li>Glad it did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a gel like hair product to me.</li>
            <li>More gel then paste though.</li>
            <li>This product is always out of stock at my salon, so I&#x27;m glad that amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and love how easily my hair styles and holds</li>
            <li>Thanks for being a good supplier.</li>
            <li>this product dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t flake and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>this is because it works the way i want it to and is easy to use</li>
            <li>Our local stores stopped carrying the product and I was happy to be able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This gel is decent and it holds good</li>
            <li>The hold is great and has barely any shine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how this makes my hair fuller, thicker and gives it the exact look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hands down the best hair product on the market for all day hold.  </li>
            <li>I paid just over $10 for it and free shipping.</li>
            <li>It is important to put it on your fingers and rub hands together until they feel sticky, then apply to your hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my short, sexy hair looking good all day.  </li>
            <li>have found no other product as good as this.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, but wasn&#x27;t what I was exactly looking for.</li>
            <li>Great handling after hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of hair products and this is the best one for a rough and ready look.</li>
            <li>She got pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li>I wish they could have just left a good thing alone.  </li>
            <li>The other gel they have works great</li>
            <li>quickly and keep the container sealed when not is use</li>
            <li>I received my order quick as a flash.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money if you have short hair...and want it to look sexy (...or want to think it looks sexy...).</li>
            <li>It is rather sticky and adds too much weight to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great because &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The product NEEDS to be FRESH</li>
            <li>This product holds your hair nicely with low shine.</li>
            <li>but well worth $20 a jar.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a pretty good while, depending on what you&#x27;re doing and the weather, but never really a &amp;#34;full day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very very sticky way to sticky</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this product online.  </li>
            <li>Love using it on my short spiked hair.</li>
            <li>-Avid User</li>
            <li>I will continue to do so, as the customer service was great and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I love this styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for adding volume &amp; texture to short, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and really like the hold it gives my short cut.</li>
            <li>Strong hold that looks natural - not hard, lets wind hit it &amp; still remains moldable/textured</li>
            <li>It stands up to wind and hot weather really well.</li>
            <li>I like it to look a certain way</li>
            <li>I have very short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but when I go out at night and really need to get my hair to do certain things.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT I DO BELIEVE WAS A KNOCK OFF OF THE REAL THING.  </li>
            <li>AND THE TEXTURE WAS VERY RUNNY.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>hold well and makes it very managable.  </li>
            <li>I was very please with the product and the price.  </li>
            <li>He loves the way it holds his hair the whole day.</li>
            <li>I really like this product to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; up my hair after being washed.  </li>
            <li>They are really intune with what people want for hair.</li>
            <li>I do on planning on finishing this, but I will look for a different product that will fit my needs afterwards.</li>
            <li>Though you need to wash your hands thoroughly after applying, I am using it everyday and loving it.</li>
            <li>but I have other stuff I like better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and love the way I can add volume, texture and hold to my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Been using this styling gunk for a few years now - have not been able to find another product that works like this one.</li>
            <li>But when I found out that it was not being sold anymore by the retailers I normally visited I looked around  and found it on Amazon Dot Com.</li>
            <li>Great to style short thick hair!</li>
            <li>and this works fine but not fantastic at it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but is so hard to find.</li>
            <li>It will function until I find something that offers a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>You can go to sleep with this in your hair and wake up the next morning ready to go.</li>
            <li>Really helps put style-ability into my short hair.</li>
            <li>Good for short hair -- go figure -- and I have only deviated from this product a few times, always to come back.</li>
            <li>Maybe for someone with really thick hair this would work better.</li>
            <li>It looks just as wet as the other kind in the blue container.  </li>
            <li>The name says rough and ready, and I figured that meant a rough messy look for a guy with straight hair about an inch to 1 1/2 inches on top.</li>
            <li>I find it works better for me if I put it on wet hair and then blow dry, even though the package instructions say to put it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It still goes in easy and even though I can&#x27;t do a faux hawk with it with my thick hair</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I expect because I been buying the same brand at local hair salon for a long time and know what should look like.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super long, it is cut to stand up in the back, I try to style it a little differently every day and this helps, but doesn&#x27;t have as much hold as I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It provides the right amount of hold so the hair stays as styled (even in moderate-somewhat heavy winds), but doesn&#x27;t turn the hair into a helmet that things bounce off and hurts to run your hand through the hair.  </li>

            <li> It lasts for a pretty good while, depending on what you&#x27;re doing and the weather, but never really a &amp;#34;full day&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very very sticky way to sticky</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this product online.  </li>
            <li> Love using it on my short spiked hair.</li>
            <li> -Avid User</li>
            <li> I will continue to do so, as the customer service was great and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I love this styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for adding volume &amp; texture to short, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and really like the hold it gives my short cut.</li>
            <li> Strong hold that looks natural - not hard, lets wind hit it &amp; still remains moldable/textured</li>
            <li> It stands up to wind and hot weather really well.</li>
            <li> I like it to look a certain way</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but when I go out at night and really need to get my hair to do certain things.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT I DO BELIEVE WAS A KNOCK OFF OF THE REAL THING.  </li>
            <li> AND THE TEXTURE WAS VERY RUNNY.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> hold well and makes it very managable.  </li>
            <li> I was very please with the product and the price.  </li>
            <li> He loves the way it holds his hair the whole day.</li>
            <li> I really like this product to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; up my hair after being washed.  </li>
            <li> They are really intune with what people want for hair.</li>
            <li> I do on planning on finishing this, but I will look for a different product that will fit my needs afterwards.</li>
            <li> Though you need to wash your hands thoroughly after applying, I am using it everyday and loving it.</li>
            <li> but I have other stuff I like better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and love the way I can add volume, texture and hold to my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this styling gunk for a few years now - have not been able to find another product that works like this one.</li>
            <li> But when I found out that it was not being sold anymore by the retailers I normally visited I looked around  and found it on Amazon Dot Com.</li>
            <li> Great to style short thick hair!</li>
            <li> and this works fine but not fantastic at it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, but is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It will function until I find something that offers a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> You can go to sleep with this in your hair and wake up the next morning ready to go.</li>
            <li> Really helps put style-ability into my short hair.</li>
            <li> Good for short hair -- go figure -- and I have only deviated from this product a few times, always to come back.</li>
            <li> Maybe for someone with really thick hair this would work better.</li>
            <li> It looks just as wet as the other kind in the blue container.  </li>
            <li> The name says rough and ready, and I figured that meant a rough messy look for a guy with straight hair about an inch to 1 1/2 inches on top.</li>
            <li> I find it works better for me if I put it on wet hair and then blow dry, even though the package instructions say to put it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It still goes in easy and even though I can&#x27;t do a faux hawk with it with my thick hair</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I expect because I been buying the same brand at local hair salon for a long time and know what should look like.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super long, it is cut to stand up in the back, I try to style it a little differently every day and this helps, but doesn&#x27;t have as much hold as I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It provides the right amount of hold so the hair stays as styled (even in moderate-somewhat heavy winds), but doesn&#x27;t turn the hair into a helmet that things bounce off and hurts to run your hand through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a texturizing product for my short hair, but this made it fall flat.</li>
            <li> The equivalent that they have replaced it with does not work nearly as well, you get less, and it is way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to use to much or it seems to weigh my hair down and makes it feel sticky.</li>
            <li> It gives that messy fun look and with a little water can be restyled again, even later in the day.  </li>
            <li> Hair goes flat</li>
            <li> I will keep buying it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place and it lasts a long time because I dont have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one that I find keeps my hair the way I like it without dulling it.</li>
            <li> Stays put all day long!</li>
            <li> It has a dry look which I like.</li>
            <li> and this is for dry hair which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.</li>
            <li> You only need a little, and it works like bed-head.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time because you only need a small amount to style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really shiny but also not matt which I like.  </li>
            <li> Distribute on your fingertips and put into your short hair after it&#x27;s dried.  </li>
            <li> I just prefer using a styling product on wet hair</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair look thick and full.  </li>
            <li> just remember a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> and the other is nine</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount or it will gum up and be visible on your hair.</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day there are no more bed head flat spots.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive to use and I recommend it since I am very picky with texture and shine in my hair which sounds odd for me to say.  </li>
            <li> Does just as expected!!</li>
            <li> Definitely appreciate the ridiculous shipping.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair feeling stiff or greasy like other hair products.</li>
            <li> I typically put some styling product onto my hands, rub them together and then apply it to my hair so it doesn&#x27;t go on too heavily in any one spot.</li>
            <li> a little goopy for my tastes.</li>
            <li> this is still quite shiny even when I use a little.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab about the size of a dime will do.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using this gel for a few years.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy / sticky and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Usually I cant find it for less than $17</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because of its extreme hold when I style my hair!!!  </li>
            <li> I had to find a small container to put the gel into.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find from time to time,</li>
            <li> I have been using this styling gunk for at least a decade after my stylist sisters introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and gummy for me to even use.</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments on my hair and people asking, &amp;#34;What do you use in your hair?&amp;#34;  Unfortunately, the place that I usually purchase it, no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li> When I got it, the jar was broken.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy that they are no longer making this gel because I have been unable to find any other product that comes even close to performing as well as this.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to see that this has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, at least for me.</li>
            <li> but I find it looks like I just sprayed a crap load of hair spray in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nothing performs quite like it, and I&#x27;m very disappointed to hear it&#x27;s being discontinued !</li>
            <li> , I am just very disappointed that I can no longer get it at Cosmoprof!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this product all the time and love how easily my hair styles and holds</li>
            <li> I like this product because of its extreme hold when I style my hair!!!  I would and recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> keeps your hair in place all day, even in the wind. love it</li>
            <li> This product gives me the spiky look for my short hair cut without being sticky or greasy.  I love the smell...it&#x27;s tropical smelling!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, at least for me. It&#x27;s too thick and gummy for me to even use. I typically put some styling product onto my hands, rub them together and then apply it to my hair so it doesn&#x27;t go on too heavily in any one spot. When I tried that with this stuff, my hands just stuck together. I didn&#x27;t get any shine from it either. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this styling product.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for adding volume &amp; texture to short, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Apply quickly and keep the container sealed when not is use&lt;br /&gt;as this product dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very very sticky way to sticky</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I have very short, fine hair.  It&#x27;s amazing how this makes my hair fuller, thicker and gives it the exact look I am going for.&lt;br /&gt;I have found no other product as good as this.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or stiff.  One jar lasts forever!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years.  I always receive compliments on my hair and people asking, &amp;#34;What do you use in your hair?&amp;#34;  Unfortunately, the place that I usually purchase it, no longer carries it.  This is my first time ordering this product online.  I will continue to do so, as the customer service was great and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!!  Hope it stays around .  Love using it on my short spiked hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a while now. Love it. Very easy to work with in your hair. Received it real quick and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT I DO BELIEVE WAS A KNOCK OFF OF THE REAL THING.  THE JAR DID NOT HAVE A SEAL AROUND IT AND THE TEXTURE WAS VERY RUNNY.  THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DO THE JOB IN MY HAIR LIKE IT USED TO DO. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I love it !!! My hair always does great with this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any girl or guy that likes their hair short &amp; spiked</li>
            <li> This product is one that I have used for many years. It stands up to wind and hot weather really well. It was delivered to my home earlier than what was estimated. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every &amp;#34;spiking&amp;#34; product there is on the market over the last 5+ years.....this is - by far - the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Nothing performs quite like it, and I&#x27;m very disappointed to hear it&#x27;s being discontinued !</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It keeps my short, sexy hair looking good all day.  It holds without being gooey.</li>
            <li> Has no hold. Hair goes flat</li>
            <li> I have used Rough &amp; Ready for 6-7 years now and have watched it go from $9-$18 in price, so I&#x27;ve spent all ranges of dollar amounts. The product NEEDS to be FRESH &amp; IT WAS!!! Thanks for being a good supplier. -Avid User</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. You don&#x27;t need a lot to separate and keep hair in place.  Never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best hair product on the market for all day hold.  Trust me I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> a little goopy for my tastes. Was looking for a texturizing product for my short hair, but this made it fall flat. Maybe for someone with really thick hair this would work better.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this at a salon and it no longer exists so I had to find it somewhere and I thought where else Amazon. It does what I need it to do for my hair great hold Great look.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does just as expected!!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair gel—and cheaper than I get it at any brick &amp; mortar establishment I&#x27;ve found.  It provides the right amount of hold so the hair stays as styled (even in moderate-somewhat heavy winds), but doesn&#x27;t turn the hair into a helmet that things bounce off and hurts to run your hand through the hair.  No flaking/faux dandruff look, and is water soluble so washes out very easily.  Definitely worth the money if you have short hair...and want it to look sexy (...or want to think it looks sexy...).</li>
            <li> Great product! Been using this styling gunk for a few years now - have not been able to find another product that works like this one. It gives that messy fun look and with a little water can be restyled again, even later in the day.  Good hold, leaves no residual residue in your hair, washes out easily. Lasts a long time because you only need a small amount to style. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my sons hair and it works great.  It holds well and his hair stays in place.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for managing my hair styles for years. This product is great because &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya.&amp;#34; But when I found out that it was not being sold anymore by the retailers I normally visited I looked around  and found it on Amazon Dot Com. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and love the way I can add volume, texture and hold to my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best short hair styling product on the market period.  I have tried them all and when I tried this one all the others in my hs ir kit went into the trash!</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! Please make it more and continue making others and myself happy! And that all I have to say</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It holds the style on short hair and gives it plenty of spike without being overly sticky.  Love it!</li>
            <li> hold well and makes it very managable.  better than mouse or gel.  a little goes a very long way. good price and very quick deliery</li>
            <li> Supposedly this company stopped making this product. It is the best stuff I have ever used for my short spiky hair. I will keep buying it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This product holds your hair nicely with low shine. Though you need to wash your hands thoroughly after applying, I am using it everyday and loving it.</li>
            <li> Definitely appreciate the ridiculous shipping. Honestly, some of the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Great handling after hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I expect because I been buying the same brand at local hair salon for a long time and know what should look like.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair styling gel. My hair stylist was told it was not being made anymore, so I was very pleased to see that I could get it on amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I have short layered asymmetrical hair. I like this when I want a more defined look. I don&#x27;t use it every day but when I go out at night and really need to get my hair to do certain things. It&#x27;s not really shiny but also not matt which I like.  It does&#x27;t flake and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Great hold, makes my hair look healthy, and washes out nicely. Hard to find from time to time, but well worth $20 a jar.</li>
            <li> Great gorgeous short hair.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Gunk&amp;#34; is a good word for this. It is not a pomade, but more of a custard consistency. It is rather sticky and adds too much weight to my fine hair. I prefer the &amp;#34;Rocked Out&amp;#34; product from this line over this; I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a product i have used for many years. this is because it works the way i want it to and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I was very please with the product and the price.  My husband uses it every morning.  He loves the way it holds his hair the whole day.</li>
            <li> I have pixie cut and this is PERFECT.  Strong hold that looks natural - not hard, lets wind hit it &amp; still remains moldable/textured</li>
            <li> works ok for me. but I have other stuff I like better</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! With my whimsy hair I need all the help that this &amp;#34;Magic Goup&amp;#34; provides!</li>
            <li> The hold is great and has barely any shine!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this gel for a few years. Its the best gel that I know of. It holds my hair in place and it lasts a long time because I dont have to use a lot of it. I paid just over $10 for it and free shipping. Usually I cant find it for less than $17 so this is the only way to buy it.</li>
            <li> Probably better for shorter hair but a nice product with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 7 years. Love it! My hair is straight and heavy so I need a hair product that can hold it up and spike it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one that I find keeps my hair the way I like it without dulling it.</li>
            <li> It works to hold my hair ... kind of. My hair isn&#x27;t super long, it is cut to stand up in the back, I try to style it a little differently every day and this helps, but doesn&#x27;t have as much hold as I was looking for. It will function until I find something that offers a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> holds well, nice fragrance.  I like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. All guys with short hair need this. It has a dry look which I like.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF. Buy it and try it. Smells good. Works great. Good product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This gel is decent and it holds good but I find it looks like I just sprayed a crap load of hair spray in my hair.  It looks just as wet as the other kind in the blue container.  The other gel they have works great but it is more of a hold and this says its not as shiny but its still close.  Even though it says four and the other is nine this is still quite shiny even when I use a little.  It still goes in easy and even though I can&#x27;t do a faux hawk with it with my thick hair I use it for another style I try to pull off.  It is expensive to use and I recommend it since I am very picky with texture and shine in my hair which sounds odd for me to say.  Depending on what I am doing with it I like it to look a certain way and this works fine but not fantastic at it.  Try it out and you might like it and maybe it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I like the product just remember a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> When I got it, the jar was broken.  I had to find a small container to put the gel into.  I love this product, but is so hard to find. Im happy that I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel/paste that I have ever used.  I am very unhappy that they are no longer making this gel because I have been unable to find any other product that comes even close to performing as well as this.  The equivalent that they have replaced it with does not work nearly as well, you get less, and it is way more expensive.  I wish they could have just left a good thing alone.  What I like about it is that it has an amazingly good hold that is also flexible.  You can go to sleep with this in your hair and wake up the next morning ready to go.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to styling paste.  You only need a little, and it works like bed-head.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this product to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; up my hair after being washed.  Sorry to see that this has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and really like the hold it gives my short cut. It does not leave my hair feeling stiff or greasy like other hair products. It is important to put it on your fingers and rub hands together until they feel sticky, then apply to your hair. I have tried a lot of hair products and this is the best one for a rough and ready look.</li>
            <li> Really helps put style-ability into my short hair. I find it works better for me if I put it on wet hair and then blow dry, even though the package instructions say to put it on dry hair. Only need a small amount or it will gum up and be visible on your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always given my hair sylist a tip but now I tip her with products she loves and this is one of them! She got pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Our local stores stopped carrying the product and I was happy to be able to find it on Amazon.  It makes my thin hair look thick and full.  I use it every day and have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab about the size of a dime will do.  Distribute on your fingertips and put into your short hair after it&#x27;s dried.  I use a hair pic and the hair goes and stays where you want it to.  If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day there are no more bed head flat spots.  This is the best for short hair.</li>
            <li> Great to style short thick hair! Stays put all day long!</li>
            <li> I have been using this styling gunk for at least a decade after my stylist sisters introduced me to it. Good for short hair -- go figure -- and I have only deviated from this product a few times, always to come back.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! Great hold, quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Love it been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect stickiness and hold.</li>
            <li> This is an ok styling product. You just have to be careful not to use to much or it seems to weigh my hair down and makes it feel sticky. I just prefer using a styling product on wet hair and this is for dry hair which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Trusty product. It sort of disappeared from online for a while then reappeared. Glad it did. This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for hair gel. If you are in question, just order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a long time.  I like it obviously, I am just very disappointed that I can no longer get it at Cosmoprof!</li>
            <li> Great products! They are really intune with what people want for hair. Works great for me! Really love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great hold with just the right amount of pliability and shine, easy to work with and lasts all day once it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but wasn&#x27;t what I was exactly looking for. The name says rough and ready, and I figured that meant a rough messy look for a guy with straight hair about an inch to 1 1/2 inches on top. It dries faster then you&#x27;d expect, and kind of leaves a coat of itself on your hands, so you might want to wash you hands afterwards. It lasts for a pretty good while, depending on what you&#x27;re doing and the weather, but never really a &amp;#34;full day&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s more of a gel like hair product to me. When it dries it has this crispy look to it, like a gel, but can be somewhat formed throughout the day like a paste. More gel then paste though. I do on planning on finishing this, but I will look for a different product that will fit my needs afterwards. But if this description fit your needs at all, then more power to you!</li>
            <li> I received my order quick as a flash. I will purchase from here again soon!! I love this product and so happy I can get it here!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too heavy / sticky and does what it says it will do. This product is always out of stock at my salon, so I&#x27;m glad that amazon carries it. Pricing is fair and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was as promised.  No problem with anything.  Happy to have this option for my hair.  Great!</li>
