            <li>and I was offered this Majestic at a great deal to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>this product i got discounted, and i used it with and it gives a good result..</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>I use it after my moisturizer and it looks good with, or without make-up.  </li>
            <li>Good gel, I tried it, but I prefer cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing good results from every night usage.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worked liked they stated.</li>
            <li>Was not expecting this to work so good.</li>
            <li>So I think this is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>I waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a fair review.  </li>
            <li>34;no makeup&amp;#34; lifestyle, so keeping my skin looking good is a must.</li>
            <li>a good eye treatment without the risk of&lt;br /&gt;irritation.</li>
            <li>My opinions and happy eyes are my own.</li>
            <li>Feels good after application.</li>

            <li>(I am normal/dry skin) and my husband said I look like I&#x27;ve been getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed with this eye gel, the way it feels and works, and it&#x27;s terriffic list of healing and soothing ingredients!</li>

            <li>I bought just one of these to try and, so far, it has been wonderful..</li>
            <li>Its easy to applicate and has worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li>Excited to see if its good as it says....</li>
            <li>I have used many types of eye firming gels but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Eye Gel is beautiful inside and out.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to buy this Eye Gel Type 1 from Majestic Pure at a promotional price and be able to share my honest experience with it here with you.</li>
            <li>An ideal product would cover both needs fully, but it&#x27;s usually more realistic to realize a formula will tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>The gel has a very light and ungreasy texture.</li>
            <li>but health is very important.  </li>
            <li>Very light scent, glides on very light &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the scent is very light.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good going on and it smells nice too, clean and lightly citrus.  </li>

            <li>good stuff saw a real difference in 10 days!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li>and more make this a product that is sure to deliver for me as it has for many others.</li>
            <li>So glad to have tried it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes me feel.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had them for YEARS), and my skin is smoother with much better tone than ever before.</li>
            <li>my skin under my eyes looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li>i love that, will keep using it to see more results .</li>
            <li>I pumped twice and I was able to get under both of my eyes and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Keeps eye area hydrated &amp; healthy looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is NO way I would have been able to say all of that the way they did, my words are more like, &amp;</li>
            <li>I love that this product comes with a pump.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I would give more if I could.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product and will be buying more of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone with eyes needs this eye get - love this scent did I mention that?</li>
            <li>It sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m  really enjoying this eye gel.</li>
            <li>It reduced the puffiness I had under my eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;It has a cooling and refreshing feeling and didn&#x27;t  burn under my eyes.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I just bought this again because I love everything about it.</li>

            <li>I love this product and will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have not found an eye gel or cream that will make those lines disappear, but this gel helps more than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>I think its a good gift too sine its very helpful and effective :)</li>
            <li>The best part is the money back</li>
            <li>And I feel more confident without my makeup now</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it &amp; have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>Hope others have better luck if they try it.</li>

            <li>Majestic Pure Eye Gel!!</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>IF I order this product again, the box better not be opened and there better be written instructions for application unless one considers those on the reverse of the bottle, which are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to read them.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overpowering and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild (no added fragrance) and sort of an herbal cucumber essence.</li>
            <li>and I used it up to quickly.  </li>
            <li>The gel absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to absorb quickly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very crisp clean fresh scent, sort of like cucumber</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very nice eye gel that I would definitely recommend for puffy eyes and fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li>It is definitely reducing the bags under my eyes and I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I could see a difference the very first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very refreshing and light unlike many of the perfumey smelling ones that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I love trying out new products</li>
            <li>I cannot give this anything less than a 5 star because I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li>when you apply it, quick absorbed leaving the skin supple and plump.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this until the bottle is gone and probably buy more!</li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning to wake up!  </li>
            <li>Who wants to have that?!?!</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that the cream smells slightly like cucumber, which reminds me of a nice spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES TAKE CARE OF FINE LINES AROUND THE EYE &amp; IT</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and light, but that is the only positive.  </li>
            <li>I really like Majestic Pure as a company and have enjoyed the products I received from them.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Plant Stem Cell Eye Gel from Majestic Pure for anyone who wants a great eye gel.</li>
            <li>The gel is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27; t seen a huge improvement, but I have been using it since a week ago!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, goes on smoothly and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>This is such an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am loving the products for anti-aging, especially this one!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it to my eye area I felt it was silky but quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Carefully designed Eye Gel Youth formula contains a innovative combination of ingredients for most favorable results.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Once absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural without uneccessary chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product and will last awhile.</li>
            <li>so applying it first thing in the morning is ok too not thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>’s supposed to be safe on all skin since I have sensitive skin I believe that.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far, too soon to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li>It applies nicely to around eyes, it is creamy yet just sticky enough.</li>
            <li>I did apply around my eyes for 3 days, I can say my eyes don&#x27;t look nearly as puffy but that can be because of many instances but will give product benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>this absorbed well and did not crumble.  </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m really enjoying using it....</li>
            <li>I love beauty products and i am always trying new stuff and Majestic product really amaze me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying the product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, as I&#x27;ve read some very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this eye gel because of the smell - it is fresh and clean and wonderful to place under your eyes when you are tired or just getting ready for the morning and waking up -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to the ingredients &amp; surprisingly hopeful results of this eye gel product type 1</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was given the opportunity to review this gel at a special price and share my opinions as this products work wonders just like the company’s essential oils.</li>
            <li>While applying it just soaked right in and leaved no residue.</li>
            <li>dab the gel around my eyes and it soaks right in with no stickiness.</li>
            <li>I wish I could right a review in30dats not 10days as we have to do now.</li>
            <li>Seller notified me right away when product was shippped</li>
            <li>I am positive with continued use, they will be gone in no time!</li>
            <li>This makes magic because it helps lightens those dark circles and helps hydrate and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel incredibly soft after using and I ended up using my normal moisturizer afterwards , but I still liked it.  </li>
            <li>I like the Eye Gel as it goes on smooth, clear, no residual, no odor, and it feels lite and cool.</li>
            <li>Great little product!</li>

            <li>This serum is light and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>I was very anxious to try this product because upon opening it has a very pleasant smell, unlike some others that I have tried that truly have a very stinky odor.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can use it as a general wrinkle remover as well as around the eye.</li>
            <li>I felt misled by the picture but later realized that they blew it up that much to display its abundant ingredients.  </li>

            <li>Since I do not use makeup, I utilize this product in the morning (it is suggested in the label to use at night), and I&#x27;ve noticed that a few minutes after application, my eyes look more refreshed, and I feel better prepared to start with my</li>
            <li>Super Lightweight and Absorbs Fast...</li>
            <li>Although I do not have many wrinkles, the few I did have seem to not be as prominent.</li>
            <li>I love when fun skin products come up for review, I don&#x27;t like spending a ton of money when you never know if it&#x27;s actually going to work or not.</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye gel for only a short time but it feels great on my under eye area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working good so far I&#x27;ve only had it for  about 8 days</li>
            <li>This eye gel from majestic pure does exactly as it says!</li>
            <li>coz you only need a small amount to apply to your skin to be able to get a great result.</li>
            <li>I like to use this at night as part of my moisturizing regimen (face wash, toner, vitamin C serum, THIS EYE GEL, light moisturizer, heavy moisturizer), but first I used it alone to see how I liked the texture.  </li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY MUCH @ ALL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best part is, I suddenly obtained a white bump on my right eyelid that was getting bigger, and</li>
            <li>The scent is a nice summer scent of cucumber which is great because it&#x27;s not overwhelming, the color is slightly cloudy but not a full on white color like others, it has great coverage and applies really easy.</li>
            <li>; Majestic Pure Plant Stem Cell based EYE Cream Gel is the best anti aging Youth Formula based on natural ingredients designed for the delicate skin around your eyes to reverse the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>sure tell a different story.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and cannot wait for a long term effect.</li>
            <li>In the short time I&#x27;ve been given to use and review this product, I have not been able to tell a difference in my skin (on my face).</li>
            <li>#34;I love that it has the fix for EVERY under the eye issue one could possibly have!</li>
            <li>Hey, a girl can wish, can&#x27;t she? ;-)</li>
            <li>I based my FIRST order on the reviews of others.</li>
            <li>The eye gel was delivered in protective packaging and was exactly as described on product page.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is completely opaque, so there won&#x27;t be any issue with light deteriorating the ingredients (like Vitamin E) that degrade in</li>
            <li>but now they look much better, I have only used it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS EYE GEL!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it describes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve using is for about a week and noticed the difference after the first couple of days</li>
            <li>I also love that they offer a money back guarantee, which is  a relief with this sort of product!</li>
            <li>It is likely that continued use will result in even better results.</li>
            <li>It looks lighter, tighter and overall much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can be seen immediately within the first week&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>And that was just the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying eye cream after eye gels I haven&#x27;t YET found anything that does EXACTLY what it says and beyond.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and really helps get rid of my crows feet!</li>
            <li>But this eye gel works really well!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see even more results in the next couple of days!</li>
            <li>The biggest difference I see is in both my crows feet and, most of all, the deep line that I used to have in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Not so much since I started using this gel though!  </li>
            <li>and i recieved exactly when seller said it would be here.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer!</li>
            <li>I really like the eye gel!</li>
            <li>Love this product I will definitely use it again</li>
            <li>and it really works!  </li>

            <li>Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals consistently delivers quality products.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was light and easy to put under my eyes to help with the dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I have to give it five stars because it did pretty much what was claimed.</li>

            <li>I have noticed that this product goes a very very long way, which I feel makes it a fantastic value!</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was bigger, but the easy application.</li>
            <li>The gel smooths on easily and, pleasantly absorbs quickly without leaving a residue, which I have found in other gels and makes it hard to apply makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Eye Gel...</li>
            <li>I received this &amp;#34;Eye Gel Type I-Youth Formula&amp;#34; by: Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals to review on &amp; give my unbiased results....</li>
            <li>I use pure Witch Hazel as a wash before I apply this gel.  </li>
            <li>Then at night when I re-apply, I wash the day off with the pure witch-hazel again.  </li>
            <li>Majestic Pure eye gel was givin to me to try by my mother whom had INSISTED she had found the Fountain of Youth.</li>
            <li>Another hit from Majestic Pure, this eye gel has a permanent spot on my vanity.</li>
            <li>This is a review of Majestic Pure Eye Gel Type I, Youth Formula, 0.5 fl.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin but that gel is very gentle on skin!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this around my eyes, on my forehead and on my cheeks for the last week and a half and my face feels great.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it so easy to control how much product you are using because you really only need one pump of this product to cover each eye.</li>
            <li>Like all of the other Majestic Pure products I have tried, this one has been nothing short of amazing!</li>

            <li>My eyes where very puffy all the time, I would not leave my house without makeup</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s now almost completely gone!!!  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Having tried numerous Majestic Pure items in the past I was happy to see they offer an eye gel.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients are more oriented towards immediate, temporary improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these product, I will not use any other eye gel anymore.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but none of them have worked so</li>
            <li>The quality is very high and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it was just like that pretty pink tone you get from a light workout  or dancing , ect.  </li>
            <li>The packaging of the eye gel is simple and easy to use, the pump is really controlled which is a good thing because a little goes and long way</li>
            <li>I am very excited to try other products in this line.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this little bottle goes a long long way.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a coupon code for this item and really am grateful to have used it.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this Anti Aging Serum now for about 3 days and can already see Positive Results!!</li>
            <li>The thing i noticed the most difference in is the puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I was only able to use this feel good, tightening eye gel for one day.</li>
            <li>However, after more than two weeks of using the Eye Gel 2X per day, I have seen no noticeable improvement to the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My dark circles look  better</li>
            <li>The deeper wrinkles looked the same, but there was a marked reduction in fine lines and my skin looked fresher and brighter around the eye</li>
            <li>The fine lines under my eyes are also starting to disappear (been applying this gel for two weeks so far).</li>
            <li>The slight herbal scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and has an instant moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far, but the squirt lid was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of face creams and serums and gels, but none that had actual stem cell therapy.</li>
            <li>This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for all skin types looking&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>May not work for everyone, but I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>so It&#x27;s high time I take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Just got my majestic pure eye gel and so far Iove it.</li>
            <li>i love the dispenser, because all you want is a little amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the effects of the aging process.</li>
            <li>So far do not see much difference.  </li>
            <li>My mother is 66 years old and how the whole conversation came about</li>
            <li>I have oily skin normally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much difference this is making to my eye area, but I love the feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a slippery gel feel going on (aloe is the second ingredient), then a fresh cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any deep set wrinkles, but I am using this on my forehead and laugh line area as a preventative treatment.</li>
            <li>oh my goodness, did it feel good on my tired, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>This covers those dark circles right up!! 5</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick gel that hydrates well and leaves the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle right now.</li>
            <li>several days, I noticed that my entire eye area looked and felt firmer, and the fine lines at the corners were diminished.</li>
            <li>Putting it on the back of one hand resulted in immediately moister, smoother skin with fewer fine wrinkles as compared to the back of the untreated hand.</li>
            <li>did notice less puffiness and my fine lines are starting to be less visible, I&#x27;ve been using after my showers as is recommended to apply after cleansing with warm water.</li>
            <li>(i have a new baby at home) to reduce the puffiness and to almost awaken my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I forgot (the forgetfulness also comes with the sleep deprivation of having a new baby at home,</li>
            <li>But for now I keep trying new products like everyone else out there.</li>
            <li>This eye gel helps diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow’s feet, fine lines and sagginess.</li>
            <li>It lightlens dark circle around the eyes, demishes fine wrinkles, eye puffiness, and tones skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for slight puffiness and darkness under my eyes and It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cell  Eye Cream is a multitasking powerhouse for Wrinkles, Dark Circles Fine Lines, Crows Feet and Puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So having it dry so quickly</li>
            <li>Light thin and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>But it did leave my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>And with it being all natural it hasn’t ruined my pillow case or towels or clothing!</li>
            <li>When I first applied it I noticed a tingling sensation and could actually feel it working on my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>goes  on smooth and saw an immediate improvement with my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product in ingredients, scent, texture, and even bottle type as Aria Starr Beauty&#x27;s ultra youth eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First pic (the one on the viewers left) has no eye gel.</li>
            <li>I wanted to write a review for this particular product, because with so many products on Amazon its hard to no what to use.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty unique as far as any eye gels I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>After using this I can see that this will go a long way as just the right amount of gel is pumped out.  </li>
            <li>I use 2 small pumps and the gel is smooth and my skin is reacting very well.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ll admit I was very skeptical from the over the top reviews, but after a week my eyes are no longer puffy and wrinkles seem to be diminishing.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise the product seems to work well, my eyes feel hydrated and although I didn&#x27;t not have any dark circle or bags under my eyes to begin with, I think my skin looks better overall under my eyes.</li>
            <li>After my first use of this product WOW you could actually already tell a difference.</li>
            <li>received this at a small discount, but the review above expresses my honest opinions.</li>
            <li>First time user, got some ich initially, and been used about week, haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far...</li>
            <li>I am 4 years short of 80, and there are no wrinkles under my eyes, and the puffiness is going down more each time I use it.</li>
            <li>really like this product, and although I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every morning and can definitely seen an improvement.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure eye gel comes in a very tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure eye gel has been helping immensely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised only because I really wasn&#x27;t sold</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and will make this part of my routine.</li>
            <li>You will be greatly surprised at how far it will go.  </li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and felt smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;After it dries it leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals or pesticides.</li>
            <li>is all natural.</li>
            <li>I can already see a difference in the areas around my eyes that are frequently puffy and swollen from stress and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and CLEAR, so it is not a cover-up.  </li>
            <li>THAT IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>It will last much longer than you imagine.</li>
            <li>The company was very gracious and helpful, a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give a full review but so far it&#x27;s working well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few days now and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>so far its moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>One pump was more than enough to use on my eyes and with a second pump I had enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li>It is completely non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It is soft and silky</li>
            <li>Wearing Sensitive Eyes...</li>
            <li>Of course, if you didn&#x27;t put your face in the sun to begin with all these years, you may not looks so old, ha ha.</li>
            <li>I know the under eye bags will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>The package looks ghetto and haven&#x27;t seen any result so far</li>
            <li>The gel does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin in any way.</li>
            <li>personally all I can really saw is try it</li>
            <li>The eye creme is lightly scented (not expert opinion, but reminds me of green tea).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rank this gel as excellent in terms of cosmetic effects.</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry out or overhydrate my skin.</li>
            <li>just a tiny small amount - applied regularly will help my skin look even better than ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been there for a VERY long time and with the help of this eye gel, and the Majestic Pure oils (Argan, Rosehip and jojoba), it&#x27;s almost completely disappeared!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that a little goes a long way, so use it very sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smooth and dries quickly so you don’t have sticky sitting on your face like some of the other eye gels I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling of the gel and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Within a week of regular use I&#x27;ve noticed renewed plumpness around my eyes, and a slight diminishing effect on the fine lines and wrinkles that have been taking hold.  </li>
            <li>This treatment is a gel formula and is just shy of total odorless, I smell a hint of cucumber like, it is super refreshing</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe how much its working for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The first few days, I thought &amp;#34;this is ok&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t see the point of using it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the eye gel, but think there may have been an air bubble in the tube because it has only lasted for a few applications (20 single pumps?) and seems to have a lot of air when I pump it.  </li>
            <li>This feels nice and cool on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells to it like other creams.</li>
            <li>It works the same and I would highly recommend for people with aging wrinkles or people who want firmer skin around their eyes.</li>
            <li>A transparent serum, it glides on evenly and smoothly, requiring very little.</li>
            <li>When I noticed fine lines around my eyes, and deep lines in my forhead and between my eyebrows, I may have freaked out a little</li>
            <li>It advertises &amp;#34;stem cell therapy&amp;#34; not sure how accurate it is because of the lengthly experiments that goes into it.</li>
            <li>small and can easily fit on your purse...</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are still the same, and I believe I got a new one since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li>Ive been looking for something that can help me with my dark circles and right away you could tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and it&#x27;s probably to late in life to expect wrinkle free eyes.</li>
            <li>I love that just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I hope that with continued use I can slow the inevitable aging process just a bit so that maybe I&#x27;ll be carded for alcohol just once more.  </li>
            <li>This will make a perfect eye cream for the morning (I use crazy thick stuff at night because I am getting older *sigh)...</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to a lot of different products</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped tremendously in the mornings when I&#x27;ve had very little sleep</li>
            <li>The first night I tried it I was not impressed by how it made my eyes feel, but the next morning I felt better about the product.  </li>
            <li>When this procuct was offered to me during a promotional period I was skeptical but tried it out due to the great reviews I read on Amazon</li>
            <li>I noticed significant differences withing only a few days.</li>
            <li>I decided to use due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Definitely leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in mine.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin it can definitely be an issue.</li>
            <li>The Matrixyl 3000 helps to firm the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Innovative, Potent, anti aging cream - Eye Gel for Wrinkles, Dark Circles and Puffiness.</li>
            <li>I think I like the eye gel itself, my eyes look more refreshed, but the box the bottle was packaged in looked a bit home made and the pump was broken, which I tried fixing but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>, what’s frustrating with these sorts of products is you won’t know it works until many years</li>
            <li>My skin felt a little tighter and firmer right away.  </li>
            <li>I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li>I find it very strange that the ingredients are absolutely the same 1:1 as the ingredients in InstaNatural Eye Cream (19.95)&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li>As a woman who recently turned 30&#x27;s I am very conscious of any wrinkles, lines or puffiness in my face; especially in regards to my eyes.</li>
            <li>right are with the eye gel all dried up</li>
            <li>After reading some of the other reviews, I was cautious on how much of this stuff to use at once.</li>
            <li>I give this product 4stars because I have spent a lot of money in the past trying to get that youthful appearance back around my eyes, but nothing I have tried has made me as satisfied as this product.</li>
            <li>I was really close to returning it, thinking it was empty, but finally it started coming out.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t take &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; photos, but I certainly feel that the gel is working to diminish the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this I have to admit I was a little discouraged in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Frustrating excpected to be able to use since my other eye cream is running out an wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was bigger, other than that it worked very well for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Helps to bring back the loss of tone and brings back that resiliance that I COMPLETELY took advantage of when I was in my teen years?</li>
            <li>One little pump was more than enough to cover under the eyes, up the side of the eyes and have a little left to smear over the forehead.</li>
            <li>I smell all the products I put on my skin before I do, mainly for perfumes because I have sensitive skin, and the gel actually smells slightly vegital.</li>
            <li>has really gone down since using this.</li>
            <li>Coming in an easy to pump container, this serum packs a mean punch!</li>
            <li>It onky rakes about 20-30 seconds for it to dry which I really liked because usually I have to wait a few minutes for eye cream/gel to set</li>
            <li>I apply it morning &amp; night and find it soaks in quickly with no icky residue left behind.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always careful what new products I use.</li>
            <li>My dark circles have also decreased, and it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I wasted several pumps of it the first couple times.  </li>
            <li>Not worth it bottle was half full.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have decreased, and my skin feels so moisturized.</li>
            <li>It really helps with puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say they have done much for the start of the little wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing.  </li>
            <li>Makes me wonder how much solution is in the little container.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so gentle that I can put a little on my upper lip while i&#x27;m at it.</li>
            <li>The bad part about this is it seems to absorb so fast it takes a lot more product than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It seemed to absorb quickly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very crisp clean fresh scent, sort of like cucumber</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very nice eye gel that I would definitely recommend for puffy eyes and fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It is definitely reducing the bags under my eyes and I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I could see a difference the very first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very refreshing and light unlike many of the perfumey smelling ones that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I love trying out new products</li>
            <li> I cannot give this anything less than a 5 star because I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> when you apply it, quick absorbed leaving the skin supple and plump.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this until the bottle is gone and probably buy more!</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning to wake up!  </li>
            <li> Who wants to have that?!?!</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that the cream smells slightly like cucumber, which reminds me of a nice spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES TAKE CARE OF FINE LINES AROUND THE EYE &amp; IT</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and light, but that is the only positive.  </li>
            <li> I really like Majestic Pure as a company and have enjoyed the products I received from them.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Plant Stem Cell Eye Gel from Majestic Pure for anyone who wants a great eye gel.</li>
            <li> The gel is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27; t seen a huge improvement, but I have been using it since a week ago!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, goes on smoothly and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> This is such an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am loving the products for anti-aging, especially this one!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it to my eye area I felt it was silky but quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Carefully designed Eye Gel Youth formula contains a innovative combination of ingredients for most favorable results.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Once absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural without uneccessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> so applying it first thing in the morning is ok too not thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> ’s supposed to be safe on all skin since I have sensitive skin I believe that.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far, too soon to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li> It applies nicely to around eyes, it is creamy yet just sticky enough.</li>
            <li> I did apply around my eyes for 3 days, I can say my eyes don&#x27;t look nearly as puffy but that can be because of many instances but will give product benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> this absorbed well and did not crumble.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m really enjoying using it....</li>
            <li> I love beauty products and i am always trying new stuff and Majestic product really amaze me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying the product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, as I&#x27;ve read some very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this eye gel because of the smell - it is fresh and clean and wonderful to place under your eyes when you are tired or just getting ready for the morning and waking up -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the ingredients &amp; surprisingly hopeful results of this eye gel product type 1</li>
            <li> I am glad that I was given the opportunity to review this gel at a special price and share my opinions as this products work wonders just like the company’s essential oils.</li>
            <li> While applying it just soaked right in and leaved no residue.</li>
            <li> dab the gel around my eyes and it soaks right in with no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I wish I could right a review in30dats not 10days as we have to do now.</li>
            <li> Seller notified me right away when product was shippped</li>
            <li> I am positive with continued use, they will be gone in no time!</li>
            <li> This makes magic because it helps lightens those dark circles and helps hydrate and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel incredibly soft after using and I ended up using my normal moisturizer afterwards , but I still liked it.  </li>
            <li> I like the Eye Gel as it goes on smooth, clear, no residual, no odor, and it feels lite and cool.</li>
            <li> Great little product!</li>
            <li> well this is so true about Majestic Pure eye gel.</li>
            <li> Since i put it first time on my skin, i started feel how it works, moreover i noticed a result almost from first steps using this product!</li>
            <li> This serum is light and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to try this product because upon opening it has a very pleasant smell, unlike some others that I have tried that truly have a very stinky odor.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can use it as a general wrinkle remover as well as around the eye.</li>
            <li> I felt misled by the picture but later realized that they blew it up that much to display its abundant ingredients.  </li>
            <li> a good job in helping removing black circles</li>
            <li> Also got it super fast.</li>
            <li> Since I do not use makeup, I utilize this product in the morning (it is suggested in the label to use at night), and I&#x27;ve noticed that a few minutes after application, my eyes look more refreshed, and I feel better prepared to start with my</li>
            <li> Super Lightweight and Absorbs Fast...</li>
            <li> Although I do not have many wrinkles, the few I did have seem to not be as prominent.</li>
            <li> I love when fun skin products come up for review, I don&#x27;t like spending a ton of money when you never know if it&#x27;s actually going to work or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for only a short time but it feels great on my under eye area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working good so far I&#x27;ve only had it for  about 8 days</li>
            <li> This eye gel from majestic pure does exactly as it says!</li>
            <li> coz you only need a small amount to apply to your skin to be able to get a great result.</li>
            <li> I like to use this at night as part of my moisturizing regimen (face wash, toner, vitamin C serum, THIS EYE GEL, light moisturizer, heavy moisturizer), but first I used it alone to see how I liked the texture.  </li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY MUCH @ ALL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best part is, I suddenly obtained a white bump on my right eyelid that was getting bigger, and</li>
            <li> The scent is a nice summer scent of cucumber which is great because it&#x27;s not overwhelming, the color is slightly cloudy but not a full on white color like others, it has great coverage and applies really easy.</li>
            <li> ; Majestic Pure Plant Stem Cell based EYE Cream Gel is the best anti aging Youth Formula based on natural ingredients designed for the delicate skin around your eyes to reverse the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> sure tell a different story.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and cannot wait for a long term effect.</li>
            <li> In the short time I&#x27;ve been given to use and review this product, I have not been able to tell a difference in my skin (on my face).</li>
            <li> #34;I love that it has the fix for EVERY under the eye issue one could possibly have!</li>
            <li> Hey, a girl can wish, can&#x27;t she? ;-)</li>
            <li> I based my FIRST order on the reviews of others.</li>
            <li> The eye gel was delivered in protective packaging and was exactly as described on product page.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is completely opaque, so there won&#x27;t be any issue with light deteriorating the ingredients (like Vitamin E) that degrade in</li>
            <li> but now they look much better, I have only used it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS EYE GEL!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it describes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using is for about a week and noticed the difference after the first couple of days</li>
            <li> I also love that they offer a money back guarantee, which is  a relief with this sort of product!</li>
            <li> It is likely that continued use will result in even better results.</li>
            <li> It looks lighter, tighter and overall much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can be seen immediately within the first week&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> And that was just the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying eye cream after eye gels I haven&#x27;t YET found anything that does EXACTLY what it says and beyond.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and really helps get rid of my crows feet!</li>
            <li> But this eye gel works really well!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see even more results in the next couple of days!</li>
            <li> The biggest difference I see is in both my crows feet and, most of all, the deep line that I used to have in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not so much since I started using this gel though!  </li>
            <li> and i recieved exactly when seller said it would be here.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer!</li>
            <li> I really like the eye gel!</li>
            <li> Love this product I will definitely use it again</li>
            <li> and it really works!  </li>
            <li> This eye gel by Majestic Pure is based on plant stem cells and contains many products such as Hyaluronic Acid and Matrixyl 3000 to help correct and prevent damage that show signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> It helps recapture a youthful appearance and can help fade dark circles under eyes and puffy eyes by draining excess fluids&amp;#34; - OK, I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packed full of  Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Peptide Complex, Botanical Extract, and Vitamin E - Powerful and Effective Youth Formula</li>
            <li> This is really a good eye gel (not cream) and has really helped to rid my eyes of dark circles and bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> good skin - but fine lines are beginning to show and even &amp;#34;gasp&amp;#34; - occasional puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals consistently delivers quality products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was light and easy to put under my eyes to help with the dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I have to give it five stars because it did pretty much what was claimed.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small tube with a pump top that dispenses the gel easily without too much coming out at once.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this product goes a very very long way, which I feel makes it a fantastic value!</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was bigger, but the easy application.</li>
            <li> The gel smooths on easily and, pleasantly absorbs quickly without leaving a residue, which I have found in other gels and makes it hard to apply makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eye Gel...</li>
            <li> I received this &amp;#34;Eye Gel Type I-Youth Formula&amp;#34; by: Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals to review on &amp; give my unbiased results....</li>
            <li> I use pure Witch Hazel as a wash before I apply this gel.  </li>
            <li> Then at night when I re-apply, I wash the day off with the pure witch-hazel again.  </li>
            <li> Majestic Pure eye gel was givin to me to try by my mother whom had INSISTED she had found the Fountain of Youth.</li>
            <li> Another hit from Majestic Pure, this eye gel has a permanent spot on my vanity.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Eye Gel Type I, Youth Formula, 0.5 fl.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin but that gel is very gentle on skin!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this around my eyes, on my forehead and on my cheeks for the last week and a half and my face feels great.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it so easy to control how much product you are using because you really only need one pump of this product to cover each eye.</li>
            <li> Like all of the other Majestic Pure products I have tried, this one has been nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> They are very high quality and well formulated.</li>

            <li> My eyes where very puffy all the time, I would not leave my house without makeup</li>
            <li> I was so hoping this would really help the aging process.</li>

            <li> Really does remove puffiness.  </li>

            <li> While I have not seen a great deal of eye area firming from this product, it IS fading the dark circles under my eyes that I have had as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Contains Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Peptide Complex, Botanical Extract, and Vitamin E - Powerful and Effective Youth Formula - Try Eye Gel Risk</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed the dark circles and bags weren&#x27;t as prominently defined.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now almost completely gone!!!  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Having tried numerous Majestic Pure items in the past I was happy to see they offer an eye gel.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients are more oriented towards immediate, temporary improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these product, I will not use any other eye gel anymore.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but none of them have worked so</li>
            <li> The quality is very high and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it was just like that pretty pink tone you get from a light workout  or dancing , ect.  </li>
            <li> The packaging of the eye gel is simple and easy to use, the pump is really controlled which is a good thing because a little goes and long way</li>
            <li> I am very excited to try other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Best of all, this little bottle goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a coupon code for this item and really am grateful to have used it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this Anti Aging Serum now for about 3 days and can already see Positive Results!!</li>
            <li> The thing i noticed the most difference in is the puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was only able to use this feel good, tightening eye gel for one day.</li>
            <li> However, after more than two weeks of using the Eye Gel 2X per day, I have seen no noticeable improvement to the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles look  better</li>
            <li> The deeper wrinkles looked the same, but there was a marked reduction in fine lines and my skin looked fresher and brighter around the eye</li>
            <li> The fine lines under my eyes are also starting to disappear (been applying this gel for two weeks so far).</li>
            <li> The slight herbal scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly and has an instant moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li> Works great so far, but the squirt lid was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of face creams and serums and gels, but none that had actual stem cell therapy.</li>
            <li> This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for all skin types looking&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> May not work for everyone, but I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> so It&#x27;s high time I take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Just got my majestic pure eye gel and so far Iove it.</li>
            <li> i love the dispenser, because all you want is a little amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the effects of the aging process.</li>
            <li> So far do not see much difference.  </li>
            <li> My mother is 66 years old and how the whole conversation came about</li>
            <li> I have oily skin normally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much difference this is making to my eye area, but I love the feel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slippery gel feel going on (aloe is the second ingredient), then a fresh cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any deep set wrinkles, but I am using this on my forehead and laugh line area as a preventative treatment.</li>
            <li> oh my goodness, did it feel good on my tired, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> This covers those dark circles right up!! 5</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick gel that hydrates well and leaves the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle right now.</li>
            <li> several days, I noticed that my entire eye area looked and felt firmer, and the fine lines at the corners were diminished.</li>
            <li> Putting it on the back of one hand resulted in immediately moister, smoother skin with fewer fine wrinkles as compared to the back of the untreated hand.</li>
            <li> did notice less puffiness and my fine lines are starting to be less visible, I&#x27;ve been using after my showers as is recommended to apply after cleansing with warm water.</li>
            <li> (i have a new baby at home) to reduce the puffiness and to almost awaken my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I forgot (the forgetfulness also comes with the sleep deprivation of having a new baby at home,</li>
            <li> But for now I keep trying new products like everyone else out there.</li>
            <li> This eye gel helps diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow’s feet, fine lines and sagginess.</li>
            <li> It lightlens dark circle around the eyes, demishes fine wrinkles, eye puffiness, and tones skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for slight puffiness and darkness under my eyes and It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Cell  Eye Cream is a multitasking powerhouse for Wrinkles, Dark Circles Fine Lines, Crows Feet and Puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So having it dry so quickly</li>
            <li> Light thin and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> But it did leave my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> And with it being all natural it hasn’t ruined my pillow case or towels or clothing!</li>
            <li> When I first applied it I noticed a tingling sensation and could actually feel it working on my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> goes  on smooth and saw an immediate improvement with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product in ingredients, scent, texture, and even bottle type as Aria Starr Beauty&#x27;s ultra youth eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First pic (the one on the viewers left) has no eye gel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review for this particular product, because with so many products on Amazon its hard to no what to use.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty unique as far as any eye gels I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> After using this I can see that this will go a long way as just the right amount of gel is pumped out.  </li>
            <li> I use 2 small pumps and the gel is smooth and my skin is reacting very well.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit I was very skeptical from the over the top reviews, but after a week my eyes are no longer puffy and wrinkles seem to be diminishing.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise the product seems to work well, my eyes feel hydrated and although I didn&#x27;t not have any dark circle or bags under my eyes to begin with, I think my skin looks better overall under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After my first use of this product WOW you could actually already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> received this at a small discount, but the review above expresses my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> First time user, got some ich initially, and been used about week, haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far...</li>
            <li> I am 4 years short of 80, and there are no wrinkles under my eyes, and the puffiness is going down more each time I use it.</li>
            <li> really like this product, and although I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every morning and can definitely seen an improvement.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure eye gel comes in a very tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure eye gel has been helping immensely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised only because I really wasn&#x27;t sold</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and will make this part of my routine.</li>
            <li> You will be greatly surprised at how far it will go.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a pump dispenser and is not runny so there is no waste .I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and felt smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> The product arrived early.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it dries it leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals or pesticides.</li>
            <li> is all natural.</li>
            <li> I can already see a difference in the areas around my eyes that are frequently puffy and swollen from stress and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and CLEAR, so it is not a cover-up.  </li>
            <li> THAT IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> It will last much longer than you imagine.</li>
            <li> The company was very gracious and helpful, a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give a full review but so far it&#x27;s working well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few days now and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> so far its moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> One pump was more than enough to use on my eyes and with a second pump I had enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li> It is completely non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It is soft and silky</li>
            <li> Wearing Sensitive Eyes...</li>
            <li> Of course, if you didn&#x27;t put your face in the sun to begin with all these years, you may not looks so old, ha ha.</li>
            <li> I know the under eye bags will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> The package looks ghetto and haven&#x27;t seen any result so far</li>
            <li> The gel does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin in any way.</li>
            <li> personally all I can really saw is try it</li>
            <li> The eye creme is lightly scented (not expert opinion, but reminds me of green tea).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rank this gel as excellent in terms of cosmetic effects.</li>
            <li> It has a very gentle scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry out or overhydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> just a tiny small amount - applied regularly will help my skin look even better than ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been there for a VERY long time and with the help of this eye gel, and the Majestic Pure oils (Argan, Rosehip and jojoba), it&#x27;s almost completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note that a little goes a long way, so use it very sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smooth and dries quickly so you don’t have sticky sitting on your face like some of the other eye gels I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling of the gel and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Within a week of regular use I&#x27;ve noticed renewed plumpness around my eyes, and a slight diminishing effect on the fine lines and wrinkles that have been taking hold.  </li>
            <li> This treatment is a gel formula and is just shy of total odorless, I smell a hint of cucumber like, it is super refreshing</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how much its working for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The first few days, I thought &amp;#34;this is ok&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t see the point of using it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the eye gel, but think there may have been an air bubble in the tube because it has only lasted for a few applications (20 single pumps?) and seems to have a lot of air when I pump it.  </li>
            <li> This feels nice and cool on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells to it like other creams.</li>
            <li> It works the same and I would highly recommend for people with aging wrinkles or people who want firmer skin around their eyes.</li>
            <li> A transparent serum, it glides on evenly and smoothly, requiring very little.</li>
            <li> When I noticed fine lines around my eyes, and deep lines in my forhead and between my eyebrows, I may have freaked out a little</li>
            <li> It advertises &amp;#34;stem cell therapy&amp;#34; not sure how accurate it is because of the lengthly experiments that goes into it.</li>
            <li> small and can easily fit on your purse...</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are still the same, and I believe I got a new one since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for something that can help me with my dark circles and right away you could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and it&#x27;s probably to late in life to expect wrinkle free eyes.</li>
            <li> I love that just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hope that with continued use I can slow the inevitable aging process just a bit so that maybe I&#x27;ll be carded for alcohol just once more.  </li>
            <li> This will make a perfect eye cream for the morning (I use crazy thick stuff at night because I am getting older *sigh)...</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to a lot of different products</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped tremendously in the mornings when I&#x27;ve had very little sleep</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it I was not impressed by how it made my eyes feel, but the next morning I felt better about the product.  </li>
            <li> When this procuct was offered to me during a promotional period I was skeptical but tried it out due to the great reviews I read on Amazon</li>
            <li> I noticed significant differences withing only a few days.</li>
            <li> I decided to use due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in mine.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin it can definitely be an issue.</li>
            <li> The Matrixyl 3000 helps to firm the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Innovative, Potent, anti aging cream - Eye Gel for Wrinkles, Dark Circles and Puffiness.</li>
            <li> I think I like the eye gel itself, my eyes look more refreshed, but the box the bottle was packaged in looked a bit home made and the pump was broken, which I tried fixing but couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> , what’s frustrating with these sorts of products is you won’t know it works until many years</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little tighter and firmer right away.  </li>
            <li> I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> I find it very strange that the ingredients are absolutely the same 1:1 as the ingredients in InstaNatural Eye Cream (19.95)&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> As a woman who recently turned 30&#x27;s I am very conscious of any wrinkles, lines or puffiness in my face; especially in regards to my eyes.</li>
            <li> right are with the eye gel all dried up</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was cautious on how much of this stuff to use at once.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4stars because I have spent a lot of money in the past trying to get that youthful appearance back around my eyes, but nothing I have tried has made me as satisfied as this product.</li>
            <li> I was really close to returning it, thinking it was empty, but finally it started coming out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; photos, but I certainly feel that the gel is working to diminish the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this I have to admit I was a little discouraged in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating excpected to be able to use since my other eye cream is running out an wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was bigger, other than that it worked very well for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Helps to bring back the loss of tone and brings back that resiliance that I COMPLETELY took advantage of when I was in my teen years?</li>
            <li> One little pump was more than enough to cover under the eyes, up the side of the eyes and have a little left to smear over the forehead.</li>
            <li> I smell all the products I put on my skin before I do, mainly for perfumes because I have sensitive skin, and the gel actually smells slightly vegital.</li>
            <li> has really gone down since using this.</li>
            <li> Coming in an easy to pump container, this serum packs a mean punch!</li>
            <li> It onky rakes about 20-30 seconds for it to dry which I really liked because usually I have to wait a few minutes for eye cream/gel to set</li>
            <li> I apply it morning &amp; night and find it soaks in quickly with no icky residue left behind.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always careful what new products I use.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have also decreased, and it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted several pumps of it the first couple times.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> My fine lines have decreased, and my skin feels so moisturized.</li>
            <li> It really helps with puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say they have done much for the start of the little wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing.  </li>
            <li> Makes me wonder how much solution is in the little container.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so gentle that I can put a little on my upper lip while i&#x27;m at it.</li>
            <li> The bad part about this is it seems to absorb so fast it takes a lot more product than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> and she is very pleased--she&#x27;s been using it as directed less than a week and says she notices the difference!</li>
            <li> A little squirt of the gel goes a long way and It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  </li>
            <li> Packed in a small pump top bottle you think to yourself this is too small to last very long.</li>
            <li> , shipping was quick, the item is also Cruelty free, the bottle is a little thin bottle but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It will last a while because just a tiny drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> tiny bit so this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> bottle is small and sleek and very well sealed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any real difference.</li>
            <li> This is far beyond your average puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used this product long enough</li>
            <li> Dark circles are less noticeable, bit naturally that won&#x27;t ever ho away completely.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using regularly now for about a week with my other daily skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the area around my eyes is really starting to look dry.</li>
            <li> There is no sheen which I love because my skin isn&#x27;t left looking greasy or feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and renewed with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how little the bottle was when I received it.</li>
            <li> oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how little the bottle is.  </li>
            <li> I have seen lesser of the puffiness under my eyes, fine lines on my forehead slowly disappearing &amp; those pucker lines on my lips slowly going away as well.</li>
            <li> It took maybe 3 days to start seeing improvement with my dark circles and about a week to see my general eye area improvement.</li>
            <li> I was hooked on the Philosophy eye cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with puffiness around my eyes although the puffiness is not completely gone</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not old</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that one pump goes a really long ways.  </li>
            <li> Have not  had it that long</li>
            <li> It seems good for the wrinkles, but it is almost impossible to get rid of dark circles!  </li>
            <li> Plant Stem Cells enhance its strength to protect against sun damage and other external factors while Hyaluronic Acid hydrates the skin and plumps it up with moisture.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days where soap, water, and a little powder would leave my fresh, youthful skin looking rested and radiant, despite the late nights college afforded.  </li>
            <li> Not in originally package, no seal what so ever, even pump was un twisted an gel was already through pump which anyone thats used a pump lotion it takes alot of pumps to start it out.</li>
            <li> any other topical product,</li>
            <li> You know those products that dry on your face and make your face feel like its cracking?</li>
            <li> When applied on dry skin, one pump covers the under-eye area of both eyes.  </li>
            <li> Did not live up to my to what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> So really dont think this is new and for this type of product its my face an its expensive for such a little bottle.</li>
            <li> I am only 27 and do not have kids yet, but the dark rings under my eyes</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for something to get rid of the dark patches and keep my eyes from being as poofy as they are.</li>
            <li> The old saying Dynamite comes in small packages</li>
            <li> Leaves my eyes so soft and firm!</li>
            <li> Since using the product, the puffiness under my eyes has reduced and the dark circles are starting to lighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that I can&#x27;t tell when the bottle is about to run out since its a pump</li>
            <li> On the third morning, I got up and noticed that my puffiness was down.</li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Skin around the eyes feels instantly smoother, moisturized and less puffy.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s super expensive</li>
            <li> the lotion does not seem to react poorly with her skin like other lotions and that is a good thing,the last time she done something crazy she looked like a fighter that lost.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> and I hate seeing my dark circle eyes or puffiness most especially when I didnt get enough sleep.</li>
            <li> As a single momma of twin autistic sons ... those are a constant.</li>
            <li> Despite the small size of the bottle, I can tell it&#x27;s going to last a long time since a single pump is sufficient for a generous application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice that the puffiness under my eyes have subsided a little after only using this product 2 times a day for 3 days now.</li>
            <li> you only need a little to cover the eye area.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really working for me jet.</li>
            <li> The gel fill like sitting on my skin not absorbing in to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about 1-2wks and noticed a difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> Results took a few days and you can actually see the difference, so not even a week in</li>
            <li> daily either alone or under makeup, being gel isnt heavy so its also go well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Now get to waste my time returning an open product yet again.</li>
            <li> This item hydrates and firm the skin for younger looking eyes.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> It has been only a few days</li>
            <li> I’ve only had it for a few days but no irritation.</li>
            <li> Will review it again when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I got the Dead Sea mud mask from the same company</li>
            <li> Although I do not have wrinkles under my eyes, I do have tired looking eyes because I don’t get much sleep.</li>
            <li> Like others commented on the size of the container this came in, I too thought this was not much.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles were only slightly diminished but the puffiness was gone in minutes.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is really small, so I was worried how long it would last – a little bit goes a REALLY long ways</li>
            <li> I have used others before and even sensitive formulas like proactive give a burning sensation and leave my skin raw and burned after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I have insane dark circles and found another product that is doing a great job</li>
            <li> My under eye area has felt a bit smoother and has been less dry</li>
            <li> to my surprise this little bottle is going to go a LONG WAY, it takes the tiniest drop at each use.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with the product.</li>
            <li> little of it goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So in saying that, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick(ish) like a gel, but slippery like a serum and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I never use anything on my face other than soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to continued use as I am inspired by other reviewers longer use.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my makeup and my youthful appearance in the past week.</li>
            <li> and i use it on other places on my face which it is helping</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of eye serum and non worked until this.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount so hopefully this small pump will last awhile.</li>
            <li> formula is extremely airy, so you only need a small pump to apply on both eyes.</li>
            <li> A small dab is all you need, well unless you want to use it on your entire face which you also can.</li>
            <li> It will either work or it will be like every other product I have tried and it will be thrown in a drawer to collect dust.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t such a small container I would use it on my forehead too...</li>
            <li> ; When u yourself notice a difference and when OTHER people notice a difference is a total different ball game.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and a half and have noticed absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite small, but you only need one small pump, as a little goes a long way with this gel.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles is getting lighter after using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the dark circles in my eyes have also had a reduction.  </li>

            <li> I experience waking up with pimple in the morning with other products!</li>
            <li> Also, there was some tingling but subsided after a minute other than that I like it and a little goes</li>

            <li> It has a slight cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it a really small bottle but so plain!  </li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel oily after using, no bad smell, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is an anomaly or just not much in each bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very faint smell, smells like a faintly fresh cut cucumber.</li>

            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have pretty bad dark circles under my eyes due to a lack of sleep and long 16 hour shifts.</li>
            <li> This is really thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and often wake up with dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My mom has already tired and is ordering, it is amazing and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It actually tightened the area under my eyes and slightly decreased the dark circles.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days there was a slight improvement in the color around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try because I didn&#x27;t want to break out or anything from not ever using anything on my face.</li>
            <li> Allow me to do a little copy and paste,*HYDRATES AND FIRMS SKIN:</li>
            <li> It looks like an opaque gel, and feels a little like a lotion.</li>
            <li> The dark circles in my eyes are decreasing and now I wish I would have taken before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> And even the dark circles under my eyes start to disappear!</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a punch.</li>
            <li> I used just a little bit under my eyes and to feel it working.</li>
            <li> seems to help a little for the sag under my eyes</li>
            <li> It stings a little for a minute if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It appeared to tighten the skin a little and reduce the eye bags a little.</li>
            <li> ive noticed increased puffiness around my eyes a a little bit of what I call saggy undereye skin.</li>
            <li> It automatically got rid of my dark eye circles I have had for years!</li>
            <li> However, i am starting to see a difference, no more puffy eyes!!</li>
            <li> A few days after she began using it, she reported it&#x27;s working well.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for an eye gel without harsh chemicals and toxin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my fingertips and smoothed it under my eyes and around my eyes and lids the rest of my face</li>
            <li> Smells like plants and as soon as it goes on, it feels firm.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this to a few friends and family.</li>
            <li> This product helps get read of those bags I have under my eyes everyday when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a few days</li>
            <li> My skin immediately feels silkier after each application and appears visibly smoother and firmer after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The blackness around my eyes was decreased and the crows feet around my eyes were smaller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I noticed a difference after it dried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or greasy, nor does it feel like it&#x27;s dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Skin does not feel sticky after the gel has dried fully; until then there is a texture you can feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottle although it took me a few pumps to get it going.</li>
            <li> so you don’t have any wasted gel on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Did my application during the night time and woke up with reduced puffiness and you can tell that it had slightly firmed my skin!</li>
            <li> and I used a very small amount every day after I shower and at night after I wash my face and the  bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results, but I have only been using it a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different eye gel products for my tired eyes, my problem is excessive under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does not have a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> 4th day using it and my dark circles are gone by 50% at least.</li>
            <li> I have been using this just over a week and the dark circles under my eyes are fading and the poofy stuff around my eyes is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> My under  eye area does appear a little firmer!</li>
            <li> Very little needed.</li>
            <li> The bottle is rather small (that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars).</li>
            <li> I squirted some out on my skin and it has a white creamy texture with a faint scent of cucumber.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how small the bottle was!</li>
            <li> Well, not sure how the product works because the pump does not work.</li>
            <li> This eye gel comes in a small bottle but it works well</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle with a pump .</li>
            <li> Not sure if all reviews are legitimate on here.</li>
            <li> (sorry about spelling ) above  and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference no more saggy baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful because you&#x27;ll become addicted to the stuff.</li>
            <li> I already see a difference in just the few days I&#x27;ve gotten it!</li>
            <li> Also hoped it would help with the small lip lines I have - it hasn&#x27;t - I will finish what I have - but will NOT reorder.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle but the measured pump helps with the conservation.</li>
            <li> I found that, though the bottle is small compared to some eye treatments, one pump is all you need per application.</li>
            <li> Usually eye gels kinda get filmy and then crumbly/flakey over the course of the day, but</li>
            <li> Even other people thought I didn&#x27;t look as tired as usual.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, and it&#x27;s thick!!!</li>
            <li> this is not a toy or a common usual product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eye area hard or paper feeling.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and bad allergies</li>
            <li> /&gt;They can claim all kinds of crazy stuff, include big words of which some maybe made up, but the truth is in the product always!.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my puffiness AND dark circles (which aren&#x27;t terrible but do exist) disappeared before my very eyes as soon as I put this on!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base and gently pat my eye cream over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying, the eyes feel a bit cooler, and symptoms of morning tiredness slowly fade.</li>
            <li> but in the mean time try it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s base of ingredients is all natural</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I was disappointed how small the bottle was and from there on I had a bad attitude about it.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick.</li>
            <li> i tired it yesterday and today.</li>
            <li> My eyes always look tired with darkness underneath.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I have seen a difference in my eye are since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>

            <li> Not impressed!  </li>
            <li> she is not standing over my shoulder), I am just skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was wary that an eye cream would work, but when I was given this opportunity to review for a reduced price I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It at very least does not make things worse - and some things I have tried do !!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> I always looked like I had two black eyes and hated caking concealer under my eyes to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I do not smoke so, the lines aren&#x27;t as bad as we think they are...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a bad smell or leave a residue.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not into makeups, creams and those sort of things, but my dear wife is, so when she saw this Eye Gel, she couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  A few days after she began using it, she reported it&#x27;s working well.  I see her every day, so I can&#x27;t tell the difference myself.  Being a skeptic, I asked to see her before and after photos, but she didn&#x27;t have any, so I can&#x27;t offer any photo evidence.  She still looks beautiful to me and she credits the eye cream, so that&#x27;s all that counts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks already I purchased Eye Gel! And i love it! Since i put it first time on my skin, i started feel how it works, moreover i noticed a result almost from first steps using this product! My husband and friends noticed changes too!! Skin around my eyes looks much better!! I feel great! Will purchase again for sure! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> loved the way it felt.  would use again</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love this product. Definitely will purchase this again. My face feels so refreshed after I put this on. NOT GREASY... That is what I was concerned about, but not with this product. My face didn&#x27;t feel oily after using, no bad smell, nothing bad to say. I feel like I just got out of the shower, that is how refreshed my face feels. I am blown away by it. I never use anything on my face other than soap and water. I was a little nervous to try because I didn&#x27;t want to break out or anything from not ever using anything on my face. I definitely didn&#x27;t break out and I use it in the morning and at night. I use all over my face too. I also have no problems putting my makeup on after. So ladies, don&#x27;t worry about that. It does not make you feel or look oily so no worries about shiney greasy faces!!!!! I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am loving the products for anti-aging, especially this one!  As soon as I applied it to my eye area I felt it was silky but quickly absorbed.  The slight herbal scent is lovely.  I am looking forward to continued use as I am inspired by other reviewers longer use.  Stem cell therapy, hyaluronic and amino acids, Vitamin E, and more make this a product that is sure to deliver for me as it has for many others. Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals consistently delivers quality products.</li>
            <li> I am only 27 and do not have kids yet, but the dark rings under my eyes sure tell a different story. I am constantly looking for something to get rid of the dark patches and keep my eyes from being as poofy as they are. This eye gel from majestic pure does exactly as it says! The bottle is really small, so I was worried how long it would last – a little bit goes a REALLY long ways and I do not even need a full pump to do both of my eyes! This little bottle will last me a very long time! I have been using this just over a week and the dark circles under my eyes are fading and the poofy stuff around my eyes is slowly going away. I will definitely keep using this until the bottle is gone and probably buy more! I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! I  really like my eye gel,it goes on smoothly and my skin around my eyes definitely feel nice and healthy.I believe it is helping with the puffiness,hopefully with continues use it will become a must have item.So glad to have tried it.I was lucky enough to receive a coupon code for this item and really am grateful to have used it.</li>
            <li> This eye gel helps diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow’s feet, fine lines and sagginess. I like that it can be used as an all-over face treatment to restore radiant skin and prevent premature aging. The eye gel being plant based is also a definite plus! Very easy to use and does not have a nasty smell. And with it being all natural it hasn’t ruined my pillow case or towels or clothing!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 30 days. I am 50 and have fine lines around my eyes. It definitely helped reduce the lines! Easy to apply. No unpleasant smell! Very little needed.</li>
            <li> This product is so good. I love how it makes me feel. It came well packaged and works just as described. Time to buy some more. :) Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant scent much like cucumber.  Feels nice and is cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This anti aging eye gel is awesome! It keeps my eyes area hydrated, smooth, and healthy looking. The gel is light and absorb fast. My dark circles is getting lighter after using it. Love it. Will recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using regularly now for about a week with my other daily skin regimen.  So far, it has helped tremendously in the mornings when I&#x27;ve had very little sleep (i have a new baby at home) to reduce the puffiness and to almost awaken my eyes.  I noticed that the dark circles in my eyes have also had a reduction.  I wish I took a before and a 5 day after picture so you can see for yourself but I forgot (the forgetfulness also comes with the sleep deprivation of having a new baby at home, lol) I will definitely continue to use and I will repurchase once the eye gel runs outs.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel!!! Getting to place another order for this. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this! I noticed significant differences withing only a few days. My dark circles are GONE (I&#x27;ve had them for YEARS), and my skin is smoother with much better tone than ever before. A fantastic product and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I will say that i used this after my Mask on Saturday night and each night thereafter to see if there was a difference. The thing i noticed the most difference in is the puffiness and dark circles. As a single momma of twin autistic sons ... those are a constant. I am gonna keep using it!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Its smell is pleasent and the composition light. It appears to work well per the instructions.</li>
            <li> eye gel cream is pretty good. smells like earth. i tired it yesterday and today. my skin under my eyes looks more hydrated. i love that, will keep using it to see more results . i love the dispenser, because all you want is a little amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received  this product  as a discount  for an honest  review</li>
            <li> I really like it. Skin around the eyes feels instantly smoother, moisturized and less puffy. I have a sensitive skin but that gel is very gentle on skin!  I like the pump design. The bottle is rather small (that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars). Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and cannot wait for a long term effect.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review with a very generous discount. In the short time I&#x27;ve been given to use and review this product, I have not been able to tell a difference in my skin (on my face). To me this product does not have a pleasant smell, that is one thing that I would like to see changed. But it did leave my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I find it very strange that the ingredients are absolutely the same 1:1 as the ingredients in InstaNatural Eye Cream (19.95)&lt;br /&gt;Who copied who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Matrixyl 3000, Palmitoyl Triepeptide-3, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Plant Stem Cells, Cucumber Hydrosol, Organic Jojoba Oil, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Silk Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, L’Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Wildcrafted Vinca Major (Periwinkle), Organic Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice), Wildcrafted Euphrasia Officinalis (Eye Bright), Wildcrafted Ganoderma Lucidum (Reishi), Organic Gotu Kola, Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin</li>
            <li> Love this - the best ever !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Received this product at a reduced rate however all opinions are my own and non biased.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this product in the mail, and even though it says it&#x27;s a night cream, I opened it up and put it on. Patience has NEVER been a virtue I carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so this bottle look and is tiny! But after using the pump on my finger, I see WHY it doesn&#x27;t need to be ANY bigger for it&#x27;s price. A little goes a LONG way, and it&#x27;s thick!!! I pumped twice and I was able to get under both of my eyes and on my cheeks. One pump of this stuff next time will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the product description before I purchased it and before I put it on my face... Allow me to do a little copy and paste,*HYDRATES AND FIRMS SKIN: Keeps eye area hydrated &amp; healthy looking. Carefully designed Eye Gel Youth formula contains a innovative combination of ingredients for most favorable results. Plant Stem Cells enhance its strength to protect against sun damage and other external factors while Hyaluronic Acid hydrates the skin and plumps it up with moisture. The Matrixyl 3000 helps to firm the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Innovative, Potent, anti aging cream - Eye Gel for Wrinkles, Dark Circles and Puffiness. From Plant Stem Cells to Multiple Complex Peptide blends, from botanically derived Hyaluronic Acid Spheres to fiber and cellular rebuilding Amino Acids, collagen boosting and skin firming and wrinkle repairing ingredients are fully loaded into this genius formula.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO way I would have been able to say all of that the way they did, my words are more like, &amp;#34;I love that it has the fix for EVERY under the eye issue one could possibly have! Dark circles? Check. Helps to bring back the loss of tone and brings back that resiliance that I COMPLETELY took advantage of when I was in my teen years? Check.Gets rif of the puffy eyes? Check!!! There is NOTHING that I dislike about this eye gel!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle was small, but only a small amount and it cover both of my eyes. From what i read in some of comment it said  it irritated their eyes and other said it works for them. But for me, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes though. I guess is different for each and every person. There hasn&#x27;t been any result yet because is my second day using this. But i will keep this post update.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the effects of the aging process. I have oily skin normally but I have noticed that the area around my eyes is really starting to look dry. I love trying out new products and I was happy to buy this Eye Gel Type 1 from Majestic Pure at a promotional price and be able to share my honest experience with it here with you. The item arrived quickly and undamaged. I squirted some out on my skin and it has a white creamy texture with a faint scent of cucumber. I love that this product comes with a pump. The pump makes it so easy to control how much product you are using because you really only need one pump of this product to cover each eye. The product on feels very cooling and soothing. It did not bother my eyes at all or make them water. I did notice that the puffiness under my eyes have subsided a little after only using this product 2 times a day for 3 days now.</li>
            <li> So far do not see much difference.  Do not have dark circles, but do have puffy under eyes.  Still using it, so maybe it will change.</li>
            <li> Received yesterday! I was a little worried about how small the bottle was! I used two pumps which was too much. This is really thick and a little goes a long way. I have used it twice so far and will make this part of my routine. I feel like the skin around my eyes are tighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 weeks, cannot tell a difference yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 4 days.  It&#x27;s ok, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  It seems good for the wrinkles, but it is almost impossible to get rid of dark circles!  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I see somewhat of an improvement, but not much with the dark circles.  I&#x27;ll keep on using it though, and I&#x27;ll see what happens after 2 weeks and then a month of using this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say it is a great eye gel tho in my case it&#x27;s not really working for me jet. Don&#x27;t see much difference on my eye, but I give some more time. The gel fill like sitting on my skin not absorbing in to my skin. But i do like the temporary effect the eye gel provide.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eye Gel...to my surprise this little bottle is going to go a LONG WAY, it takes the tiniest drop at each use.  You will be greatly surprised at how far it will go.  I was very anxious to try this product because upon opening it has a very pleasant smell, unlike some others that I have tried that truly have a very stinky odor.  It worked and within a couple of days I noticed a huge difference, I no longer had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes like I hadn&#x27;t slept in days.  When I first applied it I noticed a tingling sensation and could actually feel it working on my wrinkles.  There is no doubt in my mind that this amazing product should get all of the 5 stars that I can give in this review.  I would give more if I could.  I recommend this product and will be buying more of it.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for over 10 days and haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> This eye gel works great! It really helps with puffiness and dark circles! I am really surprised how great this is! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel! It smells great-- very fresh, like cucumber-melon, maybe? It is non-irritating, and you only need a bit.  It dries great, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue at all.  You know those products that dry on your face and make your face feel like its cracking? This isn&#x27;t one of those products.  It is definitely reducing the bags under my eyes and I am very satisfied with this product.  It&#x27;s a great value and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy since using product. Definitely leaves my face soft. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny, but a little goes a long way.  A drop will take care of both eyes.  It looks like an opaque gel, and feels a little like a lotion. It has a slight oily-ness (the vitamin E, perhaps?) but it absorbs quickly and has an instant moisturizing effect.  Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Love love love the scent - like fresh cucumbers - I look forward to using this eye gel because of the smell - it is fresh and clean and wonderful to place under your eyes when you are tired or just getting ready for the morning and waking up -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this gel my eyes feel and look more awake and alert with this gel - great item for any skin type and for any age -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with eyes needs this eye get - love this scent did I mention that?</li>
            <li> I received this &amp;#34;Eye Gel Type I-Youth Formula&amp;#34; by: Majestic Pure Cosmeceuticals to review on &amp; give my unbiased results....I have only been using this Anti Aging Serum now for about 3 days and can already see Positive Results!! This serum is light and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin. It is virtually odor free (clean, fresh scent), and feel so good on my skin! I love that just a small amount goes a long way. I use this as a Morning  &amp; Night Serum, I just use a Pea Size amount &amp; it covers my whole face. I those 3 days I have seen lesser of the puffiness under my eyes, fine lines on my forehead slowly disappearing &amp; those pucker lines on my lips slowly going away as well. **I do not smoke so, the lines aren&#x27;t as bad as we think they are...LOL!!**</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see much difference, but I continue to use it. It sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> As I have entered into my mind-30&#x27;s, I have begun to notice the ravages of time as never before.  Gone are the days where soap, water, and a little powder would leave my fresh, youthful skin looking rested and radiant, despite the late nights college afforded.  I received this firming eye gel in hopes that I could attack the crow&#x27;s feet becoming more and more apparent as father time marches on.  Within a week of regular use I&#x27;ve noticed renewed plumpness around my eyes, and a slight diminishing effect on the fine lines and wrinkles that have been taking hold.  I hope that with continued use I can slow the inevitable aging process just a bit so that maybe I&#x27;ll be carded for alcohol just once more.  Hey, a girl can wish, can&#x27;t she? ;-)</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have pretty bad dark circles under my eyes due to a lack of sleep and long 16 hour shifts. I have been looking for an eye gel without harsh chemicals and toxin becuase my skin is very senstive and I hate putting random crap on my face. When this procuct was offered to me during a promotional period I was skeptical but tried it out due to the great reviews I read on Amazon and now I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small and sleek and very well sealed. I was not expecting the gel to smell so great! It has a cucumber like scent and feels very cool under my eyes. After a week of using this gel, my eyes felt great. The dark circles in my eyes are decreasing and now I wish I would have taken before and after pictures! I absolutely love then gel and have shared it with two of my close friends and both of them said their results are great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel is simply amazing. My skin feels tight and renewed with all natural ingredients. Stem cell therapy and vitamin E are some of my favorite ingredients and this gel has them both. I use 2 small pumps and the gel is smooth and my skin is reacting very well. I am very excited to see more results!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t have puffy eyes or dark circles under my eyes. I just wanted something to help with the crows feet. This stuff makes my eyes look radiant. I&#x27;ve only been using for about 1-2wks and noticed a difference within a few days. I will never try to find something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; because this is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
            <li> works amazingly great!</li>
            <li> Well, not sure how the product works because the pump does not work. I had to pull the top off and apply with my finger tip. IF I order this product again, the box better not be opened and there better be written instructions for application unless one considers those on the reverse of the bottle, which are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to read them.  I based my FIRST order on the reviews of others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good eye cream or treatment for awhile and I was offered this Majestic at a great deal to share my honest opinion. This treatment is a gel formula and is just shy of total odorless, I smell a hint of cucumber like, it is super refreshing when you apply it, quick absorbed leaving the skin supple and plump. Comes with a pump dispenser and is not runny so there is no waste .I did notice less puffiness and my fine lines are starting to be less visible, I&#x27;ve been using after my showers as is recommended to apply after cleansing with warm water. Have to say this is a potent treatment and is doing me good!</li>
            <li> This eye gel glides on easily. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and has a pleasant scent. It will last a while because just a tiny drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Give 5 min and go back to mirror</li>
            <li> This is amazing eye gel. I bought it for myself but my mom took it from me cause she loved it so much. So ill be buying more. Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different eye gel products for my tired eyes, my problem is excessive under eye puffiness. This is a nice thick gel that hydrates well and leaves the skin around my eyes very soft. It does well reducing the puffiness and fine wrinkles around my eyes. A little squirt of the gel goes a long way and It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.  Overall this is a very nice eye gel that I would definitely recommend for puffy eyes and fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Somewhat of a miracle product.  I decided to wait to use this product for close to a month before reviewing, because the proof will be in use, not initial impressions.  While I have not seen a great deal of eye area firming from this product, it IS fading the dark circles under my eyes that I have had as long as I can remember.  I always looked like I had two black eyes and hated caking concealer under my eyes to get rid of it.  The black/purple circles under my eyes have faded dramatically and are almost gone.  I&#x27;ve just got a bit toward the inner corner of my eye after using this product for about three weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product for puffiness and improving texture around the eyes. It didn&#x27;t break me out yet. No irritation either. While applying it just soaked right in and leaved no residue. I use mostly at night time before going bed. I sometimes use daytime underneath make-up. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! It works fast. Comes in an easy pump bottle. It has worked wonders on my darkness and puffiness under eyes. I&#x27;m impressed. It has even started working on the fine lines. Can&#x27;t wait for more results. Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> This eye gel comes in a small bottle but it works well coz you only need a small amount to apply to your skin to be able to get a great result. Apply it after washing your face and it absorbs nicely to your skin. I didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and felt smooth and firm. I&#x27;m just using it for a few days and I can already see the improvement on my skin. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I have seen a difference in my eye are since I&#x27;ve been using it. I just dab this eye gel all along my under eye area and im noticing that my wrinkles are starting to look smaller, not as deep. I love the way this eye gel smells! I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what the scent it, but I definitely love it!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how little the bottle was when I received it.The old saying Dynamite comes in small packages well this is so true about Majestic Pure eye gel.It has Hyaluronic Acid and Matrixyl 300 which helps correct and prevent damage. It comes in a small bottle with a pump . It has a light scent and it&#x27;s a gel with a smooth texture. I put a few drops on my fingertips and smoothed it under my eyes and around my eyes and lids the rest of my face and  It went on cool and refreshing and absorbes quickly.I have noticed within a week my lines looked smoother and fuller and my eye area looks so much smoother and brighter. I love it! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this and have been using it for about a week. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but I&#x27;ve seen a difference already.The product makes your skin feel tight while still being silky. It also helped my makeup look better! I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my makeup and my youthful appearance in the past week. There is no way anyone could be disappointed with this!</li>
            <li> this product i got discounted, and i used it with and it gives a good result..I like this product .heres more feedback for this product , I have a best result now. thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27; t seen a huge improvement, but I have been using it since a week ago! However, i am starting to see a difference, no more puffy eyes!! Can&#x27;t wait to see how my eyes will look like within a month...or two!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Works great so far, but the squirt lid was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with the product. I only use the slightest bit and it works wonders under my eyes. My fine lines have decreased, and my skin feels so moisturized. My dark circles have also decreased, and it feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> The eye gel was delivered in protective packaging and was exactly as described on product page.  We purchased the gel in a promotion for testing and review.  I have been searching for an eye gel that would work on the dark circles under my eyes.  The bottle is quite small, but you only need one small pump, as a little goes a long way with this gel.  I didn&#x27;t take &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; photos, but I certainly feel that the gel is working to diminish the dark circles.  I was happy to see that advertised sale price is so reasonable, because I will likely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of face creams and serums and gels, but none that had actual stem cell therapy. So when I was offered this Youth Formula Eye Gel from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I have been using this around my eyes, on my forehead and on my cheeks for the last week and a half and my face feels great. I love that I can put this Eye Gel on and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin making it break out. I also noticed less puffiness under my eyes. I definitely recommend this Plant Stem Cell Eye Gel from Majestic Pure for anyone who wants a great eye gel.</li>
            <li> I think  it is working, need to use it longer and i use it on other places on my face which it is helping</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> This product is well worth anything the seller ask!! I can really tell the difference around my eyes since using this product.  Just a dab will do you.  I love this product. Just ordered more!! The product arrived early.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for couple of weeks. It&#x27;s creamy, goes on smoothly and absorbs fast. My undeeye area feels tight after applying it. Happy about the purchase.</li>
            <li> Looks good. Will have to see if it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much difference this is making to my eye area, but I love the feel.  Non-greasy and non-irritating.  I use it after my moisturizer and it looks good with, or without make-up.  I added it to my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products and i am always trying new stuff and Majestic product really amaze me! I love this eye gel cream. I applied it at night and my skin felt rejuvenated in the next morning. When i look in the mirror it felt like i have a bottox. Lol but yea i cant compose a word to review this product. I love it and it works really good on my skin. My skin is so sensitive and i have been trying a lot of stuff. I experience waking up with pimple in the morning with other products! But this one rocks! :) Thank youuuuuu</li>
            <li> Smells like plants and as soon as it goes on, it feels firm.  I like Yalmeh brand also because it is also huge.  But this one, you just need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel! I got this product in exchange of an honest and fair review!&lt;br /&gt;My experience:  Smells great, good feeling for my skin, skin stays refreshed all day long! And even the dark circles under my eyes start to disappear! I couldn&#x27;t expect more! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Not worth it bottle was half full. Lasted for 4 applications</li>
            <li> Never purchased wanted to see if anyone can post reviews that never bougth.Not sure if all reviews are legitimate on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  really enjoying this eye gel. It goes on smoothly and is nice and light, not heavy or globby. It&#x27;s not sticky, greasy or tacky like a lot eye products tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very crisp clean fresh scent, sort of like cucumber melon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of it goes a long way so the bottle should last you awhile. It onky rakes about 20-30 seconds for it to dry which I really liked because usually I have to wait a few minutes for eye cream/gel to set so I can apply my makeup. So having it dry so quickly a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dries it leaves your skin feeling silky and soft. It helped fill in my fine lines and crepe-iness (sorry about spelling ) above  and under my eyes. It reduced the puffiness I had under my eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;It has a cooling and refreshing feeling and didn&#x27;t  burn under my eyes. Most eye products tend to burn or even sting under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to let my mom try it now. She&#x27;s always in search of an eye treatment to help with her lines and bags.. I would never let her try something I didn&#x27;t think was of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to have been chosen to review this product for a promotional price and give my honest opinion. I hope my review has been helpful to you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. In a week or so the difference is crazy ! I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle right now.</li>
            <li> I just bought this again because I love everything about it. I love the feeling of the gel and a little goes a long way. I can smell the cucumber and it feels just as refreshing. I put it under my eyes, and on my eyelid and across my lip line. I notice a huge difference. I am 4 years short of 80, and there are no wrinkles under my eyes, and the puffiness is going down more each time I use it.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit I was very skeptical from the over the top reviews, but after a week my eyes are no longer puffy and wrinkles seem to be diminishing.  Best part is, I suddenly obtained a white bump on my right eyelid that was getting bigger, and it&#x27;s now almost completely gone!!!  Am thrilled about that.  Dark circles are less noticeable, bit naturally that won&#x27;t ever ho away completely.   I do recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review for this particular product, because with so many products on Amazon its hard to no what to use.  I have been using this for about 2 weeks.  I really can&#x27;t believe how much its working for my dark circles.  I have noticed with age I have these horrible dark circles under my eyes that make me look terrible.  Well I bought this to see how it would do.  My eyes look brighter and the dark circles are gone.  I can&#x27;t say they have done much for the start of the little wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing.  I will say if you have dark circles give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I swear by pumps for dispensing my pricier products (like foundations, serums, etc.) because it keeps the packaging neat and keeps me from using too much product.  So I am so thankful that they have a pump included.  In addition to the reasons I specified above, this keeps air from interacting with the ingredients, which keeps them fresher longer.  Also, the bottle is completely opaque, so there won&#x27;t be any issue with light deteriorating the ingredients (like Vitamin E) that degrade in light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this gel is like a cross between Neosporin and aloe vera gel. I like to use this at night as part of my moisturizing regimen (face wash, toner, vitamin C serum, THIS EYE GEL, light moisturizer, heavy moisturizer), but first I used it alone to see how I liked the texture.  When applied on dry skin, one pump covers the under-eye area of both eyes.  If you apply this to a damp/wet face, one pump can cover the whole face.  Once absorbed, it leaves the skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy.  I love this product and will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: organic herbal infusion, organic aloe barbadensis (aloe) leaf, matrixyl 3000, palmitoyl tripeptide-3, kosher vegetable glycerin, globularia cordifolia callus culture extract (plant stem cells), cucumis sattivus (cucumber hydrosol), organic simmondsis chinensis (jojoba oil), cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, silk amino acid blend (sodium L-pyrrolidone carbocylate, sodium lactate, L-Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidonecarbocylid Acid, glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), wildcrafted vinica major (periwinkle), organic glycynthiza glabra (licorice), wildcrafted euphrasia officinalis (eye bright), wildcrafted ganoderma lucidum (reishi), organic centella asiatica (gotu kola), boswellia serrate (frankincense), tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin.cense), tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin.</li>
            <li> Just received the product put it on immediately within 3 to 4 minutes I could see a difference no more saggy baggy eyes. There&#x27;s no harsh chemicals or pesticides. It&#x27;s a youth formula. It doesn&#x27;t make your eyes feel gritty.</li>
            <li> Have not found an eye gel or cream that will make those lines disappear, but this gel helps more than most that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations, it&#x27;s light and clog pores, decreases puffiness and easy to use, no fragrance and not oily</li>
            <li> Good gel, I tried it, but I prefer cream. Gel is not for me.</li>
            <li> I love it. Goes on smoothly and makes my eye area look terrific!</li>
            <li> I have been trying different product to help around my eyes. My skin is very sensitive to a lot of different products and I had no problem with this product. A little goes a long way. This product is very thick. After a few days I really saw a difference. I have recommended this to a few friends and family. I love that is is all natural.</li>
            <li> This product helps get read of those bags I have under my eyes everyday when I wake up.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to arrive due to the awesome reviews and it hasn&#x27;t let me down. The packaging of the eye gel is simple and easy to use, the pump is really controlled which is a good thing because a little goes and long way so you definitely don&#x27;t want a pump that allows too much because it could go to waste. The scent is a nice summer scent of cucumber which is great because it&#x27;s not overwhelming, the color is slightly cloudy but not a full on white color like others, it has great coverage and applies really easy. Results took a few days and you can actually see the difference, so not even a week in and I&#x27;m seeing good results from every night usage.</li>
            <li> I think I like the eye gel itself, my eyes look more refreshed, but the box the bottle was packaged in looked a bit home made and the pump was broken, which I tried fixing but couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m having to dip mufti get in the bottle to use it which is not optimal. But otherwise the product seems to work well, my eyes feel hydrated and although I didn&#x27;t not have any dark circle or bags under my eyes to begin with, I think my skin looks better overall under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worked liked they stated.</li>
            <li> i use a lot of eye gel products but this one is the best so far. this is an eye gel on the go...small and can easily fit on your purse...I think its a good gift too sine its very helpful and effective :)</li>
            <li> Was not expecting this to work so good. Tightens skin around the eye area as soon as applied. Very impressed! Will order again!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law who is always worried about the lines around her eyes. She liked it because it lessened the lines and puffiness under her eyes, but it did not reduce the darkness. It didn&#x27;t have a bad smell or leave a residue. The best part is the money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Not a lot in container and there seems to be  a lot of air.  Product kind of spits out.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my mother as a gift, and in four days her capillaries under her eyes reduced. This stuff is continuing to work, and is definitely well-worth the purchase! I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a few days since I got this eye gel and I have not noticed any change and I used a very small amount every day after I shower and at night after I wash my face and the  bottle is empty I don&#x27;t think it was even a quarder full when I got it 😢</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c58a313cd8e4fa221ee5cb299a9dab3b]] Like all of the other Majestic Pure products I have tried, this one has been nothing short of amazing! I can already see a difference in the areas around my eyes that are frequently puffy and swollen from stress and lack of sleep. After using this product for around a week, I have experienced very nice results! No longer are they as puffy and swollen! I have noticed that this product goes a very very long way, which I feel makes it a fantastic value! I highly recommend it to those wanting to eliminate the puffiness and firm/tighten up the area around your eyes and forehead! I am so glad I received this product on promotion and was given the opportunity to rid myself of the puff and share my thoughts with you!</li>
            <li> This eye gel by Majestic Pure is based on plant stem cells and contains many products such as Hyaluronic Acid and Matrixyl 3000 to help correct and prevent damage that show signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Used daily either alone or under makeup, being gel isnt heavy so its also go well with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Like all eye gel this bottle look and is tiny! but after using the pump on my finger, I see why it doesn&#x27;t need to be any bigger for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This gel feels SO cool going on my under-eye area!  I use it first thing in the morning to wake up!  I have dark circles and puffy skin under my eyes BUT I have had them for 20 years.  I don&#x27;t expect any product to erase them overnight.  That&#x27;s asking a bit too much.  This gel reminds me a bit of aloe gel but without the stinging &amp; watery eyes. All this at a great price!  This container will last me quite a while- you only need a little to cover the eye area.  Over all-a great product!  I did order this at a reduced price to try &amp; now I&#x27;ve got an eye treatment!</li>
            <li> Very nice! My eyes where very puffy all the time, I would not leave my house without makeup but now they look much better, I have only used it for a couple of weeks but I can see the difference. And I feel more confident without my makeup now</li>
            <li> Not a bad product - leaves skin feeling a tad sticky. Smell is great. Been using for over a week and have seen some improvement around my eye area</li>
            <li> What an absolutely wonderful product! Coming in an easy to pump container, this serum packs a mean punch! I could see a difference the very first time I put it on. A transparent serum, it glides on evenly and smoothly, requiring very little. I apply this under my eyes, above my eyes and on my cheek bones two times a day, and not only do I look refreshed, I feel refreshed as well! It has a very gentle scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry out or overhydrate my skin. My favorite part about it is that I no longer have permanent raccoon eyes!! This covers those dark circles right up!! 5 Star Product!!  What a great promotion to be a part of!!</li>
            <li> This actually seems to help !  I use it twice a day.  It is all natural and CLEAR, so it is not a cover-up.  It smells slightly like cucumbers.  It seems to help with both the puffiness &amp; discoloration of dark bags under the eyes.  I have had this problem all my life, so I knew there would be no miracle cure.  Most products, however, are merely cover-ups.  This seems to actually reduce the CAUSE.  I will continue to use it &amp; have ordered more.  I have never ordered a second of ANYTHING else I&#x27;ve tried.  So I think this is a good sign.  I use pure Witch Hazel as a wash before I apply this gel.  Then at night when I re-apply, I wash the day off with the pure witch-hazel again.  On days that I do NOT use this product morning &amp; night I DO see a difference.  This will obviously take a while, but I have hopes that it will help.  It at very least does not make things worse - and some things I have tried do !!  Yes, I would recommend it !</li>
            <li> Wouldnt trust to use it. Not in originally package, no seal what so ever, even pump was un twisted an gel was already through pump which anyone thats used a pump lotion it takes alot of pumps to start it out. So really dont think this is new and for this type of product its my face an its expensive for such a little bottle. Frustrating excpected to be able to use since my other eye cream is running out an wanted to try something new. Now get to waste my time returning an open product yet again.Hope others have better luck if they try it. Hope its an easy return.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly.  I purchased this because of the rave reviews, but I got to say, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  I gave it weeks  to do something and I saw no improvement.  I was so hoping this would really help the aging process.</li>
            <li> This is really a good eye gel (not cream) and has really helped to rid my eyes of dark circles and bags under my eyes! You can see in my photos how good my under eye skin looks! I have NO makeup on in these photos :-)  It feels so good going on and it smells nice too, clean and lightly citrus.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for about  a week, but I&#x27;m impressed already with the results!  I have some photos to show how well it&#x27;s working already!  I plan to update this after I&#x27;ve been using it for longer.  Thank you for reading my review! :)</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It works well.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS EYE GEL! I LOVE THAT IT IS ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND WHO DOESN&#x27;T WANT HELP WITH ANTI AGING AND THIS STUFF DELIVERS!! I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it describes.  It lightlens dark circle around the eyes, demishes fine wrinkles, eye puffiness, and tones skin.  I&#x27;ve using is for about a week and noticed the difference after the first couple of days</li>
            <li> This little bottle packs a punch. When I first opened the package, I was disappointed how small the bottle was and from there on I had a bad attitude about it. I felt misled by the picture but later realized that they blew it up that much to display its abundant ingredients.  I purchased it at a promotional price to try and test as a consumer. Prior to receiving this product, I didn&#x27;t use any eye gel. I used a Vitamin C Serum followed by moisturizer. I used the same moisturizer around my eyes as I did my face. The first few days, I thought &amp;#34;this is ok&amp;#34; but I really didn&#x27;t see the point of using it. The more I used it, the more my eyes woke up.  I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and now when I put it on, my eyes immediately feel better. You have to be careful because you&#x27;ll become addicted to the stuff. Best of all, this little bottle goes a long long way. You don&#x27;t need much. It will last much longer than you imagine. I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in mine.</li>
            <li> I used just a little bit under my eyes and to feel it working. it helps with fine wrinkles and snooze the under eye area. Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now, wanting to see how it will work for me. I LIKE IT...  Knowing that i&#x27;m not going to get my miracle fix from a bottle. At age 50+ we all know what i&#x27;m looking at to fight aging. But for now I keep trying new products like everyone else out there. For all that to be said. I have notice my eye-shadow apply is smoother.  (not fighting the wrinkles around my eyes) And it&#x27;s so gentle that I can put a little on my upper lip while i&#x27;m at it. So for now I will keep using Eye Gel Type 1. No trash can for this one.. lol</li>
            <li> I work night shift for a while now and I hate seeing my dark circle eyes or puffiness most especially when I didnt get enough sleep. This makes magic because it helps lightens those dark circles and helps hydrate and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> 4th day using it and my dark circles are gone by 50% at least. It is a miracle cream. I&#x27;m not a believer of this type of beauty creams but this one is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement after 1 month.</li>
            <li> Dark, puffy under-eye circles are one of my biggest beauty concerns. This soothing Eye Gel has already been a great help in reducing that issue. The formula goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any greasy after-feel. My skin immediately feels silkier after each application and appears visibly smoother and firmer after a few weeks of use. My skin is super sensitive so I&#x27;m always careful what new products I use. I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse effects from this one. I also love that they offer a money back guarantee, which is  a relief with this sort of product! I&#x27;m happy with the results so far and will continue using it too see how my skin progresses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was only able to use this feel good, tightening eye gel for one day. The pump stopped working on the second day. Due to the ingredients &amp; surprisingly hopeful results of this eye gel product type 1 I am going to give it another try. The company was very gracious and helpful, a big plus in my book.  After continued use, I will write an updated review.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eye Gel - Love this product. It goes on like silk and my puffiness under the eye area has really gone down since using this. I love that it is all natural without uneccessary chemicals. I bought it on a sale to try out and review and I am glad I did. I will replace it for sure when I run out.</li>
            <li> Feels nice when I apply it but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any real difference.</li>
            <li> This product works!  The first night I tried it I was not impressed by how it made my eyes feel, but the next morning I felt better about the product.  The blackness around my eyes was decreased and the crows feet around my eyes were smaller.  I have used this product for 3 days, and I am much happier with how my eyes looks.  The dark circles are less, and my crows feet are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this item because I wanted to give it a fair review.  Well, I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch but this product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> seems to be good as any eye cream, do any eye creams work really?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in dark circles, but my skin DOES seem clearer and tighter. I&#x27;m trying out that whole &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; lifestyle, so keeping my skin looking good is a must. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and update in a few weeks. So far, so good though!</li>
            <li> still using tooo soon</li>
            <li> still like it after 2 weeks; not greasy, easy to apply, and I&#x27;m 67 yo!!</li>
            <li> Item as decribed. Fast shipping. Packaging in tact. So far product seems to be good quality!</li>
            <li> This gel is very hydrating. It comes in an easy to use pump and goes on coolly like cucumbers on your face. It&#x27;s very gentle and the best ingredients. I&#x27;ll be using this every day!</li>
            <li> I bought it for slight puffiness and darkness under my eyes and It arrived very quickly. I have been using it for a week and a half and have noticed absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> this product so good quality and its perfect</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job in helping removing black circles&lt;br /&gt;Removes wrinkles around eyes&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness is a goner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove black circles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product at a reduced price for my review!</li>
            <li> This is pretty unique as far as any eye gels I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The gel has a very light and ungreasy texture. The bad part about this is it seems to absorb so fast it takes a lot more product than I&#x27;d like.  Keep in mind I am using this as an &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; moisturizer instead just under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;  The dark circles were only slightly diminished but the puffiness was gone in minutes.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel incredibly soft after using and I ended up using my normal moisturizer afterwards , but I still liked it.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good thing or some kind of reaction but this gave my faces really nice color,  it was just like that pretty pink tone you get from a light workout  or dancing , ect.  More continuous use will be needed to find out if it will have any effects on fine lines/wrinkles.  Purchased at promotional  price for review/ inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> I used this after I got a shower this morning and I felt like I noticed a difference after it dried. I will continue to use this. Great product</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I love this product. It actually tightened the area under my eyes and slightly decreased the dark circles. I don&#x27;t expect miracles but this product is the best eye gel I have used in a long time. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to review this item. My eyes always look tired with darkness underneath. I have tried other brands of eye serum and non worked until this. I have only been using it for 7 days but I am very impressed with how much better my eyes look already. I look much more rested and the darkness is still there but looks much more improved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and I can see a slight difference already.  The scent is pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily or greasy, nor does it feel like it&#x27;s dried out.  It just feels like I&#x27;ve applied lotion to my face.  I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This feels so silky and smooth on your skin. It&#x27;s full of wonderful herbs and flower extracts.  It&#x27;s very faint smell, smells like a faintly fresh cut cucumber. I recommend this product.  I have sensitive skin and bad allergies and I found this product to be wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: discount received to test and give true unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days there was a slight improvement in the color around my eyes. It is likely that continued use will result in even better results.</li>
            <li> good stuff saw a real difference in 10 days!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this product for a short period of time and love it!!!!  seeing results around my eyes, it does take some puffiness away, like the cucumber smell</li>
            <li> Nice gel. I use it as a base and gently pat my eye cream over it.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye gel. I have been using it for a few days now and I can really tell the difference in the skin around my eyes. It looks lighter, tighter and overall much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that a little goes a long way, so use it very sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely makes my eyes look younger! I have recomended to all of my friends and family. I am very excited to try other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give a full review but so far it&#x27;s working well!&lt;br /&gt;I dab the gel around my eyes and it soaks right in with no stickiness. My under  eye area does appear a little firmer!</li>
            <li> Great little product! Been using it for a few days now and really enjoy it. It goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly,. Been using it in the morning and before bed. I had no problem using this under makeup, just make sure you let it soak in before applying anything else. Leaves my skin nice and soft. Had no issues with it at all. Also got it super fast. Would definitely get again, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the eye gel, but think there may have been an air bubble in the tube because it has only lasted for a few applications (20 single pumps?) and seems to have a lot of air when I pump it.  Not sure if this is an anomaly or just not much in each bottle. But the amount I&#x27;ve used has been very soothing.</li>
            <li> After my first use of this product WOW you could actually already tell a difference. It feels like it is tightening and making me feel and look younger, I cant wait to see how this product does after a week. My mom has already tired and is ordering, it is amazing and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice eye gel. The texture is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes. I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s good for puffy eyes or not, but it does feel refreshing when I have it on.</li>
            <li> The eye gel is very moisturizing to the eyelid, under eye, and forehead. Its a great product because it is almost exactly the same thing as a name brand eye gel but for a fraction of the cost. It works the same and I would highly recommend for people with aging wrinkles or people who want firmer skin around their eyes.</li>
            <li> Smooths, provides a nice firming effect! Seems like this one will be a keeper!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS EYE GEL. IT REALLY DOES TAKE CARE OF FINE LINES AROUND THE EYE &amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE VERY MUCH @ ALL. WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> seems to help a little for the sag under my eyes</li>
            <li> I tried the eye gel for 3 weeks with no change under my eyes. I am 71 years old and it&#x27;s probably to late in life to expect wrinkle free eyes.</li>
            <li> I already see a difference in just the few days I&#x27;ve gotten it! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is working on my fiances bags underneath her eyes....for years we haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to help but this stuff is working its magic. She&#x27;s only been using it for a week and its slowly making them disappear. Will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes. I don&#x27;t have lines around my eyes, but they are a bit puffy. I like the scent, so that&#x27;s why I rated it a 2.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> This eye gel really does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;Offers superb hydration to the eye area&lt;br /&gt;without an oily feel.  Plumps those fine lines&lt;br /&gt;and refreshes the eye region with a delicate&lt;br /&gt;scent of mint and cucumber. Also works great&lt;br /&gt;as a makeup base.  Results are cumulative as&lt;br /&gt;with any other topical product, but it&#x27;s anti-aging&lt;br /&gt;effects can be seen immediately within the first week&lt;br /&gt;of use.  It&#x27;s base of ingredients is all natural, so&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for all skin types looking&lt;br /&gt;for a good eye treatment without the risk of&lt;br /&gt;irritation.</li>
            <li> Works well for getting rid of the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I look at the good reviews, decide to buy it but wasn&#x27;t happy when came with broken pump. Since, I rather not wait for the exchange so I&#x27;m keeping it in another container. Excited to see if its good as it says.... Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really does remove puffiness.  I use it everyday and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Eye Gel is beautiful inside and out. It comes in a small tube with a pump top that dispenses the gel easily without too much coming out at once. I really liked the packaging and delivery style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I put on it, and oh my goodness, did it feel good on my tired, puffy eyes. They were immediately soothed, and a short while later, I saw the puffiness had abated. And that was just the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days, I noticed that my entire eye area looked and felt firmer, and the fine lines at the corners were diminished. So I used a dab on my forehead as well, and those lines began to fade as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no irritation at all, despite applying it rather generously, even after several uses. It&#x27;s very gentle, yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and happy eyes are my own.</li>
            <li> wasting money and time  . dose not effect at all .</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight and grease free eye gel that adds brightness and provides moisture. There is no sheen which I love because my skin isn&#x27;t left looking greasy or feeling dirty. The product says eye gel but really it can be used anywhere, the bottle even says so. I used it under my eyes and on my cheekbones and the tiny drop seen in the picture was plenty. It&#x27;s a nice product and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This product works great on fine lines around the eyes! I got it for my mother to try out and she is very pleased--she&#x27;s been using it as directed less than a week and says she notices the difference!</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure eye gel was givin to me to try by my mother whom had INSISTED she had found the Fountain of Youth. After trying eye cream after eye gels I haven&#x27;t YET found anything that does EXACTLY what it says and beyond. My mother is 66 years old and how the whole conversation came about I&#x27;d that I noticed a difference in her skin and I asked&amp;#34; What r u doing different? &amp;#34; When u yourself notice a difference and when OTHER people notice a difference is a total different ball game. I tried it myself and have to say I will NEVER go back.People will notice a difference when u use this product. Majestic Pure is a whole skin line of miracles.</li>
            <li> It works to eliminate fine lines under the eye.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time with this product to say anything about it yet. I will keep an updated review with all noticeable changes&lt;br /&gt;and more information about the product. I have received this in return of a review and I will give all accurate info</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any kind of difference after using it for approx. 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> so far its moisturizing. I cant say about the wrinkles since its been only a week. But no irritation or problems. I will you posted!</li>
            <li> goes  on smooth and saw an immediate improvement with my dark circles. I only have to use a small amount so hopefully this small pump will last awhile. I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I was hooked on the Philosophy eye cream for a long time. But it&#x27;s super expensive so when I lost one I couldn&#x27;t justify buying another bottle. I bought Majestic instead and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my eye area hard or paper feeling. It&#x27;s moisturizing and really helps get rid of my crows feet! I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference with my under eye circles. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin immediately!  This is such an AMAZING product.  It does wonders for the eyes but I also use it as a whole face serum.  Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> This item hydrates and firm the skin for younger looking eyes.&lt;br /&gt;its also safe for all skin type, shipping was quick, the item is also Cruelty free, the bottle is a little thin bottle but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for products to help with my puffy eyes and dark circles underneath them.  Having tried numerous Majestic Pure items in the past I was happy to see they offer an eye gel. Packed in a small pump top bottle you think to yourself this is too small to last very long. I was pleasantly surprised.  One pump was more than enough to use on my eyes and with a second pump I had enough for my entire face. One pump is the magic number I&#x27;ve learned.  It took maybe 3 days to start seeing improvement with my dark circles and about a week to see my general eye area improvement. It has just the lightest scent of cucumber but it&#x27;s not overpowering and dissipates quickly. I also like that it absorbs into your skin fast so you can make this a part of your before bed routine without making the process longer than needed. Another hit from Majestic Pure, this eye gel has a permanent spot on my vanity.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It&#x27;s been helping my dark circle under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I decided to use due to the positive reviews. I have tired looking eyes and puffiness under my eyes. I myself have been using twice a day since I received and have not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> No opportunity to try the product. The pump was defective and the design of the bottle does Not allow to get the product out.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Just got my majestic pure eye gel and so far Iove it. I love the cucumber smell it&#x27;s very refreshing and light unlike many of the perfumey smelling ones that I have tried in the past. I like that you can use it on your forehead too. It&#x27;s very thin so applying it first thing in the morning is ok too not thick and creamy. Light thin and smooth on the skin. Says you can apply it both in the morning and evening too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me at a promotional rate so that I could review it and give my opinion. The opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with this eye gel, the way it feels and works, and it&#x27;s terriffic list of healing and soothing ingredients! I&#x27;m really happy I tried it and will reorder it again!</li>
            <li> makes my under eye area so much smoother-- don&#x27;t know if anything can help these stubborn wrinkles though</li>
            <li> I like the Eye Gel as it goes on smooth, clear, no residual, no odor, and it feels lite and cool. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and do not see any difference in my fine wrinkles, they are still as they have been. I will continue to use the product until it runs out and re-evaluate then.</li>
            <li> Putting it on the back of one hand resulted in immediately moister, smoother skin with fewer fine wrinkles as compared to the back of the untreated hand. I put it on one eye and waited a half hour, then looked in the mirror. The deeper wrinkles looked the same, but there was a marked reduction in fine lines and my skin looked fresher and brighter around the eye I put the gel on. I&#x27;d rank this gel as excellent in terms of cosmetic effects. This is the exact same product in ingredients, scent, texture, and even bottle type as Aria Starr Beauty&#x27;s ultra youth eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slippery gel feel going on (aloe is the second ingredient), then a fresh cooling sensation. Skin does not feel sticky after the gel has dried fully; until then there is a texture you can feel. It is completely non-greasy. The scent is mild (no added fragrance) and sort of an herbal cucumber essence. It stings a little for a minute if you get it in your eyes. Aside from that, it has a very cooling, refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In choosing skin care products, you need to know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects. Cosmetic effects are immediate and only there when the product has been applied that day - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product for a month (but don&#x27;t do that when you have something that works - your skin needs continued support if you want to delay signs of aging as much as possible). An ideal product would cover both needs fully, but it&#x27;s usually more realistic to realize a formula will tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this formula, the Matrixyl 3000, peptides, hyaluronic acid and some of the herbal ingredients should provide long-term support. The other ingredients are more oriented towards immediate, temporary improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

            <li> It has done nothing for me.  I ordered it, hoping it would reduce the darkness under my eyes.  It hasn&#x27;t.  Also hoped it would help with the small lip lines I have - it hasn&#x27;t - I will finish what I have - but will NOT reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. It has significantly reduced my mothers eye puffiness. It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> The eye gel made my eyes inflammed &amp; itchy. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> OK, ladies I&#x27;ve been using this since July 16th and it really works.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised only because I really wasn&#x27;t sold but I&#x27;ll try anything once with that being said it did take some time to see it working.  I followed the instructions using the product twice a day before bed and in the morning.  I had a problem with puffiness around my eyes although the puffiness is not completely gone but I do see changes.  It is said that it takes about 6 - 8 weeks I guess to see dramatic changes but I&#x27;ve also changed my diet, drinking plenty of water and started working out dunno if this has something to do with it but health is very important.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted within the next weeks but in the mean time try it.  Also, there was some tingling but subsided after a minute other than that I like it and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I paid full price and I&#x27;m not being paid for my review.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; Majestic Pure Plant Stem Cell based EYE Cream Gel is the best anti aging Youth Formula based on natural ingredients designed for the delicate skin around your eyes to reverse the signs of aging. It helps recapture a youthful appearance and can help fade dark circles under eyes and puffy eyes by draining excess fluids&amp;#34; - OK, I&#x27;m in! At 64 years of age, I am all about looking naturally younger.  I was blessed with good skin - but fine lines are beginning to show and even &amp;#34;gasp&amp;#34; - occasional puffiness and dark circles! But this eye gel works really well! just a tiny small amount - applied regularly will help my skin look even better than ever!</li>
            <li> not greasy but its effects still need time to prove</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  This probably works when you&#x27;re just starting to get puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> From the moment of application, you can feel this product working. I have pale skin and often wake up with dark circles around my eyes. This product works great not only to diminish the visible effects of tiredness, but also feels the skin around the eyes feel refreshed. Since I do not use makeup, I utilize this product in the morning (it is suggested in the label to use at night), and I&#x27;ve noticed that a few minutes after application, my eyes look more refreshed, and I feel better prepared to start with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is extremely airy, so you only need a small pump to apply on both eyes. The cream will spread nicely. Despite the small size of the bottle, I can tell it&#x27;s going to last a long time since a single pump is sufficient for a generous application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, the eyes feel a bit cooler, and symptoms of morning tiredness slowly fade. My favorite part is that the cream smells slightly like cucumber, which reminds me of a nice spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, and although I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every morning and can definitely seen an improvement. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a small discount, but the review above expresses my honest opinions. I will continue to use and purchase this product, even at full price.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet</li>
            <li> Both hubby and I are trying this product out for more than a week now and positive, happy results are showing. Fine lines around the eye are diminishing and my pigmentation are significantly reduced. It comes in a small bottle but the measured pump helps with the conservation. A small dab is all you need, well unless you want to use it on your entire face which you also can. I love that you can use it under makeup and is safe to use both morning and night. Got this product at promotional discount to test, try out and review. Very effective and safe. Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Feels good after application. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement. That being said I like how it feels with &amp; without makeup.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, glides on very light &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It is soft and silky when I put it on and because of this, I use it 2x per day, in the morning and in the evening before I go to bed.  Now, for my age (and I&#x27;m not going to mention the number), I don&#x27;t look it and don&#x27;t have many lines or any crowsfeet.  I cannot give this anything less than a 5 star because I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>

            <li> Very pleasant fragrance and makes eyes less puffy.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use product. smells good and I have seen an incredible difference in how my eyes look and feel since using. cool and creamy feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t realize I would only need a small amount. So in saying that, a little goes a long way. The gel is light and goes on evenly. Although I do not have many wrinkles, the few I did have seem to not be as prominent. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice light eye gel.</li>
            <li> I was asked to write a review on the Eye Gel Type I. Hint: I placed my container in the refrigerator. Wow! What a refresher in the a.m.! I&#x27;m still using this product. I absolutely LOVE it! Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, the skin around my eyes feels refreshed and the dark circles are lighter. Feels especially great if you keep it in the fridge before you put it on.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was cautious on how much of this stuff to use at once. One little pump was more than enough to cover under the eyes, up the side of the eyes and have a little left to smear over the forehead. I am not old but I guess I am on my way. Those crow&#x27;s feet began showing(ugh) and I already have huge eye bags. This is far beyond your average puffiness. I gooped this stuff on the bags twice per day. It has been only a few days so I have a lot of this stuff to use yet but I did notice a bit of shrinkage under the eyes. It appeared to tighten the skin a little and reduce the eye bags a little. That is somewhat impressive for just a few days of usage. I have to give it five stars because it did pretty much what was claimed. Some advice I can offer to buyers is keep the sun off the face. Lots of sunlight on the face is counterproductive to what this product may help with so limit the sun exposure for best results. Of course, if you didn&#x27;t put your face in the sun to begin with all these years, you may not looks so old, ha ha.</li>
            <li> this product did not work for me at all. i used it for about two weeks and saw no difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days now, I haven&#x27;t seen any result yet, but maybe time will tell. I wish I could right a review in30dats not 10days as we have to do now. Some products just take longer than others to see results</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed a non greasy eye cream, this had great reviews. I like this it seems to help with puffiness and moisturizes with out oil, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was bigger, but the easy application. I just started using eye cream / gel and this one is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this again it really worked well for my under eyes.  The only down fall is that I can&#x27;t tell when the bottle is about to run out since its a pump and I used it up to quickly.  I wish the bottle was bigger, other than that it worked very well for my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and value. It actually works if wrinkles are not too deep... Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used this product long enough but it seems good.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure eye gel comes in a very tiny bottle. But don&#x27;t let the size fool you. I tried this on twice today. I will be lying if I notice an immediate difference, but I can tell you the puffiness of my under the eye bags seems to be not as puffy. I can totally be lying to myself. But I am sure if I give this product more time to work its magic. I know the under eye bags will be completely gone. I love this product came with my money back guarantee, although i have no plans to return this awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received this in a honest to provide my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I already love this product after one use. As a woman who recently turned 30&#x27;s I am very conscious of any wrinkles, lines or puffiness in my face; especially in regards to my eyes. I have tried tons of eye creams over the years and nothing compares to the immediate relief I received by applying this eye gel. My eyes reduced in puffiness immediately upon application and they feel rejuvenated. I can&#x27;t wait to see even more results in the next couple of days!</li>
            <li> I like the container with the pump.  Worked to soften lines, but I was not blown away by the results.</li>
            <li> does what it says it is going to do! very exciting!</li>
            <li> I love when fun skin products come up for review, I don&#x27;t like spending a ton of money when you never know if it&#x27;s actually going to work or not. Since I have sensitive skin it can definitely be an issue. So far I can honestly say I like this gel. I have used others before and even sensitive formulas like proactive give a burning sensation and leave my skin raw and burned after a few days of use. This feels nice and cool on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells to it like other creams. I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many creams/gels for treating the severe dryness and wrinkles under my left eye skin, and while some worked better than others, this so far has been the best eye gel I&#x27;ve yet to use. Been applying it twice per day (morning/night), and in a matter of few mins, my eyes look less puffy and the wrinkles becomes less visible. The fine lines under my eyes are also starting to disappear (been applying this gel for two weeks so far). May not work for everyone, but I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Great product! No sticky feeling and really makes my skin tight and beautiful! Will buy again !!</li>
            <li> I love Majestic Pure products. They are very high quality and well formulated. I expected nothing but the best from this eye cream and that&#x27;s exactly what I got! I was able to purchase and review this item during a promotional period and any opinions are my own. ive noticed increased puffiness around my eyes a a little bit of what I call saggy undereye skin. I&#x27;m 29! Who wants to have that?!?! So I gave this eye gel a shot. Did my application during the night time and woke up with reduced puffiness and you can tell that it had slightly firmed my skin! I was amazed! Even other people thought I didn&#x27;t look as tired as usual. That definitely or a smile on my face! I now have a go to tired look coverup...Majestic Pure Eye Gel!! Great product!</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my to what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks and see no change at all..</li>
            <li> I’ve been looking for a good eye gel, and decided to try this out. It’s great: light, pleasant smelling, and hopefully does what it says. I’ve only had it for a few days but no irritation. I’ve been scouring the internet for things with peptide complexes. Plant stem cells are still up for debate: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25362798, but hold promise. Good product to try, what’s frustrating with these sorts of products is you won’t know it works until many years later!&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel.  My skin felt a little tighter and firmer right away.  You only need&lt;br /&gt;a tiny bit so this bottle will last a long time.  I might try to keep it in the fridge, Keeping&lt;br /&gt;it cool will really feel great when you put it on.  Review for amztrader.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandma. She have a big eye bag. It is day 2 and she said she liked it. She applies it every night. Will review it again when the bottle is empty. So far so good. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Majectic pures products for a while now and I can honestly say the quality of their products are amazing! I have used many types of eye firming gels but this one is by far the best. This feels great after applying, the skin under my eyes feel rejuvenated and I can tell a huge difference in the lines under my eyes. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to like this eye gel. Seems like I can feel it tighting around my eyes after I put it on. It has a cool feel and a nice light sent of cucumber. I like it so far. Thank you for this.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this but i could feel some firming and it seems to work, this was a promo item and i was supposed to give my opinion on it and i like it i need to give it more time to work but this is a very nice product</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Eye Gel Type I, Youth Formula, 0.5 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how little the bottle is.  I opened it up and pumped some into my hand.  I put it under my eyes and realized I had pumped too much.  I’m guessing one pump is enough.  Then I went to bed since I decided to do this last minute before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing miraculous happened in the morning.  But being a trooper, I tried it again the next night and next. On the third morning, I got up and noticed that my puffiness was down. The gel absorbs quickly into your skin.  I have been looking for this product and now I have it I will keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s supposed to be safe on all skin since I have sensitive skin I believe that.  They guarantee it 100% which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchanged for an unbiased and truthful review.  This is 100% my thoughts.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy gel formulation.  Non drying or caking like some &amp;#34;gels&amp;#34;. Applies smoothly, evenly and easily absorbed.  Love it so far, too soon to notice a difference.  Very happy that the ingredients are as listed - honesty is greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> THIS HAS HELPED WITH THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES AND DARK CIRCLES SO MUCH.  IT ISN&#x27;T GREASY EITHER.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for only a short time but it feels great on my under eye area. I will update once I have time to test for anti aging properties.</li>
            <li> I can only use this during the day.  For some reason, It irritated my eyes if I used it at night.  I will finish the container, but I won&#x27;t reorder.  Update:  I see no difference from this product. Others work better.  Goes on nice and light, but that is the only positive.  Taking off another star.</li>
            <li> The package looks ghetto and haven&#x27;t seen any result so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a model in my early-mid thirties. When I noticed fine lines around my eyes, and deep lines in my forhead and between my eyebrows, I may have freaked out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic Pure eye gel has been helping immensely! I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 days and already my lines and eye-puffiness are disappearing. I love that you can use it as a general wrinkle remover as well as around the eye. The biggest difference I see is in both my crows feet and, most of all, the deep line that I used to have in between my eyebrows. It&#x27;s been there for a VERY long time and with the help of this eye gel, and the Majestic Pure oils (Argan, Rosehip and jojoba), it&#x27;s almost completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is awesome! It automatically got rid of my dark eye circles I have had for years! Its easy to applicate and has worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> When I first received this I have to admit I was a little discouraged in the bottle.  Not only was it a really small bottle but so plain!  Not impressed!  But then I started using it and it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that one pump goes a really long ways.  I wasted several pumps of it the first couple times.  You know... More is better?  Well not here because more is wasteful so use it sparingly.  I also have to admit, I don&#x27;t have the best of luck getting enough sleep or staying dehydrated so dark circles are my norm.... Not so much since I started using this gel though!  I have been using it a few weeks now and I have stopped using extra concealer under my eyes all together.  Plus my crows feet are even disappearing!  This eye gel has made a world of difference and despite the lack of packaging design, I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
            <li> Leaves my eyes so soft and firm!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product . I have insane dark circles and found another product that is doing a great job but I am always on the hunt for a great eye treatment. I do like the gel formula . Very cooling . I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect on the dark circles yet but it does help reduce the puffiness during the day . I will continue to use and see if the dark circles fade. The packaging on this is great and its nice to not have to stick my finger in a pot. I am looking forward to seeing additional results. I did receive this product to  review and for that reason I plan on updating this review as time goes on to see the full effects.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft application.  Seems to be helping.  Have not  had it that long</li>
            <li> This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail. I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> Nothing has happened! My wrinkles are still the same, and I believe I got a new one since I started using this cream. Nothing happened to my dark circles either, but the puffiness under my eyes were gone after I used it.</li>
            <li> Pump on bottle didn&#x27;t work. Can&#x27;t use product.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference. I have used it everyday for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> First time user, got some ich initially, and been used about week, haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far...</li>
            <li> Very good.  Like this get.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Small bottle ,but very good smell and works great for me</li>
            <li> it feels ok to apply gets absorbed by the skin right away, does not feel or look oily. I have used it but have not seen much improvement, I will continue using it until it is gone and then give another update on this product.</li>
            <li> Used product for 1 week now with no improvement. Will give it more time.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for the entire eye area. Gets rid of bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as accepted,looking forward to seeing some results! Keep ya posted</li>
            <li> The Plant Stem Cell technology in the gel is what originally drew me to the product. I smell all the products I put on my skin before I do, mainly for perfumes because I have sensitive skin, and the gel actually smells slightly vegital. True to description, it has gel consistency and a clear/white opaque appearance. I found that, though the bottle is small compared to some eye treatments, one pump is all you need per application. The gel smooths on easily and, pleasantly absorbs quickly without leaving a residue, which I have found in other gels and makes it hard to apply makeup in the morning. The gel does not sting or irritate my sensitive skin in any way. I like to use Eye Gel Type 1 in the morning because it decreases my puffiness and leaves me looking rested! I really like Majestic Pure as a company and have enjoyed the products I received from them. There is a lot of follow-up on how I like my product and desire to make sure I am very happy. Their products speak for themselves. *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order form the seller again.</li>
            <li> Used many eye creams this one suits me as it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t hang around  Blends in and smooths the under eye area beautifully.</li>
            <li> good product..all the description are true..i recieved this product at discounted price for my homest review</li>

I bought it because I got the Dead Sea mud mask from the same company and it was amazing.  I&#x27;m ready to buy more because I&#x27;m pretty sure did after a month or so my eyes will look gorgeous</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my eyes looking refreshed and helps moisturize my lower lids</li>
            <li> Since using, people have actually told me how rested I look! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these product, I will not use any other eye gel anymore.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes, no matter how rested I am. I typically use a lot of concealer to cover the dark circles and bags under my eyes. When I was offered this product at a free / reduced price I figured, what did I have to lose? It will either work or it will be like every other product I have tried and it will be thrown in a drawer to collect dust. After the first use I noticed the dark circles and bags weren&#x27;t as prominently defined. They were actually noticeably lighter. Now I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer! I look much more rested. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Based on all the information I read regarding this product, I felt quite confident that this was going to work. However, after more than two weeks of using the Eye Gel 2X per day, I have seen no noticeable improvement to the dark circles around my eyes. I did see a slight improvement to the puffiness below my eyes but that was not my main concern. I have tried many other products but none of them have worked so I was very disappointed with results of this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so ashamed of looking like a racoon or a masked bandit when I go out in public so I will continue my quest to find a product that will help me with my dark circles. Even a product that would lighten the darkness would be very welcome. I&#x27;m not saying the product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, as I&#x27;ve read some very positive reviews. Unfortunately, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working good so far I&#x27;ve only had it for  about 8 days and I do notice a diffrence around my eyes some of the puffiness is going down . I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel. You don&#x27;t need much. Wish I would have ordered 2, one for m/u area and one for nightstand drawer! I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I may change my rating after using awhile, but just wanted to post now that it took me possibly a hundred pumps to finally get the gel to start coming out.  Makes me wonder how much solution is in the little container.  I was really close to returning it, thinking it was empty, but finally it started coming out.  I&#x27;m rating based on the product itself.  It feels good, smells good and after a few months I will revisit to update my rating to see if I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye gel! My dark circles look  better it seems to help and that is all I expect  thank You</li>
            <li> Love this product I will definitely use it again</li>
            <li> Earlier this year, I asked my doctor what I could do about the unsightly bags under my eyes.  Her response was to try to find a good eye cream.  I was wary that an eye cream would work, but when I was given this opportunity to review for a reduced price I decided to give it a try.  It smells just like fresh cucumber.  I like that I can use this as an all over face treatment, instead of just on my eyes.  Using only one product is a great time-saver.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is amazing! I had fine lines that I was worried about, so I bought this gel and it really works!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) and it smells great! It has a slight cucumber scent.  I recommend this to anyone fighting the aging process!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this eye gel. As a plus 50 I am always looking for a way to diminish the circles under my eyes. I really like the way this feels and went on smoothly. It seemed to absorb quickly and didn&#x27;t feel greasy. I like the pump bottle although it took me a few pumps to get it going. The quality is very high and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is a great little addition to my daily beauty routine! Although I do not have wrinkles under my eyes, I do have tired looking eyes because I don’t get much sleep. I was looking for something that was light and easy to put under my eyes to help with the dark circles and puffiness.  Since using the product, the puffiness under my eyes has reduced and the dark circles are starting to lighten up a bit. I am positive with continued use, they will be gone in no time! I am glad that I was given the opportunity to review this gel at a special price and share my opinions as this products work wonders just like the company’s essential oils. The gel comes in a nice pump bottle and one pump does the trick so you don’t have any wasted gel on your hands.  The gel goes on smooth and dries quickly so you don’t have sticky sitting on your face like some of the other eye gels I have tried in the past.  To top it off, gel also has a refreshing cucumber smell. I would definitely recommend giving this gel a try!</li>
            <li> *received product for purpose of review* The &amp;#34;eye gel&amp;#34; arrived in a cardboard box lid was not on product but rather in bottom of packaging. There was no safety seal (which may concern some). The bottle requires multiple pumping as it at times only expels air. The eye creme is lightly scented (not expert opinion, but reminds me of green tea). It applies nicely to around eyes, it is creamy yet just sticky enough. It advertises &amp;#34;stem cell therapy&amp;#34; not sure how accurate it is because of the lengthly experiments that goes into it. I did apply around my eyes for 3 days, I can say my eyes don&#x27;t look nearly as puffy but that can be because of many instances but will give product benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks so i dont expect any improvements. So i am suspicious of the&lt;br /&gt;reviewers who gave this prod excellent recommendations so quickly. I know face products take months before we notice difference (if ever it works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It emphasizes my wrinkles. After i have a good laugh, i can feel my wrinkles are&lt;br /&gt;Stuck or folded together. I double check in mirror, my eyes confirm what i feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attached are pictures. First pic (the one on the viewers left) has no eye gel. Middle pic and pic on viewers right are with the eye gel all dried up and after i smiled. I dont know if viewers can see the difference but i see it and i feel when my wrinkles are stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for others, but this is not for me. I mix it with my face moisturizer so it wont be sticky.</li>
            <li> I experienced an immediate improvement to my under eye area. If it wasn&#x27;t such a small container I would use it on my forehead too...</li>
            <li> After a week of reviewing this product I have noticed differences in the softness on the skin around my eyes and the dark circles I have accumulated for being a night owl have also noticeably been reduced. I give this product 4stars because I have spent a lot of money in the past trying to get that youthful appearance back around my eyes, but nothing I have tried has made me as satisfied as this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 so It&#x27;s high time I take care of my skin. I feel great using this product. It smells like bath and body works cucumber a bit. Which leaves a refreshing sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional product and my review is honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Deducted a star because I felt the labeling was a bit unprofessional and bubbled up. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skins fine lines or appearance however if I do I I will update it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel!  Usually eye gels kinda get filmy and then crumbly/flakey over the course of the day, but this absorbed well and did not crumble.  Immediately my eye puffiness went away, which is great.  This will make a perfect eye cream for the morning (I use crazy thick stuff at night because I am getting older *sigh)... my puffiness AND dark circles (which aren&#x27;t terrible but do exist) disappeared before my very eyes as soon as I put this on!  I will keep using this and recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> The packaging is simple, but efficient.  I really like that it has a pump for sanitary reasons.  The price is low for an eye cream and I find it is still on par with more expensive brands I have tried.  The consistency is thick(ish) like a gel, but slippery like a serum and a little goes a long way. This formula is packed with beneficial/organic ingredients. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results, but I have only been using it a week. I apply it morning &amp; night and find it soaks in quickly with no icky residue left behind. My under eye area has felt a bit smoother and has been less dry (I am normal/dry skin) and my husband said I look like I&#x27;ve been getting a good night&#x27;s sleep. I don&#x27;t have any deep set wrinkles, but I am using this on my forehead and laugh line area as a preventative treatment. An added bonus, this product is made in the USA and I love that. Overall I would say this is a good quality eye gel at a steal of a price. I will update my review in the future once I have used it longer.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount on this product, but my opinions are 100% honest. I could not in good conscious deceive people about liking something I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Like others commented on the size of the container this came in, I too thought this was not much.  After using this I can see that this will go a long way as just the right amount of gel is pumped out.  When I put this gel around my eyes, I also had enough to put on my cheeks.  I loved how was absorbed into my skin and it did not leave any greasy feeling.  With the stem cell therapy, I feel that my eyes will get visability younger. *I did receive this at a reduced cost and these are my true and honest unbiased feelings.</li>
            <li> This eye gel smells so refreshing...like cucumbers.  It&#x27;s not too strong but instead it is very pleasant.  I really liked the feel of the clear gel when I put it around my eyes.  It felt nice...I really could feel it tightening my skin but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  It just made me feel like it was doing its job.  Also, I could really tell a difference in the puffiness of my under eye area. It did not leave any sticky residue at all and my make-up went on smooth right over top the gel.  I have tried many products from Majestic Pure and, as always, they do not disappoint. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> great product.  feels wonderful going on and makes my skin feel refreshed.  I also like that the scent is very light.  Looking forward to using it longer so I can really see results but so far I&#x27;m really enjoying using it.... Maybe I  even look just a tad younger already.  I think its starting to show results after about a week.</li>
