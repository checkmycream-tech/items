            <li>obviously will take a bit of practice to make perfect, but because this is a long-lasting polish there is plenty in the bottle to play around with.  </li>

            <li>So glad I purchased this product. :)</li>
            <li>gel polish 60 seconds, top coat</li>
            <li>its really cute too,</li>
            <li>Excellent product especially for the price</li>
            <li>But if you want both hands in then you&#x27;ll have to pay more</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove all cotton</li>
            <li>* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV</li>

            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Nice compact size, quick cure.</li>
            <li>The polish stays on easily for 2 weeks or more, protects her nails from breaking and helps her to grow her nails longer.</li>
            <li>She told me of the importance of getting the right light (no uv lighting)!The drying method is very good, smooth, even, and quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to get a gel manicure right at home.</li>
            <li>The easy to reach top timer push buttons are easy to use and start the lamp to come on.  </li>
            <li>This lamp is truly incredible, simple &amp; sleek!</li>
            <li>and I got it on a Sunday so cool! ..</li>
            <li>Light works great, so far I have used it with Fingerpaints polish and OPI gel polish.</li>
            <li>You can easily spend over $1000 a year going to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>We just started doing this some months ago and trying to find all of the steps was not so easy.</li>
            <li>A high quality LED UV curing system at a fair price.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>A high quality LED UV curing system at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>The size is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Some of my nail techs like to put four fingers in for 30 seconds, and then do the thumb, but I think it works just fine with all five in at one time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this little machine is a wonderful way to do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to blame the light just yet.</li>
            <li>it was about time we upgraded to LED instead of UV for no chip manicures and these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and when I tried a UV light it seemed like the process took forever and a day.  </li>
            <li>Summary of the Ivation LED UV light:  </li>
            <li>So far so good though...</li>
            <li>It was okay while it lasted but in the end the longevity was only as good as what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Some of the products give a general time frame but the variation in wattage impacts this so it would have been nice if the LED machine itself had better instructions.</li>
            <li>Cute and great transaction, wish it was a little more powerful</li>
            <li>so I am familiar with all of them.</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>The price is insanely reasonable, they are adorable, and they work like a charm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product and does a job well, but I would like to get more information and instructions coming with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;►  60 Long-Life LED Bulbs for Quick Drying w/o Heat&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you roll the polish in between the palms of your hands and give it a few good shakes to ensure it mixes well, otherwise it will be watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In general I am thrilled with the gel nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>At the local beauty supply stores I found some great ones but didn&#x27;t want to drop too much money right away.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first because I was comparing it to my old UV lamp.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry good the nails...</li>
            <li>(my toes are something different, a nicely done toenails are a summertime must)</li>
            <li>I really love this product, it works as it should and better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just a nice summertime personal pedicure works for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can either go it alone or have fun with a friend.  </li>
            <li>(Ruby Pumps and clear gel top coat).</li>
            <li>Ok, so when I first bought this lamp, i was brand new to gel polish.</li>
            <li>This process took hours and sometimes the pinky nail would still not cure right.</li>
            <li>Love this lamp, well worth spending a little more.</li>
            <li>It is much faster and easier to use than the older UV lamps and we liked the new features built into the design.</li>

            <li>super fast shipping</li>
            <li>The lights are only on the top in the inside of the lamp, and none on the sides.</li>

            <li>Only thing that would have been better is if there had been an instruction manual included, like the paper that was in the box said was included--which it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This works well, but the process is time-consuming, and kind of a drag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok size for the price, only one hand can go inside of the machine.</li>
            <li>You have to cure the foundation, the first coat, the second coat and the top it off sealer.</li>

            <li>This is large enough to fit my full hands in, and cures all brands (China Glaze, Gellish, Orly) that I&#x27;ve used in it.</li>
            <li>It will wipe off easily if you make an initial mistake and there&#x27;s always nail polish remover if you want to change colors</li>

            <li>I was able to get the normal dry/smooth finish only after this step.</li>
            <li>Take a pass if you have large feet.  </li>
            <li>I have also listed several links to the products we used in the video and they are all available of Amazon at reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I can fit one hand entirely inside.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It has a very sleek design, it has auto shutoff and the timer presets</li>
            <li>SO MUCH, I bought three.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a lot of others you can buy.</li>
            <li>The time that it took to do my nails was really slashed.  </li>
            <li>the curing time is much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of them is putting on too much polish.  </li>

            <li>LED UV lamp really speeds up the curing process and it is a real time saver.</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the Ivation UV LED lamp for 30 seconds for a light color or possible longer for a darker color.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fast and convenient to store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and am shopping for a new one with higher wattage.  </li>
            <li>already tried it out and this little lamp is amazing cures gels and regular polishes with super fast speed.</li>
            <li>* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the normal process for applying gel polish and used only Gelish products and had issues with the light not curing the polish.</li>
            <li>I used an Essie black gel color coat (Leather on Top), and Gelaze from China Glaze</li>
            <li>EZ Flow 1st Launch Gel Polish, Jellybean]] which is one of TruGel&#x27;s launch colors is a vibrant purple that you can either use on your fingernails or toenails.  </li>
            <li>No need to replace the UV lamps every two years like the older style of lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Professional mani would last a couple of days, but not all that long, and besides being a drain on my time and money, I became kind of paranoid about the tools that are used...  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>wife just loves the high glossy UV curable Gel fingernail polishes.</li>
            <li>I had become familiar with this lamp when a relative fixed my nails.</li>
            <li>I love this light, it dries my nails super quick, base coat 30seconds,</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great with Gelish brand base coat and top coats so far</li>
            <li>have created a video showing the features and benefits of this new lamp</li>

            <li>, I have small feet, so it should be OK.  </li>
            <li>and it is easily wiped off with a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad after the manicure is all done.</li>
            <li>Nice to have and convenient, Takes slightly longer to dry than the salon brands but works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been less than a year of pretty consistent use and this lamp has burnt out on me.</li>
            <li>, I wish I would&#x27;ve bought in a professional one instead.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I apply professional gel manicures at my job and also an a licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought a professional LED lamp at a licensed beauty supply store and since then, haven&#x27;t been experiencing any issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s labeled as being for \\&quot;professional use only,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>With the LED lights, the time under the lamp is slashed considerably.  </li>
            <li>I did I waited until the polish was ready to come off (end of summer) and oddly enough it pulled</li>

            <li>And as far as doing pedicures...</li>
            <li>I like it so far....</li>
            <li>I have now upgraded to a professional lamp.</li>
            <li>In addition I have listed the steps you need to follow in order to get professional results.</li>
            <li>It is not required but just an old habit that she is used to following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, I just set curing time kind of randomly between 30 &amp; 90 seconds, because I really don&#x27;t know what it should be for this lamp.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I love that it takes half the time of my old UV and less risk of UV skin damage.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was big enough for the whole hand.</li>
            <li>The Professional LED Manicure Lamp, comes in five different colors choices...</li>
            <li>A bottle of high quality Gelish polish is only $13 and it will last you a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is fine with me, my color commitment is not that long lasting - I usually want a different color in 5 days to a week.  </li>
            <li>I also used it to dry a regular nail polish, as it emits some heat, so speeds up the process (at least I think so, and drying time on the regular top coat - a sparkly one I put over the gel nail polish) was really short.  </li>
            <li>price of LED lamps was really steep, but they are coming down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and takes up less space than my UV lamp did.</li>
            <li>As soon as my nails were done i took my other newly purchased UV lamp, packaged it up &amp; am preparing to send it back!!!</li>

            <li> Test ran this LED lamp on my color swatch using gelish &amp; shellac, and then on my own nails.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a nice lamp to start doing my shellac manicure at home.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 so far, one for my self and the rest as gifts because this works great!</li>
            <li> great product works perfectly, worth every penny ...</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended as a very good</li>

            <li> obviously will take a bit of practice to make perfect, but because this is a long-lasting polish there is plenty in the bottle to play around with.  </li>

            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Nice compact size, quick cure.</li>
            <li> The polish stays on easily for 2 weeks or more, protects her nails from breaking and helps her to grow her nails longer.</li>
            <li> She told me of the importance of getting the right light (no uv lighting)!The drying method is very good, smooth, even, and quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to get a gel manicure right at home.</li>
            <li> The easy to reach top timer push buttons are easy to use and start the lamp to come on.  </li>
            <li> This lamp is truly incredible, simple &amp; sleek!</li>
            <li> and I got it on a Sunday so cool! ..</li>
            <li> Light works great, so far I have used it with Fingerpaints polish and OPI gel polish.</li>
            <li> You can easily spend over $1000 a year going to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> We just started doing this some months ago and trying to find all of the steps was not so easy.</li>

            <li> A high quality LED UV curing system at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> The size is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Some of my nail techs like to put four fingers in for 30 seconds, and then do the thumb, but I think it works just fine with all five in at one time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this little machine is a wonderful way to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to blame the light just yet.</li>
            <li> it was about time we upgraded to LED instead of UV for no chip manicures and these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> and when I tried a UV light it seemed like the process took forever and a day.  </li>
            <li> Summary of the Ivation LED UV light:  </li>
            <li> So far so good though...</li>
            <li> It was okay while it lasted but in the end the longevity was only as good as what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Some of the products give a general time frame but the variation in wattage impacts this so it would have been nice if the LED machine itself had better instructions.</li>
            <li> Cute and great transaction, wish it was a little more powerful</li>
            <li> so I am familiar with all of them.</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> The price is insanely reasonable, they are adorable, and they work like a charm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product and does a job well, but I would like to get more information and instructions coming with it.  </li>

            <li> Make sure you roll the polish in between the palms of your hands and give it a few good shakes to ensure it mixes well, otherwise it will be watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In general I am thrilled with the gel nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> At the local beauty supply stores I found some great ones but didn&#x27;t want to drop too much money right away.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first because I was comparing it to my old UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry good the nails...</li>
            <li> (my toes are something different, a nicely done toenails are a summertime must)</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it works as it should and better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Just a nice summertime personal pedicure works for me.&lt;br</li>

            <li> (Ruby Pumps and clear gel top coat).</li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first bought this lamp, i was brand new to gel polish.</li>
            <li> This process took hours and sometimes the pinky nail would still not cure right.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp, well worth spending a little more.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and easier to use than the older UV lamps and we liked the new features built into the design.</li>

            <li> Only thing that would have been better is if there had been an instruction manual included, like the paper that was in the box said was included--which it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This works well, but the process is time-consuming, and kind of a drag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok size for the price, only one hand can go inside of the machine.</li>
            <li> You have to cure the foundation, the first coat, the second coat and the top it off sealer.</li>

            <li> This is large enough to fit my full hands in, and cures all brands (China Glaze, Gellish, Orly) that I&#x27;ve used in it.</li>
            <li> It will wipe off easily if you make an initial mistake and there&#x27;s always nail polish remover if you want to change colors</li>

            <li> I was able to get the normal dry/smooth finish only after this step.</li>
            <li> Take a pass if you have large feet.  </li>
            <li> I have also listed several links to the products we used in the video and they are all available of Amazon at reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cures the nails fast.  </li>
            <li> I can fit one hand entirely inside.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has a very sleek design, it has auto shutoff and the timer presets</li>
            <li> SO MUCH, I bought three.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a lot of others you can buy.</li>
            <li> The time that it took to do my nails was really slashed.  </li>
            <li> the curing time is much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of them is putting on too much polish.  </li>

            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and convenient to store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and am shopping for a new one with higher wattage.  </li>
            <li> already tried it out and this little lamp is amazing cures gels and regular polishes with super fast speed.</li>
            <li> * Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the normal process for applying gel polish and used only Gelish products and had issues with the light not curing the polish.</li>
            <li> I used an Essie black gel color coat (Leather on Top), and Gelaze from China Glaze</li>
            <li> EZ Flow 1st Launch Gel Polish, Jellybean]] which is one of TruGel&#x27;s launch colors is a vibrant purple that you can either use on your fingernails or toenails.  </li>
            <li> No need to replace the UV lamps every two years like the older style of lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Professional mani would last a couple of days, but not all that long, and besides being a drain on my time and money, I became kind of paranoid about the tools that are used...  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wife just loves the high glossy UV curable Gel fingernail polishes.</li>

            <li> and it is easily wiped off with a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad after the manicure is all done.</li>
            <li> Nice to have and convenient, Takes slightly longer to dry than the salon brands but works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been less than a year of pretty consistent use and this lamp has burnt out on me.</li>
            <li> , I wish I would&#x27;ve bought in a professional one instead.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I apply professional gel manicures at my job and also an a licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought a professional LED lamp at a licensed beauty supply store and since then, haven&#x27;t been experiencing any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s labeled as being for \\&quot;professional use only,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> With the LED lights, the time under the lamp is slashed considerably.  </li>

            <li> And as far as doing pedicures...</li>
            <li> I like it so far....</li>
            <li> I have now upgraded to a professional lamp.</li>
            <li> In addition I have listed the steps you need to follow in order to get professional results.</li>
            <li> It is not required but just an old habit that she is used to following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, I just set curing time kind of randomly between 30 &amp; 90 seconds, because I really don&#x27;t know what it should be for this lamp.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I love that it takes half the time of my old UV and less risk of UV skin damage.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was big enough for the whole hand.</li>
            <li> The Professional LED Manicure Lamp, comes in five different colors choices...</li>
            <li> A bottle of high quality Gelish polish is only $13 and it will last you a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is fine with me, my color commitment is not that long lasting - I usually want a different color in 5 days to a week.  </li>
            <li> I also used it to dry a regular nail polish, as it emits some heat, so speeds up the process (at least I think so, and drying time on the regular top coat - a sparkly one I put over the gel nail polish) was really short.  </li>
            <li> price of LED lamps was really steep, but they are coming down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and takes up less space than my UV lamp did.</li>
            <li> As soon as my nails were done i took my other newly purchased UV lamp, packaged it up &amp; am preparing to send it back!!!</li>
            <li> Does not dry a hand set of fingers, I have to dry thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> The LED bulbs should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had to watch several youtube videos to try to figure out how long to cure each layer.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on good reviews and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> NEVER DID DRY PROPERLY</li>
            <li> supposedly only need 30 second timer setting , I was Leary and put it at 60 sec.</li>
            <li> it was big enough for my size 10 wide foot.</li>
            <li> You are not fumbling with wet fingernails having open bottles of polish around you and trying to turn on a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A thin coat works much better because too much will make it difficult to dry.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has timer on it but does not cure thumbs at same rate as other four fingers.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, I have not tried to dry it</li>
            <li> On Gel Bonder]] and let it fully dry.  </li>
            <li> Your gels are dry under this layer.</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In our case We cured the second coat for 1 minute as it was a dark plum color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can add the tips of four fingers of my other hand at the same time, if I want a little extra curing for that hand.  </li>
            <li> My polish cures to a dry touch with the Ivation, but isn&#x27;t hardened like the salon manicures which lasts for almost a month!  </li>
            <li> I used the base coat, color and top coat and no matter how long I left them under the lamp they were still not cured.</li>
            <li> I will try 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Product has done everything I have expected it to.  </li>
            <li> 30,60,90 sec &amp; 30 min timer.</li>
            <li> Would not cure, went through the process 3 times, set the timer for 90 sec and still nothing, returned it for a refund</li>
            <li> And LEDs were too expensive at first, so not feasible.  </li>
            <li> : I would give 5 stars but haven&#x27;t tested this on other gel polishes yet.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is the brand of polish or some other factor.</li>
            <li> The Ivation is small, but has enough room to put my foot in.  </li>
            <li> Repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I looked a couple of moths ago it turned out LEDs wend down in price, so I did some research and decided on Ivation.  </li>
            <li> Just on one hand the curing time went from 10 minutes for two coats down to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Previous review May 2015</li>
            <li> The LED lights take a lot less energy and</li>
            <li> Not to mention MUCH less harmful on the skin, and no bulbs to replace.</li>
            <li> You may get a wrinkled mess for your efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small in size, the timers are extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I wasted a bunch of product and time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s user error or the lamp.</li>
            <li> just because I am hard on my nails, and the nail polish would chip in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a hard process because I&#x27;ve done it).  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a hard process because I&#x27;ve done it).  </li>
            <li> : In response to some negative reviews about gel polish not curing all the way, please keep in mind that gel polishes leave a tacky residue after they harden, it&#x27;s called an inhibition layer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just experimenting and don&#x27;t have everything down pat, but there are a couple of things that can make it difficult to cure your nails.  </li>
            <li> I hate chipped nail polish, so I ended up re-doing my nails every day, and that just got old, so I stopped altogether.  </li>
            <li> I am no expert, tough</li>
            <li> The bulbs on my UV were exposed and one was broken.  </li>
            <li> With Red Carpet gel color, terrible.  </li>
            <li> The LEDs are protected and not as vulnerable to breakage.  </li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 30 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp after seeing the reviews and I am extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works okay, I wish I would&#x27;ve bought in a professional one instead. This one just takes a lot longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product and does a job well, but I would like to get more information and instructions coming with it.  I can&#x27;t figure out the wattage and accordingly have problems calculating the correct curing time. I am no expert, tough, that may just be me having no idea.  In general I am thrilled with the gel nail polishes.  A couple of years ago I stopped using nail polish on my nails (my toes are something different, a nicely done toenails are a summertime must) just because I am hard on my nails, and the nail polish would chip in a day or two.  I hate chipped nail polish, so I ended up re-doing my nails every day, and that just got old, so I stopped altogether.  Professional mani would last a couple of days, but not all that long, and besides being a drain on my time and money, I became kind of paranoid about the tools that are used...  So I only got it infrequently.  I did not want UV lamp because of the exposure to... UV rays.  Maybe I AM paranoid.  And LEDs were too expensive at first, so not feasible.  Then when I looked a couple of moths ago it turned out LEDs wend down in price, so I did some research and decided on Ivation.  So far it&#x27;s working well, I just set curing time kind of randomly between 30 &amp; 90 seconds, because I really don&#x27;t know what it should be for this lamp.  I also used it to dry a regular nail polish, as it emits some heat, so speeds up the process (at least I think so, and drying time on the regular top coat - a sparkly one I put over the gel nail polish) was really short.  A couple of minutes - like 2 or 3.  But that might have been a speedy drying top coat, I don&#x27;t know, I have not tried to dry it naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel manicures last me anytime from 4 to 10 days, depending on the time I spend prepping and cleaning nail before and during application.  That is fine with me, my color commitment is not that long lasting - I usually want a different color in 5 days to a week.  All in all it&#x27;s been a good experience and Ivation LED manicure lamp is a good and fairly inexpensive way to try gel manicures at home.  I am looking forward to using it on my toenails, I have small feet, so it should be OK.  We&#x27;ll see in the spring :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good!  Cures the nails fast.  supposedly only need 30 second timer setting , I was Leary and put it at 60 sec. timer just to be sure. I will try 30 sec. next time.  Will update later if needed😀</li>
            <li> I apply professional gel manicures at my job and also an a licensed cosmetologist. I purchased this lamp after seeing the reviews and I am extremely disappointed. I use OPI, Gelish &amp; Essie gels at my work so I am familiar with all of them. At home I use OPI Gel color. I tried giving myself a manicure about 10 times with this lamp and I found that it would not cure the pinky nail properly. I would have to do my pinky, cure that, do the index, middle and ring finger, and then do the thumb separately. This process took hours and sometimes the pinky nail would still not cure right. I wasted a bunch of product and time. I went out and bought a professional LED lamp at a licensed beauty supply store and since then, haven&#x27;t been experiencing any issues. Don&#x27;t buy this lamp. The lights are only on the top in the inside of the lamp, and none on the sides.</li>
            <li> Cute and great transaction, wish it was a little more powerful</li>
            <li> Used the video that is in the first review and I ended up with as good or even better Gelish manicure than I&#x27;ve gotten at the salon.  This lamp is awesome!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on good reviews and have not been disappointed.  great price and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> no users manual!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents listed in enclosed sheet indicate users manual included--not there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may revise later, once my wife and I figure out how to use it. What are they thinking?</li>
            <li> Awesome light!! Works with all gel lines.. I saw some reviews on here that weren&#x27;t good.. They said it didn&#x27;t cure. If you do it correctly it WILL WORK. Sometimes the top coat seems tacky, alcohol on a cotton ball works great! I&#x27;d buy another if I needed to!!</li>
            <li> Works well- needed an Australian power plug tho...</li>
            <li> This is large enough to fit my full hands in, and cures all brands (China Glaze, Gellish, Orly) that I&#x27;ve used in it. Nice compact size, quick cure.</li>
            <li> Love it. I do my own nails and it&#x27;s works just like the salon ones. Just wish it was big enough for the whole hand.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK FOR ME AS OUTLINED.NAILS NEVER DID DRY PROPERLY</li>
            <li> Updated review Nov 2016:  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and am shopping for a new one with higher wattage.  I liked it at first because I was comparing it to my old UV lamp.  Now I prefer LED.  This lamp is only 12W while the salons use 64W. My polish cures to a dry touch with the Ivation, but isn&#x27;t hardened like the salon manicures which lasts for almost a month!  Previous review May 2015: I would give 5 stars but haven&#x27;t tested this on other gel polishes yet. It works great with Gelish brand base coat and top coats so far (5stars for that). With Red Carpet gel color, terrible.  With IBD gel color, OK. I&#x27;m not going to blame the light just yet. Perhaps it is the brand of polish or some other factor. In any case, I love that it takes half the time of my old UV and less risk of UV skin damage. The size is fine for me. I can fit one hand entirely inside. I can add the tips of four fingers of my other hand at the same time, if I want a little extra curing for that hand.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and takes up less space than my UV lamp did.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when I first bought this lamp, i was brand new to gel polish. I tried it, and thought it didnt work because the polish was tacky between laters. Well, after some research, that is how it is supposed to be!! Its call the inhibition layer. The topcoat is the only one that is no tacky when cured. I have been using this lamp for about 2 or 3 months now and LOVE it!!!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the CND products.</li>
            <li> Top of the line. I had become familiar with this lamp when a relative fixed my nails. She told me of the importance of getting the right light (no uv lighting)!The drying method is very good, smooth, even, and quick. It is also easy to use if you are doing your own nails. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Light works great, so far I have used it with Fingerpaints polish and OPI gel polish.</li>
            <li> Product has done everything I have expected it to.  Great item!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it works as it should and better than I had expected. It has a very sleek design, it has auto shutoff and the timer presets are as follows: 30,60,90 seconds and 30 minutes. The Professional LED Manicure Lamp, comes in five different colors choices...It&#x27;s so worth the price. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, I really love mine and I hope that you love yours too.I highly recommend this product. Best</li>
            <li> Awesome light! And a great price, cures in about 30 seconds. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this led lamp at a great price and it works as i had hoped it would. Happy I bought it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE LAMPS SO MUCH, I bought three. I own a salon and it was about time we upgraded to LED instead of UV for no chip manicures and these are fantastic. The price is insanely reasonable, they are adorable, and they work like a charm. Some of my nail techs like to put four fingers in for 30 seconds, and then do the thumb, but I think it works just fine with all five in at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic purchase. Very happy with these lamps.</li>
            <li> Nice machine. Much cheaper than a lot of others you can buy. It gets the job done. I see the people reviewing that the gel doesn&#x27;t cure -- I can&#x27;t help but to think they aren&#x27;t wiping the tacky layer after the topcoat. I&#x27;ve never had any curing problems with this machine</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1LDK6FAJLPI91]]In the summertime I love to dress up my toenails and when I tried a UV light it seemed like the process took forever and a day.  The Ivation is small, but has enough room to put my foot in.  Take a pass if you have large feet.  The time that it took to do my nails was really slashed.  The LED lights take a lot less energy and the curing time is much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time for curing is supposed to be something in the line of 10 seconds to a minute, but I wasn&#x27;t timing the process.  You do need a gel polish that works in both a UV and LED lamp (they are interchangeable).  No your Mabelline or Revlon won&#x27;t cure under these lights.  I like the look of a gel polish, but I don&#x27;t do my fingernails.  Just a nice summertime personal pedicure works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of LED lamps was really steep, but they are coming down.  The LED bulbs should last a long time.  The bulbs on my UV were exposed and one was broken.  The LEDs are protected and not as vulnerable to breakage.  I tried to get a replacement bulb for the UV and never got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  60 Long-Life LED Bulbs for Quick Drying w/o Heat&lt;br /&gt;►  1/40,000th the UV Exposure of Traditional Lamps&lt;br /&gt;►  One-Button Operation w/Automatic Shutoff&lt;br /&gt;►  Timer Presets: 30/60/90 Seconds &amp; 30 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;►  7.59\\&quot; x 7.71\\&quot; x 3.93\\&quot; - Weighs Just 10.5 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to use [[ASIN:B008MCH7Z4 EZ Flow 1st Launch Gel Polish, Jellybean]] which is one of TruGel&#x27;s launch colors is a vibrant purple that you can either use on your fingernails or toenails.  It&#x27;s labeled as being for \\&quot;professional use only,\\&quot; but with the Ivation LED Manicure Lmp it&#x27;s one of those things you can do at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had all my materials together I simply followed the instructional video on the TruGel website.  You can either go it alone or have fun with a friend.  Make sure you roll the polish in between the palms of your hands and give it a few good shakes to ensure it mixes well, otherwise it will be watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put on some protective gloves if you do your fingernails regularly.  With the LED lights, the time under the lamp is slashed considerably.  I&#x27;m just experimenting and don&#x27;t have everything down pat, but there are a couple of things that can make it difficult to cure your nails.  One of them is putting on too much polish.  A thin coat works much better because too much will make it difficult to dry.  You may get a wrinkled mess for your efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USING THE IVATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Prep your nails and cuticles properly.  If you don&#x27;t the bonder and polish won&#x27;t adhere well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Apply a coat of [[ASIN:B008K5Y2X8 Ez Flow TruGel Bond-It-On Gel Bonder]] and let it fully dry.  You can do all your fingernails and thumbs at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Apply [[ASIN:B00893PTWO Ez Flow TruGel base coat]] to four fingers (you will be doing the thumbs separately).  Make sure you do the tip edge of your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  Cure all four fingers for 1 minute in the Ivation (I&#x27;m guesstimating my times here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)  You should do your thumbs separately to make sure that they cure properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7)  Apply [[ASIN:B00893PTWO Ez Flow TruGel base coat]] to your thumbs.  Make sure you do the tip edge of your thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8)  Place both your thumbs beneath the Ivation for one minute.  Press them flat to ensure best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9)  Apply your gel polish of choice to your fingernails.  This must be a polish specifically made for LED/UV lamps or it won&#x27;t work properly.  I chose to use [[ASIN:B008MCH7Z4 EZ Flow 1st Launch Gel Polish, Jellybean]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10)  Cure all four fingers for 90 seconds in the Ivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11)  Repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12)  You should do your thumbs separately to make sure that they cure properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13)  Apply your gel polish of choice to your thumbnails.  Makesure you do the tip edges of your thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14)  Place both your thumbs beneath the Ivation for 90 seconds.  Press them flat to ensure best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15) Apply a second coat, repeating the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16)  Apply a coat of [[ASIN:B00893SY5S EX Flow Trugel System Top Coat]], repeating the same process, including drying under the LED lamp for 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It obviously will take a bit of practice to make perfect, but because this is a long-lasting polish there is plenty in the bottle to play around with.  It will wipe off easily if you make an initial mistake and there&#x27;s always nail polish remover if you want to change colors (it&#x27;s a hard process because I&#x27;ve done it).  I prefer the acetone-free which is readily available locally.  The last gel polish job I did I waited until the polish was ready to come off (end of summer) and oddly enough it pulled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by the distributor for review.sure you do the tip edges of your thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14)  Place both your thumbs beneath the Ivation for 90 seconds.

            <li> Super Duper fast shipping..and I got it on a Sunday so cool! ..already tried it out and this little lamp is amazing cures gels and regular polishes with super fast speed. So glad I purchased this product. :)</li>
            <li> For the money, very good!</li>
            <li> wife said it works great</li>
            <li> Test ran this LED lamp on my color swatch using gelish &amp; shellac, and then on my own nails. As soon as my nails were done i took my other newly purchased UV lamp, packaged it up &amp; am preparing to send it back!!! This lamp is truly incredible, simple &amp; sleek! 30,60,90 sec &amp; 30 min timer. The quality for the price cannot be beat. 30 second cure with this lamp vs. 120 second cure in the UV lamp. Not to mention MUCH less harmful on the skin, and no bulbs to replace. Even if you dont purchase this exact lamp, just remember LED &amp;#62; UV always!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to get a gel manicure right at home. And this little machine is a wonderful way to do it. It comes with 4 preset times of 30/60/90 seconds and 30 minutes. And as far as doing pedicures...it was big enough for my size 10 wide foot.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has timer on it but does not cure thumbs at same rate as other four fingers.</li>
            <li> Works great! You will need to follow your manufacturers directions for the gel you are using., as well as experiment with the time for casting technique.</li>
            <li> It works great. Only thing that would have been better is if there had been an instruction manual included, like the paper that was in the box said was included--which it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This works well, but the process is time-consuming, and kind of a drag. I think it is just easier to go to a salon to get gel nails.</li>
            <li> Nice to have and convenient, Takes slightly longer to dry than the salon brands but works well.</li>
            <li> I could not get my nails to cure under this lamp. I used the base coat, color and top coat and no matter how long I left them under the lamp they were still not cured. Not sure if it&#x27;s user error or the lamp.</li>
            <li> Small in size, the timers are extremely helpful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this light, it dries my nails super quick, base coat 30seconds, gel polish 60 seconds, top coat 90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;And its really cute too,</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!!  A good price for this lamp.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t say the watts, turned to be just 12</li>
            <li> Extremely impressed. Excellent product especially for the price</li>
            <li> I like it so far....I&#x27;ve only used it to speed up the drying of my regular nail polish. No gel yet, but I&#x27;ll be doing that today so I&#x27;ll update my review then. It&#x27;s an ok size for the price, only one hand can go inside of the machine. But if you want both hands in then you&#x27;ll have to pay more so there it is. So far so good though...</li>
            <li> I bought 3 so far, one for my self and the rest as gifts because this works great! Can&#x27;t wait till hristmas so I can give out more!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I was looking for a nice lamp to start doing my shellac manicure at home. At the local beauty supply stores I found some great ones but didn&#x27;t want to drop too much money right away. Based on this lamp&#x27;s reviews I decided to give it a try. I used an Essie black gel color coat (Leather on Top), and Gelaze from China Glaze (Ruby Pumps and clear gel top coat). Trying to grow my nails back out, damn you shampoo bowls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: In response to some negative reviews about gel polish not curing all the way, please keep in mind that gel polishes leave a tacky residue after they harden, it&#x27;s called an inhibition layer and it is easily wiped off with a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad after the manicure is all done. Your gels are dry under this layer. Yay science!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been less than a year of pretty consistent use and this lamp has burnt out on me. It was okay while it lasted but in the end the longevity was only as good as what I paid for. I have now upgraded to a professional lamp.</li>
            <li> great product works perfectly, worth every penny ... super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I wish there were instructions included with this. I had to watch several youtube videos to try to figure out how long to cure each layer. Some of the products give a general time frame but the variation in wattage impacts this so it would have been nice if the LED machine itself had better instructions.</li>
            <li> Works well.  product works as it should and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Would not cure, went through the process 3 times, set the timer for 90 sec and still nothing, returned it for a refund</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry good the nails...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FFIG7PYT4JF2]]My wife just loves the high glossy UV curable Gel fingernail polishes. The polish stays on easily for 2 weeks or more, protects her nails from breaking and helps her to grow her nails longer. The polishes just look glossier and nicer and she likes the quality and selection. She has been using a UV lamp to cure her nails and was eager to try this newer technology UV LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having your nails gel polished in our area is $28 per application. That equals $728 per year for an application every two weeks plus sales tax and tip. You can easily spend over $1000 a year going to the nail salon. You can do your own nails hundreds of times for ¼ that cost at home! A bottle of high quality Gelish polish is only $13 and it will last you a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have created a video showing the features and benefits of this new lamp and I have listed them below. In addition I have listed the steps you need to follow in order to get professional results. We just started doing this some months ago and trying to find all of the steps was not so easy. Perhaps this list will save you some time. I have also listed several links to the products we used in the video and they are all available of Amazon at reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a new design light that uses 12 watt LEDs to cure your fingernail polish and here are some of the features and benefits of this LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;* It features longer life LEDs that can last up to 5 years of continuous use.  50,000 hours of LED life.&lt;br /&gt;* No need to replace the UV lamps every two years like the older style of lights.&lt;br /&gt;* Shorter cure times in the 30 second to 1 minute range versus 2 to 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;* Does not produce heat like the UV lamps.&lt;br /&gt;* Reduced power consumption using lower wattage LEDs&lt;br /&gt;* Greatly reduce the time to cure your nails and this will speed up the process and save you a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;* LED lights don&#x27;t lose UV curing power over time as they age like UV lamps do.&lt;br /&gt;* Reduced skin damage caused by UV exposure.&lt;br /&gt;* LEDs are not easily broken as they are not glass bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;* 1 year product warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED UV lamp really speeds up the curing process and it is a real time saver. Just on one hand the curing time went from 10 minutes for two coats down to 5 minutes. This means you can save 5 minutes in the curing time for two hands. You have to cure the foundation, the first coat, the second coat and the top it off sealer. The easy to reach top timer push buttons are easy to use and start the lamp to come on.  You are not fumbling with wet fingernails having open bottles of polish around you and trying to turn on a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife always uses UV protection gloves on her hands and arms when doing her nails to avoid over exposure to UV rays. Only her nails are exposed to the UV LEDs. It is not required but just an old habit that she is used to following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels in a LED curing lamp:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape the nail using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball. Make sure you remove all cotton fibers.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish pH Bond to nails&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 30 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV cured gel polish to the nail surface and to the nail edge.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the Ivation UV LED lamp for 30 seconds for a light color or possible longer for a darker color. (We used 30 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;* Apply a second coat of polish and cure it.  In our case We cured the second coat for 1 minute as it was a dark plum color.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the Ivation LED UV lamp for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (If any exists) of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail.

It is much faster and easier to use than the older UV lamps and we liked the new features built into the design.

            <li> Love this lamp, well worth spending a little more. It&#x27;s fast and convenient to store. The package arrived promptly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Does not dry a hand set of fingers, I have to dry thumbs separately. No too happy with that.</li>
            <li> I followed the normal process for applying gel polish and used only Gelish products and had issues with the light not curing the polish. I ended up letting each hand cure a total of 6 minutes and it still hasn&#x27;t cured properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I swiped my nails with a cotton ball soaked in acetone remover, it seemed to take care of the tacky texture and finish the curing. I was able to get the normal dry/smooth finish only after this step. If you have problems with it curing, try this. It worked for me!</li>
