            <li>I love the Boots #7 line of products and this exfoliator does the trick!</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the product, so I purchased the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Eye Cream - which I also love.</li>
            <li>She has been able to use this successfully, without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and smoothe.</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliator -</li>
            <li>I began with the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Beauty Serum after hearing rave reviews on some talk show.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and face is very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This is the gentlest AND most effective exfoliator I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I think I like Oil Olay&#x27;s Regererist microdermabrasion better.</li>
            <li>and I think it feels like it has a more peeling effect.</li>
            <li>and I feel totally comfortable saying this is the most effective mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and look of my aging skin after I use this product.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s love.</li>
            <li>and my pores look so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for those days (you know which ones,) when I put on BB creamer foundation  and suddenly see lots of flaking skin that I didn&#x27;t know was there.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 year old with a light complexion and this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I use this a couple of times a week and just love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am now almost exclusively a No7 girl - and after results like the ones I enjoy with this micro-dermabrasion exfoliator, I look forward to trying the rest of their line!</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper and more effective !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good for the first run.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it either, I don&#x27;t even remember if it has a smell at all, if that helps, so it can&#x27;t be strong if there is one.  </li>
            <li>The No7 Beautiful Skin Foaming Cleanser works wonders on removing the daily grime...</li>
            <li>A huge noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It really is a light creamy exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I went from refusing to leave the house without make up to feeling comfortable make up free in a matter of weeks.</li>

            <li>Boots is #1 in Britain &amp; has a great following in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kendall</li>
            <li>It feels so good and soft to the touch</li>
            <li>As far as a bleaching quality I can&#x27;t comment because I am so fair I didn&#x27;t notice anything.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to so many people and they have had positive experiences too!</li>
            <li>Love it - good scrub, use little and scrub soft, does a great job.</li>
            <li>however it did lighten the skin, so do make sure you fully cover so it does not leave spots    as with sun tan lotion blend in very very well.    </li>
            <li>I have bought this over and over and over, it makes my face unbelievably soft--i love boots no 7 products!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is shiny and freshly looking, like glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the micro-dermabrasion for about 2 months and my friends have commented several times how good my skin looks Which for someone who will be 60 this year</li>
            <li>I love how soft and easy it was to use this cream.</li>
            <li>but that faded quickly).  </li>
            <li>When you remove this product, your skin is a healthy pink and has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>But it only made my skin feel really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to ditch foundation completely!</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after using, but then a couple of days later, I am broke out.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin smooth, not irritating at all</li>
            <li>I recommend using it twice to three times a week to keep your skin looking fresh.</li>
            <li>I make sure I use a beauty product for at least 3-4 weeks before I make a fair judgement about it with the understanding that nothing works miracles overnight.</li>
            <li>If you need serious results I would recommend something else, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good exfoliator and you have okay skin</li>
            <li>and I really do look more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I also like the healthy glow you are left with after using this - it only lasts a little while, but I feel like my skin is healthy and beautiful.</li>

            <li>I have been getting professional microdermabrasion for many years now, and while I love the results, I simply cannot afford it any longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sloughs off the top layer of dead skin and makes my face look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>and it came very fast</li>
            <li>I rub it into my face - probably a little longer than I should - because it feels so good.</li>
            <li>Left my face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>(I just looked a bit more red as if I had been working out</li>
            <li>if doing for the first time do it a week before going to a party/event, just incase you have issues or irration.  </li>
            <li>see if you have no reaction at first, then increase if you feel you need to.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the instructions described including using it twice a week</li>
            <li>Exactly what I like and need.</li>
            <li>I love the entire line.</li>
            <li>First time using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is now on my MUST HAVE list - which is pretty short, since I don&#x27;t use much make up or many</li>
            <li>This is now on my MUST HAVE list - which is pretty short, since I don&#x27;t use much make up or many</li>
            <li>really makes your face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So, I looked it up on Amazon and saw additional positive reviews, so I ordered.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care for harsh scrubs, but I&#x27;m always looking for something that will really clean out my pores and make my face feel - and look - extra clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is gentle too, even though it works.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like a real winner discovering this, I just wish I used this much, much sooner.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use too much in the beggining</li>
            <li>I really like this exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper than Boots exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Very nice,quality product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t travel much</li>
            <li>A gentle touch is all it takes.</li>
            <li>but this takes clean to the next level!</li>
            <li>It is fine enough to remove blackheads, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>So I only use it for the special days, the day of.</li>
            <li>This exfoliating scrub is AH-mazing - it is light and leaves your face a little tingly, feeling incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>This product feels on your face like the products used at high end salons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this to others!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one other Boots facial exfoliator before and it was nice.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the professional</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin and leaves your face with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Soft and supple skin is taken to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>You can use this and go right back to applying your make-up.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin that breaks out from any sort of granular scrub.</li>
            <li>It is fun to use and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that it is only recommended to be used twice a week, though.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really reduce skin discoloration due to mild acne scarring, but so far seems to have helped breakouts clear faster.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But if someone has sensitive skin I would get this over Oil Olay.</li>
            <li>I have used it three times so far and a considerable difference from then</li>
            <li>My face feels SO soft after every use.</li>
            <li>It was simple to use, yet I couldn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>morning, I looked in the mirror - and WOW.</li>
            <li>Very pricey though, think I may go back to a lower price brand, don&#x27;t find anything earth shattering about this brand, over priced in my book.</li>
            <li>It is abrasive, but not harsh.</li>
            <li>Was your face first then completely dry both your face and hands before applying to your face.</li>
            <li>I highly, HIGHLY recommend the entire line of No7 products.</li>
            <li>Definitely smoothed out the dry patches after first use.</li>
            <li>did a little research online for do-it-yourself products and this particular product seemed to be highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin, and this somehow has really helped with the oil production and helped keep the shine down.</li>
            <li>I have tried an extensive list of products to help improve the look of my skin to make me less inclined to pick but none really did what I was looking for on my post grad budget.</li>
            <li>I tested it for a week when I wore no makeup, and I was really astonished at how little I seemed to have to blot or wash my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one other Boots facial exfoliator before and it was nice. But this one is even better! It really is a light creamy exfoliator. I had read the package directions and thought it would be something that would maybe make my face feel uncomfortable or red. But it only made my skin feel really nice and clean. Nice and smoothe. I will buy this one for now on. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after using, but then a couple of days later, I am broke out. So I only use it for the special days, the day of.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very nice and works well.  I bought it to see if it would fade my acne scars.  After using it twice a week for a few weeks I do notice a difference.  It is fun to use and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it either, I don&#x27;t even remember if it has a smell at all, if that helps, so it can&#x27;t be strong if there is one.  It is gentle too, even though it works.  My skin wasn&#x27;t red after I used it (I just looked a bit more red as if I had been working out but that faded quickly).  It didn&#x27;t make me break out or anything either.</li>
            <li> A really great product for the price. I recommend using it twice to three times a week to keep your skin looking fresh. I have oily/combination skin, and this somehow has really helped with the oil production and helped keep the shine down. I tested it for a week when I wore no makeup, and I was really astonished at how little I seemed to have to blot or wash my face.</li>
            <li> I have bought this over and over and over, it makes my face unbelievably soft--i love boots no 7 products!!!</li>
            <li> what this is, a suspension of aluminum oxide crystals in a creamy base with mineral oil. Why they cannot mix this with cleanser so it takes only 1 step? answer. because the crystals would sink down to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;what makes this product work at all?  answer  the aluminum oxide crystals.&lt;br /&gt;I just use the crystals mixed with my foaming cleanser it is much cheaper and more effective ! win/win</li>
            <li> All true--all that other reviewers say about this product. My skin is shiny and freshly looking, like glowing and smooth. It feels so good and soft to the touch, I feel like a real winner discovering this, I just wish I used this much, much sooner. For what it does to my skin, the price is truly remarkable!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin after use/refreshing!!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes a big difference in skin condition.</li>
            <li> my skin is hyper senstitive and this does not irritate me. take it from me, who has wasted lots of monies to try stuff to only throw into trash after one use.    the skin felt so smooth and looked fresh!!!!! it&#x27;s not drying at all and did not burn my eyes. it did not leave any rash or scaring, like the pore extrators do    it keeps the face a flush for a few hours and not more than that, so do it at night to take advantage of the sleeping hours.    however it did lighten the skin, so do make sure you fully cover so it does not leave spots    as with sun tan lotion blend in very very well.    if doing for the first time do it a week before going to a party/event, just incase you have issues or irration.  don&#x27;t use too much in the beggining see if you have no reaction at first, then increase if you feel you need to.</li>
            <li> Using all of the kit products seems to soften the skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It is a very good moisturizer and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this exfoliating scrub. It is fine enough to remove blackheads, and leaves my skin feeling very soft. Be aware that it is only recommended to be used twice a week, though.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and for the price excellent. It does make my skin smooth, not irritating at all but I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin. I think I like Oil Olay&#x27;s Regererist microdermabrasion better. It turns warn when you combine the two &#x27;potions&#x27; and I think it feels like it has a more peeling effect. But if someone has sensitive skin I would get this over Oil Olay.</li>
            <li> I never though I would see the day when I gave a mask 5 stars but this one earned it. I make sure I use a beauty product for at least 3-4 weeks before I make a fair judgement about it with the understanding that nothing works miracles overnight. I have used this product for 3 weeks and I feel totally comfortable saying this is the most effective mask I have ever used. I have extremely fair, very sensitive, acne prone skin that I have an awful habit of compulsively picking at. I have tried an extensive list of products to help improve the look of my skin to make me less inclined to pick but none really did what I was looking for on my post grad budget. This entire at home microdermabrasion takes 2 minutes, thats it. The same time it takes me to wash my face at night. I did exactly as the instructions described including using it twice a week and it has helped my acne prone skin exponentially! As far as a bleaching quality I can&#x27;t comment because I am so fair I didn&#x27;t notice anything. I went from refusing to leave the house without make up to feeling comfortable make up free in a matter of weeks. I have recommended this to so many people and they have had positive experiences too!</li>
            <li> This product feels on your face like the products used at high end salons.  Goes on nicely and face is very smooth afterwards.  I had been using apricot scrubs and they were breaking the blood vessels in my face - this product does not!</li>
            <li> Love the feel and look of my aging skin after I use this product.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Love this product everyone in england uses it  really makes your face feel soft and smooth. Very nice product and it came very fast</li>
            <li> Works well with my Neutrogena exfoliator.</li>
            <li> After 1 use skin is glowing, have yet to see if it helps dark spots so we will see!</li>
            <li> I had researched about this product a lot, before placing an order. And it works! I have used it three times so far and a considerable difference from then to now!&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this to others!&lt;br /&gt;I already have recommended it to my sister and my friends!</li>
            <li> it does the job, you can feel the cream working on your face. i would recommend it to friends. good stuff</li>
            <li> I researched a micro-dermabrasion product and saw great reviews for this.  I have to say I agree and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I just recently discovered this line of skin care and I love it. I have been using the micro-dermabrasion for about 2 months and my friends have commented several times how good my skin looks Which for someone who will be 60 this year is always  a great thing to hear. This product works and is a good value for your money-try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliator - and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Awesome face scrub. Gets the job done. Real tiny gritty scrubby pieces. Exactly what I like and need. Scrub then apply my moisturizer and my face feels so good. Mmm</li>
            <li> I use this every other day as instructed by the directions.  It is a rougher exfoliator (I guess this is why they suggest it should be used every other day)  but the results are the same.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s love. I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for about a month now. I use it 3 times a week. My face feels SO soft after every use. I&#x27;m seeing a lot of my red post acne marks fading and my pores look so much better. I follow up with a witch hazel toner and the Boots Lift and Luminate night cream. My skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li> Very nice performance for the money.  I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks and notice a definite improvement in skin texture after use.  Doesn&#x27;t really reduce skin discoloration due to mild acne scarring, but so far seems to have helped breakouts clear faster.  If you need serious results I would recommend something else, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good exfoliator and you have okay skin this is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I actually&lt;br /&gt;prefer the apricot scrub by St. Ives and it is much cheaper than Boots exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I am a big advocate of exfoliating, and I do so at least three times a week. It sloughs off the top layer of dead skin and makes my face look more youthful.  I love the Boots #7 line of products and this exfoliator does the trick!</li>
            <li> Very nice,quality product. Would not hesitate to purchase again. Works as well as any of the other microderm.cleansers I have used for much less money too!!</li>
            <li> Another great product by No7! I love how soft and easy it was to use this cream. Definitely a great addition to their day and night cream I use.</li>
            <li> This is the gentlest AND most effective exfoliator I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s perfect for those days (you know which ones,) when I put on BB creamer foundation  and suddenly see lots of flaking skin that I didn&#x27;t know was there. You can use this and go right back to applying your make-up.</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional microdermabrasion for many years now, and while I love the results, I simply cannot afford it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research online for do-it-yourself products and this particular product seemed to be highly recommended. So, I looked it up on Amazon and saw additional positive reviews, so I ordered. I was hopeful that I could get at least a fraction of the results I get from an aesthetician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night. It was simple to use, yet I couldn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin. Disappointed, I went to bed after applying lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I looked in the mirror - and WOW. I could see the difference then. Smoother skin, lines and wrinkles almost disappeared, even texture, and even slightly lighter skin tone. Very comparable to the professional experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good for the first run. I will update my review in the future as I continue to use the product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Boots&#x27; Microdermabrasion Exfoliator for about 2 years and I love it.  The trick is you have to use it on dry skin. Was your face first then completely dry both your face and hands before applying to your face. It removes dead skin and leaves your face with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Love it - good scrub, use little and scrub soft, does a great job. Very pricey though, think I may go back to a lower price brand, don&#x27;t find anything earth shattering about this brand, over priced in my book.</li>
            <li> A huge noticeable difference in my skin. I felt like I was looking very dull and worn out. The glow I had a few years ago had faded and in my early thirties I felt like I was wearing my age. A few weeks with using this product twice a week and I have been able to ditch foundation completely! My skin has its glow back and I really do look more vibrant. There is enough product to last about two months. A great value for the at home spa consumer.</li>
            <li> I like Boots products and this is no exception.Left my face clean and smooth.Definitely smoothed out the dry patches after first use. Have only used it twice so will follow up in a couple of months</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Highly recommend it. I am 60 year old with a light complexion and this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and removes the dead skin.  7 does it again.  I love the entire line.</li>
            <li> Very nice for my skin.  I apply it to my dry face.  Once a week works well.</li>
            <li> No7 has stolen my heart. I began with the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Beauty Serum after hearing rave reviews on some talk show. (The View maybe?) I was really happy with the product, so I purchased the Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Eye Cream - which I also love. Added the Beautiful Skin Foaming Cleanser - works awesomely! (Traveling with it sucks - it has leaked every single time I&#x27;ve put it in my checked bag. Not much - but it does get the outside of the bottle slimy. I place it in a plastic zippered bag and rinse it off when I use it - and all is well. I don&#x27;t travel much so it isn&#x27;t that big of an issue for me, but I still wanted to mention it.) Anyway, I then added this glorious product...and I AM OBSESSED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for harsh scrubs, but I&#x27;m always looking for something that will really clean out my pores and make my face feel - and look - extra clean and healthy. Look no further - this is the product that will do those things! And in a short time, too. I use this a couple of times a week and just love what it does for my skin. I don&#x27;t wear make up everyday, so when I do wear it, I feel like my pores can&#x27;t breathe. (Am I crazy??) The No7 Beautiful Skin Foaming Cleanser works wonders on removing the daily grime...but this takes clean to the next level! It is abrasive, but not harsh. I rub it into my face - probably a little longer than I should - because it feels so good. A gentle touch is all it takes. When you remove this product, your skin is a healthy pink and has a nice glow. It also feels incredible! Soft and supple skin is taken to a whole new level. My daughter has very sensitive skin that breaks out from any sort of granular scrub. She has been able to use this successfully, without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I highly, HIGHLY recommend the entire line of No7 products. I have yet to be disappointed in any of the products. This exfoliating scrub is AH-mazing - it is light and leaves your face a little tingly, feeling incredibly soft and smooth. I also like the healthy glow you are left with after using this - it only lasts a little while, but I feel like my skin is healthy and beautiful. This is now on my MUST HAVE list - which is pretty short, since I don&#x27;t use much make up or many skin care products. I am now almost exclusively a No7 girl - and after results like the ones I enjoy with this micro-dermabrasion exfoliator, I look forward to trying the rest of their line!th.

            <li> Good product.  First time using this product.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine.  It&#x27;s a good exfoliator.  My skin feels great&lt;br /&gt;afterwards.  Boots is #1 in Britain &amp; has a great following in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kendall malloy&lt;br /&gt;Chicago</li>
