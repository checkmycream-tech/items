            <li>Great starter pack for Murad.</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Also - if you use makeup try using some that are oil free and dont get into your pores!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!  </li>
            <li>face wash feels amazing when you use it and does a VERY good job removing dirt, oil, and even makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>And Step 2 works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>and I have to say this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I would like to say that Murad Customer support was great, but I have nothing good to say, considering I sent them a message asking for advise and received no reply.</li>
            <li>I love murad and this kit is a GRRREAT DEAL price wise!!!</li>
            <li>Company was pleasant to deal with    </li>
            <li>I tried to be pleasant..</li>
            <li>always loved there product</li>
            <li>but all and all good product.</li>
            <li>good set to start with</li>
            <li>fair complexion and never had any acne issues.  </li>
            <li>This is a good sign, and I am hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>This is a really good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good sized products for a kit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>it smelled good</li>
            <li>But, I will not ever order from Murad again, despite the good reviews they get.</li>
            <li>and this works really good along with the face wash.</li>
            <li>Good product, five stars.</li>
            <li>gave it 2 stars because the product seem to be of good quality when i used them but</li>
            <li>I loved how it made my skin feel and really loved that the acne was cleared up with out the harshness to my skin.  </li>
            <li>im loving the Clinique redness solutions makeup :) its SPF 15, covers up most to all redness from zits, and DOES NOT make you break out :D &amp; its oil free :D!</li>
            <li>Best of luck on your skin&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li>i was VERY satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and Murad works great for clearing skin.</li>
            <li>I love the murade acne kit it work great for your skin</li>
            <li>After two months I am 200% more confidant and happy with my skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re purging to this extent and still made it through to the first month, good for you; I honestly wish the best for you.</li>
            <li>What more could I want?!</li>
            <li>of course what most matters is that IT DID HELP WITH ACNE!</li>
            <li>I love Murad products!</li>
            <li>My favorite acne wash!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product, my face looks cleaner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I am now using Dermalogica and its amazing.</li>
            <li>Murad Acne Treatment Concealer is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>This worked amazingly, but I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing improvements in my skin with these products.</li>
            <li>Even my pores are shrinking, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>They told me of the problems with another product...and are thrilled not to have those headaches with this product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it is a nice product</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I use instead of your own hands.</li>
            <li>Good to know it works on many people but probably not me.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t do it for my kind of acne.</li>
            <li>and this works as good or better than anything of those ever did.</li>
            <li>Works to cleanse your face but isn&#x27;t effective for acne as they claim.</li>
            <li>Just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li>my skin will heal on its own.</li>
            <li>So far so good I am loving it!!!</li>
            <li>The products have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>The system is very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It does not solve the problem completely, but it does the best among all I have tried.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE the gentleness and simplicity of the lotion.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was using more and more make up to cover up break outs.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the recommended usage amounts and read the directions about exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be able to get another month out of the amount I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ps, you might want to shop around for better prices.  </li>
            <li>but I look better</li>
            <li>, I have not found one better then Amazon.</li>
            <li>Still LOVE Murad.</li>
            <li>i have more whiteheads than before i started using the system.</li>
            <li>I like the Neutrogena products a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was really and truly expecting great results.</li>
            <li>I would give Murad 0 stars if I was able to.</li>
            <li>Mostly around my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit and have been so pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Murad Acne line for about 2.5 months now, and am about to order more.</li>
            <li>It really seems like a hit or miss with this product, I read reviews about it being great for some</li>
            <li>I decided to use murad because a friend LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>But I thought that it would get better and my face would soon stop healing</li>
            <li>and I am glad I am no longer using it</li>
            <li>More breakouts than before.  </li>
            <li>I love this product line for my combination oil-dry skin.</li>
            <li>I get hormonal &amp; stress breakouts along my chin mostly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soooooo pressing on.  :-)</li>
            <li>I bought it at a reputable place and was optomistic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel sticky after using it (make sure to put the Lotion (step 3) on or else your skin will feel sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the acne face wash, does a great job of keeping the oil of my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is an okay acne kit</li>
            <li>You get better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many acne treatments and this works better then</li>
            <li>and now my face is about 98% better</li>
            <li>I bought Acnefree at the store and my acne got better in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>But be sure about the usage.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better out there.</li>
            <li>becuase your skin will get better.  </li>
            <li>It never got better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Murad products.</li>
            <li>However, this one did despite being the most inexpensive of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>i just bought a moisturizer that is better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to repurchase.  </li>
            <li>I love the Murad products.</li>
            <li>Fingers crossed it continues to work : )</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I called..spoke to a lovely girl reading from her script.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>A week after stopping using this product my skin looks significantly better than while on Murad.  </li>
            <li>We have now bought the larger products separately, but the kits are a great deal!  </li>
            <li>ok, I still get the honey&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love Murad products and</li>
            <li>and I have been pleased ever since.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up significantly and I have a lot more confidence!</li>
            <li>I tried giving it another week, but by day 14, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting any better.</li>
            <li>Going to order more.</li>
            <li>I love Murad products for me face.</li>
            <li>and you will love it.  </li>
            <li>I have better results with Pevonia spateen line.</li>
            <li>Made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>My face look much better since i started using it.</li>
            <li>A product I buy over the counter in cvs for 10 $ helps me more.</li>
            <li>The compliance is important for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m halfway through week 2 and my skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li>but now i have more zits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love my change to Murad.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling from the eucalyptus oil!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product so far!</li>
            <li>Works and feels clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Understanding that skin is unique to each individual - Murad may be wonderful - just not in our case.</li>
            <li>I am certain this is a good product.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin has improved greatly and I&#x27;ve started to notice the old glow in my skin that I used to have.  </li>
            <li>The sulfur on the spot treatment is good at getting the blemish to purge, and the cleanser is gentle.</li>
            <li>While the product does not yield perfectly clear skin, my skin still feels very nice.</li>
            <li>However, it was very effective in making old zits come to the surface.</li>
            <li>but with make-up, a easy temporary solution until they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a great deal buying through Amazon instead of going through the Murad website &amp; paying more money for the same products.</li>
            <li>I went to Ulta and spoke with a skin specialist, and they said the stuff in Murad is so strong it doesn&#x27;t work on alot of people.</li>
            <li>So I purchased the system, and really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li>At first your skin might break out more, but don&#x27;t freak out, it will get better.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother and more silky after the very first time using the product.</li>
            <li>HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li>and I am still acne free.</li>
            <li>Buying in here on amazon is about 15 bucks cheaper then sephora (plus no taxes and free delivery).....</li>
            <li>So worth the money :-)</li>
            <li>They are pricey for sure, but I believe well worth the money.</li>
            <li>And I guess since it is a hit or miss would caution buyers to try the products in a travel size if available.</li>
            <li>This kit is great, Murad has totally transformed my skin!</li>
            <li>I think one of the most exciting aspects is the oil control.</li>
            <li>There was noticeable improvement and her faced remained smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>The formula is nice on my skin, which is very oily.</li>
            <li>No matter what you answer to or explain what you want, you will be included in the free membership.</li>
            <li>Do I sound like an infomercial?</li>
            <li>and there it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s worked the best without destroying my face.</li>
            <li>Works great on my acne and has definitely cleared it up.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, there is no set of products that will completely get rid of acne problem and Murad stands as the best choice.</li>
            <li>Good- skin feels soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>the &#x27;sulfur mask&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem very useful either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest though, that&#x27;s probably the best my face has been the last 12 years (long term acne sufferer).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results so far</li>
            <li>Within a couple days I noticed my skin felt healthier, it felt smooth and clean hours after I washed.  </li>
            <li>Worked good ;)  noticed results fast</li>
            <li>*it does say that Murad will &amp;#34;PURGE&amp;#34; your skin, meaning get rid of everything first- causing you to break out before getting better, BUT i thought that wouldnt apply to me since I was already using the STARTER KIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks, I saw significant changes.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know if I would be able to use the product twice a day</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product for over $100 on the original website.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clean.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of just these products I needed a deeper clean</li>
            <li>Great product could tell a different right away.</li>
            <li>Cleared my skin right up!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it for about 3 weeks now and my face has lucky cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>Went to an actual dermatologist and she laughed when I told her I was using this system.</li>
            <li>With the order I just placed, I ordered the cleanser and exfolicating gel separately, and then ordered a different Murad moisturizer with SPF that had good review for acne.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait til the full 60 days are</li>
            <li>so you really have to use another moisturizer or sun block on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m going to give this another month to make my full review.</li>
            <li>The directions do tell you how to work up to full strength if this happens to you.</li>
            <li>Good value vs. individual item purchases.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need a more gentle product.</li>
            <li>I would use the cleanser but not the full kit.</li>
            <li>The product has helped my acne a bit but not as much as I would hope for but will continue to use to see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Murad&#x27;s is a nice kit for people that don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and have surface acne.</li>
            <li>and it made my dream come true.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the directions on how much to use-</li>
            <li>I made the change to Bobbi Brown and ditched the so called mineral powders for a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>While using Murad, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with dry, flaky skin (love the skin perfecting lotion, by the way), and I feel like the level of oiliness on my face is perfect...</li>
            <li>i would recommend for people with mild acne</li>
            <li>super oily/ post-pardum breakout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe my acne has been the product of my lovely hormones, so I was looking for extraordinary results, I ended up with mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>The products have helped my ultra-sensitive skin out tremendously and are not drying to my face.  </li>
            <li>it provides for some moisture and glow, but I no longer have a super greasy-looking face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is already clearing up my complexion.</li>
            <li>It quickly helped heal my blemishes as well as preventing acne.</li>
            <li>but then it clears quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have high hopes for these products for sure.</li>
            <li>These products work great, but you have to make sure you use them properly and regularly to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Before, my skin was pretty smooth besides where I was breaking out.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and it&#x27;s the real product!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products (Clinique, Mary Kay, ProActice, Oil of Olay, Almay, Clearacil, Nutrogena, Aveno, Apricot scub, Clean and Clear, etc.)</li>
            <li>found my new acne procuct :)</li>
            <li>but i hope it would work better in preventing new break out</li>
            <li>Previously, I used ProActiv and that worked great for my skin.  </li>
            <li>but i went over the 60 days and still have a lot of products left &#x3D;)!&lt;</li>
            <li>#34;See results in just three days&amp;#34;, which, like all of the other claims that acne medicines blare on their commercials, seemed a bit too good to be true.</li>
            <li>1 week later the prom was a great success with pictures of clear skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the face wash (which will last you forever) is amazing</li>
            <li>but the dryness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though to get rid of the breakouts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with a current system or cannot find an effective system.  </li>
            <li>I hope others will have the success that I have.  </li>
            <li>Not only did my acne improve, but my skin felt and looked more smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li>If you are unsure if this product will work for you or not, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to find more natural remidies.</li>
            <li>So I guess it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>honestly would rather they make a larger cleanser and gel or sell the kit cheaper without those two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the moisturizer lacks greatly in what is needed especially for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Received the product in a timely manner but cased more breakouts than it fixed.</li>
            <li>murad is ok my skin is clear</li>
            <li>If their initial free gift had included samples that lasted more than one or two uses, I would perhaps now be a Murad user.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else we have tried so far.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely broke out on my cheeks and chin, and they are now covered in them.</li>
            <li>So it is definitely worth the purchase, and as the other review said, it does go a bit further than the 30 days, or 60 days, which makes it that much more of a great value.  </li>
            <li>and then I have a few pimples, but it is much better!!  </li>
            <li>Lasts a really long time and cheaper than more products as well!</li>
            <li>For me Murad is just right.  </li>
            <li>like I have right know.</li>
            <li>Also, I did like the accompanying card that shows you the right amount of product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every acne product available with the exception of accutane.  </li>
            <li>From the first few days, I have been getting great results.</li>
            <li>it took a little over 4 weeks for me to really see my skin clear up, but excellent!</li>
            <li>first off its no miracle pills where it will heal/remove your pimples right away.  </li>
            <li>But after a month you will be on your way to a fresh and clean new you.</li>
            <li>I used Murad Acne Complex for 4 months and had great success.</li>
            <li>it made my face super sticky and way too much product for my face to absorb.  </li>
            <li>very, very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall very fast acting, very effective system.  </li>
            <li>This product is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It certainly rivals the competition and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time about three years ago, but I stopped using it because of cost.  </li>
            <li>but when I first tried it the smell gagged me.</li>
            <li>This was one info commerical that I was glad I gave a second look.    </li>
            <li>this is YOUR FIRST MURAD SYSTEM buy, get the STARTER KIT:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Three months later, I didn&#x27;t look any better.    </li>
            <li>When i first saw an ad for it</li>
            <li>and i was VERY upset!</li>
            <li>my face feels really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Murad was my first choice of the brand for acne treatment.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cannot stress enough, is this magic?</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to have any extra tools to apply any of the products</li>
            <li>Always handles my breakouts fast!</li>
            <li>This is not only a lie when it comes to my skin, but I am sure that it has happened to plenty of others.  </li>
            <li>The only reason why I don&#x27;t think the product deserves 5 stars is because it isn&#x27;t that potent against blackheads.</li>
            <li>It has been the first OTC thing that has worked on my acne.  </li>
            <li>Most recently I purchased it via amazon/online to save money.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using this, I noticed the redness going away within the first week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover up!</li>
            <li>It hadn&#x27;t worked the first time</li>
            <li>Three teen boys look better already.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind for the first week</li>
            <li>First thing in the morning, wash with Clarifying Cleanser</li>
            <li>Just be cautious about any company that offers a \\&quot;free&#x27; gift.</li>
            <li>However, as I tried it exactly as instructed for a month or so, I didn&#x27;t see ANY improvements at all.</li>
            <li>Even compared to treatments that are advertised year-long on television, Murad is still my first pick.</li>
            <li>and when i bought this product, most of my pimples were gone or reduced the next morning!</li>
            <li>I used to use the product twice a day but started drying out my skin since i have been using it for about 2 months and switched to only once since my acne has been alot better.</li>
            <li>love it ,always on time or even earlier..</li>
            <li>probably what you&#x27;ll run out of first.</li>
            <li>After investing in this product after much hesitation, I cleared up within 2 months!</li>
            <li>Murad also doesn&#x27;t bleach bedding and towels like benzoyl peroxide products, and my skin is incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since then the only thing I have had to buy more of is the foundation and powder</li>
            <li>It really does work!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this system even when using it at full strength right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>20 and 30 something&#x27;s that need a little help with mild acne!:)</li>
            <li>I spent about $200 in November 2011 on kitting myself out from her counter at a local Department store and have a natural feel coverage that is smooth and glides on, stays on and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my blemishes but gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>The Murad, on the other hand, works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Plan to use it for a full 60 days because I really didn&#x27;t see any real change until about 4 weeks into the routine but when it works it really works.</li>
            <li>I know with the active ingredients and what the product is doing for my skin is amazing, but the smell is a force to be reckoned with.</li>
            <li>Her Lock-It Tattoo foundation is the only thing I have found that completely covers my spots (it&#x27;s amazing) and also doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you literally don&#x27;t have to use much at all, so it may not seem like a lot, but I use it twice a day and still have another month or two left.</li>
            <li>The lotion has pleasant, subtle fragrance, applies easily and leaves the skin soft and moist without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>I had used Differin for a couple of years and had pretty good results with it, except that it made my skin really oily and fairly red (the same thing happened with RetinA).</li>
            <li>I used the ACNE SPOT FAST FIX  3 times a day, a dab on each pimple during that time and it really works!</li>
            <li>Granted my skin is never completely clear, it has cleared up a lot and feels more under control.</li>
            <li>that work just as good if not much better.</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up so much, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that the makeup I am using my face is actively healing my skin while also working as a coverup.</li>
            <li>This particular purchase was so much cheaper and will last me another 60 days until I can afford to get more.</li>
            <li>I am 28 and was having some problems with breaking out in certain spots.</li>
            <li>Large cysts forming on my chin, on the sides of my nose and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating gel similarly is easy to apply and seem to be effective without being irritating.</li>
            <li>The first time I experienced it was shortly after my second son was born and the residual pregnancy hormones left my body.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out!</li>
            <li>After the first week though, if you are consistent by the end of the month your face will be completely clear!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my teenage grandson,  He says it is working fine.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole set if you go through a certain tube faster.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d tried everything available to him over the counter &amp; had very limited success.</li>
            <li>I re-ordered and have been using for the last 2 months and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Murad!</li>
            <li>I decided to start using it again because I am standing up in a wedding, and I really didn&#x27;t want to see photos of myself covered in acne.      </li>
            <li>The prescriptions made me smell and it didn&#x27;t really work.    </li>
            <li>And you do not need to use much of the product at a time.</li>
            <li>Acne FAST treatment-</li>
            <li>I was also getting really depressed</li>
            <li>My face became very oily on my t-zone and my cheeks  </li>
            <li>so I really have nothing</li>
            <li>My texture is starting to smooth out and</li>
            <li>With this in mind &amp; really bc of this reason I wrote this review although my knowledge is very limited.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Turned out he really did &amp;</li>
            <li>after giving birth to my daughter i had so much breakout on my face.</li>
            <li>I like:&lt;br /&gt;-it absorbs fast into your skin</li>
            <li>I tried that and realised how much products that is and</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the Acne Spot Treatment.  </li>
            <li>I suggest buying on Amazon because it&#x27;s much cheaper than in-store:  http://www.amazon.com/Murad-Acne-Treatment-Concealer-Light/dp/B0017SUE96/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1403210456&amp;sr&#x3D;1-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;murad+acne</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the instructions provide a picture of the amount of product that should be used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done the whole barrage of medications (Accutane, everything that ends with &amp;#34;cillin&amp;#34;, Retin A, etc.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much product (a dime size I would guess) to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>This has really helped with my acne</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 months using this Murad kit, I am ready to declare a cautious victory.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin and have tried LOTS of products.</li>
            <li>The combination of products in the acne problem kit work very well.  </li>
            <li>It was quite different from the one I bought in Sephora, and I had confirmed with Murad that they do not longer produce this.</li>
            <li>Not so much for me.</li>
            <li>And of course, they really works.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Not so much...  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>Use this product religiously and your face will clear out, I know many people who have used it</li>
            <li>I had a problem with adult acne a few years ago and tried this product at the suggestion of a friend who had heard good things about it.</li>
            <li>The person I spoke to on their chat-contact-service requested for me a full refund (I was told to dispose of the product and my refund should be apparent on my card in 2-3 business days).</li>
            <li>STAY CLEAR of this product, do not go through the same thing as me and many others.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne mostly cyst type that is stress related.</li>
            <li>The only time the acne would go away enough to feel good about my skin was during the early weeks of summer.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to try this product because it was slightly pricey, but after seeing it for a better deal on amazon I decided to take a chance</li>
            <li>I get nervous using any sort of facial product due to my sensitive skin, but I have used Murad for two months now and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I did find that benzoyl peroxide was the most effective, however it recently began to cause serious rashes on my maturing face (too harsh).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im now going to try other products that contain witch hazel because i really like the reviews on them :)</li>
            <li>Among the set, exfoliating gel and lotion are superior to any other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>This set costs much more to purchase from Sephora or the other makeup stores.</li>
            <li>This is not to say it&#x27;s due to the product itself, in truth I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I have used many other products, and I still broke out.  </li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up significantly and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It helps better than other things he has tried.  </li>
            <li>aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than other places.</li>
            <li>As a twenty-five year old with acne, I can tell you that this product has been working very well for me, when pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve tried has not.</li>
            <li>with most systems, it is possible that you can break out or that your skin can be sensitive to the new product.</li>
            <li>Proactive worked pretty well, but I felt it was so much more harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was aware that this was a stage and would get better after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had clear skin instantaneously, but the result was very fast.</li>
            <li>Her acne completely cleared off her forhead quite quickly, and the rest of her face continued to clear.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product and usually cheaper on amazon than ulta.</li>
            <li>Being 36 years old and still breaking out, Murad is the one product that never fails me.</li>
            <li>The first couple days I used it, my skin felt soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin was burning, inflammed, red, and full of pimples.</li>
            <li>I had acne problems and actually ordered this product on TV in new year and was really excited about the results.</li>
            <li>i still see new breakout here/there throughout this whole process)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But seriously I wish I would have saved my money and stayed with my OTC products because now that I am back to them my skin is feeling better and looking better .THIS</li>
            <li>It is also important  to note that if  you do use the set that is provided, from step 1 to step 4, you should also use a moisture afterwards because it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to switch back to my daily wash of Pronexin which gave me better results.</li>
            <li>but my main issue is jawline cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Prom quickly approaching, some quick help needed, purchased \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot; products while waiting for this highly-advertised product to arrive.  </li>
            <li>It has cleared up some of my acne but for something that costs 3 times as much as a drug store product that can do the same thing it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li>Acne Complex is a great product, I felt the difference in my face with the initial use of the cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The three-step system treatment includes a cleanser, oil, and lotion, all of which leave your skin feeling vibrant and refreshed.</li>
            <li>not bad as far as over the counter acne kits go, but my stubborn acne is barely affected by this concentration of salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>So the main thing is to be patient.</li>
            <li>Getting my first facial was the first step.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li>then my skin exploded week 2-4, mainly the chin away, a bunch of little whiteheads that easily popped with no scarring and a bountiful of blackheads, a couple large pimples on the cheek area....</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and have suffered from adult acne, even though I didn&#x27;t break out much as a teenager.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it did much for my cystic adult acne</li>
            <li>I dont normally write reviews</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cool on the skin, but it does not lather too well and feels difficult to be rinsed.  </li>
            <li>On the second day, my face was swollen, red, hot to the touch and super itchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the system for 3 weeks and from the first few days my skin looked and felt healthy and vibrant</li>
            <li>Especially around on my chin and right below my nose.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using the system and went back to my neutrogena face wash, my acne cleared right up.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t see any miraculous results, the cleansing effect alone just feels plain healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>but as a new patient I coudn&#x27;t get in to see the doctor for six weeks.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t prevent new break out for me</li>
            <li>I had a lot of new acne come up (purging)</li>
            <li>live on the Westcoast, got acne attack on my forehead ever since I started working in Pittsburgh for a year&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I manage to put spot treatment on a newly appearing spot, it disappears within couple of hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other popular treatment systems.  </li>
            <li>After a month of continuous use, other than my skin feeling and looking a bit cleaner, I&#x27;ve yet to see any real improvement in the mild acne I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.  </li>
            <li>There is a minimal purging period (5-7 days) which is short for most acne treatment systems.  </li>
            <li>So that was really exciting, and it&#x27;s slowly starting to clear up blemishes that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>In short, this product line alone does not get rid of acne problem; however, it is very gentle on acne-prone skin, reduces the intensity of breakouts and improves the skin texture.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I was happy to get the whole starting kit for a little less money online.</li>
            <li>I thought I was having an allergic reaction, but found online that many other people have had this same thing.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>i usually used this the most around my \\&quot;time of the month\\</li>
            <li>To be more specific, I got massive cyst like pimples in places where I had never had pimples before, such as my jaw line and forehead.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday and will purchase it from Amazon from now on!</li>
            <li>I have been looking forward to using it twice a day, and it is the first acne product, that I could actually use 2 times a day as directed.  </li>
            <li>I think Klear Action and Acne Free are actually the same product</li>
            <li>I also noticed wherever I applied this product I ended up getting some pretty big pimples, borderline cystic.  </li>
            <li>I think in generally this system works very well</li>
            <li>I first learned about this line from going to Massage Envy locally.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so clear I have not had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>In fact, one of the areas on my neck that had started to clear up by day 11, broke out with a new set of pimples on day 13.</li>
            <li>One positive thing is Murad caused the sales of cover girl prodcuts to go up because i need about a weeks worth of concealer to cover this mess on my face.</li>
            <li>As for the cleanser, I like how it contains salicylic acid and how it does not dry up my skin too much.</li>
            <li>It probably took about a few weeks to really start seeing results and nearly a couple of months to see the full effects of it.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakout for me at all (while it does help clear up old breakout</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time</li>
            <li>, I used Clinique and all it did was dry my skin and irritate any pimples so they would be smaller, but more inflamed and red and noticeable.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; products, it does not leave the skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks to clear up my face.</li>
            <li>None of the products in this kit did anything to clear up my son&#x27;s acne.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using Murad again and really hope that I have enough time to clear this up before my interview.</li>
            <li>and I had hope it would help me to clear up the acne I have been struggling with for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of products over the years to clear up my acne, but nothing has worked as well as the Murad.  </li>
            <li>I have fewer breakouts, heck, even clear skin while on this</li>
            <li>My face stays clear with this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taking forever to get rid of but the rest of my face is clear I will not buy this again or proactive</li>
            <li>I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made my skin 100% clear yet, but it seems well on its way.</li>
            <li>When using this moisturizer alone, my skin started to clear.  </li>
            <li>she reports that it works well and has helped clear her complexion.  </li>
            <li>I used Murad acne complex kit when in my teens and it worked magic on my skin.</li>
            <li>I developed acne on my jawline and forehead.</li>
            <li>For background, I&#x27;m a 25 year old woman, and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 11 years old.  </li>
            <li>I had acne over my entire face, and much of it has cleared up.  </li>
            <li>My blackheads are almost completely gone at this point.  </li>
            <li>every now and again and only very sparingly.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that I have found that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>(I have oily sink) for nearly three months now</li>
            <li>The Acne clearing solution works better than the STEP 2 of the COMPLEX system (the</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this COMPLEX system is not any better.</li>
            <li>After going back to my cheap drug store products, I&#x27;m back to breaking out only during my period.    </li>
            <li>b/c i&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>and my face is completely breaking out</li>
            <li>but this really ruined his skin enough to make him self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li>This product is aggressive on my type of adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman, and after pregnancy my face changed.</li>
            <li>but it improved my acne so much that I can finally &amp;#34;tolerate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work and for a short period of time I thought that it was.</li>
            <li>but I know it can take 6 mos-year for them to completely fade</li>
            <li>I tried this for my acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and have still been having issues with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>it does help treat my old break out/new breakout overtime.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- 25-30 yrs old</li>
            <li>Wow, redness went away.  </li>
            <li>but wow, this truly does work.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll start to see the effects about 2 weeks after using it, but it really kicks in about a month later.  </li>
            <li>It may work for some people but for me who has really sensitive skin, Retinol and Salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my face very itchy and red.</li>
            <li>I feel like it has helped maintain my breakouts, inevitably I still break out but not as much as I did before.</li>
            <li>As far as acne solutions systems go, I think it&#x27;s a trial and error thing.</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin just feels so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>The redness that was usually present in my cheeks has also really improved.     </li>
            <li>It helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I suggest getting the bigger bottle because it saves so much money over time</li>
            <li>find with the Murad Acne line that it keeps my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>So far its been working.</li>
            <li>Like it so far, will update on how it treats acne in 30 days</li>
            <li>guess what did it work so far nothing has worked on me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with persistent adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early on in my daughter&#x27;s treatment plan, but we did not notice a difference...sadly.</li>
            <li>So far so good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started with one or two blemishes on my chin and now i have a complete explosion of acne all over my face.</li>
            <li>bought this product because the reviews say it works wonders for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and have always suffered from acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this did not bother it at all</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t go away once I became an adult either.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the products after my skin cleared and thought I was finished with my experience with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more clear because I use them everyday in the same order.</li>
            <li>I have also altered my diet, make sure to drink plenty of water everyday, and get enough sleep.</li>
            <li>this product is slowly but surely making my skin clearer.</li>
            <li>its become more softer and the blemishes are slowly going away.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m aware of trying any new product and a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period is always to be expected</li>
            <li>Lotion is not greasy, only downside is that the bottle ended up leaking and letting water into it and watering down the face wash over time, before I knew it the bottle was full of 90% water!</li>
            <li>After I bought the first month long kit I was charged for another kit that charged me over $70 Dollars!</li>
            <li>The instances of red bumps have decreased significantly which is what was really important to me.</li>
            <li>purchasing this for one who is able to stick with a facial regimen on a daily basis, due to its multi-step system.  </li>
            <li>As the products states, there is a good chance that it will get a little worse within the first week of use, but after that the acne almost melts away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 years old and previously had mild breakouts a couple of days a month.  </li>
            <li>I found a significant difference after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now</li>
            <li>This product is expensive and it isn&#x27;t all that high in quality, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Once I ran out, I was lazy and decided to use my old facewash, which was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>If you use small amounts of this twice a day then you&#x27;ll get results and have a pretty face like me, well maybe not this pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this line is the first to make such a change with my skin and in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I was doing that at first, but have dropped down to 2 vitamins a day with no negative impact.</li>
            <li>This treatment is a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it dried my skin a bit too much (when this happens, I break out even more).  </li>
            <li>Yesterday afternoon I tried Murad for the very first time to try and clear up a few blemishes before a job interview.</li>
            <li>It took two weeks to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>second round of purchased product: skin is still better than it was before, but the acne is still present...</li>
            <li>but it was too strong for my sensitive skin but decided to try again, I mean what</li>
            <li>once it runs out, if i don&#x27;t see positive results, i&#x27;ll never purchase it again and i will definitely write a follow-up review on this acne kit making other potential buyers aware of the ineffectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it really seemed to clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I will admit the product is incredibly gentle and doesnt dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Murad isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin and clears it quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I am not completely acne free, this product helps keep the amount of acne down that pops up on my face.</li>
            <li>I am thirty years old, my acne started when I was in middle school and has been consistent since then, the only other thing that I&#x27;ve used that made a noticeable difference was ProActive, while I was in high school, which worked for awhile</li>
            <li>I got hooked on the moisturizer from this kit, which doesn&#x27;t contain SPF (and apparently my skin hates SPF!).  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I fully expect that my face will be as clear as it was last time by the wedding in two weeks.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an outbreak like this since I used Noxzema as a teenager and had a similar result that took weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li>Within a week, my face was starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a T and patiently waited for what I thought was just initial acne from using the product to clear, but it never did.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll see the zit start to clear up the next day.</li>
            <li>In an effort to find an alternative treatment that would actual clear up the acne without damaging my skin, I found Murad.  </li>
            <li>I have alot of old red marks</li>
            <li>purchased this as a gift for a male 17 year old with reaccurring acne issues.</li>
            <li>Spot treatment does not seem to work particularly well and sometimes leaves the applied spot dry.</li>
            <li>but me being an adult and not realizing that these products are made for teen skin and</li>
            <li>I usually only use organic products but I tried the dermatologist and even a natural pharmacist, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>one thing the majority of the reviews specified is that your skin will get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>I love that this product line clears up my breakouts with over-drying and over irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>The package came nice and on time but the product did nothing for my acne unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Two days ago I stopped using and have been taking off my makeup with cethaphil lotion and using only that- no soap, and it is starting to calm down and clear up.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that does not dry out my skin completely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitve normal to dry irish/german skin.</li>
            <li>Although I did not have normal &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;, I had tons of red, flat spots all over my cheeks for years.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>Other recommendation is read the product insert as it tells you how much to use</li>
            <li>and I do feel as though by week 4 I&#x27;ll see an even more dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li>I also told her that I had had to listen to countless offers when I initially ordered the product.</li>
            <li>Recently again, (nearly 7 years later)</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t stay on it as I developed drug-induced Lupus because I had been on it for so long but went away after 60 days of being off of it</li>
            <li>The cleanser smelled like a margarita (I&#x27;m apparently the only one who thought so - friends and family</li>
            <li>have been on it now for almost 5 weeks, I did experience a clearing in the first few days</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a firm believer that you have to be consistent for 8-12 weeks to truly see if a product will work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and in that time, my acne has decreased significantly, as well as some lightning of old acne marks.</li>
            <li>I ordered Murad with high hopes due to the reviews and recommendations from family and friends; it worked for them</li>
            <li>This product dried my skin out so badly that my skin became incredible itchy, red and even more broken out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Murad for less than 5 days, and my face is much clearer.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and noticed some dry patches after about two weeks.</li>
            <li>It made my skin itchy, dry and flakey all while still having frequent acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it over and above any other system and I have tried everything over the years.</li>
            <li>BEFORE Murad, my skin was still oily and small cystic pimples (maybe 6-8) were present around my jawline and neck on only the right side of my face.</li>
            <li>Since my last post in Sept I read a review on Murad that said it was not a long lasting solution to acne, I thought maybe it would stop working for me at some point</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive, I even tried using the exfoliating gel once a day, and still very dry.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and have had issues with other acne products (some making my face dry, and others making it very oily).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much like some other products do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use the products until they&#x27;re gone and will update my review if there are any changes, good or bad.</li>

            <li> lol)</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> Once my skin recovered I tried another acne product and had great results.  </li>
            <li> Great buy</li>
            <li> Im happy</li>
            <li> I was reading how great the reviews were on amazon</li>
            <li> product seems to be working great.  </li>
            <li> Still a great product</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my skin has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> REALLY happy with Murad.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my skin for my acne now</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well, however I have experienced some stinging/irritation I never had before.  </li>
            <li> It clears up my skin almost immediately and keeps it looking great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> But murad is absoletly great.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> works great to reduce breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Great starter pack for Murad.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Also - if you use makeup try using some that are oil free and dont get into your pores!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  </li>
            <li> face wash feels amazing when you use it and does a VERY good job removing dirt, oil, and even makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> And Step 2 works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> and I have to say this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I would like to say that Murad Customer support was great, but I have nothing good to say, considering I sent them a message asking for advise and received no reply.</li>
            <li> I love murad and this kit is a GRRREAT DEAL price wise!!!</li>
            <li> Company was pleasant to deal with    </li>
            <li> I tried to be pleasant..</li>
            <li> always loved there product</li>
            <li> but all and all good product.</li>
            <li> good set to start with</li>
            <li> fair complexion and never had any acne issues.  </li>
            <li> This is a good sign, and I am hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good sized products for a kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> it smelled good</li>
            <li> But, I will not ever order from Murad again, despite the good reviews they get.</li>
            <li> and this works really good along with the face wash.</li>
            <li> Good product, five stars.</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars because the product seem to be of good quality when i used them but</li>
            <li> I loved how it made my skin feel and really loved that the acne was cleared up with out the harshness to my skin.  </li>
            <li> im loving the Clinique redness solutions makeup :) its SPF 15, covers up most to all redness from zits, and DOES NOT make you break out :D &amp; its oil free :D!</li>
            <li> Best of luck on your skin&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li> i was VERY satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and Murad works great for clearing skin.</li>
            <li> I love the murade acne kit it work great for your skin</li>
            <li> After two months I am 200% more confidant and happy with my skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re purging to this extent and still made it through to the first month, good for you; I honestly wish the best for you.</li>
            <li> What more could I want?!</li>
            <li> of course what most matters is that IT DID HELP WITH ACNE!</li>
            <li> I love Murad products!</li>
            <li> My favorite acne wash!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product, my face looks cleaner!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am now using Dermalogica and its amazing.</li>
            <li> Murad Acne Treatment Concealer is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> This worked amazingly, but I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have seen amazing improvements in my skin with these products.</li>
            <li> Even my pores are shrinking, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> They told me of the problems with another product...and are thrilled not to have those headaches with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that it is a nice product</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I use instead of your own hands.</li>
            <li> Good to know it works on many people but probably not me.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do it for my kind of acne.</li>
            <li> and this works as good or better than anything of those ever did.</li>
            <li> Works to cleanse your face but isn&#x27;t effective for acne as they claim.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li> my skin will heal on its own.</li>
            <li> So far so good I am loving it!!!</li>
            <li> The products have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> The system is very easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It does not solve the problem completely, but it does the best among all I have tried.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE the gentleness and simplicity of the lotion.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was using more and more make up to cover up break outs.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the recommended usage amounts and read the directions about exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be able to get another month out of the amount I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ps, you might want to shop around for better prices.  </li>
            <li> but I look better</li>
            <li> , I have not found one better then Amazon.</li>
            <li> Still LOVE Murad.</li>
            <li> i have more whiteheads than before i started using the system.</li>
            <li> I like the Neutrogena products a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was really and truly expecting great results.</li>
            <li> I would give Murad 0 stars if I was able to.</li>
            <li> Mostly around my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit and have been so pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Murad Acne line for about 2.5 months now, and am about to order more.</li>
            <li> It really seems like a hit or miss with this product, I read reviews about it being great for some</li>
            <li> I decided to use murad because a friend LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> But I thought that it would get better and my face would soon stop healing</li>
            <li> and I am glad I am no longer using it</li>
            <li> More breakouts than before.  </li>
            <li> I love this product line for my combination oil-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal &amp; stress breakouts along my chin mostly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soooooo pressing on.  :-)</li>
            <li> I bought it at a reputable place and was optomistic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel sticky after using it (make sure to put the Lotion (step 3) on or else your skin will feel sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like the acne face wash, does a great job of keeping the oil of my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is an okay acne kit</li>
            <li> You get better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many acne treatments and this works better then</li>
            <li> and now my face is about 98% better</li>
            <li> I bought Acnefree at the store and my acne got better in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> But be sure about the usage.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better out there.</li>
            <li> becuase your skin will get better.  </li>
            <li> It never got better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Murad products.</li>
            <li> However, this one did despite being the most inexpensive of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> i just bought a moisturizer that is better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to repurchase.  </li>
            <li> I love the Murad products.</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed it continues to work : )</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I called..spoke to a lovely girl reading from her script.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> A week after stopping using this product my skin looks significantly better than while on Murad.  </li>
            <li> We have now bought the larger products separately, but the kits are a great deal!  </li>
            <li> ok, I still get the honey&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love Murad products and</li>
            <li> and I have been pleased ever since.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up significantly and I have a lot more confidence!</li>
            <li> I tried giving it another week, but by day 14, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting any better.</li>
            <li> Going to order more.</li>
            <li> I love Murad products for me face.</li>
            <li> and you will love it.  </li>
            <li> I have better results with Pevonia spateen line.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even more.</li>
            <li> My face look much better since i started using it.</li>
            <li> A product I buy over the counter in cvs for 10 $ helps me more.</li>
            <li> The compliance is important for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through week 2 and my skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li> but now i have more zits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love my change to Murad.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling from the eucalyptus oil!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product so far!</li>
            <li> Works and feels clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Understanding that skin is unique to each individual - Murad may be wonderful - just not in our case.</li>
            <li> I am certain this is a good product.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has improved greatly and I&#x27;ve started to notice the old glow in my skin that I used to have.  </li>
            <li> The sulfur on the spot treatment is good at getting the blemish to purge, and the cleanser is gentle.</li>
            <li> While the product does not yield perfectly clear skin, my skin still feels very nice.</li>
            <li> However, it was very effective in making old zits come to the surface.</li>
            <li> but with make-up, a easy temporary solution until they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a great deal buying through Amazon instead of going through the Murad website &amp; paying more money for the same products.</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta and spoke with a skin specialist, and they said the stuff in Murad is so strong it doesn&#x27;t work on alot of people.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the system, and really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li> At first your skin might break out more, but don&#x27;t freak out, it will get better.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother and more silky after the very first time using the product.</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> and I am still acne free.</li>
            <li> Buying in here on amazon is about 15 bucks cheaper then sephora (plus no taxes and free delivery).....</li>
            <li> So worth the money :-)</li>
            <li> They are pricey for sure, but I believe well worth the money.</li>
            <li> And I guess since it is a hit or miss would caution buyers to try the products in a travel size if available.</li>
            <li> This kit is great, Murad has totally transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> I think one of the most exciting aspects is the oil control.</li>
            <li> There was noticeable improvement and her faced remained smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> The formula is nice on my skin, which is very oily.</li>
            <li> No matter what you answer to or explain what you want, you will be included in the free membership.</li>
            <li> Do I sound like an infomercial?</li>
            <li> and there it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s worked the best without destroying my face.</li>
            <li> Works great on my acne and has definitely cleared it up.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, there is no set of products that will completely get rid of acne problem and Murad stands as the best choice.</li>
            <li> Good- skin feels soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> the &#x27;sulfur mask&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem very useful either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest though, that&#x27;s probably the best my face has been the last 12 years (long term acne sufferer).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results so far</li>
            <li> Within a couple days I noticed my skin felt healthier, it felt smooth and clean hours after I washed.  </li>
            <li> Worked good ;)  noticed results fast</li>
            <li> *it does say that Murad will &amp;#34;PURGE&amp;#34; your skin, meaning get rid of everything first- causing you to break out before getting better, BUT i thought that wouldnt apply to me since I was already using the STARTER KIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks, I saw significant changes.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if I would be able to use the product twice a day</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product for over $100 on the original website.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clean.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of just these products I needed a deeper clean</li>
            <li> Great product could tell a different right away.</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin right up!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for about 3 weeks now and my face has lucky cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> Went to an actual dermatologist and she laughed when I told her I was using this system.</li>
            <li> With the order I just placed, I ordered the cleanser and exfolicating gel separately, and then ordered a different Murad moisturizer with SPF that had good review for acne.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait til the full 60 days are</li>
            <li> so you really have to use another moisturizer or sun block on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m going to give this another month to make my full review.</li>
            <li> The directions do tell you how to work up to full strength if this happens to you.</li>
            <li> Good value vs. individual item purchases.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need a more gentle product.</li>
            <li> I would use the cleanser but not the full kit.</li>
            <li> The product has helped my acne a bit but not as much as I would hope for but will continue to use to see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Murad&#x27;s is a nice kit for people that don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and have surface acne.</li>
            <li> and it made my dream come true.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the directions on how much to use-</li>
            <li> I made the change to Bobbi Brown and ditched the so called mineral powders for a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> While using Murad, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with dry, flaky skin (love the skin perfecting lotion, by the way), and I feel like the level of oiliness on my face is perfect...</li>
            <li> i would recommend for people with mild acne</li>
            <li> super oily/ post-pardum breakout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe my acne has been the product of my lovely hormones, so I was looking for extraordinary results, I ended up with mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> The products have helped my ultra-sensitive skin out tremendously and are not drying to my face.  </li>
            <li> it provides for some moisture and glow, but I no longer have a super greasy-looking face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is already clearing up my complexion.</li>
            <li> It quickly helped heal my blemishes as well as preventing acne.</li>
            <li> but then it clears quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have high hopes for these products for sure.</li>
            <li> These products work great, but you have to make sure you use them properly and regularly to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Before, my skin was pretty smooth besides where I was breaking out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and it&#x27;s the real product!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products (Clinique, Mary Kay, ProActice, Oil of Olay, Almay, Clearacil, Nutrogena, Aveno, Apricot scub, Clean and Clear, etc.)</li>
            <li> found my new acne procuct :)</li>
            <li> but i hope it would work better in preventing new break out</li>
            <li> Previously, I used ProActiv and that worked great for my skin.  </li>
            <li> but i went over the 60 days and still have a lot of products left &#x3D;)!&lt;</li>
            <li> #34;See results in just three days&amp;#34;, which, like all of the other claims that acne medicines blare on their commercials, seemed a bit too good to be true.</li>
            <li> 1 week later the prom was a great success with pictures of clear skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the face wash (which will last you forever) is amazing</li>
            <li> but the dryness isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it though to get rid of the breakouts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with a current system or cannot find an effective system.  </li>
            <li> I hope others will have the success that I have.  </li>
            <li> Not only did my acne improve, but my skin felt and looked more smooth and even toned.</li>
            <li> If you are unsure if this product will work for you or not, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to find more natural remidies.</li>
            <li> So I guess it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> honestly would rather they make a larger cleanser and gel or sell the kit cheaper without those two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the moisturizer lacks greatly in what is needed especially for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely manner but cased more breakouts than it fixed.</li>
            <li> murad is ok my skin is clear</li>
            <li> If their initial free gift had included samples that lasted more than one or two uses, I would perhaps now be a Murad user.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely broke out on my cheeks and chin, and they are now covered in them.</li>
            <li> So it is definitely worth the purchase, and as the other review said, it does go a bit further than the 30 days, or 60 days, which makes it that much more of a great value.  </li>
            <li> and then I have a few pimples, but it is much better!!  </li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time and cheaper than more products as well!</li>
            <li> For me Murad is just right.  </li>
            <li> like I have right know.</li>
            <li> Also, I did like the accompanying card that shows you the right amount of product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every acne product available with the exception of accutane.  </li>
            <li> From the first few days, I have been getting great results.</li>
            <li> it took a little over 4 weeks for me to really see my skin clear up, but excellent!</li>
            <li> first off its no miracle pills where it will heal/remove your pimples right away.  </li>
            <li> But after a month you will be on your way to a fresh and clean new you.</li>
            <li> I used Murad Acne Complex for 4 months and had great success.</li>
            <li> it made my face super sticky and way too much product for my face to absorb.  </li>
            <li> very, very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall very fast acting, very effective system.  </li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> It certainly rivals the competition and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time about three years ago, but I stopped using it because of cost.  </li>
            <li> but when I first tried it the smell gagged me.</li>
            <li> This was one info commerical that I was glad I gave a second look.    </li>
            <li> this is YOUR FIRST MURAD SYSTEM buy, get the STARTER KIT:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Three months later, I didn&#x27;t look any better.    </li>
            <li> When i first saw an ad for it</li>
            <li> and i was VERY upset!</li>
            <li> my face feels really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Murad was my first choice of the brand for acne treatment.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cannot stress enough, is this magic?</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to have any extra tools to apply any of the products</li>
            <li> Always handles my breakouts fast!</li>
            <li> This is not only a lie when it comes to my skin, but I am sure that it has happened to plenty of others.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t think the product deserves 5 stars is because it isn&#x27;t that potent against blackheads.</li>
            <li> It has been the first OTC thing that has worked on my acne.  </li>
            <li> Most recently I purchased it via amazon/online to save money.  </li>
            <li> Once I started using this, I noticed the redness going away within the first week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover up!</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t worked the first time</li>
            <li> Three teen boys look better already.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind for the first week</li>
            <li> First thing in the morning, wash with Clarifying Cleanser</li>
            <li> Just be cautious about any company that offers a \\&quot;free&#x27; gift.</li>
            <li> However, as I tried it exactly as instructed for a month or so, I didn&#x27;t see ANY improvements at all.</li>
            <li> Even compared to treatments that are advertised year-long on television, Murad is still my first pick.</li>
            <li> and when i bought this product, most of my pimples were gone or reduced the next morning!</li>
            <li> I used to use the product twice a day but started drying out my skin since i have been using it for about 2 months and switched to only once since my acne has been alot better.</li>
            <li> love it ,always on time or even earlier..</li>
            <li> probably what you&#x27;ll run out of first.</li>
            <li> After investing in this product after much hesitation, I cleared up within 2 months!</li>
            <li> Murad also doesn&#x27;t bleach bedding and towels like benzoyl peroxide products, and my skin is incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since then the only thing I have had to buy more of is the foundation and powder</li>
            <li> It really does work!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this system even when using it at full strength right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 20 and 30 something&#x27;s that need a little help with mild acne!:)</li>
            <li> I spent about $200 in November 2011 on kitting myself out from her counter at a local Department store and have a natural feel coverage that is smooth and glides on, stays on and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my blemishes but gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> The Murad, on the other hand, works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Plan to use it for a full 60 days because I really didn&#x27;t see any real change until about 4 weeks into the routine but when it works it really works.</li>
            <li> I know with the active ingredients and what the product is doing for my skin is amazing, but the smell is a force to be reckoned with.</li>
            <li> Her Lock-It Tattoo foundation is the only thing I have found that completely covers my spots (it&#x27;s amazing) and also doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you literally don&#x27;t have to use much at all, so it may not seem like a lot, but I use it twice a day and still have another month or two left.</li>
            <li> The lotion has pleasant, subtle fragrance, applies easily and leaves the skin soft and moist without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I had used Differin for a couple of years and had pretty good results with it, except that it made my skin really oily and fairly red (the same thing happened with RetinA).</li>
            <li> I used the ACNE SPOT FAST FIX  3 times a day, a dab on each pimple during that time and it really works!</li>
            <li> Granted my skin is never completely clear, it has cleared up a lot and feels more under control.</li>
            <li> that work just as good if not much better.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up so much, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that the makeup I am using my face is actively healing my skin while also working as a coverup.</li>
            <li> This particular purchase was so much cheaper and will last me another 60 days until I can afford to get more.</li>
            <li> I am 28 and was having some problems with breaking out in certain spots.</li>
            <li> Large cysts forming on my chin, on the sides of my nose and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating gel similarly is easy to apply and seem to be effective without being irritating.</li>
            <li> The first time I experienced it was shortly after my second son was born and the residual pregnancy hormones left my body.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out!</li>
            <li> After the first week though, if you are consistent by the end of the month your face will be completely clear!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my teenage grandson,  He says it is working fine.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole set if you go through a certain tube faster.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d tried everything available to him over the counter &amp; had very limited success.</li>
            <li> I re-ordered and have been using for the last 2 months and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Murad!</li>
            <li> I decided to start using it again because I am standing up in a wedding, and I really didn&#x27;t want to see photos of myself covered in acne.      </li>
            <li> The prescriptions made me smell and it didn&#x27;t really work.    </li>
            <li> And you do not need to use much of the product at a time.</li>
            <li> Acne FAST treatment-</li>
            <li> I was also getting really depressed</li>
            <li> My face became very oily on my t-zone and my cheeks  </li>
            <li> so I really have nothing</li>
            <li> My texture is starting to smooth out and</li>
            <li> With this in mind &amp; really bc of this reason I wrote this review although my knowledge is very limited.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Turned out he really did &amp;</li>
            <li> after giving birth to my daughter i had so much breakout on my face.</li>
            <li> I like:&lt;br /&gt;-it absorbs fast into your skin</li>
            <li> I tried that and realised how much products that is and</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the Acne Spot Treatment.  </li>
            <li> I suggest buying on Amazon because it&#x27;s much cheaper than in-store:  http://www.amazon.com/Murad-Acne-Treatment-Concealer-Light/dp/B0017SUE96/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1403210456&amp;sr&#x3D;1-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;murad+acne</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the instructions provide a picture of the amount of product that should be used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the whole barrage of medications (Accutane, everything that ends with &amp;#34;cillin&amp;#34;, Retin A, etc.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much product (a dime size I would guess) to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This has really helped with my acne</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 months using this Murad kit, I am ready to declare a cautious victory.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin and have tried LOTS of products.</li>
            <li> The combination of products in the acne problem kit work very well.  </li>
            <li> It was quite different from the one I bought in Sephora, and I had confirmed with Murad that they do not longer produce this.</li>
            <li> Not so much for me.</li>
            <li> And of course, they really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Not so much...  </li>
            <li> It really is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Use this product religiously and your face will clear out, I know many people who have used it</li>
            <li> I had a problem with adult acne a few years ago and tried this product at the suggestion of a friend who had heard good things about it.</li>
            <li> The person I spoke to on their chat-contact-service requested for me a full refund (I was told to dispose of the product and my refund should be apparent on my card in 2-3 business days).</li>
            <li> STAY CLEAR of this product, do not go through the same thing as me and many others.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne mostly cyst type that is stress related.</li>
            <li> The only time the acne would go away enough to feel good about my skin was during the early weeks of summer.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to try this product because it was slightly pricey, but after seeing it for a better deal on amazon I decided to take a chance</li>
            <li> I get nervous using any sort of facial product due to my sensitive skin, but I have used Murad for two months now and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I did find that benzoyl peroxide was the most effective, however it recently began to cause serious rashes on my maturing face (too harsh).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im now going to try other products that contain witch hazel because i really like the reviews on them :)</li>
            <li> Among the set, exfoliating gel and lotion are superior to any other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> This set costs much more to purchase from Sephora or the other makeup stores.</li>
            <li> This is not to say it&#x27;s due to the product itself, in truth I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I have used many other products, and I still broke out.  </li>
            <li> My acne has cleared up significantly and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It helps better than other things he has tried.  </li>
            <li> aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than other places.</li>
            <li> As a twenty-five year old with acne, I can tell you that this product has been working very well for me, when pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve tried has not.</li>
            <li> with most systems, it is possible that you can break out or that your skin can be sensitive to the new product.</li>
            <li> Proactive worked pretty well, but I felt it was so much more harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was aware that this was a stage and would get better after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had clear skin instantaneously, but the result was very fast.</li>
            <li> Her acne completely cleared off her forhead quite quickly, and the rest of her face continued to clear.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product and usually cheaper on amazon than ulta.</li>
            <li> Being 36 years old and still breaking out, Murad is the one product that never fails me.</li>
            <li> The first couple days I used it, my skin felt soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin was burning, inflammed, red, and full of pimples.</li>
            <li> I had acne problems and actually ordered this product on TV in new year and was really excited about the results.</li>
            <li> i still see new breakout here/there throughout this whole process)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But seriously I wish I would have saved my money and stayed with my OTC products because now that I am back to them my skin is feeling better and looking better .THIS</li>
            <li> It is also important  to note that if  you do use the set that is provided, from step 1 to step 4, you should also use a moisture afterwards because it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to switch back to my daily wash of Pronexin which gave me better results.</li>
            <li> but my main issue is jawline cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Prom quickly approaching, some quick help needed, purchased \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot; products while waiting for this highly-advertised product to arrive.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up some of my acne but for something that costs 3 times as much as a drug store product that can do the same thing it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li> Acne Complex is a great product, I felt the difference in my face with the initial use of the cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The three-step system treatment includes a cleanser, oil, and lotion, all of which leave your skin feeling vibrant and refreshed.</li>
            <li> not bad as far as over the counter acne kits go, but my stubborn acne is barely affected by this concentration of salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> So the main thing is to be patient.</li>
            <li> Getting my first facial was the first step.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li> then my skin exploded week 2-4, mainly the chin away, a bunch of little whiteheads that easily popped with no scarring and a bountiful of blackheads, a couple large pimples on the cheek area....</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and have suffered from adult acne, even though I didn&#x27;t break out much as a teenager.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it did much for my cystic adult acne</li>
            <li> I dont normally write reviews</li>
            <li> It feels nice and cool on the skin, but it does not lather too well and feels difficult to be rinsed.  </li>
            <li> On the second day, my face was swollen, red, hot to the touch and super itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the system for 3 weeks and from the first few days my skin looked and felt healthy and vibrant</li>
            <li> Especially around on my chin and right below my nose.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using the system and went back to my neutrogena face wash, my acne cleared right up.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t see any miraculous results, the cleansing effect alone just feels plain healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> but as a new patient I coudn&#x27;t get in to see the doctor for six weeks.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t prevent new break out for me</li>
            <li> I had a lot of new acne come up (purging)</li>
            <li> live on the Westcoast, got acne attack on my forehead ever since I started working in Pittsburgh for a year&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I manage to put spot treatment on a newly appearing spot, it disappears within couple of hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other popular treatment systems.  </li>
            <li> After a month of continuous use, other than my skin feeling and looking a bit cleaner, I&#x27;ve yet to see any real improvement in the mild acne I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.  </li>
            <li> There is a minimal purging period (5-7 days) which is short for most acne treatment systems.  </li>
            <li> So that was really exciting, and it&#x27;s slowly starting to clear up blemishes that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> In short, this product line alone does not get rid of acne problem; however, it is very gentle on acne-prone skin, reduces the intensity of breakouts and improves the skin texture.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I was happy to get the whole starting kit for a little less money online.</li>
            <li> I thought I was having an allergic reaction, but found online that many other people have had this same thing.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> i usually used this the most around my \\&quot;time of the month\\</li>
            <li> To be more specific, I got massive cyst like pimples in places where I had never had pimples before, such as my jaw line and forehead.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday and will purchase it from Amazon from now on!</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward to using it twice a day, and it is the first acne product, that I could actually use 2 times a day as directed.  </li>
            <li> I think Klear Action and Acne Free are actually the same product</li>
            <li> I also noticed wherever I applied this product I ended up getting some pretty big pimples, borderline cystic.  </li>
            <li> I think in generally this system works very well</li>
            <li> I first learned about this line from going to Massage Envy locally.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so clear I have not had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> In fact, one of the areas on my neck that had started to clear up by day 11, broke out with a new set of pimples on day 13.</li>
            <li> One positive thing is Murad caused the sales of cover girl prodcuts to go up because i need about a weeks worth of concealer to cover this mess on my face.</li>
            <li> As for the cleanser, I like how it contains salicylic acid and how it does not dry up my skin too much.</li>
            <li> It probably took about a few weeks to really start seeing results and nearly a couple of months to see the full effects of it.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakout for me at all (while it does help clear up old breakout</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time</li>
            <li> , I used Clinique and all it did was dry my skin and irritate any pimples so they would be smaller, but more inflamed and red and noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; products, it does not leave the skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to clear up my face.</li>
            <li> None of the products in this kit did anything to clear up my son&#x27;s acne.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using Murad again and really hope that I have enough time to clear this up before my interview.</li>
            <li> and I had hope it would help me to clear up the acne I have been struggling with for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of products over the years to clear up my acne, but nothing has worked as well as the Murad.  </li>
            <li> I have fewer breakouts, heck, even clear skin while on this</li>
            <li> My face stays clear with this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taking forever to get rid of but the rest of my face is clear I will not buy this again or proactive</li>
            <li> I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made my skin 100% clear yet, but it seems well on its way.</li>
            <li> When using this moisturizer alone, my skin started to clear.  </li>
            <li> she reports that it works well and has helped clear her complexion.  </li>
            <li> I used Murad acne complex kit when in my teens and it worked magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> I developed acne on my jawline and forehead.</li>
            <li> For background, I&#x27;m a 25 year old woman, and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 11 years old.  </li>
            <li> I had acne over my entire face, and much of it has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> My blackheads are almost completely gone at this point.  </li>
            <li> every now and again and only very sparingly.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that I have found that really works for me.  </li>
            <li> (I have oily sink) for nearly three months now</li>
            <li> The Acne clearing solution works better than the STEP 2 of the COMPLEX system (the</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, this COMPLEX system is not any better.</li>
            <li> After going back to my cheap drug store products, I&#x27;m back to breaking out only during my period.    </li>
            <li> b/c i&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> and my face is completely breaking out</li>
            <li> but this really ruined his skin enough to make him self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> This product is aggressive on my type of adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman, and after pregnancy my face changed.</li>
            <li> but it improved my acne so much that I can finally &amp;#34;tolerate&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work and for a short period of time I thought that it was.</li>
            <li> but I know it can take 6 mos-year for them to completely fade</li>
            <li> I tried this for my acne prone sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and have still been having issues with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> it does help treat my old break out/new breakout overtime.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- 25-30 yrs old</li>
            <li> Wow, redness went away.  </li>
            <li> but wow, this truly does work.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll start to see the effects about 2 weeks after using it, but it really kicks in about a month later.  </li>
            <li> It may work for some people but for me who has really sensitive skin, Retinol and Salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my face very itchy and red.</li>
            <li> I feel like it has helped maintain my breakouts, inevitably I still break out but not as much as I did before.</li>
            <li> As far as acne solutions systems go, I think it&#x27;s a trial and error thing.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin just feels so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> The redness that was usually present in my cheeks has also really improved.     </li>
            <li> It helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting the bigger bottle because it saves so much money over time</li>
            <li> find with the Murad Acne line that it keeps my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> So far its been working.</li>
            <li> Like it so far, will update on how it treats acne in 30 days</li>
            <li> guess what did it work so far nothing has worked on me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with persistent adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early on in my daughter&#x27;s treatment plan, but we did not notice a difference...sadly.</li>
            <li> So far so good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started with one or two blemishes on my chin and now i have a complete explosion of acne all over my face.</li>
            <li> bought this product because the reviews say it works wonders for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and have always suffered from acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this did not bother it at all</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t go away once I became an adult either.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the products after my skin cleared and thought I was finished with my experience with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more clear because I use them everyday in the same order.</li>
            <li> I have also altered my diet, make sure to drink plenty of water everyday, and get enough sleep.</li>
            <li> this product is slowly but surely making my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> its become more softer and the blemishes are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m aware of trying any new product and a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period is always to be expected</li>
            <li> Lotion is not greasy, only downside is that the bottle ended up leaking and letting water into it and watering down the face wash over time, before I knew it the bottle was full of 90% water!</li>
            <li> After I bought the first month long kit I was charged for another kit that charged me over $70 Dollars!</li>
            <li> The instances of red bumps have decreased significantly which is what was really important to me.</li>
            <li> purchasing this for one who is able to stick with a facial regimen on a daily basis, due to its multi-step system.  </li>
            <li> As the products states, there is a good chance that it will get a little worse within the first week of use, but after that the acne almost melts away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old and previously had mild breakouts a couple of days a month.  </li>
            <li> I found a significant difference after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and it isn&#x27;t all that high in quality, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Once I ran out, I was lazy and decided to use my old facewash, which was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> If you use small amounts of this twice a day then you&#x27;ll get results and have a pretty face like me, well maybe not this pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this line is the first to make such a change with my skin and in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was doing that at first, but have dropped down to 2 vitamins a day with no negative impact.</li>
            <li> This treatment is a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it dried my skin a bit too much (when this happens, I break out even more).  </li>
            <li> Yesterday afternoon I tried Murad for the very first time to try and clear up a few blemishes before a job interview.</li>
            <li> It took two weeks to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> second round of purchased product: skin is still better than it was before, but the acne is still present...</li>
            <li> but it was too strong for my sensitive skin but decided to try again, I mean what</li>
            <li> once it runs out, if i don&#x27;t see positive results, i&#x27;ll never purchase it again and i will definitely write a follow-up review on this acne kit making other potential buyers aware of the ineffectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it really seemed to clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I will admit the product is incredibly gentle and doesnt dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Murad isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin and clears it quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I am not completely acne free, this product helps keep the amount of acne down that pops up on my face.</li>
            <li> I am thirty years old, my acne started when I was in middle school and has been consistent since then, the only other thing that I&#x27;ve used that made a noticeable difference was ProActive, while I was in high school, which worked for awhile</li>
            <li> I got hooked on the moisturizer from this kit, which doesn&#x27;t contain SPF (and apparently my skin hates SPF!).  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I fully expect that my face will be as clear as it was last time by the wedding in two weeks.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an outbreak like this since I used Noxzema as a teenager and had a similar result that took weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li> Within a week, my face was starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T and patiently waited for what I thought was just initial acne from using the product to clear, but it never did.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ll see the zit start to clear up the next day.</li>
            <li> In an effort to find an alternative treatment that would actual clear up the acne without damaging my skin, I found Murad.  </li>
            <li> I have alot of old red marks</li>
            <li> purchased this as a gift for a male 17 year old with reaccurring acne issues.</li>
            <li> Spot treatment does not seem to work particularly well and sometimes leaves the applied spot dry.</li>
            <li> but me being an adult and not realizing that these products are made for teen skin and</li>
            <li> I usually only use organic products but I tried the dermatologist and even a natural pharmacist, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> one thing the majority of the reviews specified is that your skin will get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I love that this product line clears up my breakouts with over-drying and over irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The package came nice and on time but the product did nothing for my acne unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Two days ago I stopped using and have been taking off my makeup with cethaphil lotion and using only that- no soap, and it is starting to calm down and clear up.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that does not dry out my skin completely.</li>
            <li> I have sensitve normal to dry irish/german skin.</li>
            <li> Although I did not have normal &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;, I had tons of red, flat spots all over my cheeks for years.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers really like the fragrance</li>
            <li> Other recommendation is read the product insert as it tells you how much to use</li>
            <li> and I do feel as though by week 4 I&#x27;ll see an even more dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I also told her that I had had to listen to countless offers when I initially ordered the product.</li>
            <li> Recently again, (nearly 7 years later)</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t stay on it as I developed drug-induced Lupus because I had been on it for so long but went away after 60 days of being off of it</li>
            <li> The cleanser smelled like a margarita (I&#x27;m apparently the only one who thought so - friends and family</li>
            <li> have been on it now for almost 5 weeks, I did experience a clearing in the first few days</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a firm believer that you have to be consistent for 8-12 weeks to truly see if a product will work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and in that time, my acne has decreased significantly, as well as some lightning of old acne marks.</li>
            <li> I ordered Murad with high hopes due to the reviews and recommendations from family and friends; it worked for them</li>
            <li> This product dried my skin out so badly that my skin became incredible itchy, red and even more broken out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad for less than 5 days, and my face is much clearer.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and noticed some dry patches after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> It made my skin itchy, dry and flakey all while still having frequent acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it over and above any other system and I have tried everything over the years.</li>
            <li> BEFORE Murad, my skin was still oily and small cystic pimples (maybe 6-8) were present around my jawline and neck on only the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> Since my last post in Sept I read a review on Murad that said it was not a long lasting solution to acne, I thought maybe it would stop working for me at some point</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive, I even tried using the exfoliating gel once a day, and still very dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and have had issues with other acne products (some making my face dry, and others making it very oily).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use the products until they&#x27;re gone and will update my review if there are any changes, good or bad.</li>
            <li> , my skin is very sensitive, I could feel a couple of spots that felt dry, but they didn&#x27;t look dry.  </li>
            <li> My acne was never bad by any means-- usually just a few large pimples here and there, slightly bumpy forehead skin, and blackheads on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> Between the original break outs, the break outs from the acne products, and all the make up my skin was worse than when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I should also note that the spot remover for this system is the quickest I&#x27;ve ever seen, it really does make them smaller and less red by the morning and all you need is just a tiny amount, not like other clay based spot removers that require a thicker layer.&lt;br /&gt;:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin needed improvement in every area: blackheads, red bumps, white bumps, oily, dry, RED.</li>
            <li> They said that some people look worse at first bacause all of the impurities are coming to the surface, but that with continued use my skin would stay clear.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and have tried several products (including Proactiv which only dried out my skin).</li>
            <li> I stopped seeing new break outs after a few uses and saw definite improvement in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Murad Acne Complex Kit is the first skin care line that has improved the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and only developed acne in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Switching my make up has gone a long way to improving my appearance and how I feel about my skin overall.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a little tight after cleansing, but I just put the lotion on right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try new products as i&#x27;m desperate to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> Throughout my teenage and adult life, I have been searching for products to fight acne with limited to no success.</li>
            <li> It never leaves the skin dry like some other products I have used nor oily as my skin naturally is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old woman who has been struggling with Adult Acne for 12 years with hardly a pimple to speak of in my youth.....</li>
            <li> , I bought this 60 day COMPLEX KIT (been using it for 3 weeks) thinking it would continue to keep my skin clear and maybe help with old scarring as the reviews said.</li>
            <li> like exfoliators made me red and dry</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin was super oily and I was breaking out worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all manner of benzoyl peroxide acne treatments, with only limited improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is either an older version or not authentic.</li>
            <li> even though it didn&#x27;t give me amazing result like what i hope, it still isn&#x27;t a bad products.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal issues and my body produces too much androgen; acne is a common side-effect of my disorder.  </li>
            <li> I usually have fairly clear skin except for the occasional minor breakout.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if the product was going to be of the same quality since it was cheaper than it is directly from the company.  </li>
            <li> (lasts on average about 6 months with daily use, sometimes twice daily use if I go out at night).</li>
            <li> tried Murad a long time ago</li>
            <li> and it did not clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am told to give it a try for the first month, but WHAT IF it only continues to get worse?</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I caused me to have even more skin problems than I already had, my acne flared up like crazy and my skin was so dry.</li>
            <li> I mean not a lot of things really get to him</li>
            <li> I also feel that my skin is a lot less oily in general than it used to be.</li>
            <li> When it did, other products (which child followed to the letter) immediately stopped and Murad Acne Complex then followed exactly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, the kit seemed promising at first, but then failed to deliver!</li>
            <li> One other thing I do like about this product is that the smell is very faint and nice (not including the spot treatment, it&#x27;s sulfur and smells like sulfur, but I don&#x27;t have to use this often).</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve tried other stuff, and it hasn&#x27;t worked, I would definitely recommend trying Murad.</li>
            <li> only* thing that I would say takes off 1 Star for me is because of the Moisturizer and the tiny little &amp;#</li>
            <li> It wasnt until i searched other websites for reviews that i see people have had the same reaction as me.</li>
            <li> I have one very small new blemish that I put the spot treatment on last night and it is now almost gone.</li>
            <li> I been buying this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very minimal and no big deal.</li>
            <li> I tried Klear Action and Acne Free, and my face broke out so badly</li>
            <li> to once a day and the dry patches disappeared.</li>
            <li> this product doesnt dry out my skin like others do.</li>
            <li> got dry.</li>
            <li> I used it as indicated for 4 days and my skin was so dry and irritated that it started peeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (i avoid eyes/inner face area where i do not have breakout)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over dry no irritation.</li>
            <li> I started using these products 30 days ago, and though I have yet to see much of an improvement of my acne scarring, I have not had any serious breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t over dry my skin either.</li>
            <li> Well, 30 days later, and my skin is worse than it ever was, irritated, large cystic acne, white heads, black heads, you name it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see where any of it made a single difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I feel I have overused the product in the past, in which case it clearly states</li>
            <li> Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on.</li>
            <li> My 2 month supply is less than 1/4 of the way gone, so it&#x27;ll last me about 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> It feels like it gets the dirt out of my pores, and I have less bumps and overall smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, Pro Active and other various over the counter washes/treatments.  </li>
            <li> I bought Murad again and it has made my skin very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> but if you have moderate to severe acne, it works for a little</li>
            <li> Just a little at a time, but two months after receiving the product, I was back to where I was before the kit</li>
            <li> but since then I experience very few pimples, not anything like before; rather then having cystic, long lasting (painful)and multiple pimples and breakouts I will get the odd one or two which go away within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and it is so hard to find acne products that help with my skin.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that I got many scars on my face when I hadn&#x27;t before.  </li>
            <li> I used Proactive for a few weeks years ago and had the same reaction as I did to the drug store products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 4 months and it as really improved the acne on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can imagine this routine can get expensive &amp; plenty of people will be reading reviews in an attempt to help them decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But I had relentless red acne which itched and hurt for a few weeks going</li>
            <li> Similarly, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel is a bit harsh on my face as well.  </li>
            <li> I returned the product, understanding that I would get a refund minus $10.</li>
            <li> All of these companies are alike Be careful when you order a \\&quot;free\\&quot; gift.</li>
            <li> it dries out my skin and makes its so rough and bumpy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it helps reduce the size of my pimples within the next day (by the 3rd day the pimples slowly subside)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to start slow because I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use mine in between the days I use the RX topical stuff, since the RX stuff is extremely drying and harsh.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY FOR THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;-it</li>
            <li> I still have half a bottle of lotion and gel, but I ran out of the cleanser just within the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was a big waste!</li>
            <li> There are just other products that are out there</li>
            <li> friend told me to try clarisonic or other derma products.  </li>
            <li> It did give me a couple small white pimples when I started using it</li>
            <li> It will not do anything for you that other supermarket acne cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other acne face washes and they sucked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have acne due to hormonal problems so nothing will be a miracle cure for acne for now</li>
            <li> Small amounts needed makes this a product that will last.</li>
            <li> If this doesnt work, what other acne products would be suggested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weber.chelsey@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Acne treatments are difficult to review, because everyone has such different skin conditions and treatments affect everyone differently.</li>
            <li> When compared to other suppliers, the Amazon price was lower...and delivery was great.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> a small whitehead here and there on my chin, blackheads very minimal, no big pimples to speak of.</li>
            <li> skin is a little dry but the moisturizer works well</li>
            <li> i read all the reviews very carefully to aid me in my decision-making process and was persuaded to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients will start to lose their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get bigger and worse break outs while using this product, but I was ashamed to continue to use it until it ran out.  </li>
            <li> After the first day I saw a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> The products don&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as other products in the past have done</li>
            <li> This is my second go-around with Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can point out is that I do not like the smell of the products.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the moisturizer has no SPF, which I assume is because it can cause breakouts for some.</li>
            <li> I have deviated since and used five or six different brands, sticking with each product set for at least a month.</li>
            <li> My only complaint which is not a problem with the product</li>
            <li> I am not sure I have ever left a harsh revue-</li>
            <li> Now in my late 20&#x27;s, i look like a teen going through puberty.</li>
            <li> The Philosophy cleared up my acne, but the lotion wasn&#x27;t thick enough to fix the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Well, so far, it has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I cut down using the exfoliating acne treatment gel (step 2)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my 5th week and my skin is calming down........</li>
            <li> it calms everything down which I like about it.</li>
            <li> any other ones I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> My usual problem has to do with the painful red, cyst-like bumps that are right under the skin.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 4 and a half stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided I give this a try, I was previously using proactive which helped a lot</li>
            <li> , I applied less, and the product just seemed to exacerbate my skin problems.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month and a half, still see no result.</li>
            <li> I had previously used 2 Murad products for oily skin and they had worked well.</li>
            <li> And within three months, I had skin that would have been unrecognizable to me a year previously.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to say: If you&#x27;re \\&quot;purging\\&quot; for over 3 weeks, STOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the product deserves less than 1 Star; however, Amazon deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I plan to wait it out for another week and a half.</li>
            <li> stopped using the kit, and randomly used the different products in addition to my regular skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> So I was left with painful, red lumps that typically take several months to go</li>
            <li> The kit I purchased lasted a little over 2.5 months, with me using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> All around totally disappointed, now all I have left from my dedication is some scars and a second, basically unused, kit left that I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> Everything has improved -- even the blackheads a little bit.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than Proactive did...</li>
            <li> However, I ended up getting these little bumps all over my face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the urge to pop any of my zits anymore with the acne spot treatment, dab a little on every time I wash my face and they&#x27;re gone within a couple days.</li>
            <li> The other reivews even state that their face bled from the irritation!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this Murad kit did not help my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I used witch hazel after and there was tons on impurities left behind.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of trying it, keep in mind a few things about this product.</li>
            <li> After using Murad, my skin was so dried out it felt like alligator skin.</li>
            <li> I could not even get my foundation on correctly because it was so dried out.</li>
            <li> I have a few pimples for a few days and it&#x27;ll go away.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t dried it out one bit.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I was experiencing a bout of acne and decided to look into a skin care system.</li>
            <li> I had to finally stop using it because I feared the scars would get worse.  </li>
            <li> However, it dried me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like this, has been using for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> and then the effectiveness wore off after a few years.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe because I was impatient</li>
            <li> Have bought it a few times since.</li>
            <li> BUT there is no way I can try to stay on this product for another 2 weeks; since day 3, it&#x27;s only getting worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot of wasted money that you can use to go to the dermologist.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my 4th week of Murad and my skin is worse than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> and though I still get a few whiteheads here</li>
            <li> This infomercial promised that this system was unlike anything else on the market, and specifically targeted people who had tried and disliked Proactive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had trouble with my skin, since the beginning of puberty.</li>
            <li> and my acne has gotten worse actually,</li>
            <li> I had only a small amount on my chin and around my mouth, but it is enough to drive me crazy.</li>
            <li> The products really tame my acne.</li>
            <li> and now they&#x27;re small little pimples that go away in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I ordered the \\&quot;free\\&quot; kit and the samples were so small, they were of little use to determine their quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive than buying the individual items when you can&#x27;t commit to a brand.</li>
            <li> it dries out your skin and makes it feel tight!</li>
            <li> No more waste of money.  </li>
            <li> When we bought Murad, it seemed like it was just going to be another item on the loooong list of acne treatments we&#x27;d tried in the past few years.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than the kit in the salon and better than proactive which dried her out terribly.  </li>
            <li> Now, I didn&#x27;t have bad acne because I had taken extreme medicine to clear it up which it did..</li>
            <li> (the small starter kit bottles lasted about 2 months, you dont need much no matter how bad your skin</li>
            <li> I have tons of acne scars and the usual whitehead</li>
            <li> 4 days later skin was WORSE!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> no more than 5 times a yr&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am so lazy with my skin</li>
            <li> I still get a couple small pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> No rush or excessive dryness noticed.</li>
            <li> No more cysts, and no more scars.</li>
            <li> i dont usually get a lot&lt;</li>
            <li> , It was very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look...well not very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with numerous dark spots from the horrible breakouts but they are getting lighter every day.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my daughter&#x27;s hard to treat acne.</li>
            <li> The face wash was too hard on my skin, as was the clarifying mask.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days my acne got so bad, large cysts- worse</li>
            <li> i had an awful allergic reaction to it, my face dried up like crazy even with generous amounts of moisturizer, and i got a rash on my neck, chest and hands, it did bring a lot of gunk to the surface, which was nice, just a shame i had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I know that some people have complained that it burns.  </li>
            <li> At least 75% of my face was affected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The complex system&#x27;s spot treament is SULFER based------</li>
            <li> NOT the complex system!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the only thing Murad did was make my face worse.</li>
            <li> give it at least 2 weeks before seeing some type of result.  </li>
            <li> I started suffering from adult acne that has left some nasty scars.  </li>
            <li> This product did not work for me and was an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> Another month on the Murad Acne Complex</li>
            <li> It was a bit slow in the beginning.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t complicated wait-this-many-minutes for this, that and the other thing.</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE NASTY LITTLE BUMPS AND THREE LARGE BUMPS</li>
            <li> At that time, I found the product rather disappointing for its price as it did not completely remove acne problem even after months of use.</li>
            <li> Also if you get them in a store they come spread as in individually and they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;spot treatment\\&quot; is very small and</li>
            <li> My acne started with surface acne (like whiteheads) and has evolved into cystic acne (the hard, red, painful lumps under the skin).</li>
            <li> I decided to continue using the products and I find it less expensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I saw serious results in one week.</li>
            <li> I have white heads and unfortunetly cystic acne that hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> But my face is now covered in big painful pimples.</li>
            <li> This product was not good for me.</li>
            <li> It is also the cheapest here on amazon, I paid an outrageous amount at ulta for it the first time I started using it.</li>
            <li> Made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> started breaking out about 6 months ago and the break outs got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> At that point I had nothing to lose; I didn&#x27;t think it could get any worse.</li>
            <li> I had forgot what it felt like to be broken out.</li>
            <li> this is THE SECRET INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li> After using these products (The starter kit &amp; Mask) for a couple of weeks, my skin looked worse than ever, so I called their customer service number.  </li>
            <li> The redness an d irritation got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> and it just made everything worse.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make my breakout worse</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact they made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Yet my skin continued to get worse for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> If anything, it made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> You might be worse after a week or two.</li>
            <li> But all of those products I was using helped one area but made others worse:</li>
            <li> I only had the money for the one kit so needless to say I was very unhappy</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as with other salicylic acid based products that I have used previous, this did not work on the worst of my acne - cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market it seems and this was by far the worst...</li>
            <li> bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to.</li>
            <li> Sorry Murad....</li>
            <li> and then I went back to my awful skin woes.</li>
            <li> I used it for two days (once a day) and it made my skin so much worse!</li>
            <li> if anything, made my acne worse!</li>
            <li> but then it makes it worse!</li>
            <li> My skin was really starting to break out terribly before using these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> but now my dermo won&#x27;t prescribe it to me so needless to say, 3 mos after, the acne returned and with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> it was too expensive for him to buy</li>
            <li> Breakouts still occur, but none are outrageous and disappear relatively soon.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these products didn&#x27;t rise to the challenge.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the acne murad kit did not work for me.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> We were wrong.</li>
            <li> Just overall terrible for YEARS.</li>
            <li> It itches very badly and even wakes me up at night due to the irritation.</li>
            <li> &quot; if you know what i mean, and usually my acne is HORRIBLE around that time</li>
            <li> Bad- Made acne worse, made face greasier</li>
            <li> but at least get rid of that crap on your face.</li>
            <li> But then my skin began to break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive in the stores</li>
            <li> I wanted it so badly to work for me</li>
            <li> I was breaking out really bad</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a break out this bad in over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I did not experience break outs this bad even when i was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest this product if you dont have that bad of ance..</li>
            <li> I have a terrible problem with acne and it doesn&#x27;t make it all disappear but comes awful close, closer than any other product out there</li>
            <li> so I discontinued use. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This time, I tried using some organic-based and botanical products along with altering my diet and bumping up my exercise routine, but no luck. :(  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s, and when my hormones went crazy, I would break out horribly.  </li>
            <li> I had the worst breakouts I had ever had ,my mom and family told me to stop using this product because they noticed how bad my face was getting.</li>
            <li> BUT I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THIS BAD!</li>
            <li> My mom got it for me and while using it over a weekend visiting, from Friday to Monday, all my ugly bumps and upcoming bumps almost vanished!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> I used to be called Freddy Krueger, pizza face, and all those cruel names.</li>
            <li> and it looks absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> The results on his face were AWFUL!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> STUFF IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I was totally disgusted with my face..</li>
            <li> It made my face break out in the worst cyst and acne, I had ever had!!!!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> but this was horrible.</li>
            <li> moisturizer is awful.</li>
            <li> This was the worst acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> That was terrible.</li>
            <li> Before using it I had been suffering from terrible skin problems.</li>
            <li> Broke me out horribly.</li>
            <li> I never review stuff on Amazon unless it&#x27;s terrible and I feel the need to vent -</li>
            <li> I have horrible cystic acne and have for years, and I have been using this for a week and can&#x27;t believe the difference it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE BAD ACNE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 now and was still having awful problems with my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Horrible! Made my acne worse. Went to an actual dermatologist and she laughed when I told her I was using this system. She said it wasn&#x27;t ever going to do anything.</li>
            <li> I have loved this system! It took about 3 weeks to clear up my face. Be patient! It has actually shrunk the pores on my face. Very pleased with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and have tried several products (including Proactiv which only dried out my skin). The Murad Acne Complex Kit is the first skin care line that has improved the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now and have fewer breakouts and an even skin tone. I would highly recommend Murad!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice before. Although I am not completely acne free, this product helps keep the amount of acne down that pops up on my face. I like the tingly citrus wash and I LOVE the gentleness and simplicity of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I used Murad acne complex kit when in my teens and it worked magic on my skin. I went off because being a broke teenager, I couldn&#x27;t afford. Now (23) I bought Murad again and it has made my skin very dry and itchy. Especially around on my chin and right below my nose. I developed acne on my jawline and forehead. I know this may be the purging face but the dryness isn&#x27;t worth it. Maybe it&#x27;s just not for me and that&#x27;s okay. My skin is too sensitive, I even tried using the exfoliating gel once a day, and still very dry. I&#x27;m going to switch back to my daily wash of Pronexin which gave me better results. Sorry Murad.... But you suck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this Murad kit did not help my skin clear up. I haven&#x27;t had a cystic pimple while I was using it, but instead broke out in dozens of tiny white bumps that only go away if I pick at them, which causes redness of course. I have been using the matte lotion and that is great but nothing in this kit helped me.</li>
            <li> This is my second go-around with Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex.  I used it for the first time about three years ago, but I stopped using it because of cost.  I decided to start using it again because I am standing up in a wedding, and I really didn&#x27;t want to see photos of myself covered in acne.      For background, I&#x27;m a 25 year old woman, and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 11 years old.  I have hormonal issues and my body produces too much androgen; acne is a common side-effect of my disorder.  I&#x27;ve used pretty much every acne product available with the exception of accutane.  That list includes Differin, Retin A, Philosophy, AcneFree, and Proactiv.  The different stuff I&#x27;ve used has had varying efficacy.  The Proactiv made my face hurt.  The Philosophy cleared up my acne, but the lotion wasn&#x27;t thick enough to fix the dryness.  The prescriptions made me smell and it didn&#x27;t really work.    The Murad, on the other hand, works amazingly well.  I&#x27;ve been using Murad for less than 5 days, and my face is much clearer.  I had acne over my entire face, and much of it has cleared up.  My blackheads are almost completely gone at this point.  I fully expect that my face will be as clear as it was last time by the wedding in two weeks.    I know that some people have complained that it burns.  The acne exfoliating gel doesn&#x27;t burn me, but it definitely occasionally tingles.  It&#x27;s nothing unbearable for me.      The bottom line is, Murad isn&#x27;t going to work for everyone.  I know that I have friends who swear by Proactiv.  But if you&#x27;ve tried other stuff, and it hasn&#x27;t worked, I would definitely recommend trying Murad.</li>
            <li> This system works great</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference. I have tons of acne scars and the usual whitehead but my main issue is jawline cystic acne. I used witch hazel after and there was tons on impurities left behind.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 4 and a half stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started breaking out about 6 months ago and the break outs got worse and worse. I tried everything the drug store had to offer and nothing helped. I used Proactive for a few weeks years ago and had the same reaction as I did to the drug store products so I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to try that again. I was using more and more make up to cover up break outs. Between the original break outs, the break outs from the acne products, and all the make up my skin was worse than when I was a teenager. At least 75% of my face was affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called and made an appointment with a dermatologist but as a new patient I coudn&#x27;t get in to see the doctor for six weeks. I ordered Murad from Amazon in desperation after watching an infomercial at 2 in the morning. At that point I had nothing to lose; I didn&#x27;t think it could get any worse. This is the one and only thing I&#x27;ve ever ordered after watching an infomercial that worked. I stopped seeing new break outs after a few uses and saw definite improvement in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the basic four step kit. I have sensitive skin and noticed some dry patches after about two weeks. I cut down using the exfoliating acne treatment gel (step 2) to once a day and the dry patches disappeared. I only use the spot treatment (step 4) every now and again and only very sparingly. Make sure you follow the recommended usage amounts and read the directions about exfoliating. If you still exfoliate do so very, very gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month now and I would say I&#x27;m in the maintenance phase. Considering where I started this is nothing short of miraculous to me. I have one very small new blemish that I put the spot treatment on last night and it is now almost gone. I&#x27;m left with numerous dark spots from the horrible breakouts but they are getting lighter every day. I would also like to point out that I have quite a bit of the product left. This suprised me because I thought I would have to reorder after a month. I&#x27;ll probably be able to get another month out of the amount I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried everything OTC like me I would recommend giving this a try before seeing a dermatologist. The only negative I can point out is that I do not like the smell of the products. Other reviewers really like the fragrance but when I first tried it the smell gagged me. It&#x27;s worth it though to get rid of the breakouts. The smell is the only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Been using for a couple weeks and it is greatly reducing my breakouts. Will update after longer use. I am happy with the product so far! Fingers Crossed!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  There is a minimal purging period (5-7 days) which is short for most acne treatment systems.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other popular treatment systems.  And Step 2 works amazingly well! Every time I use it, all bumps go away.  But being a woman it doesn&#x27;t help with those pesky monthly breakouts.  But overall very fast acting, very effective system.  I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with a current system or cannot find an effective system.  It is relatively inexpensive for the quality it is. And you do not need to use much of the product at a time. A dime size amount is ample.  So it should last quite some time, even with twice daily usage.</li>
            <li> Prom quickly approaching, some quick help needed, purchased \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot; products while waiting for this highly-advertised product to arrive.  When it did, other products (which child followed to the letter) immediately stopped and Murad Acne Complex then followed exactly. (motivated to have clearer skin!)  Kept waiting for changes to happen. 4 days later skin was WORSE! (the off the shelf product we saw change the NEXT DAY! and subsequent days!)  Stopped the product, went back to off the shelf and 1 week later the prom was a great success with pictures of clear skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding that skin is unique to each individual - Murad may be wonderful - just not in our case.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am in my fifties and yes, I still have break outs. I always have. Murad works on all ethics. I have been using Murad for about four years now. It is the only thing that I have found that really works for me.  No longer do I need to worry about going to the doctor and risking taking medicines that might cause reactions. No more waste of money.  For me Murad is just right.  It has no junk to cause my skin to have rashes and such.  Once you use it keep using it.  At first your skin might break out more, but don&#x27;t freak out, it will get better. That is what it is suspose to do. Don&#x27;t give up. I hope others will have the success that I have.  This was one info commerical that I was glad I gave a second look.    Ps, you might want to shop around for better prices.  I do shop at Amazon because, I have found very good prices. Best of luck on your skin&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li> this product is slowly but surely making my skin clearer. its become more softer and the blemishes are slowly going away. this product doesnt dry out my skin like others do. found my new acne procuct :)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market it seems and this was by far the worst...&lt;br /&gt;I caused me to have even more skin problems than I already had, my acne flared up like crazy and my skin was so dry. I even tried to only use it once a day and it still didn&#x27;t help... I would never recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> These products work great, but you have to make sure you use them properly and regularly to see a difference. My skin is more clear because I use them everyday in the same order. Don&#x27;t skimp on the amounts either; you get results by using the amount they tell you, and as often as they tell you. It works! I have also altered my diet, make sure to drink plenty of water everyday, and get enough sleep.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works, nothing has ever worked on my face I&#x27;m 23 and I was beginning to give up</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products (Clinique, Mary Kay, ProActice, Oil of Olay, Almay, Clearacil, Nutrogena, Aveno, Apricot scub, Clean and Clear, etc.) trying to save a trip to the doctor. I am thirty years old, my acne started when I was in middle school and has been consistent since then, the only other thing that I&#x27;ve used that made a noticeable difference was ProActive, while I was in high school, which worked for awhile and then I went back to my awful skin woes. I was turned on to the Murad line my a facialist at Massage Envy (it is WAY cheaper on Amazon!!). I have been using the system plus toner (I have oily sink) for nearly three months now and I want to cry my results are that good!!!! Even my skin&#x27;s tone has been improving, I do also use Skin Clearing Clinique Foundation BTW.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a couple of weeks just as the instructions said but since then I experience very few pimples, not anything like before; rather then having cystic, long lasting (painful)and multiple pimples and breakouts I will get the odd one or two which go away within a couple days. I should also note that the spot remover for this system is the quickest I&#x27;ve ever seen, it really does make them smaller and less red by the morning and all you need is just a tiny amount, not like other clay based spot removers that require a thicker layer.&lt;br /&gt;:):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)&lt;br /&gt;:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/27/13-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to write and update on this product for awhile now, it&#x27;s been over 4 months now and I am still acne free. Since my last post in Sept I read a review on Murad that said it was not a long lasting solution to acne, I thought maybe it would stop working for me at some point but I look better then I have in years. Also I looked at this product at a beauty supply to compare price, I have not found one better then Amazon. Still LOVE Murad.</li>
            <li> I used to be called Freddy Krueger, pizza face, and all those cruel names. If you use small amounts of this twice a day then you&#x27;ll get results and have a pretty face like me, well maybe not this pretty but at least get rid of that crap on your face. Use this product religiously and your face will clear out, I know many people who have used it and I&#x27;ve seen the same results. Buying in here on amazon is about 15 bucks cheaper then sephora (plus no taxes and free delivery).....the only con: if you stop using it then you might break out again, so consider using this product for awhile, also this set should last for over 2-3 months</li>
            <li> I dont normally write reviews but i need to here, hoping to help someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face literally CLEARED UP with the **30 DAY STARTER KIT** My mom got it for me and while using it over a weekend visiting, from Friday to Monday, all my ugly bumps and upcoming bumps almost vanished! I used the ACNE SPOT FAST FIX  3 times a day, a dab on each pimple during that time and it really works! (the small starter kit bottles lasted about 2 months, you dont need much no matter how bad your skin is!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, I bought this 60 day COMPLEX KIT (been using it for 3 weeks) thinking it would continue to keep my skin clear and maybe help with old scarring as the reviews said. NO!!!!. MY FACE WENT BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE MURAD AND I HAVE NASTY LITTLE BUMPS AND THREE LARGE BUMPS THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY- you cant even pop them. I had forgot what it felt like to be broken out. **it does say that Murad will &amp;#34;PURGE&amp;#34; your skin, meaning get rid of everything first- causing you to break out before getting better, BUT i thought that wouldnt apply to me since I was already using the STARTER KIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is YOUR FIRST MURAD SYSTEM buy, get the STARTER KIT:&lt;br /&gt;1) ITS THE SAME CLEANSER&lt;br /&gt;2) The Acne clearing solution works better than the STEP 2 of the COMPLEX system (the gel)&lt;br /&gt;3) Acne FAST treatment- this is THE SECRET INGREDIENT. It has the Salicylic Acid treatment. It works.  The complex system&#x27;s spot treament is SULFER based------ you put a dab on, and it does NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this COMPLEX system is not any better. PLEASE get the STARTER KIT or the bottles that come with the starter kit. NOT the complex system!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend of mine and her family.  I understand that they are very happy with this product and it works well for them.  They told me of the problems with another product...and are thrilled not to have those headaches with this product.</li>
            <li> None of the products in this kit did anything to clear up my son&#x27;s acne.  Very disappointed.  Used it for 7 weeks and gave up.  Trying Proactive X-out now.</li>
            <li> Murad was the only thing that did anything for my face besides Accutane. If you are thinking of trying it, keep in mind a few things about this product. Plan to use it for a full 60 days because I really didn&#x27;t see any real change until about 4 weeks into the routine but when it works it really works. It did a great job at keeping breakouts at bay, and I used to break out almost every day of the week. So that was really exciting, and it&#x27;s slowly starting to clear up blemishes that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old and previously had mild breakouts a couple of days a month.  After using these products (The starter kit &amp; Mask) for a couple of weeks, my skin looked worse than ever, so I called their customer service number.  They said that some people look worse at first bacause all of the impurities are coming to the surface, but that with continued use my skin would stay clear.  Three months later, I didn&#x27;t look any better.    After going back to my cheap drug store products, I&#x27;m back to breaking out only during my period.    DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> i purchased this acne kit about a month ago. i was hesitant b/c i&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years. i tried every product available(prescription and non-prescription) and nothing seems to work. I&#x27;m willing to try new products as i&#x27;m desperate to have clear skin. i read all the reviews very carefully to aid me in my decision-making process and was persuaded to give it a try. one thing the majority of the reviews specified is that your skin will get worse before it gets better. Well, so far, it has gotten worse. i have more whiteheads than before i started using the system. it&#x27;s a 60-day supply so i&#x27;ll continue using the product. once it runs out, if i don&#x27;t see positive results, i&#x27;ll never purchase it again and i will definitely write a follow-up review on this acne kit making other potential buyers aware of the ineffectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I usually have fairly clear skin except for the occasional minor breakout. Yesterday afternoon I tried Murad for the very first time to try and clear up a few blemishes before a job interview. It has been almost 24 hours and my face is completely breaking out - I have zits on my forehead, chin, sides of my face, around my lips and it looks absolutely horrible. I haven&#x27;t had an outbreak like this since I used Noxzema as a teenager and had a similar result that took weeks to clear up. I won&#x27;t be using Murad again and really hope that I have enough time to clear this up before my interview.</li>
            <li> This was 45 before and now it&#x27;s 65 I been buying this for a very long time. I can&#x27;t believe they up the price</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff but it caused me to break out with these cyst like pimples. I had to stop immediately. Maybe my skin just needed to get use to it but it freaked me out so I sent it back. I have sensitve normal to dry irish/german skin. I like the Neutrogena products a lot better.</li>
            <li> For the price and Murad name I was really and truly expecting great results. I used the product religiously each day and yet my oily skin, pores, and breakouts, didn&#x27;t get under control. I couldn&#x27;t see where any of it made a single difference in the appearance of my skin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if the product was going to be of the same quality since it was cheaper than it is directly from the company.  However the quality is not slighted in anyway.  The product arreived sooner than the posted delivery date which is always a great plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued sith acne since puberty. Being 36 years old and still breaking out, Murad is the one product that never fails me. Truly the best thing I&#x27;ve found to take care of my acne.</li>
            <li> I am 28 and was having some problems with breaking out in certain spots. I took the quiz on the Murad website and it recommended this Acne set. I used it for two days (once a day) and it made my skin so much worse! On the second day, my face was swollen, red, hot to the touch and super itchy. I thought I was having an allergic reaction, but found online that many other people have had this same thing. Before, my skin was pretty smooth besides where I was breaking out. After using Murad, my skin was so dried out it felt like alligator skin. I could not even get my foundation on correctly because it was so dried out. I went to Ulta and spoke with a skin specialist, and they said the stuff in Murad is so strong it doesn&#x27;t work on alot of people. I will NEVER use this again!! It took two weeks to get my skin back to normal. I am now using Dermalogica and its amazing. I would give Murad 0 stars if I was able to.</li>
            <li> When i first saw an ad for it i thought \\&quot; Wow! this is a product that might actually work!\\&quot; so i went to go order it. For a couple months or so it did a GREAT job but all of a sudden it started diong nothing at all if anything, made my acne worse! it dries out your skin and makes it feel tight! i usually used this the most around my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot; if you know what i mean, and usually my acne is HORRIBLE around that time and i admit, i was VERY satisfied but then it just stopped working and i was VERY upset! for the cost of it youd think itd work :| i would recommend for people with mild acne but if you have moderate to severe acne, it works for a little but then it makes it worse! Im now going to try other products that contain witch hazel because i really like the reviews on them :) Also - if you use makeup try using some that are oil free and dont get into your pores!!! im loving the Clinique redness solutions makeup :) its SPF 15, covers up most to all redness from zits, and DOES NOT make you break out :D &amp; its oil free :D! good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used, I kept getting TERRIBLE pimples on my forehead and I was breaking out for 3 months, I used Clinique and all it did was dry my skin and irritate any pimples so they would be smaller, but more inflamed and red and noticeable. This cleared up all my pimples on my forehead in about two weeks! I can wear no makeup again! So worth the money :-)</li>
            <li> Murad products have worked great for me over the years. I received my products around June 1st but they have an exp. date of 10/2015--in 5 months. I didn&#x27;t expect that. The active ingredients will start to lose their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and have suffered from adult acne, even though I didn&#x27;t break out much as a teenager. Mostly around my cheeks and jawline. I have tried tons of products, including Proactive. Proactive worked pretty well, but I felt it was so much more harsh on my skin. I purchased this kit and have been so pleased. My skin was really starting to break out terribly before using these products. Within a week, my face was starting to clear up. Within a couple of weeks, I saw significant changes. I&#x27;ve been using the Murad Acne line for about 2.5 months now, and am about to order more. While I still have an occasional pimple, they are nothing like what I had before. Very minimal and no big deal. The spot treatment works well also. The texture of my skin has improved greatly and I&#x27;ve started to notice the old glow in my skin that I used to have.  I would also like to point out that I also use the Murad Acne vitamins in conjunction with this facial kit. The directions call for 4 pills a day. I was doing that at first, but have dropped down to 2 vitamins a day with no negative impact. I also purchase a facial toner through Amazon that I feel helps as well. It&#x27;s made by Cellbone and is called Prep Skin Refresher. I was my face with the Murad cleanser, then use the Cellbone toner, and then apply the Murad Exfoliating Gel and Moisturizer.  The only complaint I have is that the moisturizer has no SPF, which I assume is because it can cause breakouts for some. With the order I just placed, I ordered the cleanser and exfolicating gel separately, and then ordered a different Murad moisturizer with SPF that had good review for acne. These are great products. They are pricey for sure, but I believe well worth the money. The kit I purchased lasted a little over 2.5 months, with me using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Great product, expeditiously delivered.</li>
            <li> It really seems like a hit or miss with this product, I read reviews about it being great for some so I decided I give this a try, I was previously using proactive which helped a lot but after YEARS of using it it seemed to stop working and causing breakouts. I decided to use murad because a friend LOVE IT... I spend over 100 dollars, since they didn&#x27;t have the 60 day supply at ulta I bought the products individually (big mistake) It was a big waste! I ended up throwing the products in the garbage (in hindsight I guess I should have given them to my friend I just kept torturing myself with it at home, I used it and spend months GIVING IT ANOTHER TRY lol) I wanted it so badly to work for me and I figured I just had to get used to it, like with the prescription creams I get at the dermo, I applied less, and the product just seemed to exacerbate my skin problems. I gave it to my husband, thinking MAYBE it would favor his skin.. it didn&#x27;t. The results on his face were AWFUL! I mean not a lot of things really get to him but this really ruined his skin enough to make him self-conscious about it. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy. And I guess since it is a hit or miss would caution buyers to try the products in a travel size if available.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about three months ago and I had hope it would help me to clear up the acne I have been struggling with for a couple of years. But after the first few weeks of use it made my face explode! I had the worst breakouts I had ever had ,my mom and family told me to stop using this product because they noticed how bad my face was getting.But I thought that it would get better and my face would soon stop healing but it didn&#x27;t. The redness an d irritation got worse and worse. I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.I was also getting really depressed and I couldn&#x27;t even look in the mirror.After I bought the first month long kit I was charged for another kit that charged me over $70 Dollars! I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore! so I sent it back and hopefully I will get my money back. But seriously I wish I would have saved my money and stayed with my OTC products because now that I am back to them my skin is feeling better and looking better .THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE! To sum it all up and I am glad I am no longer using it and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I have to say that it is a nice product but I still have breakouts.  It has cleared up some of my acne but for something that costs 3 times as much as a drug store product that can do the same thing it isn&#x27;t worth it.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews and they all suggest that drugstore products can do just about the same as this product.  I will add that I wasn&#x27;t using this twice a day or three times a day, just once at night before I went to bed and the acne would still be there in the morning.  So I&#x27;m going to give the drugstore products a try before I reorder this.</li>
            <li> I used Murad Acne Complex for 4 months and had great success. Not only did my acne improve, but my skin felt and looked more smooth and even toned. However, this last time I ran out I decided to try to find a store product with similar ingredients instead. HUGE mistake. This product is aggressive on my type of adult acne. If you are unsure if this product will work for you or not, it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.  I understand that all skin/acne is different, but if you have tried all the products in the store, I do recommend this before going to a dermatologist.  One other thing I do like about this product is that the smell is very faint and nice (not including the spot treatment, it&#x27;s sulfur and smells like sulfur, but I don&#x27;t have to use this often).</li>
            <li> My face is just as oily as before.  More breakouts than before.  This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry. This brand is not that great, and it&#x27;s a rip off! There are just other products that are out there that work just as good if not much better.</li>
            <li> i had an awful allergic reaction to it, my face dried up like crazy even with generous amounts of moisturizer, and i got a rash on my neck, chest and hands, it did bring a lot of gunk to the surface, which was nice, just a shame i had to stop using it. be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product line for my combination oil-dry skin. I get hormonal &amp; stress breakouts along my chin mostly. This acne system works the best for me over anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and I&#x27;ve worked with plenty of skin care lines, nothing else I tried has come close to how well this worked for my skin and skin problems. I love that this product line clears up my breakouts with over-drying and over irritating my skin. Hope it works as well for you as it has for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old woman, and after pregnancy my face changed. My face became very oily on my t-zone and my cheeks  got dry. I also stared breaking out all the time. So I decided to try Murad, It was very harsh on my skin. The products have a very strong smell. I used it as indicated for 4 days and my skin was so dry and irritated that it started peeling. I continued to breakout so I discontinued use. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Cleared my skin right up!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found a product that works... Its not 100% but it improved my acne so much that I can finally &amp;#34;tolerate&amp;#34; it. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work and for a short period of time I thought that it was. Unfortunately, the only thing Murad did was make my face worse. To be more specific, I got massive cyst like pimples in places where I had never had pimples before, such as my jaw line and forehead. I was totally disgusted with my face.. I used it for over 3 months, using it religiously twice a day until I finally gave up on using it. I haven&#x27;t been using it for about 3 weeks now and my face has lucky cleared up significantly. I would like to say that Murad Customer support was great, but I have nothing good to say, considering I sent them a message asking for advise and received no reply. All around totally disappointed, now all I have left from my dedication is some scars and a second, basically unused, kit left that I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old woman who has been struggling with Adult Acne for 12 years with hardly a pimple to speak of in my youth.....I have tried everything from oral/topical antibiotics to Accutane and Minocycline which the Mino worked wonders for me but I couldn&#x27;t stay on it as I developed drug-induced Lupus because I had been on it for so long but went away after 60 days of being off of it but now my dermo won&#x27;t prescribe it to me so needless to say, 3 mos after, the acne returned and with a vengeance. It&#x27;s been over a year since taking Mino and I have been struggling with now blackheads joining the party.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Murad a long time ago but it was too strong for my sensitive skin but decided to try again, I mean what the heck.....couldn&#x27;t hurt and I&#x27;m aware of trying any new product and a \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period is always to be expected and I break out daily anyway so I really have nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on it now for almost 5 weeks, I did experience a clearing in the first few days then my skin exploded week 2-4, mainly the chin away, a bunch of little whiteheads that easily popped with no scarring and a bountiful of blackheads, a couple large pimples on the cheek area....the only area that I never break out on is my forehead and I have side bangs so go figure. I&#x27;m now in my 5th week and my skin is calming down........a small whitehead here and there on my chin, blackheads very minimal, no big pimples to speak of. My texture is starting to smooth out and skin is a little dry but the moisturizer works well and my skin moisture returns so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results so far but I&#x27;m a firm believer that you have to be consistent for 8-12 weeks to truly see if a product will work for you. I have alot of old red marks but I know it can take 6 mos-year for them to completely fade but with make-up, a easy temporary solution until they are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooooo pressing on.  :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month and the zits keep coming.  I wonder when it will start working</li>
            <li> always loved there product I do think the spot treatment should be a bit bigger for the price but all and all good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after having used this product for 3 months. I still have half a bottle of lotion and gel, but I ran out of the cleanser just within the last few weeks. This kit is great, Murad has totally transformed my skin! I love it because it doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out! My skin does feel a little tight after cleansing, but I just put the lotion on right away and i&#x27;m fine. I love the fact that you literally don&#x27;t have to use much at all, so it may not seem like a lot, but I use it twice a day and still have another month or two left. My skin has cleared up and I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> I love murad and this kit is a GRRREAT DEAL price wise!!! Shipping was quick and it&#x27;s the real product!! Will buy again !</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 4 months and it as really improved the acne on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with adult acne a few years ago and tried this product at the suggestion of a friend who had heard good things about it. I bought it at a reputable place and was optomistic.  Not only did it not do anything to help cure my acne, but it irritated my skin and some of products even left a sulfur smell on my skin. It made my skin itchy, dry and flakey all while still having frequent acne breakouts. Once my skin recovered I tried another acne product and had great results.  Murad acne prodcts are not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my acne prone sensitive skin and it just made everything worse.  It seemed like it was helping, but it wasn&#x27;t. I stopped using it and have still been having issues with adult acne.  I started taking pills from the dermatologist and that helped, but eventually it reeks havic on your body.  I&#x27;m still in search for that solution for clearing my skin.  I drink nothing but water and I&#x27;m trying to find more natural remidies. I thought I was only allergic to benzyl peroxide and now I know I&#x27;m allergic to sulfur too.  My quest continues.</li>
            <li> did not work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great buy I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> good set to start with</li>
            <li> I can imagine this routine can get expensive &amp; plenty of people will be reading reviews in an attempt to help them decide if it&#x27;s worth it. With this in mind &amp; really bc of this reason I wrote this review although my knowledge is very limited.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a gift for a male 17 year old with reaccurring acne issues. He&#x27;d tried everything available to him over the counter &amp; had very limited success. I purchased this as a birthday gift being it was too expensive for him to buy but he &amp;#34;needed it&amp;#34;. Turned out he really did &amp;#34;need it&amp;#34; bc it worked wonderfully on his skin. By the time he finished the product it cleared him up &amp; he&#x27;s saving for his replacement. So I guess it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> after giving birth to my daughter i had so much breakout on my face. i decided to try this product. first off its no miracle pills where it will heal/remove your pimples right away.  It takes time...give it at least 2 weeks before seeing some type of result.  Heres what I like and don&#x27;t like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my Skin type: super oily/ post-pardum breakout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-it absorbs fast into your skin&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel sticky after using it (make sure to put the Lotion (step 3) on or else your skin will feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;-made my face feels really soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (i avoid eyes/inner face area where i do not have breakout)&lt;br /&gt;-it helps reduce the size of my pimples within the next day (by the 3rd day the pimples slowly subside)&lt;br /&gt;-it say 60 days supply but i went over the 60 days and still have a lot of products left &#x3D;)!&lt;br /&gt;-i really like the acne face wash, does a great job of keeping the oil of my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t prevent new breakout for me at all (while it does help clear up old breakout i still see new breakout here/there throughout this whole process)&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT FOLLOW the instruction for the amount you put on your face. I tried that and realised how much products that is and it made my face super sticky and way too much product for my face to absorb.  Trust me A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY FOR THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;-it doesn&#x27;t prevent new break out for me but it doesn&#x27;t make my breakout worse either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;this is an okay acne kit but i hope it would work better in preventing new break out and I&#x27;ve been using this for over 60+ days.  even though it didn&#x27;t give me amazing result like what i hope, it still isn&#x27;t a bad products. it does help treat my old break out/new breakout overtime.  Im happy it didn&#x27;t make my face worser.</li>
            <li> Murad was my first choice of the brand for acne treatment. At that time, I found the product rather disappointing for its price as it did not completely remove acne problem even after months of use. I have deviated since and used five or six different brands, sticking with each product set for at least a month. Having taken that alternative route, I am back to Murad. It does not solve the problem completely, but it does the best among all I have tried.  While the product does not yield perfectly clear skin, my skin still feels very nice. It never leaves the skin dry like some other products I have used nor oily as my skin naturally is. Breakouts still occur, but none are outrageous and disappear relatively soon.  Among the set, exfoliating gel and lotion are superior to any other similar products I have used. The lotion has pleasant, subtle fragrance, applies easily and leaves the skin soft and moist without feeling sticky. The exfoliating gel similarly is easy to apply and seem to be effective without being irritating. Unlike many other \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; products, it does not leave the skin feeling dry.  Spot treatment does not seem to work particularly well and sometimes leaves the applied spot dry. I have been using tea tree oil as spot treatment.  As for the cleanser, I like how it contains salicylic acid and how it does not dry up my skin too much. It feels nice and cool on the skin, but it does not lather too well and feels difficult to be rinsed.  In short, this product line alone does not get rid of acne problem; however, it is very gentle on acne-prone skin, reduces the intensity of breakouts and improves the skin texture. As far as I know, there is no set of products that will completely get rid of acne problem and Murad stands as the best choice.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
            <li> This is life I&#x27;ve been using this product for years never had any problems. I recommend you buy this product online because if you get it in stores  it&#x27;s like $40-$60 for a starters kit. (Trials sizes).Online you get 60 days and way bigger oz. This product is very gentle on the skin and I have darker skin. Don&#x27;t over dry no irritation. I always recommen on getting a clearsonic spin brush. That&#x27;s what I use instead of your own hands. You get better results.Also if you get them in a store they come spread as in individually and they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I Suffer severely from Cystic Acne.. I wanted to wait a month before I wrote this review and I have to say this product is amazing! The first two weeks I had a lot of new acne come up (purging) but I&#x27;m going on a month and a week and my skin is so clear I have not had any new breakouts. I do have a lot of acne scarring now but I&#x27;m hoping it clears up as time goes on.. Please give this product atleast a month or so to actually see results! I will continue on with Murad! Everyone is different but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I see no differences</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my teenage son and seen no difference in the appearance of his acne. We have used a number of products prescribed by his dermatologist and no results with any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose we will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I think the last time I wrote a review was over 5 years ago.  I felt compelled to share here.  I am:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- asian female&lt;br /&gt;- 25-30 yrs old&lt;br /&gt;- fair complexion and never had any acne issues.  Occassionally pimple or zit no more than 5 times a yr&lt;br /&gt;- live on the Westcoast, got acne attack on my forehead ever since I started working in Pittsburgh for a year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve never had acne, I thought this must be something to do with the water.  I have a few pimples for a few days and it&#x27;ll go away.  It didn&#x27;t.  I tried exfoliator, didn&#x27;t work.  I tried using facewash because I am so blessed with my face that I don&#x27;t even need cleansing lotion to wash it, I sometimes just wash my face with Philosophy Purity once a week.  But I had relentless red acne which itched and hurt for a few weeks going and it just didn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me to try clarisonic or other derma products.  I just bought this, used it for 3 days . Wow, redness went away.  After 3 weeks now, I don&#x27;t even need to put cover up on my forehead and the acne has shrunken though scars still there.  I can&#x27;t wait til the full 60 days are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot stress enough, is this magic? Yes.  I am so lazy with my skin but wow, this truly does work.</li>
            <li> This set costs much more to purchase from Sephora or the other makeup stores. I love this product and use it everyday and will purchase it from Amazon from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many acne treatments and this works better then any other ones I&#x27;ve tried! It did give me a couple small white pimples when I started using it but I stuck it out and kept using it and now my face is about 98% better I still get a couple small pimples here and there. I used to have big cystic type pimples that last for weeks and now they&#x27;re small little pimples that go away in a day or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of products over the years to clear up my acne, but nothing has worked as well as the Murad.  I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t dried it out one bit.  You&#x27;ll start to see the effects about 2 weeks after using it, but it really kicks in about a month later.  My 2 month supply is less than 1/4 of the way gone, so it&#x27;ll last me about 4-5 months. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Acne Complex is a great product, I felt the difference in my face with the initial use of the cleaner.  I love that you don&#x27;t have to have any extra tools to apply any of the products, some of the products out there you have to have a cotton ball or something to apply the toner etc.  At first I didn&#x27;t know if I would be able to use the product twice a day, my skin is very sensitive, I could feel a couple of spots that felt dry, but they didn&#x27;t look dry.  I have been looking forward to using it twice a day, and it is the first acne product, that I could actually use 2 times a day as directed.  So it is definitely worth the purchase, and as the other review said, it does go a bit further than the 30 days, or 60 days, which makes it that much more of a great value.  I tried Klear Action and Acne Free, and my face broke out so badly, I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it no matter what.  I think Klear Action and Acne Free are actually the same product, that&#x27;s just my guess.  I tried them both months apart, with the same reaction...</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago because I was iffy about trying benzoyl peroxide. It made my face break out in the worst cyst and acne, I had ever had!!!! They were connected and even leaked puss. It was horrible. I bought Acnefree at the store and my acne got better in a matter of days. I was on antibiotics as well but this was horrible. It may work for some people but for me who has really sensitive skin, Retinol and Salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I was reading how great the reviews were on amazon so I purchased it. Been using this product for a month and a half, still see no result. Good to know it works on many people but probably not me.</li>
            <li> I am at my wits end when it comes to acne.  Once I entered my 20s I started suffering from adult acne that has left some nasty scars.  After countless products that continued to break out my face, my mom introduced me to the Murad acne kit.  I did not purchase this product from Amazon, rather, from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne Spot Treatment (2/5 Stars)&lt;br /&gt;- I was very dissatisfied with the Acne Spot Treatment.  This treatment is a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin, and it dried my skin a bit too much (when this happens, I break out even more).  I also noticed wherever I applied this product I ended up getting some pretty big pimples, borderline cystic.  Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel (2/5 Stars)&lt;br /&gt;- Similarly, the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel is a bit harsh on my face as well.  If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Clarifying Cleanser(4/5 Stars)&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be working great.  My skin did not have an adverse reaction so I am pleased so far.  I started using these products 30 days ago, and though I have yet to see much of an improvement of my acne scarring, I have not had any serious breakouts.  This is a good sign, and I am hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOT IN PACKAGE) Acne Treatment Concealer (5/5 Stars)&lt;br /&gt;- This product is NOT in this package, but I have to recommend it.  Murad Acne Treatment Concealer is AMAZING.  My face has cleared up so much, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that the makeup I am using my face is actively healing my skin while also working as a coverup. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Link to the coverup on Amazon. I suggest buying on Amazon because it&#x27;s much cheaper than in-store:  http://www.amazon.com/Murad-Acne-Treatment-Concealer-Light/dp/B0017SUE96/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1403210456&amp;sr&#x3D;1-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;murad+acne</li>
            <li> Always handles my breakouts fast! What more could I want?!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply daily as it shows on the manual. It shows burn if we apply daily. Works good. But be sure about the usage.</li>
            <li> The package came nice and on time but the product did nothing for my acne unfortunately. It made my face very itchy and red. It probably would work if you can stand the irritation but it did not satisfy me.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different though.</li>
            <li> Yep it definitely works! it took a little over 4 weeks for me to really see my skin clear up, but excellent! now to get rid of my scars!</li>
            <li> I recommend this kit to everyone. If you have acne now, or if you want to keep acne away. GET THIS. There is nothing better out there.</li>
            <li> I think in generally this system works very well, I like the cleanser, and the Gel is great.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even tho I would consider my skin to be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course what most matters is that IT DID HELP WITH ACNE! I have fewer breakouts, heck, even clear skin while on this system.&lt;br /&gt;The *only* thing that I would say takes off 1 Star for me is because of the Moisturizer and the tiny little &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is awful. It makes your skin look...well not very good. Also It has no SPF so you really have to use another moisturizer or sun block on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;And the &#x27;sulfur mask&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem very useful either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly would rather they make a larger cleanser and gel or sell the kit cheaper without those two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall tho Murad does work, and they are very good quality products!</li>
            <li> It tells you to keep going at it becuase your skin will get better.  This is not only a lie when it comes to my skin, but I am sure that it has happened to plenty of others.  Not only did I get bigger and worse break outs while using this product, but I was ashamed to continue to use it until it ran out.  It never got better.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I was experiencing a bout of acne and decided to look into a skin care system. I had previously used 2 Murad products for oily skin and they had worked well. Unfortunately these products didn&#x27;t rise to the challenge. As a matter of fact they made my acne worse. I followed the instructions to a T and patiently waited for what I thought was just initial acne from using the product to clear, but it never did. As soon as I stopped using the system and went back to my neutrogena face wash, my acne cleared right up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE best!  For any skin breakout at any age. I will have this in my arsenal forever!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Murad products. I&#x27;ve tried many products and Murad works great for clearing skin. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> have used the items before. works well as always</li>
            <li> I believe my acne has been the product of my lovely hormones, so I was looking for extraordinary results, I ended up with mediocre at best. This is not to say it&#x27;s due to the product itself, in truth I love how it makes my skin feel. It just didn&#x27;t do it for my kind of acne.</li>
            <li> I feel like it has helped maintain my breakouts, inevitably I still break out but not as much as I did before. The products don&#x27;t dry out my skin as much as other products in the past have done but, I&#x27;m going to give this another month to make my full review.</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal for the price.  The products have helped my ultra-sensitive skin out tremendously and are not drying to my face.  I wish it contained a toner, but I purchased witch hazel and have been using that after the wash.  I really like the fact that the instructions provide a picture of the amount of product that should be used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne problems since my teens; I&#x27;m in my forties now. My usual problem has to do with the painful red, cyst-like bumps that are right under the skin. I decided to give Murad a try after reading about it in a women&#x27;s magazine. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I can definitely tell a difference. The instances of red bumps have decreased significantly which is what was really important to me. I also feel that my skin is a lot less oily in general than it used to be. The system is very easy to follow. It is a three step process and takes no time at all. There aren&#x27;t complicated wait-this-many-minutes for this, that and the other thing. You use it twice each day - it consists of a cleanser, an acne topical lotion and a moisturizer. The fourth tube you see in the picture is a spot treatment for pimples that you use only on a pimple when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most systems, it is possible that you can break out or that your skin can be sensitive to the new product. The directions do tell you how to work up to full strength if this happens to you. I have pretty sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this system even when using it at full strength right out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the whole barrage of medications (Accutane, everything that ends with &amp;#34;cillin&amp;#34;, Retin A, etc.) and this works as good or better than anything of those ever did. As far as acne solutions systems go, I think it&#x27;s a trial and error thing. I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, Clinique and Dr. Wexler and those didn&#x27;t have a noticeable effect. However, this one did despite being the most inexpensive of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 60-day supply but I have the feeling it&#x27;s going to last longer than that. I don&#x27;t have to use much product (a dime size I would guess) to cover my face and neck. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have used only about a third of it. You can also buy the components separately on Amazon. You won&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole set if you go through a certain tube faster.</li>
            <li> Murad has been my best defense against fighting acne. I found a significant difference after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now and I love it. It feels like it gets the dirt out of my pores, and I have less bumps and overall smoother skin. The only reason why I don&#x27;t think the product deserves 5 stars is because it isn&#x27;t that potent against blackheads. I purchased the Murad Exfoliating Cleanser to use for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this line is the first to make such a change with my skin and in a short amount of time. My only complaint which is not a problem with the product but me being an adult and not realizing that these products are made for teen skin and the moisturizer lacks greatly in what is needed especially for mature skin.  Still a great product i just bought a moisturizer that is better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my skin has improved greatly.  I have used many other products, and I still broke out.  I am in my 30&#x27;s, and when my hormones went crazy, I would break out horribly.  This has controlled it.  My face is perfect until my hormones kick up and then I have a few pimples, but it is much better!!  I bought the 60 day supply, but it is lasting longer!</li>
            <li> This worked amazingly, but I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients. Now I&#x27;m using the Paula&#x27;s chioce line.</li>
            <li> I get nervous using any sort of facial product due to my sensitive skin, but I have used Murad for two months now and am really happy with the results. My skin felt smoother and more silky after the very first time using the product. It probably took about a few weeks to really start seeing results and nearly a couple of months to see the full effects of it.     My acne was never bad by any means-- usually just a few large pimples here and there, slightly bumpy forehead skin, and blackheads on my nose and chin. Everything has improved -- even the blackheads a little bit. Overall, my skin just feels so much smoother and healthier. I think one of the most exciting aspects is the oil control. I have combination skin, and have had issues with other acne products (some making my face dry, and others making it very oily). I had used Differin for a couple of years and had pretty good results with it, except that it made my skin really oily and fairly red (the same thing happened with RetinA). While using Murad, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with dry, flaky skin (love the skin perfecting lotion, by the way), and I feel like the level of oiliness on my face is perfect... it provides for some moisture and glow, but I no longer have a super greasy-looking face by the end of the day. The redness that was usually present in my cheeks has also really improved.     REALLY happy with Murad.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my skin for my acne now I just have to find something that will get rid of my acne marks</li>
            <li> I got an allergy after using this twice, I don&#x27;t know if this causes my allergy but I won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the acne murad kit did not work for me. I needed the murad redness therapy instead. I only had the money for the one kit so needless to say I was very unhappy I made that mistake.</li>
            <li> The Murad kit I bought in the store changed my life.  It has been the first OTC thing that has worked on my acne.  Most recently I purchased it via amazon/online to save money.  It seems to be working well, however I have experienced some stinging/irritation I never had before.  I am nervous it is not the same formulation that I get from the brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> This has really helped with my acne</li>
            <li> Great!  I love this product and will continue to repurchase.  It clears up my skin almost immediately and keeps it looking great.  It helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have used Proactive in the past, and tried numerous things from the dermatologist, which only worked for the first week or so. Although I did not have normal &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34;, I had tons of red, flat spots all over my cheeks for years. I never knew why but I couldn&#x27;t get rid of them for anything. Once I started using this, I noticed the redness going away within the first week. Once I ran out, I was lazy and decided to use my old facewash, which was a huge mistake. I re-ordered and have been using for the last 2 months and have noticed a huge difference. I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup to cover up! For anyone with skin problems, I would also recommend Kat Von D makeup. Her Lock-It Tattoo foundation is the only thing I have found that completely covers my spots (it&#x27;s amazing) and also doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time but it seems to be working well for me. I recommend trying it if you have problem skin it calms everything down which I like about it.</li>
            <li> Worked good ;)  noticed results fast</li>
            <li> perfect for my skin. keeps my face from breaking out.</li>
            <li> Best price for the product that I could find online.  Item arrived in the estimated time frame and everything was as it was described.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit once when I was in middle school and once again in college.  It hadn&#x27;t worked the first time but I had hoped it would possibly work the second time I purchased it.  But it didn&#x27;t..    The first couple days I used it, my skin felt soft and refreshed. But then my skin began to break out like crazy. I was aware that this was a stage and would get better after a few weeks.  Yet my skin continued to get worse for 5 weeks. It got so bad that I got many scars on my face when I hadn&#x27;t before.  I had to finally stop using it because I feared the scars would get worse.  I got a refund from the company.     Good- skin feels soft and refreshed.  Do like the mask and cleanser.  Company was pleasant to deal with    Bad- Made acne worse, made face greasier</li>
            <li> My face stays clear with this. Nothing else has worked and I have used it for years. It&#x27;s Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and it isn&#x27;t all that high in quality, to be honest. It didn&#x27;t work very well for me. The wash was slimy and the moisturizer was greasy. It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it really seemed to clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Three teen boys look better already.  Good sized products for a kit.  Good value vs. individual item purchases.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is already clearing up my complexion.Proactiv did not work for me but Murad does. I look forward to seeing the progress at the end of 60 days.</li>
            <li> I love the Murad products. My skin has FINALLY cleared up after using this...and I have tried everything. It takes a little longer than Proactive did...but I have been using it for awhile now, and the acne hasn&#x27;t returned like it did with Proactive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter  and she used it as instructed but It did not work for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal. I wouldn&#x27;t say it did much for my cystic adult acne but the face wash (which will last you forever) is amazing and so is the skin perfecting moisturizer. I recommend  them to people without acne problems. Didn&#x27;t care for the gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 yo daughter. It is cheaper than the kit in the salon and better than proactive which dried her out terribly.  There was noticeable improvement and her faced remained smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> This has been the only face wash to actually get rid of my acne. Amazing product and usually cheaper on amazon than ulta. I suggest getting the bigger bottle because it saves so much money over time</li>
            <li> I first learned about this line from going to Massage Envy locally. I decided to continue using the products and I find it less expensive on Amazon.  Previously, I used ProActiv and that worked great for my skin.  However, it dried me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find with the Murad Acne line that it keeps my skin soft and clear.  They also don&#x27;t test on animals, which is a big plus to me.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin was super oily and I was breaking out worse. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has helped my oily/combination skin with acne.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much like some other products do.</li>
            <li> Great product. Costly if purchased individually so I recommend choosing the kit that works for your needs.</li>
            <li> I love Murad products! If I am starting to get a zit, I use the cleanse twice a day &amp; I&#x27;ll see the zit start to clear up the next day. Its a great deal buying through Amazon instead of going through the Murad website &amp; paying more money for the same products. It is also important  to note that if  you do use the set that is provided, from step 1 to step 4, you should also use a moisture afterwards because it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely manner but cased more breakouts than it fixed.Maybe I need a more gentle product.I would use the cleanser but not the full kit.</li>
            <li> I have seen amazing improvements in my skin with these products. My acne has cleared up significantly and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. Fingers crossed it continues to work : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: week 4. . .? second round of purchased product: skin is still better than it was before, but the acne is still present...</li>
            <li> Great product could tell a different right away. I have a terrible problem with acne and it doesn&#x27;t make it all disappear but comes awful close, closer than any other product out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all! Lasts a really long time and cheaper than more products as well! Buy from amazon</li>
            <li> My favorite acne wash! Keep in mind for the first week or so your skin is going to break out from using this product. They called it break through acne, basically your skins cleansing itself. After the first week though, if you are consistent by the end of the month your face will be completely clear! The key is being persistent.  This has been my go to face routine for about a year now. It is also the cheapest here on amazon, I paid an outrageous amount at ulta for it the first time I started using it. Very happy with this product. It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> So far its been working.</li>
            <li> I had to start slow because I do have sensitive skin. I was recommended to get this product from an friend, and I like it. It is very expensive in the stores so I was happy to get the whole starting kit for a little less money online. The smell is something to mention. I do feel that at night after using all 4 steps that I smell like sulfur or eggs. I know with the active ingredients and what the product is doing for my skin is amazing, but the smell is a force to be reckoned with.</li>
            <li> Like it so far, will update on how it treats acne in 30 days</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my face.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample size here on amazon to try it out guess what did it work so far nothing has worked on me murad is ok my skin is clear but I don&#x27;t think it helps with acne or cyst acne like I have right know.I have tryed proactive,murad,acnefree and some zit creams I have tryed everything I have two cyst acne it&#x27;s taking forever to get rid of but the rest of my face is clear I will not buy this again or proactive I think has stop working after two years of using it.But I did like the cleasner and toner it smelled good sorry it just did it work on me on to something else.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Makes my face feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for years now. I like that this formula comes in a 4 piece package.  Saved me some money.  The product has helped my acne a bit but not as much as I would hope for but will continue to use to see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with persistent adult acne for years. I&#x27;ve used all manner of benzoyl peroxide acne treatments, with only limited improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months using this Murad kit, I am ready to declare a cautious victory. Here is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First thing in the morning, wash with Clarifying Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;- Apply Clarifying Mask, leave on through breakfast (10-20min)&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse with water, apply Skin Perfecting Lotion&lt;br /&gt;- Go to work, do stuff&lt;br /&gt;- In the evening, wash with Clarifying Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;- Apply Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel&lt;br /&gt;- Just before bed, apply Acne Spot Treatment cream</li>
            <li> not working as well as we had hoped.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged female still fighting acne. My acne started with surface acne (like whiteheads) and has evolved into cystic acne (the hard, red, painful lumps under the skin). Throughout my teenage and adult life, I have been searching for products to fight acne with limited to no success. I did find that benzoyl peroxide was the most effective, however it recently began to cause serious rashes on my maturing face (too harsh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Murad acne kit on Amazon and used it for four months. The formula is nice on my skin, which is very oily. Also, I did like the accompanying card that shows you the right amount of product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as with other salicylic acid based products that I have used previous, this did not work on the worst of my acne - cystic acne. If anything, it made the problem worse. As it promised, I got the acne that it was flushing out, but the product could not make it go away. So I was left with painful, red lumps that typically take several months to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad&#x27;s is a nice kit for people that don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and have surface acne. However, I don&#x27;t feel it works against cystic acne.</li>
            <li> this stuff clears my skin ! love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my face looks cleaner!</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like this, has been using for a few months now.  the 30 day supply he had lasted 2+ months so we are thinking this 60 day will last 4 or 5 the way he uses it.  It helps better than other things he has tried.  We just hope it stays that way, since others worked in the beginning as well and then the effectiveness wore off after a few years.</li>
            <li> I am certain this is a good product. I ordered the \\&quot;free\\&quot; kit and the samples were so small, they were of little use to determine their quality. I returned the product, understanding that I would get a refund minus $10. Yesterday, lo and behold, I got another \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample \\&quot;gift.\\&quot; I called..spoke to a lovely girl reading from her script. I explained to her that I had not signed up for the membership and would be returning the \\&quot;gift.\\&quot;  I also told her that I had had to listen to countless offers when I initially ordered the product. I received my credit card bill and there was a charge for the membership. I called..spoke to another girl reading from her script. Today, it cost me $14 to return a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; I did not order and I will again lose $10 for the return. All of these companies are alike Be careful when you order a \\&quot;free\\&quot; gift. No matter what you answer to or explain what you want, you will be included in the free membership. I tried to be pleasant..it was not those girls&#x27; fault and I respect that. But, I will not ever order from Murad again, despite the good reviews they get. If their initial free gift had included samples that lasted more than one or two uses, I would perhaps now be a Murad user. Just be cautious about any company that offers a \\&quot;free&#x27; gift.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effection just so so, I still have acne problem even I used out all of them! I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the murade acne kit it work great for your skin I try all kinds of acne product and this was the only one work yes and I will give this product a 5star because it helps with acne best wishes trinetta</li>
            <li> I had acne problems and actually ordered this product on TV in new year and was really excited about the results. However, as I tried it exactly as instructed for a month or so, I didn&#x27;t see ANY improvements at all. I thought maybe because I was impatient so I kept using it until I finish the products BUT STILL NO IMPROVEMENTS. I changed to Clearasil and it HELPED A LOT.</li>
            <li> Great product for my skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was the worst acne product I have ever used. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and only developed acne in my late 20&#x27;s. I had only a small amount on my chin and around my mouth, but it is enough to drive me crazy. I usually only use organic products but I tried the dermatologist and even a natural pharmacist, but nothing worked. This product seemed like the way to go. After 3 days my acne got so bad, large cysts- worse than it ever was- looking it up, supposedly it was my skin &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; and I should stick it out for 30 days. Well, 30 days later, and my skin is worse than it ever was, irritated, large cystic acne, white heads, black heads, you name it. Two days ago I stopped using and have been taking off my makeup with cethaphil lotion and using only that- no soap, and it is starting to calm down and clear up. I am not sure I have ever left a harsh revue- but I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> When we bought Murad, it seemed like it was just going to be another item on the loooong list of acne treatments we&#x27;d tried in the past few years. The box that it came in had said &amp;#34;See results in just three days&amp;#34;, which, like all of the other claims that acne medicines blare on their commercials, seemed a bit too good to be true. We were wrong. Now, I&#x27;m not saying the I had clear skin instantaneously, but the result was very fast. The three-step system treatment includes a cleanser, oil, and lotion, all of which leave your skin feeling vibrant and refreshed. Even if you don&#x27;t see any miraculous results, the cleansing effect alone just feels plain healthy for your skin. It was almost if you could feel the treatment washing the muck out of your pores. And within three months, I had skin that would have been unrecognizable to me a year previously. If you are one of those people who have rash-like acne and zits, Murad is for you. Even compared to treatments that are advertised year-long on television, Murad is still my first pick. This review was written by my daughter. My son is using Murad now!!!</li>
            <li> not bad as far as over the counter acne kits go, but my stubborn acne is barely affected by this concentration of salicylic acid. The sulfur on the spot treatment is good at getting the blemish to purge, and the cleanser is gentle. I use mine in between the days I use the RX topical stuff, since the RX stuff is extremely drying and harsh. The exfoliator tingles, so at least I think its doing something, and the moisturizer is non greasy and quickly absorbed. I recommend this for people with almost perfect skin, as in 2 pimples a month. Or, as a supplement to a Dr. RX medication.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have bought it a few times since. Each item included has done wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 weeks and it did not clear up my skin. However, it was very effective in making old zits come to the surface. So, if your objective is to get all the crud out of your skin, then this is definitely the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product if you have to leave your house every day. Your skin can get quite bumpy and trying to use makeup to cover it all up can be a challenge.</li>
            <li> From the first few days, I have been getting great results. Even my pores are shrinking, which is amazing. My blemishes are almost gone, plus there is no scaring.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my teenage grandson,  He says it is working fine.</li>
            <li> This product dried my skin out so badly that my skin became incredible itchy, red and even more broken out.  A week after stopping using this product my skin looks significantly better than while on Murad.  Definitely buyer beware with this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this kit. It will not do anything for you that other supermarket acne cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. But people don&#x27;t understand how these things take time. For me it took about a month before my breakouts started going away. Don&#x27;t expect it to get it over night. I would rather wait a month and have it start working then have it for years to come. So the main thing is to be patient. This product was the best thing that I ever got. I tried a lot of other acne face washes and they sucked. Don&#x27;t EVER get the acne stuff that are pads. That was terrible. But murad is absoletly great. I don&#x27;t know what I would look like today if I didn&#x27;t start using it. After I got into the routine it did take some time. But again I tell you IT will go away. You might be worse after a week or two. But after a month you will be on your way to a fresh and clean new you.</li>
            <li> I have been a Murad user for years, and have been very happy with the product line.  But when my daughter was using product after product that was NOT working for her acne, including prescription products, I decided to try her on Murad.  This kit was perfect.  Her acne completely cleared off her forhead quite quickly, and the rest of her face continued to clear.  Now, her acne is totally under control.  We have now bought the larger products separately, but the kits are a great deal!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early on in my daughter&#x27;s treatment plan, but we did not notice a difference...sadly. Next step is Accutane and/or oral contraceptive.</li>
            <li> Works to cleanse your face but isn&#x27;t effective for acne as they claim. Just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before, and it works great! I bought it again because the 60 day lasts about 90 days. It&#x27;s much less expensive than buying the individual items when you can&#x27;t commit to a brand. Murad isn&#x27;t too harsh on my skin and clears it quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I have acne due to hormonal problems so nothing will be a miracle cure for acne for now but this Murad treatment seems to be controlling about 95% of my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the system for 3 weeks and from the first few days my skin looked and felt healthy and vibrant again!&lt;br /&gt;The face wash feels amazing when you use it and does a VERY good job removing dirt, oil, and even makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for everyone,&lt;br /&gt;Especially 20 and 30 something&#x27;s that need a little help with mild acne!:)</li>
            <li> my face is still f*cked up but I figure it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not as disciplined in it&#x27;s application as I should be.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ok, I still get the honey&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I think the cleanser is to aggressive.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this works really good along with the face wash. I found that 100% clear fruit of the earth aloe vera gel works even better as a moisturizer with this product rather than any other Murad product in its line. I tried like every brand and line and found aloe vera gel to be the secret weapon to acne rather than other products. The face wash, toner, and aloe vera gel is all I need now even when break outs occur. I may on occasion use the Murad mask.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever! I have tried almost everything and this is the only thing that works wonders. I never thought I had great skin until I started using this and it made my dream come true. I saw serious results in one week. It quickly helped heal my blemishes as well as preventing acne. It didn&#x27;t over dry my skin either. This is a must try for people with acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I find that the exfoliating gel works wonders for breakouts and preventing them from happening. Love Murad products and this is great deal!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have used everything from proactive to Neutrogena and this is the only thing that has worked for me. I was breaking out really bad and when i bought this product, most of my pimples were gone or reduced the next morning! This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin and have tried LOTS of products. I decided to give Murad a shot after the woman at Sephora recommended it to me. At first I was hesitant to try this product because it was slightly pricey, but after seeing it for a better deal on amazon I decided to take a chance and I have been pleased ever since. My skin has cleared up significantly and I have a lot more confidence!</li>
            <li> BEFORE Murad, my skin was still oily and small cystic pimples (maybe 6-8) were present around my jawline and neck on only the right side of my face. To be honest though, that&#x27;s probably the best my face has been the last 12 years (long term acne sufferer). I ordered Murad with high hopes due to the reviews and recommendations from family and friends; it worked for them so I figured it may work for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER 2 weeks on Murad, my neck, chin, and jawline erupted with acne on both sides of my face!!! I haven&#x27;t had a break out this bad in over 5 years. I read that people can go through a purging process BUT I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THIS BAD! I tried giving it another week, but by day 14, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting any better. In fact, one of the areas on my neck that had started to clear up by day 11, broke out with a new set of pimples on day 13. My skin was burning, inflammed, red, and full of pimples. I think any purging process that takes over a week should be under the supervision of a dermatologist; I do not recommend this as an over-the-counter product. It&#x27;s disfiguring. By day 15, I counted OVER 70 pimples (cystic, nodules, pustules, etc.) of assorted sizes (majority on my neck and jawline)! If you&#x27;re purging to this extent and still made it through to the first month, good for you; I honestly wish the best for you. BUT there is no way I can try to stay on this product for another 2 weeks; since day 3, it&#x27;s only getting worse. Yes, I am told to give it a try for the first month, but WHAT IF it only continues to get worse? Nothing is a guarantee at this point (esp. at this rate). Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to say: If you&#x27;re \\&quot;purging\\&quot; for over 3 weeks, STOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the product deserves less than 1 Star; however, Amazon deserves 5 stars. The person I spoke to on their chat-contact-service requested for me a full refund (I was told to dispose of the product and my refund should be apparent on my card in 2-3 business days). The quality ofcustomer service here is great. I just wish I never bought this product. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than other places. I have been using this product for a couple of years and it does an excellent job on my skin.</li>
            <li> The products really tame my acne. Before using it I had been suffering from terrible skin problems. Now I combat it with this kit and very happy with the results. If I manage to put spot treatment on a newly appearing spot, it disappears within couple of hours or overnight. I wash my face two times a day with the face wash and then apply face lotion. I don&#x27;t do spot treatments daily only when a problem arises. My skin has never been so clean. No rush or excessive dryness noticed. I&#x27;m running out of the face wash now and being in panic. Going to order more.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month and I am starting to notice my face clearing up. Small amounts needed makes this a product that will last.</li>
            <li> I love Murad products for me face. I think the price of the product was also very good! You should try it!</li>
            <li> The combination of products in the acne problem kit work very well.  It certainly rivals the competition and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt the authenticity of the product. It is either an older version or not authentic. It was quite different from the one I bought in Sephora, and I had confirmed with Murad that they do not longer produce this. I have return the item.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my daughter&#x27;s hard to treat acne. She is happy with it. Better than anything else we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Broke me out horribly.</li>
            <li> I read all the wonderful reviews about this product on amazon.com, however this prodcut did not work for me. I have been using it for about a week. I started with one or two blemishes on my chin and now i have a complete explosion of acne all over my face. This product caused a rash (similar to heat rash) on my face. It itches very badly and even wakes me up at night due to the irritation. I did not experience break outs this bad even when i was a teenager. Now in my late 20&#x27;s, i look like a teen going through puberty. It wasnt until i searched other websites for reviews that i see people have had the same reaction as me. The other reivews even state that their face bled from the irritation!! i am not at that point yet, but i am not going to continue on to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because the reviews say it works wonders for sensitive skin. Not so much for me. I am going to discontinue using the product in hopes my skin will heal on its own. This prodcut had a reverse effect on my skin and its so embarassing that i do not want to leave the house! One positive thing is Murad caused the sales of cover girl prodcuts to go up because i need about a weeks worth of concealer to cover this mess on my face. STAY CLEAR of this product, do not go through the same thing as me and many others.</li>
            <li> The best product for skin care and results are extremely amazing .  Just try  and you will love it.  Must have product.</li>
            <li> After a month of continuous use, other than my skin feeling and looking a bit cleaner, I&#x27;ve yet to see any real improvement in the mild acne I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.  I&#x27;m going to use the products until they&#x27;re gone and will update my review if there are any changes, good or bad.</li>
            <li> I like the product I am of mix race and it has done everything as describe by the seller! I have used the product over a month and this my second order! and it has met all of my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I never review stuff on Amazon unless it&#x27;s terrible and I feel the need to vent - but this product is awesome. I have horrible cystic acne and have for years, and I have been using this for a week and can&#x27;t believe the difference it&#x27;s made. Do I sound like an infomercial? This stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li> I Have noticed a great change in my skin. I used to use the product twice a day but started drying out my skin since i have been using it for about 2 months and switched to only once since my acne has been alot better.</li>
            <li> I order Dr.Murad from his website.. I also order the Toner with the kit..Now, I didn&#x27;t have bad acne because I had taken extreme medicine to clear it up which it did..However, my acne started to creep back up so I decided to try this product.. This product was supposed to purge my face and it did.. However, I ended up getting these little bumps all over my face but they never turned into whiteheads.. So I called customer service and the representive  told me to tried something else... So she sent me a sample of a Vitamin C peel.. Her theory was my face wasn&#x27;t oily enough the my pores were getting clogged.. So I tried that for another month and got no result.. I tried Dr.Murad for the suggested 2 months but now I wish I stopped after the 2 week..I don&#x27;t suggest this product if you dont have that bad of ance.. It&#x27;s alot of wasted money that you can use to go to the dermologist. My face now looks alligator skin with these bumps and it&#x27;s been a month trying to get back my skin.. I&#x27;m going to stick with my Neutrogena product...JUST DON&#x27;T USE IT IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE BAD ACNE!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried hundred of products and this system works!  The exfoliating gel works well without overdrying.  The lotion doesnt make my skin too oily.  Perfect set!  I also got the overnight soothing gel and hydro-moisturizer for the dream kit!</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and have always suffered from acne. I am currently on my 4th week of Murad and my skin is worse than it has ever been. I will admit the product is incredibly gentle and doesnt dry out my skin. But my face is now covered in big painful pimples. I rarely broke out on my cheeks and chin, and they are now covered in them. I have read several times that this is all part of the purging process and could take 4-6 weeks to get all the junk out. I plan to wait it out for another week and a half. If this doesnt work, what other acne products would be suggested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weber.chelsey@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Good product, five stars.</li>
            <li> Murad is a great product</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I am in my 30&#x27;s and still break out like a hormonal teenager.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, Pro Active and other various over the counter washes/treatments.  Within a couple days I noticed my skin felt healthier, it felt smooth and clean hours after I washed.  About a week later I&#x27;ve noticed the incessent blackheads on my nose disappearing.  Nothing has worked to get rid of those.  I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne.  It&#x27;s worked wonders on my problem skin.</li>
            <li> I heard wonderful things about murad and was hopeful. This product did not work for me and was an utter disappointment. I have better results with Pevonia spateen line.</li>
            <li> I have white heads and unfortunetly cystic acne that hurts really bad. This is the only product that does not dry out my skin completely. I am African American, and it is so hard to find acne products that help with my skin. I have ordered this product for over $100 on the original website. This particular purchase was so much cheaper and will last me another 60 days until I can afford to get more. Great product.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even more. I called customer service and they said it was part of the purging process. This product was not good for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. They always arrive on time. It last a lot. And of course, they really works. My face look much better since i started using it.</li>
            <li> Worked miracles on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> the product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> love it ,always on time or even earlier..&lt;br /&gt;will recommend this to some of my friends,&lt;br /&gt;love it love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff really works. It was a bit slow in the beginning. However, after about 2-3 weeks of applying it once nightly on my teenage son&#x27;s shoulders and the back of his neck (lots and lots of acne), all the sudden I noticed it started clearing up. It has cleared up is shoulders and neck big time. Again, it did take a couple weeks to start working but then it clears quickly.  I have recommended this to a mom of a acne prone teenage friend of my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling from the eucalyptus oil! works great to reduce breakouts.  Lotion is not greasy, only downside is that the bottle ended up leaking and letting water into it and watering down the face wash over time, before I knew it the bottle was full of 90% water!</li>
            <li> My skin is too picky for one brand or system.  The face wash was too hard on my skin, as was the clarifying mask.  I went back to Rx medication.</li>
            <li> I used to have cystic acne and I&#x27;ve tried lots of products found at walmart, kroger, etc and though I still get a few whiteheads here and there it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s worked the best without destroying my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good I am loving it!!!</li>
            <li> Acne treatments are difficult to review, because everyone has such different skin conditions and treatments affect everyone differently. As a twenty-five year old with acne, I can tell you that this product has been working very well for me, when pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve tried has not. It&#x27;s not made my skin 100% clear yet, but it seems well on its way. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and in that time, my acne has decreased significantly, as well as some lightning of old acne marks. Again, take this with a grain of salt, as it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone. I recommend giving it a try, however, as someone who&#x27;s tried everything. Just make sure to follow the directions on how much to use- the \\&quot;spot treatment\\&quot; is very small and probably what you&#x27;ll run out of first.</li>
            <li> I got sucked in to Murad&#x27;s line through their infomercial.  This infomercial promised that this system was unlike anything else on the market, and specifically targeted people who had tried and disliked Proactive.  So I purchased the system, and really liked it at first.  It cleared up my acne.  The cleanser smelled like a margarita (I&#x27;m apparently the only one who thought so - friends and family thought I was nuts).&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month later.  My acne started to return.  Just a little at a time, but two months after receiving the product, I was back to where I was before the kit came.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the kit, and randomly used the different products in addition to my regular skincare routine.  I got hooked on the moisturizer from this kit, which doesn&#x27;t contain SPF (and apparently my skin hates SPF!).  When using this moisturizer alone, my skin started to clear.  Years later, I&#x27;ve tweaked my cleanser (my fave being the anti-aging PTR cleanser), but the Murad moisturizer has remained a part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the kit seemed promising at first, but then failed to deliver!</li>
            <li> I have severe outbreak when I use it. A product I buy over the counter in cvs for 10 $ helps me more.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage daughter.  It&#x27;s a multi-step facial cleansing system...she reports that it works well and has helped clear her complexion.  When compared to other suppliers, the Amazon price was lower...and delivery was great.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend purchasing this for one who is able to stick with a facial regimen on a daily basis, due to its multi-step system.  The compliance is important for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Works and feels clean!</li>
            <li> Hi! I&#x27;m from Guam, ordered these online n used it for about a week now n I&#x27;ve noticed incredible smoothness on my face! Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great starter pack for Murad. Works great on my acne and has definitely cleared it up. I could tell a difference in about 4 days. I will be buying Murad for all of my facial products from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had trouble with my skin, since the beginning of puberty. I&#x27;m 20 now and was still having awful problems with my skin. Large cysts forming on my chin, on the sides of my nose and between my eyebrows. I&#x27;m halfway through week 2 and my skin has NEVER looked better. After the first day I saw a dramatic difference! The directions booklet did say that after 3 days or so my skin would begin the purging process, which I&#x27;m going through now. But I&#x27;m hell bent on continuing the treatment and I do feel as though by week 4 I&#x27;ll see an even more dramatic improvement. I don&#x27;t feel the urge to pop any of my zits anymore with the acne spot treatment, dab a little on every time I wash my face and they&#x27;re gone within a couple days. No more cysts, and no more scars. I can&#x27;t wait to get to the end of the treatment and see what happens! I have high hopes for these products for sure.</li>
            <li> I got this along with an Aria Clarisonic thinking and hoping it would be the perfect combination&lt;br /&gt;but it was just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for 30 days now and my acne has gotten worse actually, i dont usually get a lot&lt;br /&gt;of acne but now i have more zits.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because the product seem to be of good quality when i used them but again, it just&lt;br /&gt;made my situation worse.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying Dermalogica once im done with this kit (i think the bottles have 2 weeks left of use in them)&lt;br /&gt;And will update!</li>
            <li> I couldnt beat my acne no matter what. After investing in this product after much hesitation, I cleared up within 2 months! I could not believe it. My skin is sensitive and this did not bother it at all</li>
            <li> I have used Murad for a while and switched to this kit for the value of it. Love my change to Murad. I suffer from adult acne mostly cyst type that is stress related. Granted my skin is never completely clear, it has cleared up a lot and feels more under control. Murad also doesn&#x27;t bleach bedding and towels like benzoyl peroxide products, and my skin is incredibly soft and smooth. This product also contains retinol and glycolic acid so no need for anti aging products in conjunction with it. I highly recommend it over and above any other system and I have tried everything over the years. Other recommendation is read the product insert as it tells you how much to use and I feel I have overused the product in the past, in which case it clearly states overuse can worsen your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching my make up has gone a long way to improving my appearance and how I feel about my skin overall. I made the change to Bobbi Brown and ditched the so called mineral powders for a full coverage foundation. I have never been happier. I spent about $200 in November 2011 on kitting myself out from her counter at a local Department store and have a natural feel coverage that is smooth and glides on, stays on and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my blemishes but gives great coverage. I also got blush, lipstick, gloss etc. within that $200. Since then the only thing I have had to buy more of is the foundation and powder (lasts on average about 6 months with daily use, sometimes twice daily use if I go out at night). Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get breakouts the way I used to anymore! My skin feels softer and&lt;br /&gt;is clearing up. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had constant acne since I was a preteen, so for 8 years now. The only time the acne would go away enough to feel good about my skin was during the early weeks of summer. Before discovering Murad I had tried every product under the sun. My skin needed improvement in every area: blackheads, red bumps, white bumps, oily, dry, RED. Just overall terrible for YEARS. And it didn&#x27;t go away once I became an adult either. I felt like I needed to buy every product in the store just to fix it. But all of those products I was using helped one area but made others worse: like exfoliators made me red and dry, moisturizers caused breakouts, toners increased blackheads. It was a constant push and pull effect. Using this kit every day is a life saver! Getting my first facial was the first step. After two months I am 200% more confidant and happy with my skin. The kit has a cleanser that exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t feel like an exfoliator. Acne gel is a must: it&#x27;s like a toner, leaves me feeling refreshed. Acne spot treatment is a lifesaver: shrinks bumps exponentially with each application. Moisturizer is perfect: leaves skin dewy and supple. I never thought I would use dewy and supple to describe my skin! After three weeks of just these products I needed a deeper clean so I got the clarifying mask.-LOVE Once you go Murad you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> it dries out my skin and makes its so rough and bumpy.</li>
            <li> I have never suffered from acne until I hit about age 26.  The first time I experienced it was shortly after my second son was born and the residual pregnancy hormones left my body.  I broke out in acne all over my forehead and along my hairline.  I had used another, well-known acne treatment program that tore my skin up.  In an effort to find an alternative treatment that would actual clear up the acne without damaging my skin, I found Murad.  I only purchased one kit, and my acne was gone within a month.  I loved how it made my skin feel and really loved that the acne was cleared up with out the harshness to my skin.  I stopped using the products after my skin cleared and thought I was finished with my experience with adult acne.  Not so much...  Recently again, (nearly 7 years later) I had another break-out with the same symptoms - acne all over my forehead and along my hairline.  This time, I tried using some organic-based and botanical products along with altering my diet and bumping up my exercise routine, but no luck. :(  After a month or two of this, I gave in and decided to purchase the only product that had worked for me before.  And I am SO HAPPY I DID!  Another month on the Murad Acne Complex and my acne is almost all the way gone.  As the products states, there is a good chance that it will get a little worse within the first week of use, but after that the acne almost melts away.  It really is a miracle.  It really does work!  Thank you, Murad - I&#x27;ll never try another product again!</li>
