            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love this soap and scent!</li>
            <li>Smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice lather, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of off putting, it reminds me of this chewable medicine I used to take.</li>
            <li>Its nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect for streamlining your shower routine, Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel is packaged in a very generous 32oz bottle with a pump.</li>

            <li>Daughter is very happy with this product and really likes the smell.  </li>
            <li>I order the lavender kind also.</li>
            <li>I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather.</li>
            <li>It smells good, although its probably better for a bath rather than shower.</li>
            <li>The soap is nice</li>
            <li>Smells Good without being too strong.</li>
            <li>Also very soft on the skin, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>If you are a consumer who likes very strong smelling fruity or flower scents</li>
            <li>VERY strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Its so unique and relaxing, like a product you would have used on you at a spa (besides lavender, mint or rose!)</li>
            <li>Soft on your skin, great scent!</li>
            <li>One of the best smelling, natural shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>kind of blah..not refreshing...</li>
            <li>This is a nice body shower gel that works great for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>smell is very pleasant, and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried.</li>
            <li>amazing smell, love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>Great value, huge bottle with a pump which is great for a six year old.</li>
            <li>This smells good, but it&#x27;s full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my overly sensitive skin, smells great, love this brand!</li>
            <li>Smells nice and love the super size !</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, and the large quantity makes it well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The only great thing about this body wash is it smells good..</li>
            <li>I LOVE fruity fragrances</li>
            <li>and then when I lathered it on my poof, while it lathers okay, it smelled musky and nothing like in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I just love the mango scent.</li>
            <li>Lathers ok for an organic shower gel, it performs ok just the smell that&#x27;s the most bothersome</li>
            <li>You would think that in 2012 there would be more unscented products on the market.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not so &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; that it interferes with my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Ive used it for over a year, and still love it.</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love how the bottle is set up, the push top makes it so you don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love this product ....</li>
            <li>Great price for how much you get.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay and not offensive.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have it on auto ship so we can keep both showers stocked.</li>
            <li>and I love Alba products.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and size, but it&#x27;s drying even though it states &amp;#34;emollient&amp;#34;.Still</li>
            <li>Love the smell not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I love Alba but not this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>Husband wont mind using this one either, and its much better for him to use then</li>
            <li>I love Alba Botanica&#x27;s emollient shower washes -</li>
            <li>love the pump as well.</li>
            <li>I personally love this body wash and the smell.</li>
            <li>More then anything</li>
            <li>, I just love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer it more over the honey mango.</li>
            <li>great value for the size, but the smell not so much.</li>
            <li>Who has time for that :) ?</li>
            <li>It is not horrible but just not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad there wasn&#x27;t anything else shipped with it.  </li>
            <li>Once I use some more of it</li>
            <li>Still love the soap though.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this because I was looking for a shower gel that had a bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice that it is available on subscribe and save as well.</li>
            <li>What more could you want in a bath soap?</li>
            <li>and it was OK.</li>
            <li>Love the honey mango scent.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love Alba, love this gel, love this scent.  </li>
            <li>(LOVE the body wash)...</li>
            <li>Used it to shave too :)</li>
            <li>The packaging had some spillage on it, and when I took the product out to use the top will not unscrew to pump</li>
            <li>so I have to take the top off each time...</li>
            <li>but I thought it would have more fragrance.</li>
            <li>The honey mango is slightly more on the feminine side, but still amazing quality and worth it.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for the guys and the gals love it too.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a soap with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Im just happy to have a big bottle to look forward to in my shower - love love.</li>
            <li>and I was so happy to find something all natural and not store brand chemically enhanced</li>
            <li>I loved the shine so much,</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t understand how they call it very emollient because nothing in the ingredients suggests that there is anything moisturizing in it, no Jojoba oil or anything good.</li>
            <li>It is very emollient and smells good too.</li>
            <li>It feels very pleasant, it smells quite nice, without being overpowering, and it gets one clean and has a slightly moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>If you like a strong smell then please order.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Alba in general makes great products.</li>
            <li>It smells fine though.</li>
            <li>I have ordered it previously and have been VERY happy with Alba products.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is great, but the only compliant I have is the smell is a bit too strong, like over-ripe mango&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love how it lathers, love how it feels on my very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>The huge 32 oz.</li>
            <li>The fragance is overwhelming... and far from amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a great light scent and the fact that there are no harmful chemicals is a BIG plus!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>FAIRLY  SMOOTH ON MY SKIN  </li>
            <li>A great price for such a good body wash, especially since it&#x27;s SLS free!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it makes my skin so moist and it stays that way until I shower or bathe the next day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s filled with moister</li>
            <li>my kids enjoy the smell too.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>how smooth you feel after your shower.</li>
            <li>Loves the way it smells and leaves my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling quite silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Such a great and moisturizing alternative that smells dreamy.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle body clean</li>
            <li>They are animal friendly and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li>I like the light fragrance that makes me feel clean, not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well, and the pump bottle makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This gel rinses clean with no residue, and just feels clean and comfortable after using.</li>
            <li>Im excited</li>
            <li>The lather is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but I think this smells like feet and am pretty sure I&#x27;m not going to get over it.</li>
            <li>Not only is the smell amazing, its natural and makes our skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Its worth the price, it lasts almost three months!</li>
            <li>I pretty much love anything by Alba Botanica.  </li>
            <li>love this product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The gel has an opalescent look to it and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>It was formerly manufactured by Avalon Natural Products and was wonderful.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to clean our bodies well.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is a more natural product.</li>
            <li>IT IS  GOOD,  NATURAL, ECONOMICAL  </li>
            <li>I have also found that the Alba shower/bath gels are superior in many ways to the other brands of bath and shower gels that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The wife&#x27;s review - When I first purchased this product, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the honey mango scent (it neither smells like honey or mango to me) and didn&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the results out of the shower were enough to make me forget about the smell!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, it is all natural</li>
            <li>Its fruity and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years, and also love alba&#x27;s &#x27;very emollient body lotions&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It smells so fruity and sweet but don&#x27;t worry</li>
            <li>I love that I can really smell the honey in it.</li>
            <li>(it makes me so fresh and so clean, clean)</li>
            <li>Great price for a good product, as similar size bottles from other brands can easily cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean, fresh &amp; not irritated.</li>
            <li>THE SCENT  GOES AWAY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since finding out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14.</li>
            <li>though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>This is a mild shower gel which leaves my skin with some moisture in it when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I enjoy it very much and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have had problems finding Alba products in many stores, therefore, it is great being able to buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality for the price with a light (not over-powering) scent that left my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but they sure don&#x27;t sound good---and most of the other ingredients you cannot pronounce.</li>
            <li>bottled will last quite some time, though the price per ounce is really pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The fragrant is not to strong but works very well.</li>
            <li>NICE BUT NOT LONG  </li>
            <li>Formerly was mostly organic ingredients and no water!</li>
            <li>I find that this is a very good, basic shower gel for daily use.</li>
            <li>The sparkling mint is by far my favorite body wash from this company.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ALL NATURAL PRODUCTS SMELLS</li>
            <li>To me its more earthy and natural than fruity/flowery.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting a more natural product with out having to make it yourself.  </li>
            <li>You get alot of bang for your buck and it&#x27;s more of a natural product.  </li>
            <li>CLEAN AND FRESH READY</li>
            <li>To me it smells flat as if it&#x27;s unscented yet still has a scent of some kind.</li>
            <li>But it is organic and the price was right</li>
            <li>The honey mango smell went away right away.  </li>
            <li>I considered several brands and smells before finally purchasing this body wash; I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this one!  </li>
            <li>It softens my skin and does not dry it out like so many products.</li>
            <li>My combination skin seems to react well to it, but I can see how this could be a little drying to those with dryer skin (nothing a good after shower moisturizer can&#x27;t combat).</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it&#x27;s sweet but subtle and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>First off, The description states that is had a paraben it it.</li>
            <li>I can buy it locally in smaller packages, but the bulk sizing is much more reasonably-priced, plus I&#x27;m a big fan of the pump top as it saves time in the shower.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and natural, A+.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the other scents and love those too!</li>
            <li>It is a good cleanser with a heavenly smell that has some moisturizing properties although it doesn&#x27;t replace lotion, particularly in the winter a whole lot of lotion is still required if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used Alba for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>Hain evidently purchased Avalon and now this is manufactured by Hain.</li>
            <li>at first it smelled like mango</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned about using this product, since I had never purchased anything of the brand before.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this body wash!</li>
            <li>I expected it to have a nice Mango scent</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s more natural than other chemical laden brands, foams up really well and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable, and it&#x27;s delivered right to our front door.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li>:) $15 is a bit higher than average for a body wash, but this is also a decently large size bottle, so I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I was only able to find it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Alba makes really good products although some are more expensive than others.</li>
            <li>love the smell and lasts a long time in a household of 6 people.</li>
            <li>When I first read reviews on this shower gel, it said that it smelled amazing in quite a few of them.</li>
            <li>expected more honey or sweet natural scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality &amp; good natural ingredients &amp; doesn&#x27;t create any dry skin for my family which many other soaps do.</li>
            <li>but it is really light and washes away easily leaving no residue or heavy scent.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out sensitive skin -- nice product.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, and is gentle enough to not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every brand and type available at your local box stores.</li>
            <li>The return with Amazon.com was free and simple.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses and lasts a while when buying the 32 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Reasonable Price&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a gentle cleanser that supplies that bit of hydration that might be all I need that day.</li>
            <li>Alba is a responsible company and creates a quality product.  </li>
            <li>I would not say it smells very mango-like, but I can smell the honey.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to Hain.</li>
            <li>A gentle aroma still comes off my skin for hours after the shower.  </li>
            <li>I can stand up with this smell until I use this whole 32 ounce bottle up.</li>
            <li>Very deceiving.</li>
            <li>a real pain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I like how I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get it to foam up really well - 2 pumps</li>
            <li>but I could not smell much of anything.</li>
            <li>this was packed very well with no leakage.</li>
            <li>Extra great during dry winter months so as to not dry your hands.</li>
            <li>Other than that,it is ok.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the other scents will provide something more up my alley.</li>
            <li>(Like with most organic products)&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the opposite with the original product.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very nicely with only a small amount.  </li>
            <li>A real clean feeling without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>oooooh such a sweet morning shower every day</li>
            <li>I think next time I&#x27;ll look into there full body wash rather than the dual shower/bath gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve set up a subscription since this is my new go-to!</li>
            <li>New fave!</li>
            <li>I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a decent body wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year and love it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended, so I gave it a try</li>
            <li>It is gentle and my skin feels really soft after this has been used.</li>
            <li>And I really like that it is natural</li>
            <li>My new fave.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t live close to one anymore</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like heaven, but I have very sensitive skin, and it made me itch.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than most body wash at the store, but you&#x27;re not left with the dry itchy skin afterward and again, the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I feel like the smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>I will try out some of their other scents to see if there is one I like better, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the last body wash I&#x27;ll ever buy!</li>
            <li>I think this large container will last me a while!</li>
            <li>I still had to apply lotion after my shower and with my old body wash I didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>It works well and is not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin you must try this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have a sensitive nose or</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the smell</li>
            <li>I have not found anything so natural smelling</li>
            <li>Does not smell natural to me.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle enough for my child to use in the bath each night.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and psoriasis</li>
            <li>Smell is ok...not natural smell though;</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but only really lathers when you use varied amounts.</li>
            <li>I am truly smell sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Very watered down - the first ingredient is now water.</li>
            <li>No better and no worse than any other regular kind</li>
            <li>My first order last year busted open in the box in transit, but they seem to have figured  that issue out...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the above average price scare you away, you get what you pay for and this stuff is easily worth it!</li>
            <li>It is less harsh than the stuff guys normally buy and my skin already feels better.</li>
            <li>Our water is a little alkaline making it easy for my skin dry out, however using this product helps to keep my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This Alba shower gel is perfect:  the scent is subtle (definitely not overpowering), and it definitely helps moisturize this seriously scaly-skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using with in conjunction with an exfoliation glove and the results have been incredibly soft and supple skin!</li>
            <li>, foam-ability is lucious, and you barely have to use any to wash the whole body, so it will last and last!</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using it on my kids too because the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful to their delicate skin.</li>
            <li>(The Mango is more nectar-y/floral than I expected, but not overwhelmingly so.)</li>
            <li>chose to try the honey mango scent, and I find it to be relatively cloying when smelled directly.</li>
            <li>Not only are all the ingredients vegan it leaves your skin feeling soft as a babies bum.</li>
            <li>I went back to my Aveeno moisturizing wash, and my skin is back to normal....</li>
            <li>That Was something I was most definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li>I was able to recover enough that it wasn&#x27;t a waste, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work and now has sharp pieces sticking off.  </li>
            <li>and it did not dry my hair out at all!</li>
            <li>Cheaper here than in Whole Foods or other stores.</li>
            <li>Both adults in the house complained that we didn&#x27;t feel or smell clean after using the product.  </li>
            <li>This large bottle will last me a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go very far, I need to use so much of it, It won&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry me out.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice lather, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>

            <li> One of the best smelling, natural shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> kind of blah..not refreshing...</li>
            <li> This is a nice body shower gel that works great for the whole family.  </li>

            <li> Smells nice and love the super size !</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, and the large quantity makes it well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The only great thing about this body wash is it smells good..</li>
            <li> I LOVE fruity fragrances</li>
            <li> and then when I lathered it on my poof, while it lathers okay, it smelled musky and nothing like in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I just love the mango scent.</li>
            <li> Lathers ok for an organic shower gel, it performs ok just the smell that&#x27;s the most bothersome</li>
            <li> You would think that in 2012 there would be more unscented products on the market.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not so &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; that it interferes with my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for over a year, and still love it.</li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I also love how the bottle is set up, the push top makes it so you don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product ....</li>
            <li> Great price for how much you get.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay and not offensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have it on auto ship so we can keep both showers stocked.</li>
            <li> and I love Alba products.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and size, but it&#x27;s drying even though it states &amp;#34;emollient&amp;#34;.Still</li>
            <li> Love the smell not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash.</li>
            <li> I love Alba but not this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> Husband wont mind using this one either, and its much better for him to use then</li>
            <li> I love Alba Botanica&#x27;s emollient shower washes -</li>
            <li> love the pump as well.</li>
            <li> I personally love this body wash and the smell.</li>
            <li> More then anything</li>
            <li> , I just love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer it more over the honey mango.</li>
            <li> great value for the size, but the smell not so much.</li>
            <li> Who has time for that :) ?</li>
            <li> It is not horrible but just not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad there wasn&#x27;t anything else shipped with it.  </li>
            <li> Once I use some more of it</li>
            <li> Still love the soap though.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because I was looking for a shower gel that had a bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Nice that it is available on subscribe and save as well.</li>
            <li> What more could you want in a bath soap?</li>
            <li> and it was OK.</li>
            <li> Love the honey mango scent.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love Alba, love this gel, love this scent.  </li>
            <li> (LOVE the body wash)...</li>
            <li> Used it to shave too :)</li>
            <li> The packaging had some spillage on it, and when I took the product out to use the top will not unscrew to pump</li>
            <li> so I have to take the top off each time...</li>
            <li> but I thought it would have more fragrance.</li>
            <li> The honey mango is slightly more on the feminine side, but still amazing quality and worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for the guys and the gals love it too.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a soap with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Im just happy to have a big bottle to look forward to in my shower - love love.</li>
            <li> and I was so happy to find something all natural and not store brand chemically enhanced</li>
            <li> I loved the shine so much,</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t understand how they call it very emollient because nothing in the ingredients suggests that there is anything moisturizing in it, no Jojoba oil or anything good.</li>
            <li> It is very emollient and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It feels very pleasant, it smells quite nice, without being overpowering, and it gets one clean and has a slightly moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong smell then please order.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Alba in general makes great products.</li>
            <li> It smells fine though.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it previously and have been VERY happy with Alba products.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is great, but the only compliant I have is the smell is a bit too strong, like over-ripe mango&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how it lathers, love how it feels on my very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> The huge 32 oz.</li>
            <li> The fragance is overwhelming... and far from amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a great light scent and the fact that there are no harmful chemicals is a BIG plus!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> FAIRLY  SMOOTH ON MY SKIN  </li>
            <li> A great price for such a good body wash, especially since it&#x27;s SLS free!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it makes my skin so moist and it stays that way until I shower or bathe the next day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s filled with moister</li>
            <li> my kids enjoy the smell too.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> how smooth you feel after your shower.</li>
            <li> Loves the way it smells and leaves my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling quite silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Such a great and moisturizing alternative that smells dreamy.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle body clean</li>
            <li> They are animal friendly and that&#x27;s important to me.  </li>
            <li> I like the light fragrance that makes me feel clean, not perfumed.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well, and the pump bottle makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This gel rinses clean with no residue, and just feels clean and comfortable after using.</li>
            <li> Im excited</li>
            <li> The lather is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but I think this smells like feet and am pretty sure I&#x27;m not going to get over it.</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell amazing, its natural and makes our skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Its worth the price, it lasts almost three months!</li>
            <li> I pretty much love anything by Alba Botanica.  </li>
            <li> love this product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The gel has an opalescent look to it and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> It was formerly manufactured by Avalon Natural Products and was wonderful.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to clean our bodies well.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it is a more natural product.</li>
            <li> IT IS  GOOD,  NATURAL, ECONOMICAL  </li>
            <li> I have also found that the Alba shower/bath gels are superior in many ways to the other brands of bath and shower gels that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s review - When I first purchased this product, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the honey mango scent (it neither smells like honey or mango to me) and didn&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the results out of the shower were enough to make me forget about the smell!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, it is all natural</li>
            <li> Its fruity and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, and also love alba&#x27;s &#x27;very emollient body lotions&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It smells so fruity and sweet but don&#x27;t worry</li>
            <li> I love that I can really smell the honey in it.</li>
            <li> (it makes me so fresh and so clean, clean)</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product, as similar size bottles from other brands can easily cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, fresh &amp; not irritated.</li>
            <li> THE SCENT  GOES AWAY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since finding out I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14.</li>
            <li> though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> This is a mild shower gel which leaves my skin with some moisture in it when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I enjoy it very much and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had problems finding Alba products in many stores, therefore, it is great being able to buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for the price with a light (not over-powering) scent that left my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> but they sure don&#x27;t sound good---and most of the other ingredients you cannot pronounce.</li>
            <li> bottled will last quite some time, though the price per ounce is really pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The fragrant is not to strong but works very well.</li>
            <li> NICE BUT NOT LONG  </li>
            <li> Formerly was mostly organic ingredients and no water!</li>
            <li> I find that this is a very good, basic shower gel for daily use.</li>
            <li> The sparkling mint is by far my favorite body wash from this company.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL NATURAL PRODUCTS SMELLS</li>
            <li> To me its more earthy and natural than fruity/flowery.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting a more natural product with out having to make it yourself.  </li>
            <li> You get alot of bang for your buck and it&#x27;s more of a natural product.  </li>
            <li> CLEAN AND FRESH READY</li>
            <li> To me it smells flat as if it&#x27;s unscented yet still has a scent of some kind.</li>
            <li> But it is organic and the price was right</li>
            <li> The honey mango smell went away right away.  </li>
            <li> I considered several brands and smells before finally purchasing this body wash; I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this one!  </li>
            <li> It softens my skin and does not dry it out like so many products.</li>
            <li> My combination skin seems to react well to it, but I can see how this could be a little drying to those with dryer skin (nothing a good after shower moisturizer can&#x27;t combat).</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, it&#x27;s sweet but subtle and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> First off, The description states that is had a paraben it it.</li>
            <li> I can buy it locally in smaller packages, but the bulk sizing is much more reasonably-priced, plus I&#x27;m a big fan of the pump top as it saves time in the shower.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and natural, A+.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other scents and love those too!</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser with a heavenly smell that has some moisturizing properties although it doesn&#x27;t replace lotion, particularly in the winter a whole lot of lotion is still required if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used Alba for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> Hain evidently purchased Avalon and now this is manufactured by Hain.</li>
            <li> at first it smelled like mango</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned about using this product, since I had never purchased anything of the brand before.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this body wash!</li>
            <li> I expected it to have a nice Mango scent</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s more natural than other chemical laden brands, foams up really well and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable, and it&#x27;s delivered right to our front door.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I&#x27;m not so sure.  </li>
            <li> :) $15 is a bit higher than average for a body wash, but this is also a decently large size bottle, so I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was only able to find it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li> Alba makes really good products although some are more expensive than others.</li>
            <li> love the smell and lasts a long time in a household of 6 people.</li>
            <li> When I first read reviews on this shower gel, it said that it smelled amazing in quite a few of them.</li>
            <li> expected more honey or sweet natural scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality &amp; good natural ingredients &amp; doesn&#x27;t create any dry skin for my family which many other soaps do.</li>
            <li> but it is really light and washes away easily leaving no residue or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out sensitive skin -- nice product.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, and is gentle enough to not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand and type available at your local box stores.</li>
            <li> The return with Amazon.com was free and simple.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses and lasts a while when buying the 32 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Reasonable Price&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a gentle cleanser that supplies that bit of hydration that might be all I need that day.</li>
            <li> Alba is a responsible company and creates a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I would not say it smells very mango-like, but I can smell the honey.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to Hain.</li>
            <li> A gentle aroma still comes off my skin for hours after the shower.  </li>
            <li> I can stand up with this smell until I use this whole 32 ounce bottle up.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving.</li>
            <li> a real pain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I like how I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get it to foam up really well - 2 pumps</li>
            <li> but I could not smell much of anything.</li>
            <li> this was packed very well with no leakage.</li>
            <li> Extra great during dry winter months so as to not dry your hands.</li>
            <li> Other than that,it is ok.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the other scents will provide something more up my alley.</li>
            <li> (Like with most organic products)&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the opposite with the original product.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very nicely with only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> A real clean feeling without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> oooooh such a sweet morning shower every day</li>
            <li> I think next time I&#x27;ll look into there full body wash rather than the dual shower/bath gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve set up a subscription since this is my new go-to!</li>
            <li> New fave!</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a decent body wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year and love it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended, so I gave it a try</li>
            <li> It is gentle and my skin feels really soft after this has been used.</li>
            <li> And I really like that it is natural</li>
            <li> My new fave.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t live close to one anymore</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like heaven, but I have very sensitive skin, and it made me itch.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than most body wash at the store, but you&#x27;re not left with the dry itchy skin afterward and again, the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but I feel like the smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> I will try out some of their other scents to see if there is one I like better, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the last body wash I&#x27;ll ever buy!</li>
            <li> I think this large container will last me a while!</li>
            <li> I still had to apply lotion after my shower and with my old body wash I didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> It works well and is not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin you must try this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have a sensitive nose or</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the smell</li>
            <li> I have not found anything so natural smelling</li>
            <li> Does not smell natural to me.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle enough for my child to use in the bath each night.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and psoriasis</li>
            <li> Smell is ok...not natural smell though;</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but only really lathers when you use varied amounts.</li>
            <li> I am truly smell sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Very watered down - the first ingredient is now water.</li>
            <li> No better and no worse than any other regular kind</li>
            <li> My first order last year busted open in the box in transit, but they seem to have figured  that issue out...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the above average price scare you away, you get what you pay for and this stuff is easily worth it!</li>
            <li> It is less harsh than the stuff guys normally buy and my skin already feels better.</li>
            <li> Our water is a little alkaline making it easy for my skin dry out, however using this product helps to keep my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This Alba shower gel is perfect:  the scent is subtle (definitely not overpowering), and it definitely helps moisturize this seriously scaly-skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using with in conjunction with an exfoliation glove and the results have been incredibly soft and supple skin!</li>
            <li> , foam-ability is lucious, and you barely have to use any to wash the whole body, so it will last and last!</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using it on my kids too because the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful to their delicate skin.</li>
            <li> (The Mango is more nectar-y/floral than I expected, but not overwhelmingly so.)</li>
            <li> chose to try the honey mango scent, and I find it to be relatively cloying when smelled directly.</li>
            <li> Not only are all the ingredients vegan it leaves your skin feeling soft as a babies bum.</li>
            <li> I went back to my Aveeno moisturizing wash, and my skin is back to normal....</li>
            <li> That Was something I was most definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li> I was able to recover enough that it wasn&#x27;t a waste, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work and now has sharp pieces sticking off.  </li>
            <li> and it did not dry my hair out at all!</li>
            <li> Cheaper here than in Whole Foods or other stores.</li>
            <li> Both adults in the house complained that we didn&#x27;t feel or smell clean after using the product.  </li>
            <li> This large bottle will last me a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go very far, I need to use so much of it, It won&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry me out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way: 1-2 pumps on a loofa is enough for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> One squirt in a scrunchy does my whole body, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer-- a nice big supply and less expensive than I can find in store.</li>
            <li> and there is no actual honey or mango in it, which is odd for a natural body wash, you&#x27;d think they would have added that.</li>
            <li> It should last  a long time.</li>
            <li> Unlike the minty version of this product this one has actual moisturizing benefits and I suffer from dry skin so that&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> This bottle was bigger than I expected and should last me a while.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this shower gel in the future to try the other scents because the value can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I live in the dry desert and had trouble finding a hydrating body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanica bath &amp; shower gel for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Bodywash that actually smells like nature, not the artificial fruit/nature/garden fragrances that so many other brands smell like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with Hain right now.</li>
            <li> Just like their other product one pump is plenty for your entire body.</li>
            <li> I used to have those little white bumps on my upper arms, since I&#x27;ve started using this body wash they have went away!</li>
            <li> I tried other bath and shower gels you can buy at the \\&quot;big box\\&quot; stores and none of them can compare with this product.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time in my shower!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly dry</li>
            <li> I find in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> When I received the product and used it for the first time, I was disappointed to find that it smells like you are taking a bath in pure honey.</li>
            <li> so I always have to be really careful about what kinds of soaps and lotions I use.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this except buy it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the size of bottles in the stores are so small and don&#x27;t last very long, I like this size.</li>
            <li> I bought this shower gel because I&#x27;m trying to use products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had very dry skin, but this gel made my skin so flakey that my arms and legs were molting!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower.</li>
            <li> Going on other reviews, I purchased this body wash about 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It cleans just as well as any other shower gel.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it is a step above the usual drugstore body wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel a residue or extreme dryness from after using it.</li>
            <li> Other body washes make me itch and break out.</li>
            <li> I, like some of the other reviewers, have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, other people might like it, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A LARGE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> This is an average body wash.</li>
            <li> but it smelled like something not fresh and stale…</li>
            <li> Seems watered down...</li>
            <li> But none the less, it does not leave residue or film on the skin either.</li>
            <li> However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes.</li>
            <li> The slightly flexible bottle stayed intact.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> /&gt;: Little goes along</li>
            <li> I thought this was a little pricey for shower gel</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products with a scent that I can use.</li>
            <li> It is written in big bold letters on the bottle:No animal testing, artificial colors, prabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate. !!</li>
            <li> I also find it very odd</li>
            <li> look no more.</li>
            <li> I use it as a shower gel and just a teaspoonful foams like crazy [in soft water].  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the scent but the gel makes your skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to the dangers of questionable chemicals again.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they are</li>
            <li> There was a small leak once, and the plastic wrapping took care of it.</li>
            <li> but this price is WAY too expensive for the tiny bottle I received.</li>
            <li> (I have extremely hard water).</li>
            <li> and I got tired of feeling like the soap was destroying my skin.</li>
            <li> no more flakes!</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that I am usually forced to buy unscented products because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t actually that bad.  </li>
            <li> However, this Mango smell is NOT a good scent....</li>
            <li> but this was a little too artificial chemical smelling for me.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with a broken bottle because there was no padding in the box.  </li>
            <li> It smells very artificial and not really like mango at all.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a cruelty-free body wash that&#x27;s not too expensive, and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this smell...</li>
            <li> Our household is obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Has been a life saver through this cold winter.  </li>
            <li> No animal testing, artificial colors, parabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong, 32oz for 12.00?!</li>
            <li> package was badly damaged when it arrived and had leaked body wash all over everything.</li>
            <li> I think it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, but its also not great.</li>
            <li> We use a lot of botanical based skin products and were disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I received this shipment as I have been ordering this body wash through Amazon for months</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I hate the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I HATE IT.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see all the flakes, and I wondered if I had some horrible skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li> And I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell, it&#x27;s just like rotten fruits !!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good consistency, but I feel like the smell is a little strong for me. Like the thing that it is organic</li>
            <li> I like Alba products. We always try to use organic products around the house. This soap smells very nice. However, it was leaking inside the box when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but it&#x27;s full of chemicals. SLS to name just one of them! Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Going on other reviews, I purchased this body wash about 2 weeks ago. I&#x27;ve found that my skin feels drier now than it did when I was using my Equate brand body wash. The only great thing about this body wash is it smells good..even smells good on my husband!</li>
            <li> First off, The description states that is had a paraben it it. IT DOES NOT!! Parabens are harmful to us , manufacturers like them because they preserve the shelf life of a product which is cancerous to our bodies. Alba botanica products do not contain parabens especially not this item. It is written in big bold letters on the bottle:No animal testing, artificial colors, prabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate. !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I step out the shower, my skin looked so well moisturized, I didnt even need to lotion. It was radiant, as if I went to the spa. I loved the shine so much, Im excited everytime I use it. Unlike the minty version of this product this one has actual moisturizing benefits and I suffer from dry skin so that&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and what can I say its a great NATURAL product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like heaven, but I have very sensitive skin, and it made me itch.  So I&#x27;m using it as dog shampoo and hand wash.</li>
            <li> This Alba shower gel is perfect:  the scent is subtle (definitely not overpowering), and it definitely helps moisturize this seriously scaly-skin.  The huge 32 oz. bottled will last quite some time, though the price per ounce is really pretty good.  I try to buy products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals and I appreciate Alba&#x27;s commitment to this practice.  This soap also, despite the product description on Amazon&#x27;s page, does not have parabens, which have been linked to cancer.  Therefore, I would whole-heartedly recommend this exceptional product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I hate the smell of this. It smells very artificial and not really like mango at all. It&#x27;s got a nice lather, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I needed something with no parabens, no preservatives, no sulfates etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is great!  I haven&#x27;t had any reactions and I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> This is an average body wash. No better and no worse than any other regular kind I suppose. The smell is kind of off putting, it reminds me of this chewable medicine I used to take. I LOVE fruity fragrances but this was a little too artificial chemical smelling for me. It smelled alright in the bottle and then when I lathered it on my poof, while it lathers okay, it smelled musky and nothing like in the bottle. It&#x27;s also not that moisturizing. I still had to apply lotion after my shower and with my old body wash I didn&#x27;t need to. I also find it very odd how this body wash is Honey mango scent and there is no actual honey or mango in it, which is odd for a natural body wash, you&#x27;d think they would have added that. I also don&#x27;t understand how they call it very emollient because nothing in the ingredients suggests that there is anything moisturizing in it, no Jojoba oil or anything good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again but I can finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Its nice. Nothing mindblowing but a good scent and texture.</li>
            <li> I like the soap and the pump bottle</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> When I first read reviews on this shower gel, it said that it smelled amazing in quite a few of them. When I received the product and used it for the first time, I was disappointed to find that it smells like you are taking a bath in pure honey. The fragance is overwhelming... and far from amazing. Other than that,it is ok. Just another shower gel. It doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica&#x27;s Honey Mango shower gel smells really good, without being overpowering.  It cleans just as well as any other shower gel.  Great price for a soap with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just wrote a review for their shaving foam and I am going to write a review for this stuff too. I&#x27;m a man&#x27;s man and I buy what cost money and I see commercials for. I&#x27;ve used every brand and type available at your local box stores. My skin is fairly dry and I got tired of feeling like the soap was destroying my skin. I decided to do some internet research and find something out of the box. I was a bit worried about the smell but it is really light and washes away easily leaving no residue or heavy scent. It is gentle and my skin feels really soft after this has been used. It is less harsh than the stuff guys normally buy and my skin already feels better. Just like their other product one pump is plenty for your entire body. I highly recommend this stuff for people with sensitive skin. It works well and is not heavily scented. I will be buying this from now on. Don&#x27;t let the above average price scare you away, you get what you pay for and this stuff is easily worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and lathers! We will be buying more when the time comes!</li>
            <li> This is a really good smelling body wash. I just love the mango scent. A little goes a long way. The lather is rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It smells very pleasant, I really like the pump and its cleans and feels great. And I really like that it is natural</li>
            <li> Hate the smell, it&#x27;s just like rotten fruits !! Lathers ok for an organic shower gel, it performs ok just the smell that&#x27;s the most bothersome</li>
            <li> IT IS  GOOD,  NATURAL, ECONOMICAL  FAIRLY  SMOOTH ON MY SKIN  AND  LOTS OF BUBBLES.  SMELLS NICE BUT NOT LONG  ENOUGH  THE SCENT  GOES AWAY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Alba in general makes great products. This is a great value for the size. It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s not over powering. Most sented soaps leave you with an over powering sent, and this does not, if you like suds, this does it! I would however check vitacost for a price on this and I know Amazon seems to not always have it in stock.</li>
            <li> Great product nice smell but package was badly damaged when it arrived and had leaked body wash all over everything.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how it lathers, love how it feels on my very sensitive skin....if you have sensitive skin you must try this product.  I hate the fact that I am usually forced to buy unscented products because of my sensitive skin.  You would think that in 2012 there would be more unscented products on the market.  I am excited about this product and I am hooked.......smelling good is a must!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wash! My skin feels so soft. I feel comfortable using it on my kids too because the ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful to their delicate skin. Did I mention the smell? Yummy! But it&#x27;s not so &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; that it interferes with my favorite perfume. Oh yeah &amp; since it&#x27;s one of my Subscribe &amp; Save items I get it for a steal! Go Amazon!</li>
            <li> Perfect for streamlining your shower routine, Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel is packaged in a very generous 32oz bottle with a pump. I find that this is a very good, basic shower gel for daily use. My combination skin seems to react well to it, but I can see how this could be a little drying to those with dryer skin (nothing a good after shower moisturizer can&#x27;t combat). This gel rinses clean with no residue, and just feels clean and comfortable after using. I feel that it is a step above the usual drugstore body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to try the honey mango scent, and I find it to be relatively cloying when smelled directly. In the shower during use however, I find it to be a pleasant sweet/fruity scent. Perhaps the other scents will provide something more up my alley. I will definitely be purchasing this shower gel in the future to try the other scents because the value can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s review - When I first purchased this product, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the honey mango scent (it neither smells like honey or mango to me) and didn&#x27;t particularly care for it, but the results out of the shower were enough to make me forget about the smell! It cleaned, without over drying and added just enough moisture to my skin, without it feeling oily or greasy after my shower. I&#x27;ve recently started using with in conjunction with an exfoliation glove and the results have been incredibly soft and supple skin! I will try out some of their other scents to see if there is one I like better, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the last body wash I&#x27;ll ever buy!</li>
            <li> One squirt is all you need.</li>
            <li> amazing smell, love it, love it, love it. Also very soft on the skin, this is a wonderful product. look no more.</li>
            <li> Great brand and product. The honey mango is slightly more on the feminine side, but still amazing quality and worth it. The sparkling mint is by far my favorite body wash from this company.</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of cat urine</li>
            <li> My new fave.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my overly sensitive skin, smells great, love this brand!</li>
            <li> This soap has a wonderful scent that&#x27;s not overpowering and it lathers really well. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry me out. My husband uses this too and he loves it. Great price!</li>
            <li> I like the light fragrance that makes me feel clean, not perfumed.  I use it as a shower gel and just a teaspoonful foams like crazy [in soft water].  This large bottle will last me a long, long time.  There was a small inconvenience with the first shipment.  It wasn&#x27;t packed properly, so the dispenser cap broke - leaking into the shipping box.  The return with Amazon.com was free and simple.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash!! A great price for such a good body wash, especially since it&#x27;s SLS free! Ive used it for over a year, and still love it.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, convenient delivery, smells nice, and I love the pump top. I am always looking for a cruelty-free body wash that&#x27;s not too expensive, and this fits the bill. I can buy it locally in smaller packages, but the bulk sizing is much more reasonably-priced, plus I&#x27;m a big fan of the pump top as it saves time in the shower. I&#x27;ve set up a subscription since this is my new go-to!</li>
            <li> Although all of the Alba shower gels are wonderfully scented, the scent of \\&quot;Honey Mango\\&quot; is my personal favoirte.  I have also found that the Alba shower/bath gels are superior in many ways to the other brands of bath and shower gels that I have tried.  Unfortunately, I have had problems finding Alba products in many stores, therefore, it is great being able to buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower gel I have ever owned. It smells great and it makes my skin so moist and it stays that way until I shower or bathe the next day. This is also a great buy for a 32 ounce size. It should last  a long time. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great Bath Wash!.  Has been a life saver through this cold winter.  Smells Good without being too strong.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It softens my skin and does not dry it out like so many products.</li>
            <li> This is awesome paraben free body wash. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This is just okay. The smell isn&#x27;t that great, and it doesn&#x27;t get that sudsy. But it is organic and the price was right, just don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this smell... Its so unique and relaxing, like a product you would have used on you at a spa (besides lavender, mint or rose!) I wish the smell lingered on your skin longer or that they would come out with a coordinating body spray but for now Im just happy to have a big bottle to look forward to in my shower - love love.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. Its not too over powering with synthetic mango smell either. Its silky and I don&#x27;t feel a residue or extreme dryness from after using it. I like the pump and the size of the bottle. Sometimes the size of bottles in the stores are so small and don&#x27;t last very long, I like this size. It keeps you from getting ripped off by having to repurchase every couple of days. Its a good price for a great product. I will definitely be purchasing it regularly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with this.  I think it smells bad.  I don&#x27;t know if I have a sensitive nose or what but I think this smells like feet and am pretty sure I&#x27;m not going to get over it.</li>
            <li> My fav shower gel. The whole family uses and lasts a while when buying the 32 oz bottle. Smells nice and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the texture and the way I feel after bathing makes me happy to shower or bath with</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s more natural than other chemical laden brands, foams up really well and smells fresh.  The smell does not linger on your skin. New fave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer-- a nice big supply and less expensive than I can find in store.</li>
            <li> Daughter is very happy with this product and really likes the smell.  I like the pump.</li>
            <li> I see some of these reviews talking about rosemary and lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honey mango scent is not lavender rosemary. Its fruity and sweet smelling. I&#x27;ve been using this for yrs and I love it. Good lather. Natural ingredients. Bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This is all my wife and I plan on using from now on. Not only is the smell amazing, its natural and makes our skin feel great. It&#x27;s a little pricier than most body wash at the store, but you&#x27;re not left with the dry itchy skin afterward and again, the smell is fantastic. I also love how the bottle is set up, the push top makes it so you don&#x27;t overuse. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL NATURAL PRODUCTS SMELLS GOOD LEAVES ME CLEAN AND FRESH READY FOR THE DAY OR NIGHT GREAT JOB</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. Not only are all the ingredients vegan it leaves your skin feeling soft as a babies bum. This is a great products kids and the smell is devine.</li>
            <li> love this product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft. I would recommend this to everyone. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product .... it&#x27;s filled with moister</li>
            <li> Smells great. Great price for how much you get.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. Lathers well, washes well, doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves a slimy residue on my skin. Have tried both the Mango and Mint scents and like both. (The Mango is more nectar-y/floral than I expected, but not overwhelmingly so.) Great price for a good product, as similar size bottles from other brands can easily cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel! It has a great light scent and the fact that there are no harmful chemicals is a BIG plus!!&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried face wash and body lotion all great products!</li>
            <li> I just received and started using this shower gel but I really like it.  It makes my skin so soft and moisturized and I was so happy to find something all natural and not store brand chemically enhanced stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the smell but that is just me as I&#x27;m not a fan of honey or mango to eat so the smell doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.  The smell is okay and not offensive.</li>
            <li> I love the honey mango smell!  I considered several brands and smells before finally purchasing this body wash; I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this one!  A little goes a long way: 1-2 pumps on a loofa is enough for my whole body.  I think this large container will last me a while! I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I used to have those little white bumps on my upper arms, since I&#x27;ve started using this body wash they have went away! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this body wash.  It is supposed to smell like Honey Mango, but I smell a lot of floral hints.  I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very nicely with only a small amount.  The smell is a very pleasant fruity scent.  Not overbearing at all.  The value can&#x27;t be beat.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have it on auto ship so we can keep both showers stocked. It&#x27;s high quality &amp; good natural ingredients &amp; doesn&#x27;t create any dry skin for my family which many other soaps do. The price is also aboutb1/2 the cost through amazon versus our local health store.</li>
            <li> love the smell and lasts a long time in a household of 6 people. my kids enjoy the smell too.</li>
            <li> Bodywash that actually smells like nature, not the artificial fruit/nature/garden fragrances that so many other brands smell like. Its earthly but very pleasant.  I have not found anything so natural smelling so i will be sticking with this. Cruelty free and natural, A+. If you are a consumer who likes very strong smelling fruity or flower scents this is not it. To me its more earthy and natural than fruity/flowery.</li>
            <li> The consistency is great, but the only compliant I have is the smell is a bit too strong, like over-ripe mango&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and I love Alba products.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since finding out I was pregnant.  I feel good about the ingredients and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and size, but it&#x27;s drying even though it states &amp;#34;emollient&amp;#34;.Still have to use some type of moisturizer/lotion after using.</li>
            <li> Love the smell not overpowering. Leaves my skin clean, fresh &amp; not irritated. Other body washes make me itch and break out. I tried this product and it works great. I also like how it comes with pump.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash. Smells so good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about the scent but the gel makes your skin feel soft and moisturized.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not smell natural to me.  VERY strong scent.  I would never purchase this one again because of the smell.  I love Alba but not this product.  If you like a strong smell then please order.  Otherwise forget it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanica bath &amp; shower gel for a long time.  It is great for bubble bath, creates a lot of bubbles.  Leaves skin moist and smooth.  The only problem I had was the product is when it arrived it had leaked all over everything.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that smells great and does the job! Makes my skin so smooth! I will be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough for my child to use in the bath each night. I order the lavender kind also.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell--it does not linger.  One squirt in a scrunchy does my whole body, so a little goes a long way. I have used it for years, and also love alba&#x27;s &#x27;very emollient body lotions&#x27;. Great deal for the products.</li>
            <li> I just purchased and used this body wash from Alba today. I bought it from Super Supplements for around $14. I figured the larger size would last me longer then the smaller bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant, and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried. (Like with most organic products)&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try, of course.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband wont mind using this one either, and its much better for him to use then Axe! ;)</li>
            <li> All of Alba Botanica&#x27;s bath and shower flavors are great, Honey Mango is my favorite.  Our water is a little alkaline making it easy for my skin dry out, however using this product helps to keep my skin soft and moisturized.  I tried other bath and shower gels you can buy at the \\&quot;big box\\&quot; stores and none of them can compare with this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is so amazing! A real clean feeling without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The fragrant is not to strong but works very well. I don&#x27;t feel itchy after showering. Will purchase again after I run out.</li>
            <li> I love Alba Botanica&#x27;s emollient shower washes - I rotate between scents. this is a great, non-drying shower wash that is a lot cheaper than many organic brands or spa brands. it lasts a long time in my shower! love the pump as well.</li>
            <li> I personally love this body wash and the smell. Its not tested on animals A+! and the price is reasonable. I been using this brand and body wash for about 2 years now and its my go to body wash. A little goes along way so it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;: Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;: Little goes along way&lt;br /&gt;: Mango smell great&lt;br /&gt;: NOT tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;: I don&#x27;t have any, I&#x27;ve been buying it over and over for 2 years with no complaints</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I have sensitive skin and psoriasis so I always have to be really careful about what kinds of soaps and lotions I use. Alba Botanica doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or get irritated. It is one of the few products with a scent that I can use. I recommend the mint or honey mango!</li>
            <li> Nice gentle body clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that Amazon carries this body wash.  I was only able to find it at Whole Foods and I don&#x27;t live close to one anymore and I would drive 30 minutes for this.  More then anything, I just love the way it smells.  Now I have a subscription to have it delivered regularly.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents. My husband even loves the smell. I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather. I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year and love it! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other scents and love those too!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great and safe for the environment as well as my skin and body. I won&#x27;t go back to the dangers of questionable chemicals again.</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser with a heavenly smell that has some moisturizing properties although it doesn&#x27;t replace lotion, particularly in the winter a whole lot of lotion is still required if you have dry skin. I find in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t dry this is a gentle cleanser that supplies that bit of hydration that might be all I need that day.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down...Smell is ok...not natural smell though; expected more honey or sweet natural scent.  Trying another brand next time.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this except buy it. It smells amazing, it is all natural and I believe organic...I have to check on that one. But none the less, it does not leave residue or film on the skin either. The size is great too. It lasts a long time. Its worth the price, it lasts almost three months! Do it.</li>
            <li> the smell is eh.... but it does its job (it makes me so fresh and so clean, clean)</li>
            <li> This bottle was bigger than I expected and should last me a while. I enjoy it very much and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shower gel smells yummy! It smells so fruity and sweet but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> great value for the size, but the smell not so much.</li>
            <li> Soft on your skin, great scent!</li>
            <li> oooooh such a sweet morning shower every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6+ years.  Alba is a responsible company and creates a quality product.  No animal testing, artificial colors, parabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate.</li>
            <li> The gel lathers well and has a good unisex scent.  My skin feels so moist after using it.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a more natural product with out having to make it yourself.  Who has time for that :) ?</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the scent.  It is not horrible but just not what I was expecting.  It is a decent body wash but I will probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, feels great on my skin.  Watch out when ordering though.  Mine arrived with a broken bottle because there was no padding in the box.  I&#x27;m just glad there wasn&#x27;t anything else shipped with it.  I was able to recover enough that it wasn&#x27;t a waste, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work and now has sharp pieces sticking off.  Once I use some more of it I&#x27;ll transfer it to a smaller unbroken bottle.  Still love the soap though.  Just might look for it at an actual store next time and not get it shipped.</li>
            <li> I used Alba for the first time this morning. I love the scent and how smooth you feel after your shower. I will have to try the lotion as well. I highly recommend this, you can&#x27;t go wrong, 32oz for 12.00?!</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because I was looking for a shower gel that had a bottle with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;The smells is good. I would not say it smells very mango-like, but I can smell the honey. The gel has an opalescent look to it and rinses cleanly. Because the gel is made without sulfates, it does not lather a lot, but that does not stop me from using it as a shave gel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now. I got this product hoping it would be a huge turn around for my overly dry skin. And while sadly my skin is still dry, it is less harsh than regular body washes out there and leaves me feeling very moisturized after a shower. However, the relief only seems to last mere minutes. I&#x27;m still having to use lotion all over my body on a daily basis. Maybe my results will change with the season as right now its winter and the air is fairly dry, but I&#x27;m not so sure.  The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, but its also not great. And when I received the package body wash had leaked all per inside the box and all over the bottle. That Was something I was most definitely not happy with. I will probably, however, continue to use the product as organic stuff is still healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a mild shower gel which leaves my skin with some moisture in it when I get out of the shower (I have extremely hard water). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the scent. It does nothing for me and I would not describe it as honey mango. To me it smells flat as if it&#x27;s unscented yet still has a scent of some kind.</li>
            <li> I, like some of the other reviewers, have used this product for years. Not any more!! It was formerly manufactured by Avalon Natural Products and was wonderful. Hain evidently purchased Avalon and now this is manufactured by Hain. Very watered down - the first ingredient is now water. Formerly was mostly organic ingredients and no water! Fast forward to Hain. Now the 3rd-5h ingredients: disodium laureth sulfoscuccinate, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, sodium cocyl lsethionate. Not sure what they are but they sure don&#x27;t sound good---and most of the other ingredients you cannot pronounce. Just the opposite with the original product. I have always used the mango fragrance so that is what I ordered this time. I HATE IT. I can&#x27;t wait to use it up. One push of the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; used to be enough - now it takes 5 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;Hain has an Avalon Organics line. I guess I will try that next. It&#x27;s supposedly 70% organic.&lt;br /&gt;And furthermore, Hain also purchased my Zia makeup and discontinued it. I&#x27;m not happy with Hain right now.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling, natural shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  A gentle aroma still comes off my skin for hours after the shower.  It lathers really well, and the pump bottle makes it very easy to use.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and love the super size !</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Loves the way it smells and leaves my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, creamy texture, nicely moisturizing.  Nice that it is available on subscribe and save as well.</li>
            <li> We \\&quot;subscribe\\&quot; to Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel and are very glad to do so.  It feels very pleasant, it smells quite nice, without being overpowering, and it gets one clean and has a slightly moisturizing effect. The pump works well, and the 32-Ounce bottle lasts two of us about 6 months. The price is extremely reasonable, and it&#x27;s delivered right to our front door.  It comes wrapped in a plastic bag in case there would be a leak.  There was a small leak once, and the plastic wrapping took care of it. The slightly flexible bottle stayed intact. [[ASIN:B001440150 Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel, Honey Mango, 32-Ounce Bottle]] What more could you want in a bath soap?</li>
            <li> at first it smelled like mango and it was OK. But when I used it in shower, it smelled different - I can&#x27;t describe it but it smelled like something not fresh and stale… I don&#x27;t know, other people might like it, but I don&#x27;t. I can stand up with this smell until I use this whole 32 ounce bottle up.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a little pricey for shower gel but it got good reviews and came with a pump (which not a lot do). However it arrived with a cracked pumped and about a quarter of the bottle spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> Love the honey mango scent. Ingredients that I feel good about. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> You get alot of bang for your buck and it&#x27;s more of a natural product.  It&#x27;s not bad if you want to smell delicious.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned about using this product, since I had never purchased anything of the brand before. Now I can say that I am completely satisfied with my purchase! The smell is wonderful, and the large quantity makes it well worth every penny. This company is also part of the leaping bunny and is 100% vegetarian!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shower gel because I&#x27;m trying to use products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had very dry skin, but this gel made my skin so flakey that my arms and legs were molting! I was shocked to see all the flakes, and I wondered if I had some horrible skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;Today I went back to my Aveeno moisturizing wash, and my skin is back to normal.... no more flakes!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff... Great value, huge bottle with a pump which is great for a six year old. The smell is wonderful and it keeps your skin feeling hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. It also it great to shave with. I love that I can really smell the honey in it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go very far, I need to use so much of it, It won&#x27;t last long at all. It smells fine though.</li>
            <li> I happen to like this shower gel and will continue to purchase it on a regular basis.  It is very emollient and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but only really lathers when you use varied amounts. It smells good, although its probably better for a bath rather than shower. I use it as body wash. Alba makes really good products although some are more expensive than others. I think next time I&#x27;ll look into there full body wash rather than the dual shower/bath gel.</li>
            <li> We use a lot of botanical based skin products and were disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t seem to clean our bodies well.  Both adults in the house complained that we didn&#x27;t feel or smell clean after using the product.  I NEVER purchase scented products but this was our only subscribe and save option so I thought I would chance it.  I am truly smell sensitive.  This wasn&#x27;t actually that bad.  The honey mango smell went away right away.  But so did our body order.  yuck!</li>
            <li> This is a nice body shower gel that works great for the whole family.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for the guys and the gals love it too.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, and is gentle enough to not dry out my skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love Alba, love this gel, love this scent.  I will buy again and again.  And you will love it too!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A LARGE BOTTLE! I was so disappointed when I received this shipment as I have been ordering this body wash through Amazon for months (LOVE the body wash)...but this price is WAY too expensive for the tiny bottle I received. Very deceiving. And I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells really great and I love that it is a more natural product. Used it to shave too :)</li>
            <li> Love alba products! This is another must have</li>
            <li> IT FEEL AND SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> The packaging had some spillage on it, and when I took the product out to use the top will not unscrew to pump so I have to take the top off each time...a real pain</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this body wash! It&#x27;s very soothing and moisturizing. I like how I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get it to foam up really well - 2 pumps are enough. It leaves your skin feeling quite silky and smooth. :) $15 is a bit higher than average for a body wash, but this is also a decently large size bottle, so I think it&#x27;s worth it! Very nice product! :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body wash. I live in the dry desert and had trouble finding a hydrating body wash. This came highly recommended, so I gave it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did! The smell is nice, it&#x27;s sweet but subtle and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry out sensitive skin -- nice product. Cheaper here than in Whole Foods or other stores.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for the price with a light (not over-powering) scent that left my skin soft and moisturized. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I pretty much love anything by Alba Botanica.  They are animal friendly and that&#x27;s important to me.  Plus it works great and smells good.</li>
            <li> The soap is nice but I thought it would have more fragrance. I expected it to have a nice Mango scent but I could not smell much of anything.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not too strong. Keeps me moisturized without one</li>
            <li> Our household is obsessed with this stuff. Not only do we use it as shower gel - but we also fill our hand soap dispensers with it! Such a great and moisturizing alternative that smells dreamy. Extra great during dry winter months so as to not dry your hands.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product!!!  I have ordered it previously and have been VERY happy with Alba products.  However, this Mango smell is NOT a good scent....kind of blah..not refreshing...THEN, bottle slipped out of my hands while I was showering and the cap and pump mechanism broke.  Could you possibly send me another one???  Thank you, Gala Tharp.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and scent! A tropical party with every shower! Pump top is great, foam-ability is lucious, and you barely have to use any to wash the whole body, so it will last and last! This is my second time purchasing, and I truly recommend this product if you like the smell of mango. My first order last year busted open in the box in transit, but they seem to have figured  that issue out... this was packed very well with no leakage.</li>
