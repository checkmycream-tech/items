            <li>Affordable and arent perfect and healthy lips worth it?</li>

            <li>It works excellent for chapped and windburn lips, I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It still does an excellent job of protecting and keeping your lips nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the positives: it has a nice tingling sensation upon application which feels good on sore or chapped lips and skin, the price is not bad, the container is portable and quaint, the ingredients list has</li>
            <li>The box of  12 Carmex  came on schedule, quick delivery and great packaging - as expected.should keep my husband chapped-lif free for the rest of his life</li>
            <li>Love carmex.  </li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; heals fast.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm</li>
            <li>I love Carmex.  </li>
            <li>Love the convenience and recyclability of the tin jars.</li>
            <li>I LOVE  </li>
            <li>I love carmex</li>
            <li>Product is as it states: a box of 12 pots of carmex. :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love carmex....</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t need 12 jars; this was the better buy.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine keeping this order for a year or more.</li>
            <li>I use it day and night and my lips has never been softer, redder and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has ever worked like this .. and we have tried so many ...</li>
            <li>my lips got way better.</li>
            <li>I love Carmex.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to order this knowing I don&#x27;t have to look around for it now.</li>
            <li>more trash that can&#x27;t be recycled.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I love the smell  (not perfumey), the healing sensation it leaves</li>
            <li>I love Carmex.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm</li>
            <li>So thankful that I now have a stash of my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the results for years but have notice that it leaves a wax feeling on your lips.  </li>
            <li>The original all the way!</li>
            <li>It gives perfect moisture for my dry lips.</li>
            <li>If one tin of Carmex is good a whole box of tins is better.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t have those fine lines around my lips you see on some that have seen many sunrises and sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are more concerned about soothing the feeling of sore lips, this product might fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous, I totally love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my lips healthy and moist (which is great because I&#x27;m not allergic to it like I am to others).</li>
            <li>But fair warning, you too might get addicted to awesome feeling lips.</li>
            <li>Very good product fro dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>its fine</li>
            <li>Thus, I do not feel the Carmex lip balm adequately does the job I hired it to do, if my lips feel even more parched after application.</li>
            <li>lot of chapstick type moisturizers these days contain ingredients that actually make your lips chapped faster, I haven&#x27;t experienced it with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Carmex works great on both my lips and my extremely distressed eczema hands (better than eczema prescription creams).</li>
            <li>I was excited to see how inexpensive this was, so buying 12 while needing one wasn&#x27;t a huge decision.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it from a bin at my pharmacist&#x27;s because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>And, the small jars (like these are) give you the best buy for your money.  </li>
            <li>Hence the unique packaging we can still buy today.  </li>
            <li>Most chapstick brands brands don&#x27;t work such as chapstick, lipsmacker, Blistex, Baby lips,Soft lips ,and so many more don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original since I was a kid... and will stick to this version.</li>
            <li>It was love at first application.</li>
            <li>Carmex has been great for our habitually dry and cracked lips.</li>
            <li>In sum, Carmex brand lip balm is a decent price and feels good while on your lips (after it&#x27;s rubbed off your lips- not so much).</li>
            <li>carmex keeps my  lips feeling soft and  looking amazing  </li>
            <li>By far the best lip balm for healing dry lips.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to many of the new chapstick formulas...</li>
            <li>How many lip balms I tryed from very expensive to cheap, from organic till chemical - Carmex is the best lips care.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good lip balm can not only for lip but for other kind of pimple, but i don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>carmex is excellent and everyone loves it -- hard to lose, fun to use and new each and every holiday season</li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;m going to wear lipstick, I put Carmex on first.  </li>
            <li>Sounds funny</li>
            <li>Love it, I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for years, it seems to be the only brand that helps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad amazon is selling these pots, because they are often sold out at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>&amp; as a more minor concern, I would also prefer the product not contain \\&quot;petrolatum\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>To get 12 of these things for less than 20 bucks is amazing.</li>
            <li>so they could sell you less for the same amount of money but still this is a great product.</li>
            <li>If your lips are very dry, you Find more moist lip</li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>i use it so much  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t have too much Carmex.</li>
            <li>This balm really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>Your chapped lips will go away so fast.</li>
            <li>Used by the whole family.</li>
            <li>Convient to buy a whole box.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, too</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Like many products, a cheap way to sell for the same price but less amount.</li>
            <li>Keep these readily available and now I won&#x27;t run out for a long while.</li>
            <li>Maybe addicting is the wrong word, how about the best product to keep your lips smooth and moisturized without having that heavy feeling like some lip balms.  </li>
            <li>The bad: while much of this is impressive (commitment to environmentally-friendlier practices, EWG hazard score of \\&quot;5\\&quot;, feel-good application sensation, etc. . .)</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm fan, however, I recently ran out of that particular brand of lip balm.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and it has proved to be better than the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable, it makes my lips look shiny but not too much, so it also works for the hubby and it keeps my lips so soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the product just wish it was little thicker</li>
            <li>Carmex is a great product but is sometimes difficult to find</li>
            <li>Its the new world of plastic products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Squeeze tube was added in 1988 and the stick in 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more uses than just for cold sores.  </li>
            <li>my lips are so soft now!</li>
            <li>When you first put it on your chapped lips it stings a tiny bit but</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>next day, I find that a convenient bar code sticker is attached to the bottom of each jar which oddly perfectly covers the fact that each jar is made with a false bottom and contains less than 1/2 what you perceive as being in the jar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking and reading labels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it is not exactly what I hoped for, but it&#x27;s still Carmex and the shipment came quickly.</li>
            <li>it makes my lips so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to bother reviewing carmex as a lip balm because I&#x27;m assuming everyone who is considering buying it in bulk has already tried and developed an addiction to it.</li>
            <li>I received the box and opened it I was surprised to see that what I assumed was the old glass jars were now plastic.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist I can say this is one of the biggest hoaxes in cosmetic history.</li>
            <li>The new packaging (with red labeling on the cap) says 0.25oz.</li>
            <li>But I found the new packaging has a big cavity on the bottom side of the jar.</li>
            <li>VERY soothing on dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>These larger lip balms last a long time, are affordable and work better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>In short time treats my sores or chapped lips and its soft in result!</li>
            <li>Email had no other suggested contact but here.</li>
            <li>Leave my the lips moisturized like no other, you immediately feel relief.</li>
            <li>Also good therapy from cold sores.</li>
            <li>The jars do not contain less lip balm, they simply contain less plastic (a 20% reduction) by making the container more concave (you can see a side-by-side image of this on their website).</li>
            <li>that it gives my  lips a cool  feeling after aplying and aslo  its  thick  </li>
            <li>Other than that, seems like it would have been a decent deal.</li>

            <li> I love the smell  (not perfumey), the healing sensation it leaves</li>
            <li> I love Carmex.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm</li>
            <li> So thankful that I now have a stash of my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the results for years but have notice that it leaves a wax feeling on your lips.  </li>
            <li> The original all the way!</li>
            <li> It gives perfect moisture for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> If one tin of Carmex is good a whole box of tins is better.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t have those fine lines around my lips you see on some that have seen many sunrises and sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are more concerned about soothing the feeling of sore lips, this product might fit the bill.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, I totally love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my lips healthy and moist (which is great because I&#x27;m not allergic to it like I am to others).</li>
            <li> But fair warning, you too might get addicted to awesome feeling lips.</li>
            <li> Very good product fro dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> its fine</li>
            <li> Thus, I do not feel the Carmex lip balm adequately does the job I hired it to do, if my lips feel even more parched after application.</li>
            <li> lot of chapstick type moisturizers these days contain ingredients that actually make your lips chapped faster, I haven&#x27;t experienced it with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Carmex works great on both my lips and my extremely distressed eczema hands (better than eczema prescription creams).</li>
            <li> I was excited to see how inexpensive this was, so buying 12 while needing one wasn&#x27;t a huge decision.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it from a bin at my pharmacist&#x27;s because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> And, the small jars (like these are) give you the best buy for your money.  </li>
            <li> Hence the unique packaging we can still buy today.  </li>
            <li> Most chapstick brands brands don&#x27;t work such as chapstick, lipsmacker, Blistex, Baby lips,Soft lips ,and so many more don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original since I was a kid... and will stick to this version.</li>
            <li> It was love at first application.</li>
            <li> Carmex has been great for our habitually dry and cracked lips.</li>
            <li> In sum, Carmex brand lip balm is a decent price and feels good while on your lips (after it&#x27;s rubbed off your lips- not so much).</li>
            <li> carmex keeps my  lips feeling soft and  looking amazing  </li>
            <li> By far the best lip balm for healing dry lips.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many of the new chapstick formulas...</li>
            <li> How many lip balms I tryed from very expensive to cheap, from organic till chemical - Carmex is the best lips care.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good lip balm can not only for lip but for other kind of pimple, but i don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> carmex is excellent and everyone loves it -- hard to lose, fun to use and new each and every holiday season</li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;m going to wear lipstick, I put Carmex on first.  </li>
            <li> Sounds funny</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for years, it seems to be the only brand that helps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad amazon is selling these pots, because they are often sold out at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> &amp; as a more minor concern, I would also prefer the product not contain \\&quot;petrolatum\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> To get 12 of these things for less than 20 bucks is amazing.</li>
            <li> so they could sell you less for the same amount of money but still this is a great product.</li>
            <li> If your lips are very dry, you Find more moist lip</li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> i use it so much  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t have too much Carmex.</li>
            <li> This balm really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Your chapped lips will go away so fast.</li>
            <li> Used by the whole family.</li>
            <li> Convient to buy a whole box.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, too</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Like many products, a cheap way to sell for the same price but less amount.</li>
            <li> Keep these readily available and now I won&#x27;t run out for a long while.</li>
            <li> Maybe addicting is the wrong word, how about the best product to keep your lips smooth and moisturized without having that heavy feeling like some lip balms.  </li>
            <li> The bad: while much of this is impressive (commitment to environmentally-friendlier practices, EWG hazard score of \\&quot;5\\&quot;, feel-good application sensation, etc. . .)</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm fan, however, I recently ran out of that particular brand of lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and it has proved to be better than the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, it makes my lips look shiny but not too much, so it also works for the hubby and it keeps my lips so soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the product just wish it was little thicker</li>
            <li> Carmex is a great product but is sometimes difficult to find</li>
            <li> Its the new world of plastic products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Squeeze tube was added in 1988 and the stick in 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more uses than just for cold sores.  </li>
            <li> my lips are so soft now!</li>
            <li> When you first put it on your chapped lips it stings a tiny bit but</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> next day, I find that a convenient bar code sticker is attached to the bottom of each jar which oddly perfectly covers the fact that each jar is made with a false bottom and contains less than 1/2 what you perceive as being in the jar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking and reading labels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it is not exactly what I hoped for, but it&#x27;s still Carmex and the shipment came quickly.</li>
            <li> it makes my lips so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to bother reviewing carmex as a lip balm because I&#x27;m assuming everyone who is considering buying it in bulk has already tried and developed an addiction to it.</li>
            <li> I received the box and opened it I was surprised to see that what I assumed was the old glass jars were now plastic.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist I can say this is one of the biggest hoaxes in cosmetic history.</li>
            <li> The new packaging (with red labeling on the cap) says 0.25oz.</li>
            <li> But I found the new packaging has a big cavity on the bottom side of the jar.</li>
            <li> VERY soothing on dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> These larger lip balms last a long time, are affordable and work better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> In short time treats my sores or chapped lips and its soft in result!</li>
            <li> Email had no other suggested contact but here.</li>
            <li> Leave my the lips moisturized like no other, you immediately feel relief.</li>
            <li> Also good therapy from cold sores.</li>
            <li> The jars do not contain less lip balm, they simply contain less plastic (a 20% reduction) by making the container more concave (you can see a side-by-side image of this on their website).</li>
            <li> that it gives my  lips a cool  feeling after aplying and aslo  its  thick  </li>
            <li> Other than that, seems like it would have been a decent deal.</li>
            <li> Regular users develop a PHYSICAL DEPENDENCY when lips dry out from the drying ingredients yet are fooled by the feeling of moisture from ingredients like petrolatum.  </li>
            <li> Just one you can use for such a long time..</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few reviewers complaining about the new \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Carmex lip balm jar containers, which is addressed at the Carmex website in the \\&quot;FAQ\\&quot; section.</li>
            <li> The old packaging (with black labeling on the cap) says 1/4oz.</li>
            <li> AS A SALVE FOR DRY LIPS because they know you will be buying it by the gross before long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Carmex so long that I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> In Arizona I use it 2-3 times a day, lips get dry here.</li>
            <li> The pots are far less wasteful than the tubes; you use less and it is easier to completely empty them.</li>
            <li> First developed in the kitchen of Alfred Woelbing in 1937 to stop his suffering from ever recurring cold sores.</li>
            <li> Carmex users typically have several pots of balm at any given time, home, work, car, pocket, etc.  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Same shape and size round jar.</li>
            <li> quite a few natural ingredients, and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) gives Carmex Lip Balm a score of \\&quot;5\\&quot; (\\&quot;moderate hazard\\&quot;- it could be worse).    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would advise you to look towards other lip balm brands for your lip hydration needs.</li>
            <li> other brands</li>
            <li> And they are small enough to just slip into your pocket or purse if you need lip care during the day.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the other flavored/scented carmex versions.</li>
            <li> : \\&quot;Active Ingredients-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lists camphor and menthol as the active ingredients in the item description.  </li>
            <li> Never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
            <li> I think the marketing group at Carmex has found a way to sell you much less while getting you to thing</li>
            <li> You need less over any tube, so less waste.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m on a budget, I decided to use up the other lip balm and chapstick products cluttering our bathroom drawers and cabinets, when I stumbled upon a small container of Carmex lip balm.    </li>
            <li> There is no taste or odor in these little jars, which is what I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little history on Carmex:</li>
            <li> He put the mixture into little jars he found in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> These jars are tiny, so, no great savings/deal here.</li>
            <li> This is not an experience I have ever encountered with my Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm; and since I had just made the switch between the twolip balm brands, this difference was quite stark.</li>
            <li> It is one of the products that you buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> Carmex claims this small gesture prevents about 70,000 pounds of plastic from being sent to landfills annually, and also lightens the packaging so that less fuel is consumed to ship the product.    </li>
            <li> No better lip balm out there.</li>
            <li> Carmex was developed to shrink and heal COLD SORES using DRYING agents like Camphor, Menthol and Phenol.  </li>
            <li> Guys usually ask to use when on their fishing trips.</li>
            <li> It was so late, it was after the deadline I needed them.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but Carmex did something really dishonest when they redesigned the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I checked another website and it gave beeswax as the main base rather than petrolatum which is in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cuticle cream is hard to find and expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mildly addicted to the menthol&#x27;y flavor of this lip balm.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t find your carmex, there is nothing worse.</li>
            <li> Really annoying too, since this thing takes up space in your pocket all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You canâ€™t go wrong with Carmex and the price on Amazon</li>
            <li> you canâ€˜t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I recommend it blindly.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find Carmex in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have never had a cold sore, so</li>
            <li> Works well on sun cracked Lipps and stress cold sores</li>
            <li> get cold sores from time to time and this has LITERALLY prevented them from occurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate having to carry it around with me, so with a box of 12</li>
            <li> The inactive (base) ingredients are :  petrolatum, lanolin, cetyl esters, cocoa seed butter.</li>
            <li> I am so sad!!!</li>
            <li> I used to get awful chapped lips</li>

            <li> Love carmex.  These jars are tiny, so, no great savings/deal here.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm fan, however, I recently ran out of that particular brand of lip balm. Since I&#x27;m on a budget, I decided to use up the other lip balm and chapstick products cluttering our bathroom drawers and cabinets, when I stumbled upon a small container of Carmex lip balm.    Let&#x27;s start with the positives: it has a nice tingling sensation upon application which feels good on sore or chapped lips and skin, the price is not bad, the container is portable and quaint, the ingredients list has quite a few natural ingredients, and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) gives Carmex Lip Balm a score of \\&quot;5\\&quot; (\\&quot;moderate hazard\\&quot;- it could be worse).    The ingredients list (as copied from the official Carmex website on the date of this review): \\&quot;Active Ingredients- Camphor (1.7%), Menthol (0.7%), Phenol (0.4%). Inactive Ingredients- petrolatum, lanolin, cetyl esters, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, paraffin, beeswax, flavor, salicylic acid.\\&quot;    I have noticed a few reviewers complaining about the new \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Carmex lip balm jar containers, which is addressed at the Carmex website in the \\&quot;FAQ\\&quot; section.

Carmex claims this small gesture prevents about 70,000 pounds of plastic from being sent to landfills annually, and also lightens the packaging so that less fuel is consumed to ship the product.    The bad: while much of this is impressive (commitment to environmentally-friendlier practices, EWG hazard score of \\&quot;5\\&quot;, feel-good application sensation, etc. . .), my experience with the lip balm itself was only so-so. I noticed that after the Carmex lip balm wears off, my lips were drier than prior to the application of the balm. This is not an experience I have ever encountered with my Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm; and since I had just made the switch between the twolip balm brands, this difference was quite stark. Thus, I do not feel the Carmex lip balm adequately does the job I hired it to do, if my lips feel even more parched after application. &amp; as a more minor concern, I would also prefer the product not contain \\&quot;petrolatum\\&quot;.    In sum, Carmex brand lip balm is a decent price and feels good while on your lips (after it&#x27;s rubbed off your lips- not so much). If you are more concerned about soothing the feeling of sore lips, this product might fit the bill. Otherwise, I would advise you to look towards other lip balm brands for your lip hydration needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and great service.</li>
            <li> By far the best lip balm for healing dry lips.</li>
            <li> excellent, as described.  thank you.</li>
            <li> The pots are far less wasteful than the tubes; you use less and it is easier to completely empty them. Excellent product at an excellent price- cheaper, even with the shipping, than buying from Amazon UK or FR.</li>
            <li> Delighted with purchase. Keep these readily available and now I won&#x27;t run out for a long while.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, I totally love it my lips are so soft now! My friends too, of course.  Definetly, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using this for years. It is one of the products that you buy a few at a time. I put it on before I add my lipstick for an amazing shine.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my lips and on both of my girlfriend&#x27;s lips.&lt;br /&gt;We love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So moist and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my lips healthy and moist (which is great because I&#x27;m not allergic to it like I am to others).</li>
            <li> Could not believe I found the product at Amazon! Use it for lips and finger nails/cuticles. Inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Not what I asked for. But made up for it in the amount I received.</li>
            <li> No better lip balm out there. Great value for the box.</li>
            <li> Carmax been around for years. Works great &amp; heals fast. Great price buying in 12 pack</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm</li>
            <li> what can I say.  it&#x27;s carmex  I&#x27;ve used it for years with excellent results.  fast shipping.  good price</li>
            <li> And I can never find it in the sticks anymore (there&#x27;s &amp;#34;protecting&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34;, and usually I can only find &amp;#34;protecting&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I love Carmex.  Even if I&#x27;m going to wear lipstick, I put Carmex on first.  I have never had a cold sore, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  I hate having to carry it around with me, so with a box of 12 I have them all over and enough to refill my supply.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exactly as expected.  Now I never have to search for my carmexâ€¦. I&#x27;ve always got one close by.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago and I still have jars untouched! Its definitely worth the money and it saves you money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mildly addicted to the menthol&#x27;y flavor of this lip balm. Love the convenience and recyclability of the tin jars. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Hi it&#x27;s very good armed I use this crame every day my family need this product am not to ghang any choic&lt;br /&gt;I need to make me best costumer whith you becaus I bay next time I want you to do discount please&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> The box of  12 Carmex  came on schedule, quick delivery and great packaging - as expected.should keep my husband chapped-lif free for the rest of his life</li>
            <li> carmex keeps my  lips feeling soft and  looking amazing  im almost  out of them  becasue i use it so much  i like that it gives my  lips a cool  feeling after aplying and aslo  its  thick  just the  way i like it. i dont have to reapply  every 5 secs ik  other brands I LOVE  ME SOME CARMEX!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> How many lip balms I tryed from very expensive to cheap, from organic till chemical - Carmex is the best lips care. In short time treats my sores or chapped lips and its soft in result! Also good therapy from cold sores. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If your lips are very dry, you Find more moist lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm is good product with moisture.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t have too much Carmex.</li>
            <li> Walmart.com has this 12 pack for $11....just sayin... Why would anyone pay this price.... I love carmex it makes my lips so soft.</li>
            <li> I am always and forever tearing my house apart looking for my carmex. When your lips are chapped and sore at 2am and you can&#x27;t find your carmex, there is nothing worse. Now I have plenty and if I can&#x27;t find it, I just go get another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to bother reviewing carmex as a lip balm because I&#x27;m assuming everyone who is considering buying it in bulk has already tried and developed an addiction to it. Product is as it states: a box of 12 pots of carmex. :-)</li>
            <li> I love it. whenever I bring it for my lips.</li>
            <li> a wonderful lip balm! the best!</li>
            <li> Say good-bye to chapped lips!</li>
            <li> When I lived in West Texas I learned the value of Carmex, great product. I was excited to see how inexpensive this was, so buying 12 while needing one wasn&#x27;t a huge decision. The Carmex is not diluted with a pleasant perfume, no one could make that mistake, but it was tried and try and works  That is what matters, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the box and opened it I was surprised to see that what I assumed was the old glass jars were now plastic. Its the new world of plastic products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm.... I come to the conclusion the jars are slightly smaller too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I find that a convenient bar code sticker is attached to the bottom of each jar which oddly perfectly covers the fact that each jar is made with a false bottom and contains less than 1/2 what you perceive as being in the jar.  You have a 1/2 inch jar on the outside and a 1/4 inch deep jar on the inside, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works, but my pride tells me I will not be buying anymore, &#x27;course in the beginning I would have thought a 12 pack a lifetime supply. Now I know WHY you need to buy a box of 12. I think the marketing group at Carmex has found a way to sell you much less while getting you to thing you are receiving the same thing, I somehow feel cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this. Even though the actually product still works.</li>
            <li> Very good product fro dry, chapped lips. I have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I wanted the jar because someone told me that the ingredients were different than the tube.  I checked another website and it gave beeswax as the main base rather than petrolatum which is in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I had to peel off the label at the bottom of the jar to get to product information sheet.&lt;br /&gt;It lists camphor and menthol as the active ingredients in the item description.  The inactive (base) ingredients are :  petrolatum, lanolin, cetyl esters, cocoa seed butter. paraffin, beeswax, flavor, salicylic acid and phenol.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the same as the tube except that the tube has mineral oil in place of the paraffin.  I need a product without petrolatum for occasional nasal sores. I&#x27;ll keep looking and reading labels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it is not exactly what I hoped for, but it&#x27;s still Carmex and the shipment came quickly.</li>
            <li> 4-7-14  Carmex is the only lip balm to use.  And, the small jars (like these are) give you the best buy for your money.  And they are small enough to just slip into your pocket or purse if you need lip care during the day.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love carmex.... Like to have some in stock .Hate to run out.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t need 12 jars; this was the better buy.  So now I have a jar in all possible locations.....bathrooms, office, purses, night stands....great stuff</li>
            <li> Carmex is medicated so it helps sooth, heal and protect lips. A must have for every medicine cabinet!!!! Affordable and arent perfect and healthy lips worth it? This item is worth the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> It gives perfect moisture for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars!!    I&#x27;ve always loved Carmex, it&#x27;s the best. To get 12 of these things for less than 20 bucks is amazing. Just one you can use for such a long time..In Arizona I use it 2-3 times a day, lips get dry here. I can imagine keeping this order for a year or more. You need less over any tube, so less waste. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this..</li>
            <li> This balm really moisturizes well. I use it day and night and my lips has never been softer, redder and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Carmex is the best. It&#x27;s durable, it makes my lips look shiny but not too much, so it also works for the hubby and it keeps my lips so soft! I use a medicine that dries my lips a lot and Carmex have saved them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Second time purchasing this product and it is one of my staples.</li>
            <li> These larger lip balms last a long time, are affordable and work better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m allergic to many of the new chapstick formulas...so stocked up on these.</li>
            <li> 4 of the 12 lids were very loose, one of them almost completely off, so those aren&#x27;t going to be used. Email had no other suggested contact but here. If you could respond and see if there is some way this can be corrected or adjusted, I&#x27;d be happy to up my review. I just wanted to make sure you all saw that the qc wasn&#x27;t the greatest. Other than that, seems like it would have been a decent deal.</li>
            <li> Sounds funny I know but it is truly addicting. Maybe addicting is the wrong word, how about the best product to keep your lips smooth and moisturized without having that heavy feeling like some lip balms.  There is no taste or odor in these little jars, which is what I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little history on Carmex: First developed in the kitchen of Alfred Woelbing in 1937 to stop his suffering from ever recurring cold sores. He put the mixture into little jars he found in the kitchen.  Hence the unique packaging we can still buy today.  Squeeze tube was added in 1988 and the stick in 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many more uses than just for cold sores.  Chapped lips of course, the need to keep your lips moist; Skiers use Carmex to protect against drying winds. I have used Carmex on paper cuts and sore hang nails just because I have it on my finger from applying to my lips and it helped with both. After using this product for 40 plus years (oops did I just give away my age?) I donâ€™t have those fine lines around my lips you see on some that have seen many sunrises and sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You canâ€™t go wrong with Carmex and the price on Amazon is good with their speedy shipping you canâ€˜t go wrong. But fair warning, you too might get addicted to awesome feeling lips.</li>
            <li> carmex is excellent and everyone loves it -- hard to lose, fun to use and new each and every holiday season</li>
            <li> Carmex has been great for our habitually dry and cracked lips. Nothing else has ever worked like this .. and we have tried so many ... Carmex is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used to get awful chapped lips but after i started using Carmex my lips got way better. They are softer and not chapped! Most chapstick brands brands don&#x27;t work such as chapstick, lipsmacker, Blistex, Baby lips,Soft lips ,and so many more don&#x27;t work. Carmex is the only one that truly works. I prefer the tubs of it over the chapstick containers and the lip gloss containers of Carmex, because i think it lasts longer. When you first put it on your chapped lips it stings a tiny bit but its fine but then it starts soothing your lips and ahhh it it great. I love Carmex. Your chapped lips will go away so fast. You will be so amazed if you buy this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> The old packaging (with black labeling on the cap) says 1/4oz. The new packaging (with red labeling on the cap) says 0.25oz. Same shape and size round jar. But I found the new packaging has a big cavity on the bottom side of the jar. Like many products, a cheap way to sell for the same price but less amount. So IMO there is NO WAY that the two are both 0.25oz.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this on amazon. Carmex is a great product but is sometimes difficult to find so I was pleased to order this knowing I don&#x27;t have to look around for it now. It works excellent for chapped and windburn lips, I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping time is very good.  the amount of unit is excellent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best buy I did on amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who provided the shipping, but they did not arrive in the window they said.  They could not provide any tracking information.  They arrived a week after they were predicted. It was so late, it was after the deadline I needed them. Also the picture and way it&#x27;s listed indicates a box of 12. But they did not come in a box of 12, but each individually wrapped in a blister pack--more trash that can&#x27;t be recycled.</li>
            <li> Love it.. I am not a fan of the other flavored/scented carmex versions. The original all the way! I have been using the original since I was a kid... and will stick to this version. Never let&#x27;s me down. Lips always look and feel GREAT!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it from a bin at my pharmacist&#x27;s because it was so cheap. It was love at first application. I love the smell  (not perfumey), the healing sensation it leaves and it&#x27;s a great cuticle cream. Cuticle cream is hard to find and expensive. I love it because it makes my nails look great and  prevents hang nails. All and all it it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;m going to put one in all the Christmas stockings this year.</li>
            <li> MISLEADING LABEL.  As a professional makeup artist I can say this is one of the biggest hoaxes in cosmetic history. This product is ADDICTIVE.  Carmex was developed to shrink and heal COLD SORES using DRYING agents like Camphor, Menthol and Phenol.  Phenol is banned in the UK &amp; Germany.  Regular users develop a PHYSICAL DEPENDENCY when lips dry out from the drying ingredients yet are fooled by the feeling of moisture from ingredients like petrolatum.  Carmex users typically have several pots of balm at any given time, home, work, car, pocket, etc.  THE MANUFACTURERS ARE DELIBERATELY MARKETING THIS AS A SALVE FOR DRY LIPS because they know you will be buying it by the gross before long.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for years, it seems to be the only brand that helps my lips from getting chapped. Also the price was low.</li>
            <li> Carmex is the best for chapped lips in the winter . Happy with the price. Used by the whole family.</li>
            <li> Great product for chapped lips or nose.  Changed the design of the canister (inverted bottom) so they could sell you less for the same amount of money but still this is a great product.</li>
            <li> If one tin of Carmex is good a whole box of tins is better.</li>
            <li> Works well on sun cracked Lipps and stress cold sores</li>
            <li> I love Carmex. It is a must have for the winter weather. Better to buy in bulk than run out!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve tried. Since I started using it I have not stopped. Leave my the lips moisturized like no other, you immediately feel relief. I recommend it blindly.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find Carmex in the stores. This stuff is the best for chapped lips. :)</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that goes thru a jar every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the product just wish it was little thicker</li>
            <li> The product works well, but Carmex did something really dishonest when they redesigned the packaging.  You can&#x27;t tell from the picture, but the bottom of the tin is hollowed out, resulting in it containing 50% of the product that it had before.  Really annoying too, since this thing takes up space in your pocket all day long.</li>
            <li> This product is a great lip repair product. If you have chapped or cracked lips this is meant for you. It is very affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves the stuff, always keeps one in his pocket. Bought the box of 12 so he can keep a spare in vehicle &amp; on boat. Guys usually ask to use when on their fishing trips. VERY soothing on dry, chapped lips. Also works great to prevent said problems.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> Carmex works great on both my lips and my extremely distressed eczema hands (better than eczema prescription creams). This box of 12 is at a great price!</li>
            <li> Convient to buy a whole box. Fast delivery, too</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm and I think it&#x27;s the only thing that actually works! I have used it for years and it has proved to be better than the most expensive ones. It&#x27;s so underrated I am so sad!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. I&#x27;m glad amazon is selling these pots, because they are often sold out at my local drugstore. I&#x27;ve tried for years to find any better lip balm, but this continue to be the best one.</li>
            <li> So thankful that I now have a stash of my favorite lip balm. These are going all over my house and in every purse. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can swear by this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this before bed time and it makes my lips feel so tingly and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get cold sores from time to time and this has LITERALLY prevented them from occurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of chapstick type moisturizers these days contain ingredients that actually make your lips chapped faster, I haven&#x27;t experienced it with this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Carmex so long that I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the results for years but have notice that it leaves a wax feeling on your lips.  It still does an excellent job of protecting and keeping your lips nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It&#x27;s the best lip protector I&#x27;ve ever used and stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good lip balm can not only for lip but for other kind of pimple, but i don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
