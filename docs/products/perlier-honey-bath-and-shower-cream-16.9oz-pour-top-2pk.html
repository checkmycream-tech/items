            <li>Love the scent and the texture of the cream.</li>
            <li>I love this Perlier Honey Miel Shower Gel.</li>
            <li>just wish it came with a pump instead of a pour top, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;that won&#x27;t stop me from enjoying it.</li>
            <li>This product is one of my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is great for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Neutral scent is great and leaves skin soft and fully moisturized head to toe.  </li>
            <li>It really makes you feel good all over</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy with honey, and I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, and I rate it as \\&quot;okay,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The aromatherapy benefits are a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>Happy this product is back!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>According to the directions, one is supposed to \\&quot;massage onto damp skin and rinse with warm water.\\&quot; Damp skin, not wet?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I ever use.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years after first finding it at Marshall&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the value 2 pack!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel - clean but not tight and dry.</li>
            <li>used to only be able to find this at high end department stores like Bloomingdale&#x27;s</li>
            <li>These are fairly large containers with no pump</li>
            <li>/&gt;The honey as an ingredient is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for asking</li>
            <li>I find this really helps keep my skin stay moisturized even after I step out.</li>
            <li>This Italian Honey Bath and Shower Cream is an old favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d rather use a product, though, that I worked more like the other shower gels and soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But these are complaints mainly aimed at the marketing of this product, not at its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love using this and will definitely purchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and hard to find because if the low honey production world wide.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems as good as any other bath product for body cleansing.</li>
            <li>It is a thick cream that lathers nicely and helps moisturize you skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves a light honey fragrance on the skin so this is a winter only product for me; in spring and summer you&#x27;d actually attract bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only criticism I have of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t suds very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t identify this as a liquid bathing product; it lathers and works just like most shower gels/liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various varieties of this bath cream, and it certainly works.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and from drying out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for years from Perlier directly.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 20+ years on my sensitive, dry skin.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used various varieties of this bath cream, and it certainly works. I feel clean after using it, and it was a very pleasant scent. But what is a bath cream? Is it a shower gel? A body wash? A shampoo? The only criticism I have of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t suds very much. Other than that, it seems as good as any other bath product for body cleansing. I&#x27;m also not sure exactly how to use it. According to the directions, one is supposed to \\&quot;massage onto damp skin and rinse with warm water.\\&quot; Damp skin, not wet? Is one supposed to wash with some other product, partially towel off, rub this product into one&#x27;s skin, and then get back in the shower to rinse off? One is simply not sure how this product fits into one&#x27;s bathing routine. But these are complaints mainly aimed at the marketing of this product, not at its effectiveness. It works fine, and I rate it as \\&quot;okay,\\&quot; hence three stars. I think I&#x27;d rather use a product, though, that I worked more like the other shower gels and soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Perlier Honey bath softens your skin and smells divine.  How can you go wrong with honey! Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving this to my daughter for Christmas for 4 years and she can&#x27;t wait to get it.  All the Perlier products are wonderful but this one has become our favorite.  Smooth and silky in texture and a beautiful aroma makes your bath or shower a luxurious experience.</li>

These are fairly large containers with no pump so I just use smaller refillable ones for the shower and vanity and store the bigger bottles in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to only be able to find this at high end department stores like Bloomingdale&#x27;s but I&#x27;m glad that now it can be found here on Amazon and at a good price.</li>
            <li> My favorite shower gel.  Have used for many years.  Has a wonderful scent. It is a thick cream that lathers nicely and helps moisturize you skin.</li>
            <li> Happy this product is back! (I was a bit worried when this was out of stock post Christmas.) I have used this product for 20+ years on my sensitive, dry skin.  I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel - clean but not tight and dry. I have tried other honey products from time to time, but always go back to this one.  It can be used in shower or bath and for shaving legs. Nice to know now I can find it on Amazon!  Just note that these bottles don&#x27;t include a pump - I just transferred the contents to my almost gone bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy !! I Will purchase from again when I run out  One of the best products for your skin</li>
            <li> bought 6 bottles for Christmas gifts people decided not to exchange gifts so I KEPT 6 FOR ME.I couldn&#x60;t be happier .I love this stuff love love love and the price was wonderful ,Thanks Again</li>
            <li> big fan of this shower cream. great for shaving.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for the perfect honey shower soap and I found it here at Amazon! Perlier Honey is the best shower cream/soap/gel I have ever used.  It&#x27;s very luxurious.  The soap has a very rich lather and smells very lovely.  It makes for an excellent shampoo as well.  I love using this and will definitely purchase again in the future.  The fragrance is so, so lovely and stays with you all evening.  It&#x27;s such a treat to use this shower soap after a long day at the office.  It&#x27;s calming and smells fantastic.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Perlier Honey Bath and Shower Cream makes the best bubble bath ever! It bubbles up and softens skin, providing the most relaxing bathing experience I&#x27;ve ever enjoyed. It&#x27;s the only product of its kind I ever use.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the internet to find this.  Been using it for years after first finding it at Marshall&#x27;s.  Never see it in stores anymore.  It&#x27;s seems expensive, but it lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and hard to find because if the low honey production world wide.  Perlier has not changed the formula, it is soothing and has the most wonderful smell.  I will continue to buy it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be what I wanted although I have not used it yet.  I will shortly.  Thanks for asking</li>
            <li> Discovered this years ago and have used it ever since.  Love it!  It is rich and creamy with honey, and I love how it smells.  Will keep buying it until they stop making it.</li>
            <li> I guess they may have changed the formula again and it is now back to the Perlier Honey I remember.  The bubbles are long lasting and the scent, the scent!  Best bubble bath ever.</li>
            <li> Love it. Hard to find it. Thankful that you all had it. I have been using this product for many years. Difficult finding it now.</li>
            <li> My favorite bath and shower cleanser.  Great unisex bath product.  Neutral scent is great and leaves skin soft and fully moisturized head to toe.  Add the moisturizing cream and I&#x27;m in seventh heaven.  When using the bathtub, I add a couple capfuls under the running water for nice, moisturizing soak.</li>
            <li> Looooove the smell !!! My skin is softer too !! Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 20 years and love the softness and fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perlier honey soap is the only soap I have used for 10 plus years now-received promptly after ordering this product</li>

            <li> This is great for my very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came with a pump instead of a pour top, but&lt;br /&gt;that won&#x27;t stop me from enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Perlier Honey Bath &amp; Shower Cream&lt;br /&gt; This product is one of my all time favorite.  It really makes you feel good all over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years from Perlier directly. Lately they have been out of stock, so I purchased this here. The bottle I ordered fill my gallon dispenser nicely and allow me to store it in my shower. I ordered 3 of the 2 packs.</li>
