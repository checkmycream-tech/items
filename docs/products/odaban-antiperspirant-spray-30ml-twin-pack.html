            <li>Best review over at [...]</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This is especially important in an Arizona office environment!  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality product, without doubt the best for the purpose.</li>
            <li>Knew effectiveness, found this at the best price.</li>
            <li>Works for me very effectively!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li>But damn what a good product!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the prompt delivery, for what I put 5 stars!</li>
            <li>GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff... is amazing!</li>
            <li>I end up scratching my pits and though the scratching feels good (lol)</li>
            <li>The good thing is I don&#x27;t have to apply it as often.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>but without the irritation, but price and availability wise, odaban can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  amazing.</li>
            <li>I would just guess that maybe it was some kind of reaction to the deodorant I was wearing or something.</li>
            <li>that my underarms kind of burn and they feel itchy.</li>
            <li>I tried Odaban and noticed a remarkable difference the first morning!</li>
            <li>This has been one of the better antiperspirants I have tried.</li>
            <li>Only use one spray is best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there will be many more orders.</li>
            <li>So if you ever running out of this product, make sure you order it well ahead of time if ordering from this seller.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with product and service.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>Hope to see more improvement in the weeks ahead.</li>
            <li>amazing product is a rare exception.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep purchasing for as long as it&#x27;s still made with good quality and offered at a good price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing to me.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working fine from what they tell me.  </li>
            <li>When I use up my first shipment i will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only experienced this once</li>
            <li>But definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Just make sure wherever you are applying it you wash your skin first.</li>
            <li>Although it does tend to burn a bit, I feel free for the first time about what clothes I can wear!</li>
            <li>I had high expectation for Odaban Antiperspirant Spray, but the product doesn&#x27;t really fits my need at all, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE RIGHT AFTER A SHOWER OR SHAVE</li>
            <li>The shipment was sent out right away, but took about 3-4 weeks to get here because it came from England (I think).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and how it has impacted my life and made me feel like a normal person.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>Hurts the first time you use it - a lot.  </li>
            <li>I had to use it 2x a week for the first couple of weeks, but now, once a week is all it takes.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of getting botox for your sweaty problem areas try this first.</li>
            <li>Do it exactly as it suggests by the way.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks I used it about 4 times a week.</li>
            <li>started having abnormal sweating during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This i can say, its one of the best inversions I have ever done, the only thing its that you have to applied al least 1 time per week</li>
            <li>It works really good for facial hiperhidrosis, I only need a couple of applications per week</li>
            <li>Like better than drysol because I don&#x27;t find myself scratching my pits all night long.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Carful not to put too much as your skin will burn.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>i really had my hopes  up.</li>
            <li>it worked really well for her after a couple uses</li>
            <li>and it really does stop underarm odors.  </li>
            <li>However, both Amazon and the Seller were very helpful and speedily got me a refund</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t review a product the first week I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Item works which is what counts, but I find it irritates my skin as much as drysol does, but it does work for hyperhydrosis.</li>
            <li>I would recommend driclor if you can find it in stock and at a decent price as it works just as well</li>
            <li>But the times that I spray a little bit more than recommended is the time</li>
            <li>This product is to strong for me and gave me a slight rash under one arm.  </li>
            <li>It actually did not do what they said it with and after all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My shipment arrived from Europe quite fast, considering it was an international mailing.  </li>
            <li>Delivered early.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra cost of Odaban vs. regular deodorant is worth it 10 times over.</li>
            <li>Other than that I sweat less in that problematic area, I&#x27;m wearing my blouses with more confidence.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found to completely stop my sweating.  </li>
            <li>I use natural deodorants during the day to control odor, but no daily antiperspirant is needed.  </li>
            <li>Well 3 years later, I found&lt;br /&gt;myself self conscious and sweating while at rest.</li>
            <li>I can wear colored shirts now and no longer am restricted to just black shirts or needing to carry a spare for when the sweating really gets out of hand.</li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve had problems with excessive sweating, even in the winter, and it made me very self conscious.</li>
            <li>Remember to follow instructions carefully as this is not ordinary antiperspirant and you can get skin irritations if you not following instructions.</li>

            <li> Remember to follow instructions carefully as this is not ordinary antiperspirant and you can get skin irritations if you not following instructions.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After trying several OTC deodorants I went to the web and found blogs recommending Odaban and other products.</li>
            <li> We had tried several other remedies, but nothing seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> The Odaban, although we have only used it for a couple of weeks, seems to be slowing down the sweating.  </li>
            <li> I usually only wore black shirts because it&#x27;s the only color that hid the sweat stains a little bit.</li>
            <li> Like other users, I do feel the sensation of sweating but when I go to wipe the area, it is dry.</li>
            <li> It does sting and cause skin irritation if I use it daily, but I can use it just a few times a week</li>
            <li> On the other hand,  I will deal with the pump vs. sweating.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that controls excessive perspiration for him.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Requires regular applications every few days&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer is a little too targeted&lt;br /&gt;Stings</li>
            <li> There are very few products I will back 100%.</li>
            <li> Oddly though, I haven&#x27;t had that issue any other time I&#x27;ve used it, so</li>
            <li> I still sweat a little but unlike other products I have tried, which is saying a lot because I use to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the aluminum chloride in Odaban, but I&#x27;m even less a fan of sweaty armpits in my work</li>
            <li> and when you applied you will feel that its burns a little bit.</li>
            <li> You may need to build up by using this every night for a few days, after that once a week has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> No more anti-perspirants or deodorant without worrying about sweating or stinking?</li>
            <li> However, I am not thrilled about it being a pump.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassment!</li>
            <li> I use it on my underarms, face, palms, and cleavage (no more boob sweat!</li>
            <li> Our teenage grandson had an extremely bad case of hyperhydrosis where his hands and feet were sweating excessively.  </li>
            <li> and it was indeed very unpleasant and irritating that night and the next day, even after washing it off.</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon against hyperhidrosis!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is to strong for me and gave me a slight rash under one arm.  Despite that,  it did help with my under arm wetness.  I also did not like the smell of the brand.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the better antiperspirants I have tried. I still sweat a little but unlike other products I have tried, which is saying a lot because I use to sweat a lot. The good thing is I don&#x27;t have to apply it as often. However, I am not thrilled about it being a pump. I would have preferred a roll on. On the other hand,  I will deal with the pump vs. sweating.  It&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff works! This is my secret weapon against hyperhidrosis! Goodbye embarrassing sweat.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Hurts the first time you use it - a lot.  kept me up at night.  Only use one spray is best.  But definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for Odaban Antiperspirant Spray, but the product doesn&#x27;t really fits my need at all, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff works! I had to use it 2x a week for the first couple of weeks, but now, once a week is all it takes. That&#x27;s pretty amazing to me. No more anti-perspirants or deodorant without worrying about sweating or stinking? Color me impressed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those like me suffer from hyperhidrosis.&lt;br /&gt;No collateral effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered in bulk, the best.</li>
            <li> Works legit bought 2, I have hyperhydrosis this is the best as it gets. DO NOT USE RIGHT AFTER A SHOWER OR SHAVE WILL BURN LIKE A MOTHER SISTER</li>
            <li> A Miracle in a bottle, a life changer. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and how it has impacted my life and made me feel like a normal person. Best review over at [...]</li>
            <li> My shipment arrived from Europe quite fast, considering it was an international mailing.  And besides that, Odaban *works.*  I have been a faithful user for about three years now and would likely never switch.</li>
            <li> GREAT product.  Does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> Works for me very effectively! Highly Recommended! Remember to follow instructions carefully as this is not ordinary antiperspirant and you can get skin irritations if you not following instructions.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found to completely stop my sweating.  I apply it nightly for a week to gain strength, then can maintain with one or two applications a week after that.  I use natural deodorants during the day to control odor, but no daily antiperspirant is needed.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the aluminum chloride in Odaban, but I&#x27;m even less a fan of sweaty armpits in my work clothes - uber unprofessional.  I also detox from it over summer and winter vacations to try to reduce the amount of aluminum chloride in my system.</li>
            <li> Never sweat again. Carful not to put too much as your skin will burn.</li>
            <li> NO NO PIT STAINS NO MO</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of getting botox for your sweaty problem areas try this first. The bottle lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve been using this for two years, and i&#x27;ve virtually forgotten what it&#x27;s like to have big, embarrassing sweat spots. You may need to build up by using this every night for a few days, after that once a week has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use it constantly and all the advice. Very pleased with the prompt delivery, for what I put 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product. It actually did not do what they said it with and after all the positive reviews i really had my hopes  up.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as advertised. Forget the doctor. Forget the shaman or whatever voodoo BS you&#x27;ve tried to stop sweating and embarrassing yourself. And forget the sweating because it ends when you start squirting this stuff on your pits. Do it exactly as it suggests by the way.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my sister-- it worked really well for her after a couple uses so I tried it, it works!</li>
            <li> Works for me!!! Like better than drysol because I don&#x27;t find myself scratching my pits all night long. Started out every night until controlled. Now I used every 2-4 nights a week.</li>
            <li> Miracle product! Awesome! Delivered early.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with excess sweating and this product is a life saver. No more embarrassment!</li>
            <li> This product saves me from sweaty armpits. It&#x27;s literally the only thing that works for me. I&#x27;ll keep purchasing for as long as it&#x27;s still made with good quality and offered at a good price.</li>
            <li> This stuff... is amazing! All my life I&#x27;ve had problems with excessive sweating, even in the winter, and it made me very self conscious. I usually only wore black shirts because it&#x27;s the only color that hid the sweat stains a little bit. I heard about this stuff from a friend and decided to give it a shot. I noticed the difference after only one use and I was instantly sold. For the first couple of weeks I used it about 4 times a week. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and apply it probably once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people say that it stings quite a bit. I&#x27;ve only experienced this once and it was indeed very unpleasant and irritating that night and the next day, even after washing it off. Oddly though, I haven&#x27;t had that issue any other time I&#x27;ve used it, so I would just guess that maybe it was some kind of reaction to the deodorant I was wearing or something. Just make sure wherever you are applying it you wash your skin first. I use it on my underarms, face, palms, and cleavage (no more boob sweat! Trust me ladies, you&#x27;ll thank me.) and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra cost of Odaban vs. regular deodorant is worth it 10 times over. I can wear whatever I want and not worry about embarrassing sweaty underarms. There are very few products I will back 100%. This is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> Works!  This was my second order of a 2-pack! I&#x27;m sure there will be many more orders.</li>
            <li> My son has used this product for several years.  This is the only product that controls excessive perspiration for him.</li>
            <li> For a chronic sweater. It seems to be working fine from what they tell me.  No complaints or comments made</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks of using Odaban, I am no longer embarrassed about &amp;#34;pit stains&amp;#34; under my arms! Although it does tend to burn a bit, I feel free for the first time about what clothes I can wear! I will def order again!</li>
            <li> Do follow the instructions about only applying at night!  It does sting and cause skin irritation if I use it daily, but I can use it just a few times a week and it really does stop underarm odors.  This is especially important in an Arizona office environment!  When I use up my first shipment i will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li> This i can say, its one of the best inversions I have ever done, the only thing its that you have to applied al least 1 time per week and when you applied you will feel that its burns a little bit. But damn what a good product!</li>
            <li> Years triying to find a product that helped me..., I finally found it! It works really good for facial hiperhidrosis, I only need a couple of applications per week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying it for a week now and I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvement. I&#x27;ve followed the direction as punctual as possible. But the times that I spray a little bit more than recommended is the time that my underarms kind of burn and they feel itchy. The spray button is sensitive so be careful. Other than that I sweat less in that problematic area, I&#x27;m wearing my blouses with more confidence. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it!!</li>
            <li> I have just started using the product, and  I think it will perform as advertised.  The shipment was sent out right away, but took about 3-4 weeks to get here because it came from England (I think). Had one problem with my shipment in that I ordered two bottles and only received one. However, both Amazon and the Seller were very helpful and speedily got me a refund (they were out of stock of another bottle). So if you ever running out of this product, make sure you order it well ahead of time if ordering from this seller. Overall, very happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It definitely reduces the amount of sweat in treated areas.  Requires approx 2 treatments per week.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Reduces sweat output in treated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Requires regular applications every few days&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer is a little too targeted&lt;br /&gt;Stings a bit when you apply it (but you get use to it)</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t review a product the first week I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;This amazing product is a rare exception. I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I started having abnormal sweating during my first pregnancy. I thought it would just go away after giving birth. Well 3 years later, I found&lt;br /&gt;myself self conscious and sweating while at rest. After trying several OTC deodorants I went to the web and found blogs recommending Odaban and other products. I tried Odaban and noticed a remarkable difference the first morning! I use as directed, at night and I apply to my affected areas with a cotton ball. I use powder to soothe the areas immediately after application. My sweating has all but diminished. I&#x27;ve been using for one week and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Like other users, I do feel the sensation of sweating but when I go to wipe the area, it is dry. It&#x27;s  amazing. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Excellent quality product, without doubt the best for the purpose. Knew effectiveness, found this at the best price.</li>
            <li> Item works which is what counts, but I find it irritates my skin as much as drysol does, but it does work for hyperhydrosis. I end up scratching my pits and though the scratching feels good (lol) the bruising from the vigorous scratching does not. I would recommend driclor if you can find it in stock and at a decent price as it works just as well but without the irritation, but price and availability wise, odaban can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hyperhydrosis has you feeling the blues, this may just be the product to help you. I can wear colored shirts now and no longer am restricted to just black shirts or needing to carry a spare for when the sweating really gets out of hand. As I said though, driclor if you can get it, if not odaban ftw!</li>
            <li> Our teenage grandson had an extremely bad case of hyperhydrosis where his hands and feet were sweating excessively.  We had tried several other remedies, but nothing seemed to work.  The Odaban, although we have only used it for a couple of weeks, seems to be slowing down the sweating.  Hope to see more improvement in the weeks ahead.</li>
