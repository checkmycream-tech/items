            <li>Works Great,wake up feeling good , sleep better.</li>
            <li>I liked one of the two fragrances, and it does the job</li>
            <li>I liked this a lot, but I think it&#x27;s overpriced and won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>This makes it better.  </li>
            <li>Love the oils.  </li>
            <li>Makes wearing the cpap a bit better.</li>
            <li>I wish the holder wasn&#x27;t made of paper but love how this works.  </li>
            <li>I breathe and sleep even better than before.  </li>
            <li>I love these for whenever I have a stuffy nose.</li>

            <li>I love sleeping with the scent of the clear oil; it helps me breathe better.</li>
            <li>and then putting on my full face CPAP mask after start up the scent</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for those slightly stuffy nights that would normally force me to use a full face mask instead of my beloved pillows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fond of the calm scent</li>
            <li>I liked about it at all, following the instructions as to put the pad&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>, they seller asked to email if I could not give a five star rating and they would do what it took to make it right, which I did, there offer to make it righ</li>
            <li>THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT RIGHT...</li>
            <li>I tried Calm for the first choice, and there was nothing at&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>I used too much the first night</li>
            <li>This really helps me relax while adjusting to sleeping with a CPAP.</li>
            <li>and it really does help.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to use only a full face mask.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The two smell pretty much the same</li>
            <li>6 1/2 years ago I could only keep my mask on for less than 30&lt;br /&gt;second&#x27;s,  would probly work nicely for very healthy people, as for me I would feel seriously guilty even giving this&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered a kit with two scents, a CLEAR and a CALMING.</li>
            <li>While it may have made me CLEAR, it would not have CALMED me.</li>
            <li>This helps keep my nose clear for the CPAP.  </li>
            <li>but I do like the clear scent.</li>
            <li>If you do put too much on, just move it back away from the filter an inch or two.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but not particularly exciting, either.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I really cared too much for the two samples that came with, but I bought other essential oil packs and use the chips and stand from this</li>
            <li>essential oil to be used on a decently thick paper pad, and placed on a very cheap little holder.</li>

            <li> essential oil to be used on a decently thick paper pad, and placed on a very cheap little holder.</li>
            <li> this does not clear your sinuses at all.</li>
            <li> The little filter pad you put the oils on is rather strange - I could use a make-up square and achieve the same result, or a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, product has been helpful.</li>
            <li> Be careful though the applicator/bottle does not drizzle out and when it gets on your hands it is on your hands.</li>
            <li> so be careful until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Understand, the smell dissipates over about half an hour to an hour (I use 4 to 5 drops).  </li>
            <li> A little trail and error is all it takes.  </li>

            <li> CPAP is annoying but necessary.  </li>
            <li> but now I find I have to have this behind my BiPAP filter to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> One scent wasn&#x27;t quite as bad as the other, but neither was usable for me.</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these were unusable.</li>
            <li> The metal one sadly my son snapped it apart.</li>
            <li> me a full very claustrophobic very bad unable to breath feeling, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> having a breathing problem due to a very bad heart, from a massive&lt;br /&gt;heart  attack</li>
            <li> I HATE my CPAP.</li>

            <li> I tried Calm for the first choice, and there was nothing at&lt;br /&gt;all I liked about it at all, following the instructions as to put the pad&lt;br /&gt;on the top and quickly flipping it, the scent was not all that pleasant,&lt;br /&gt;placing the pad within a couple of inches from the intake port on my CPAP&lt;br /&gt;machine and then putting on my full face CPAP mask after start up the scent&lt;br /&gt;gave me a full very claustrophobic very bad unable to breath feeling, and&lt;br /&gt;with having a breathing problem due to a very bad heart, from a massive&lt;br /&gt;heart  attack 6 1/2 years ago I could only keep my mask on for less than 30&lt;br /&gt;second&#x27;s,  would probly work nicely for very healthy people, as for me I would feel seriously guilty even giving this&lt;br /&gt;product a one Star rating, I was truly hoping for a pleasant experience and&lt;br /&gt;sweet dreams using your product, they seller asked to email if I could not give a five star rating and they would do what it took to make it right, which I did, there offer to make it righ was to try a different scent, SORRY THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT RIGHT...</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, product has been helpful.</li>
            <li> I HATE my CPAP. Hate it with a vengeance. These made it bearable.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to help out being stuffed up and having to use a cpap.</li>
            <li> Works Great,wake up feeling good , sleep better.</li>
            <li> I liked one of the two fragrances, and it does the job so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok.  CPAP is annoying but necessary.  This makes it better.  Not much more to say!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these were unusable. I ordered a kit with two scents, a CLEAR and a CALMING. Unfortunately, both scents were the same. They had the aroma of a bottle of vapor rub. While it may have made me CLEAR, it would not have CALMED me. Perhaps a mistake, but I had to return.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a smell to sleep to, I thought I was going to a gas chamber!  One scent wasn&#x27;t quite as bad as the other, but neither was usable for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not particularly exciting, either. Just some (predominantly eucalyptus) essential oil to be used on a decently thick paper pad, and placed on a very cheap little holder. Probably will not repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> I liked this a lot, but I think it&#x27;s overpriced and won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love sleeping with the scent of the clear oil; it helps me breathe better. As recommended by the respiratory therapist who issues my CPAP equipment, I place a drop on the main black filter of my machine.</li>
            <li> Love the oils.  Makes wearing the cpap a bit better. It comes with 2 stands a cardboard one and a metal one.  The cardboard one his holding up great.  The metal one sadly my son snapped it apart.</li>
            <li> I use the oils with my CPAP machine.  Seems to help with sleeping.  Just gave a set to my doctor, who also uses a CPAP.  Let&#x27;s see how he likes these!</li>
            <li> My sinuses swell when I try to use a nose mask/nasal pillow. With these, that problem is a thing of the past. I no longer have to use only a full face mask. glorious!</li>
            <li> This really helps me relax while adjusting to sleeping with a CPAP.</li>
            <li> this does not clear your sinuses at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome, you do not need a lot of this. Two to three drops keeps smelling good for a week. Be careful though the applicator/bottle does not drizzle out and when it gets on your hands it is on your hands. Could use a stand that isn&#x27;t cardboard.</li>
            <li> Like everyone who uses CPAP machines....  We know we need it, but it is a pain!  I really enjoy nice smells and was excited about this.  Can&#x27;t say I really cared too much for the two samples that came with, but I bought other essential oil packs and use the chips and stand from this and it really does help.  Understand, the smell dissipates over about half an hour to an hour (I use 4 to 5 drops).  So just enough time to get you to sleep.  Gives you something to look forward to when putting the mask on.  TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a gimmick but now I find I have to have this behind my BiPAP filter to fall asleep.  I used too much the first night so be careful until you get used to it.  If you do put too much on, just move it back away from the filter an inch or two.  A little trail and error is all it takes.  I am ready to try some new fragrances.</li>
            <li> The two smell pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for those slightly stuffy nights that would normally force me to use a full face mask instead of my beloved pillows. Highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Used this twice.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell of either essential oil that was included.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> This helps keep my nose clear for the CPAP.  This is a way I can now use aromatherapy at bedtime with my CPAP.</li>
            <li> Helps  open sinuses when using my bi-pap</li>
            <li> The Sinus Blaster is working great for me.  I highly recommend it.  I do not wake up with congested sinuses, and I&#x27;m sleeping much better!</li>
            <li> The oils are fine, but I could get those anywhere.  The little filter pad you put the oils on is rather strange - I could use a make-up square and achieve the same result, or a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I wish the holder wasn&#x27;t made of paper but love how this works.  I breathe and sleep even better than before.  I would reorder.</li>
            <li> Clears the sinus and provides a pleasant night sleep</li>
            <li> Works for a while.  I have to stop and wait and start it again.</li>
            <li> Feels like it clears out your sinuses quite well.  relaxing aroma.</li>
            <li> I love these for whenever I have a stuffy nose. They also work amazing with the SoClean 2 CPAP Cleaner to eliminate some of the smell from the activated oxygen.</li>
            <li> Love using the CPAP with this!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have a cpap machine and wanted something smell while using my machine because sometimes I could smell the hardness of the water. This helped! Need to order more!</li>
            <li> This has helped me to be more compliant with my cpap use. I&#x27;m not fond of the calm scent but I do like the clear scent.</li>
