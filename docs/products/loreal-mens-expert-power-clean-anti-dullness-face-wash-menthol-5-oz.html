    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin after a shower, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Worked great in Afghanistan</li>
            <li>i get out the shower so its a good product to use on ure face</li>
            <li>The menthol scent is especially nice first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel the menthol, but when used in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Moisturizer, I&#x27;ve found the perfect combination for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and gives you a fresh feeling, It however dries out your skin</li>
            <li>It would be a shame for such a wonderful product to go off the market because no-one tried it.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>It doesnt any more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent cleanser no doubt, and a pretty decent \\&quot;before shave\\&quot; face wash.    </li>
            <li>Fast, easy, effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male in my 40&#x27;s and have seen great improvement in the firmness of my face as well as a clearer complexion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products, from many different companies, and this one is the BEST.  </li>
            <li>but this really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Clean Anti-Dullness</li>
            <li>This product used to tingle my face and feel clean.</li>
            <li>No breakouts, no painful cysts.  </li>
            <li>This wash is also good prior to a shave (I shave electric).</li>
            <li>Yes if you want to leave ure face clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Just a little dab works great.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but that&#x27;s ok, since Amazon has it for a good price.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the money to spend</li>
            <li>This product is much more gentle and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>It does read \\&quot;Use daily to clear blemishes\\&quot; etc., but it is not the best facial cleanser for acne.    </li>
            <li>I have really seen any significant positive effects on my skin nor have I noticed any adverse effects</li>
            <li>Great product...increasing hard to find at the food and drug stores here.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feeling I have</li>
            <li>I use this daily and after the first two weeks I noticed for the first time in decades I had no blackheads or clogged pores!</li>
            <li>i mainly use this in the shower</li>
            <li>but it does leave my face fresh clean for a few hours</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, even the more expensive ones, but this is the only one that worked for me.</li>
            <li>and my skin is crystal clear.  </li>
            <li>If you do have acne, I would recommend NEUTROGENA RAPID CLEAR FACE WASH.     </li>
            <li>Very little fragrance, no skin tightening, not too strong - it just WORKS.  </li>
            <li>He has been used this face washer for over 5 years, and never wants to switch to any other products:)  </li>
            <li>it cleans deeply and thoroughly, but leave the skin soft and not tight.</li>
            <li>No dry patches or oil slicks!</li>

            <li> No dry patches or oil slicks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a bazillion products over the years for a daily face cleanser that won&#x27;t give me zits, blackheads, dry flakes, or oily skin.</li>
            <li> but my advice is if your face is still dry put some lotion on wen ure face</li>
            <li> starts to get dry</li>
            <li> my face isnt as dry as it is</li>
            <li> but now it doesnt dry anymore</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and have fewer breakouts and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried everything over the counter, and have also gone the prescription route with limited results.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products in the past with salicyclic acid and scrub particles inside.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it works because my skin still is dry i tryied almost every skin face cream</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past three weeks.  </li>
            <li> The idea of cleansing and then shaving with a shaving foam is not ideal for acne.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> This is the only face wash I have found that works.  I have suffered from acne for 14 years and I have tried everything over the counter, and have also gone the prescription route with limited results.  I have been using this product for the last year now and my skin is crystal clear.  I don&#x27;t know how they did it but this really works!!!  No breakouts, no painful cysts.  Spread the word about this product!  It would be a shame for such a wonderful product to go off the market because no-one tried it.  It WORKS!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past three weeks.  I have really seen any significant positive effects on my skin nor have I noticed any adverse effects so I guess I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleanser no doubt, and a pretty decent \\&quot;before shave\\&quot; face wash.    The thing is it is NOT for clearing acne or helping prevent breakouts. It does read \\&quot;Use daily to clear blemishes\\&quot; etc., but it is not the best facial cleanser for acne.    If you do have acne, I would recommend NEUTROGENA RAPID CLEAR FACE WASH.     Just use a shaving foam, shave, and THEN cleanse (with a follow up moisturizer).   The idea of cleansing and then shaving with a shaving foam is not ideal for acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He has been used this face washer for over 5 years, and never wants to switch to any other products:)  it cleans deeply and thoroughly, but leave the skin soft and not tight.</li>
            <li> This seems to help prepare my face for a cleaner shave. It has menthol, but not a lot. It leaves a bit of a tingle, but it isn&#x27;t overbearing like American Crew can be.</li>
            <li> i like the way how it feels after its all washed off not sure if it works because my skin still is dry i tryied almost every skin face cream and nothing is doing it for me but it does leave my face fresh clean for a few hours so it was worth the money to spend will i ever buy this product again? maybe in the future.  do i suggest it fir everyone Yes if you want to leave ure face clean and fresh this is for you but my advice is if your face is still dry put some lotion on wen ure face starts to get dry i mainly use this in the shower so wen i get out my face isnt as dry as it is but now it doesnt dry anymore wen i get out the shower so its a good product to use on ure face</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products, but nothing comes close to this. It feels great on your skin after a shower, and smells great. The menthol scent is especially nice first thing in the morning. It seems like stores in my area have stopped carrying it, but thankfully Amazon comes through for me yet again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products in the past with salicyclic acid and scrub particles inside.  This product is much more gentle and cleans very well.  I don&#x27;t really feel the menthol, but when used in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Moisturizer, I&#x27;ve found the perfect combination for my skin.  I&#x27;m a male in my 40&#x27;s and have seen great improvement in the firmness of my face as well as a clearer complexion.  This wash is also good prior to a shave (I shave electric).</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this product. It was not what I expected. Was looking for a L&#x27;Oreal product that had dermabrasion and this is not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products, from many different companies, and this one is the BEST.  Very little fragrance, no skin tightening, not too strong - it just WORKS.  Hard to find, but that&#x27;s ok, since Amazon has it for a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product...increasing hard to find at the food and drug stores here.  Please keep in stock!</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling I have after I get out of the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and have fewer breakouts and blemishes.  Just a little dab works great.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VWKIH2 L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Power Clean Anti-Dullness Face Wash 150ml/5oz]]   I&#x27;ve tried about a bazillion products over the years for a daily face cleanser that won&#x27;t give me zits, blackheads, dry flakes, or oily skin. I use this daily and after the first two weeks I noticed for the first time in decades I had no blackheads or clogged pores! No dry patches or oil slicks! Wow! No scrubbing pads either - I just use my hands to use this to wash my face in my morning shower. Fast, easy, effective. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of these cleansers targeted at men, but this one is \\&quot;comfort food\\&quot; for the face.  Given the price being asked at local retailers like DR in NYC, this is truly a bargain.</li>
            <li> Worked great in Afghanistan</li>
            <li> This product used to tingle my face and feel clean. It doesnt any more. Not like it used to be id stay away.</li>
            <li> For some reason I didn&#x27;t think to check Amazon for this item. The boyfriend likes it and I do too. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, even the more expensive ones, but this is the only one that worked for me.</li>
            <li> It smells great and gives you a fresh feeling, It however dries out your skin and I got an allergy and stopped using it after just 4 days! It leaves the skin with no moisture at all. It might work for others but definitely not for me!</li>
